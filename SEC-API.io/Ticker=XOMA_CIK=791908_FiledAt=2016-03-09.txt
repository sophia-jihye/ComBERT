Business

Overview

XOMA Corporation (&#8220;XOMA&#8221;), a Delaware corporation, is a development stage biotechnology company with a portfolio of therapeutic antibodies. Our product candidates are the result of our expertise in developing new monoclonal antibodies, which have created new opportunities to potentially treat a wide range of endocrine diseases. We discover and develop innovative antibody-based therapeutics. Several of our antibodies have unique properties due to their interaction at allosteric sites on a specific protein rather than at the orthosteric, or active, sites. The antibodies are designed to either enhance or diminish the protein&#8217;s activity as desired. We believe allosteric modulating antibodies may be more selective and offer a safety advantage in certain disease indications when compared to more traditional modes of action.

Our business efforts are focused on advancing the assets in our portfolio of compounds that could treat a variety of endocrine diseases. Our product candidates are in various stages of development and are subject to regulatory approval before they can be commercially launched. 

We currently have five assets in our endocrine portfolio, two of which were developed as part of our proprietary XOMA Metabolism (&#8220;XMet&#8221;) platform. We believe the XMet platform is highly novel as it targets the insulin receptor and has generated new classes of fully human allosteric modulating monoclonal antibodies known as Selective Insulin Receptor Modulators (&#8220;SIRMs&#8221;) . One program of SIRMs produced by the XMet Platform is a negative allosteric modulator of the insulin receptor (&#8220;XMetD&#8221;). We intend to advance the following two antibodies derived from the XMetD program, which presents potential new therapeutic approaches to the treatment of diseases that involve insulin and result in severe hypoglycemia. 

&#160;

&#183; 

XOMA 358, a potential long-acting treatment for hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

XOMA 129, a potential rapid onset, short-acting treatment for severe acute hypoglycemia. 

&#160;

Our endocrine portfolio also includes what we believe is a Phase 2-ready product candidate, XOMA 213, targeting the prolactin receptor as well as research-stage programs targeting the parathyroid receptor (&#8220;PTH1R&#8221;) and the adrenal corticotropic hormone (&#8220;A CTH&#8221;). 

Given our focus on endocrine diseases, we have determined that gevokizumab no longer fits our strategic focus and we have decided to stop all development activities on the asset. As a result, we are closing the Phase 3 program in patients suffering from pyoderma gangrenosum (&#8220;PG&#8221;) and will immediately pursue licensing discussions with potential interested parties.

Organization

We were incorporated in Delaware in 1981 and became a Bermuda-exempted company in December 1998. Effective December 31, 2011, we changed our jurisdiction of incorporation from Bermuda to Delaware and changed our name from XOMA Ltd. to XOMA Corporation. When referring to a time or period before December 31, 1998, or when the context so requires, the terms &#8220;Company&#8221; and &#8220;XOMA&#8221; refer to XOMA Corporation, a Delaware corporation, and when referring to a time or period after December 31, 1998, and before December 31, 2011, such terms refer to XOMA Ltd., a Bermuda company.

Corporate Strategy 

We are committed to establishing XOMA as a commercial organization in the United States with a portfolio of endocrine therapies that were discovered by our scientists and developed internally . Our commercialization strategy will be to market products in the United States through our own focused sales teams calling on specialist prescribers. We will likely seek development and commercialization partners outside of the United States, as our product candidates could benefit patients around the world. For indications requiring clinical studies that are prohibitively large or for the targeted patient populations are not treated by the specialist provider, we will likely seek a development and commercialization partner, globally or regionally. Additionally, we may seek to expand our pipeline by developing additional proprietary products and technologies and by entering into additional licensing and collaborative arrangements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. 

&#160;

Proprietary Products

As part of our strategy, we are focusing our technology and resources on advancing our emerging proprietary pipeline. Below is a summary of our proprietary products:

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

XOMA 358 is a fully human negative allosteric modulating insulin receptor antibody that was derived from our proprietary XMet platform. We are investigating this antibody as a novel treatment for non-drug-induced, endogenous hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia (low blood glucose caused by excessive insulin produced by the body). There are several rare disease indications that may benefit from XOMA 358 that are of greatest interest to us: congenital hyperinsulinism (&#8220;CHI&#8221;), a hereditary disease resulting in lack of insulin regulation and profound hypoglycemia, and post-meal hypoglycemia in post-bariatric surgery (&#8220;PBS&#8221;) patients. XOMA 358 has successfully completed Phase 1 testing, which showed the antibody reduced insulin sensitivity and decreased glucose after exogenous insulin injection and it appeared to be well tolerated, with no serious adverse events observed. The results were presented at the Endocrine Society's Annual Meeting in March 2015. In June 2015, we were granted Orphan Drug Designation for XOMA 358 by the FDA for the treatment of CHI. In October 2015, we initiated a single-dose Phase 2 proof-of-concept (&#8220;POC&#8221;) study of XOMA 358 in patients with CHI. In addition, we intend to initiate a single-administration Phase 2 POC study in PBS patients who experience hyperinsulinism. We believe a therapy that safely and effectively mitigates insulin-induced hypoglycemia has the potential to address a significant unmet therapeutic need for these rare medical conditions associated with hyperinsulinism. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

XOMA 129 is a highly potent fragment of a monoclonal antibody (&#8220;Fab&#8221;) with negative allosteric modulation activity against the insulin receptor. In ani mal model testing, it appears to have a fast-onset of action and short half-life. Hypoglycemia is a serious medical condition in patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (&#8220;T2 DM&#8221;) and Type 1 diabetes mellitus (&#8220;T1 DM&#8221;) and can occur as a result of insulin th erapy, accidental insulin overdose or treatment with sulfonylureas. Recurrent hypoglycemia leads to diminished recognition of the symptoms, which include palpitations, tremors, anxiety, sweating, and hunger. This reduced sensitivity to hypoglycemic symptom s can lead to more prolonged episodes and the advancement into acute severe hypoglycemia, which can result in confusion, loss of consciousness, and seizure. Acute severe hypoglycemia often presents during the nocturnal hours in patients who are treated ag gressively for their T1 DM, which puts them at elevated risk for loss of consciousness and seizure. The medical community has long been challenged with how to prevent patients from experiencing nocturnal acute severe hypoglycemia, yet there have not been a ny significant breakthroughs in pharmaceutical development efforts or experiments in dietary practices. We are conducting preclinical testing for XOMA 129 and intend to advance it into Phase 1 testing as soon as practicable. We believe XOMA 129 could poten tially offer clinicians a therapy that has rapid onset, improved efficacy and optimal duration of therapy to treat patients with acute severe hypoglycemia wherein currently available therapies are inadequate. &#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

XOMA 213 (formerly LFA 102) is a first-in-class allosteric inhibitor of prolactin action. It is a humanized IgG1-Kappa monoclonal antibody that binds to the extracellular domain of the human prolactin receptor with high affinity at an allosteric site. The antibody has been shown to inhibit prolactin-mediated signaling, and it is potent and similarly active against several animal and human prolactin receptors. We discovered XOMA 213 under our collaboration with Novartis AG (&#8220;Novartis,&#8221; formerly Chiron Corporation), and we exercised our right to bring the product back into our portfolio to develop it for diseases of hyperprolactinemia. In particular, we are developing our product for prolactinoma, a condition of benign tumors on the pituitary gland that leads to hyperprolactinemia-induced sexual dysfunction, infertility, and osteoporosis, as well as anti-psychotic-induced hyperprolactinemia, a side effect seen in patients treated with commonly used antipsychotics, antidepressants, and pain medications. For 20 percent of the 140,000 prolactinoma patients in the United States, existing therapies are poorly tolerated or not amenable to treatment with existing therapy. Anti-psychotic-induced hyperprolactinemia is a side effect seen in patients treated with commonly used antipsychotics, antidepressants, and pain medications. As patients exhibit the same signs and symptoms as prolactinoma, compliance with anti-psychotic therapies is poor. Currently available therapies to address these side effects can worsen psychosis. We intend to launch a POC study for XOMA 213, which, if successful, will allow us to advance the compound into a Phase 2 study for prolactinoma and potentially into anti-psychotic medication-induced hyperprolactinemia. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Gevokizumab is a potent humanized monoclonal antibody with unique allosteric properties that has the potential to treat patients with a wide variety of inflammatory diseases. Gevokizumab binds strongly to IL-1 beta, a pro-inflammatory cytokine. By binding to IL-1 beta, gevokizumab modulates the activation of the IL-1 receptor, thereby preventing the cellular signaling events that produce inflammation. 

In December 2010, we entered into an agreement with Les Laboratories Servier to jointly develop and commercialize gevokizumab in multiple indications. Under the terms of that agreement, Servier has worldwide rights to gevokizumab for cardiovascular disease and diabetes indications (cardiometabolic field) and rights outside the United States and Japan to all other indications. 

On July 22, 2015, we announced the Phase 3 EYEGUARD-B study of gevokizumab in patients with Beh&#231;et&#8217;s disease uveitis did not meet the primary endpoint of time to first acute ocular exacerbation. Due to these results and belief they would be predictive of results in our other EYEGUARD studies of gevokizumab in patients with non-infectious uveitis (&#8220;NIU&#8221;), in August we announced our intention to end the EYEGUARD global Phase 3 program prior to its planned completion. Servier and we closed down the EYEGUARD clinical sites and, as anticipated, neither EYEGUARD-A nor EYEGUARD-C produced positive results.

In September 2015, Servier notified XOMA of its intention to terminate the Amended and Restated Collaboration and License Agreement, and return the worldwide gevokizumab rights to XOMA. Termination of the Agreement will be effective on March 25, 2016. 

&#160;

In March 2016, we announced we are closing our Phase 3 study of gevokizumab in PG. A preliminary review of the data from the study did not show a clear signal of activity in PG.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Preclinical Product Pipeline : We are purs uing additional opportunities to further broaden our preclinical product pipeline, including internal discovery programs focused on endocrine indications. One is an anti-PTH1R program. Hyperparathyroidism results in significant hypercalcemia causing fati gue, loss of appetite, confusion, nausea, and muscle weakness. While most can be treated surgically, 10 percent of the patient population does not respond to surgery. We have identified PTH1R inhibitors and are in the process of attempting to identify a lead compound to move into pre-clinical testing. Another research program is focused on ACTH. Inappropriate secretion of ACTH leads to excess cortisol, which can lead to Cushing's disease. We have identified potent ACTH inhibitors and are testing for in vivo activity in preclinical models. &#160;

Partnership and Licensed Products

Historically, we have provided research and development collaboration services for world-class organizations, including Novartis, Novo Nordisk and Takeda, in pursuit of new antibody products. In more recent years, we have evolved our business focus from a service provider model to a proprietary product development model. However, we expect that we will continue to capitalize on partnered product arrangements as opportunities arise. Below is a list of such partnerships:

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Therapeutic Antibodies with Novartis In September 2015, we entered into a license agreement with Novartis International Pharmaceutical Ltd. (&#8220;Novartis International&#8221;) for our transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) antibody program. Novartis International will have worldwide rights to the TGF-beta program and will be solely responsible for the development and commercialization of the antibodies. We may receive potential milestones and royalties on sales of antibody products in the future. 

In November 2008, we restructured our product development collaboration with Novartis, which was entered into in 2004 with Novartis (then Chiron Corporation). Under the restructured agreement, Novartis received control over the two ongoing programs relating to CD40 and prolactin receptor. Control of the prolactin receptor antibody program was returned to us in 2014. In September 2015, we and Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics, Inc. (&#8220;NVDI&#8221;), executed an amendment to their Amended and Restated Research, Development and Commercialization Agreement dated July 1, 2008, as amended, relating to anti-CD40 antibodies. The parties agreed to reduce the royalty rates that we are eligible to receive on sales of Novartis&#8217; clinical stage anti-CD40 antibodies. These royalties are tiered based on sales levels and now range from a mid-single digit percentage rate to up to a low double-digit percentage rate. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Therapeutic Antibodies with Novo Nordisk In December 2015, we entered into an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license with Novo Nordisk for the XMetA program of allosteric monoclonal antibodies that positively modulate the insulin receptor. Novo Nordisk will have worldwide rights to the XMetA program and will be solely responsible for the development and commercialization of antibodies and products, and we retained commercialization rights for all indications considered rare. We may receive potential milestones and royalties on sales of antibody products in the future. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Therapeutic Antibodies with Takeda: Since 2006, Takeda has been a collaboration partner for therapeutic monoclonal antibody discovery and development against multiple targets selected by them. In February 2009, we expanded our existing collaboration to provide Takeda with access to multiple antibody technologies, including a suite of research and development technologies and integrated information and data management systems. We may receive potential milestones and royalties on sales of antibody products in the future. 

Technologies

We have a unique set of antibody discovery, optimization and development technologies, including:

&#160;

&#183; 

ADAPT&#8482; (Antibody Discovery Advanced Platform Technologies): proprietary phage display libraries integrated with yeast and mammalian display to enable antibody discovery; 

&#160;

&#183; 

ModulX&#8482;: technology that enables identification of allosteric antibodies for positive or negative modulation of biological pathways; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

OptimX&#8482;: technologies used for optimizing biophysical properties of antibodies, including affinity, immunogenicity, stability and manufacturability. 

&#160;

Technology Licenses 

Below is a summary of certain proprietary technologies owned by us and available for licensing to other companies:

&#160;

&#183; 

Antibody Discovery Technologies: We use human antibody phage display libraries, integrated with yeast and mammalian display, which we call ADAPT&#8482; Integrated Display, in our antibody discovery programs. We offer access to this platform, including novel phage libraries developed internally, as part of our collaboration business. We believe access to ADAPT&#8482; Integrated Display offers a number of benefits to us and our collaboration partners because it enables us to combine the diversity of phage libraries with accelerated discovery due to rapid immunoglobulin (&#8220;IgG&#8221;) reformatting and Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting (&#8220;FACS&#8221;) based screening using yeast and mammalian display. This increases the probability of technical and business success in finding rare and unique functional antibodies directed to targets of interest. 

&#160;

&#183; 

ModulX&#8482; technology: ModulX&#8482; technology allows modulation of biological pathways using monoclonal antibodies and offers insights into regulation of signaling pathways, homeostatic control, and disease biology. Using ModulX&#8482;, XOMA is generating product candidates with novel mechanisms of action that specifically alter the kinetics of interaction between molecular constituents (e.g. receptor-ligand). ModulX&#8482; technology enables expanded target and therapeutic options and offers a unique approach in the treatment of disease. 

&#160;

&#183; 

OptimX&#8482; technologies: 

Human Engineering&#8482; (&#8220;HE&#8482;&#8221;): HE&#8482; is a proprietary humanization technology that allows modification of non-human monoclonal antibodies to reduce or eliminate detectable immunogenicity and make them suitable for medical purposes in humans. The technology uses a unique method developed by us, based on analysis of the conserved structure-function relationships among antibodies. The method defines which residues in a non-human variable region are candidates to be modified. The result is an HE&#8482; antibody with preserved antigen binding, structure and function that has eliminated or greatly reduced immunogenicity. HE&#8482; technology was used in development of gevokizumab and is used in the development of certain other antibody products. 

Targeted Affinity Enhancement&#8482; (&#8220;TAE&#8482;&#8221;): TAE&#8482; is a proprietary technology involving the assessment and guided substitution of amino acids in antibody variable regions, enabling efficient optimization of antibody binding affinity and selectivity. TAE&#8482; generates a comprehensive map of the effects of amino acid mutations in the CDR region likely to impact binding. The technology is utilized by XOMA scientists and has been licensed to a number of our collaborators. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Flexible Manufacturing: This patented technology relates to a flexible arrangement of mobile clean rooms (&#8220;MCRs&#8221;) within a manufacturing facility, with each MCR providing a portable, self-contained environment that allows for drug development. The facility design allows MCRs to connect easily and quickly to a central supply of utilities such as air, water, and electricity. This unique arrangement facilitates flexible manufacturing and eliminates change-over downtime. This translates into significantly reduced capital expenditures, production costs, and maintenance costs while offering meaningful time advantages over conventional manufacturing facilities. When MCRs are not in use, they can be easily moved to cleaning/refurbishing areas and prepared MCRs can be "plugged in" for manufacturing. The flexible manufacturing system can be applied to fields as diverse as pharmaceuticals, biologics, and electronics. 

Financial and Legal Arrangements of Product Collaborations, Licensing and Other Arrangements

Collaboration and Licensing Agreements

Servier &#8211; Gevokizumab

In December 2010, we entered into a license and collaboration agreement (the &#8220;Collaboration Agreement&#8221;) with Servier to jointly develop and commercialize gevokizumab in multiple indications. Under the terms of the Collaboration Agreement, Servier obtained worldwide rights to cardiovascular disease and diabetes indications (cardiometabolic field) and rights outside the United States and Japan to all other indications, including NIU, Beh&#231;et&#8217;s disease uveitis and other inflammatory and oncology indications. XOMA retained development and commercialization rights in the United States and Japan for all indications other than cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Each party had the right in certain circumstances to pursue development in indications not specified in the agreement, and in such event, the other party had certain options to participate in such development, including reimbursement of a portion of the developing party&#8217;s expenses.

&#160;

We also entered into a loan agreement with Servier (the &#8220;Servier Loan Agreement&#8221;) that provided for an advance of up to &#8364;15.0 million. The loan was fully funded in January 2011, with the proceeds converting to approximately $19.5 million at the date of funding. The loan is secured by an interest in XOMA&#8217;s intellectual property rights to all gevokizumab indications worldwide, excluding certain rights in the United States and Japan. Interest is calculated at a floating rate based on a Euro Inter-Bank Offered Rate (&#8220;EURIBOR&#8221;) and is subject to a cap. The interest rate is reset semi-annually in January and July of each year. The interest rate for the initial int erest period was 3.22% and was reset semi-annually ranging from 2. 05 % to 3.83%. Interest for the six-month period from mid-January 2015 through mid-July 2015 was reset to 2.16%. Interest is payable semi-annually; however, the Servier Loan Agreement provide d for a deferral of interest payments over a period specified in the agreement. During the deferral period, accrued interest was added to the outstanding principal amount for the purpose of interest calculation for the next six-month interest period. On th e repayment commencement date, all unpaid and accrued interest was paid to Servier, and thereafter, all accrued and unpaid interest shall be due and payable at the end of each six-month period. In January 2016, we paid $0.2 million in accrued interest to S ervier as well as the principal amount then due as described below. 

On January 9, 2015, Servier and we entered into Amendment No. 2 (&#8220;Loan Amendment&#8221;) to the Servier Loan Agreement. The Loan Agreement was initially entered into on December 30, 2010 and subsequently amended by a Consent, Transfer, Assumption and Amendment Agreement entered into as of August 12, 2013. The Loan Amendment extended the maturity date of the loan from January 13, 2016 to three tranches of principal to be repaid as follows:&#8364;3.0 million on January 15, 2016, &#8364;5.0 million on January 15, 2017, and &#8364;7.0 million on January 15, 2018. In addition, the loan becomes immediately due and payable upon certain customary events of default. At December 31, 2015, the outstanding principal balance under this loan was $16.4 million using the December 31, 2015 Exchange Rate of 1.091. 

On September 28, 2015, Servier notified us of its intention to terminate the Collaboration Agreement, as amended and return the gevokizumab rights to us. The termination will be effective on March 25, 2016, and does not result in a change to the maturity date of our loan with Servier. As we will no longer be required to provide services to Servier under the Collaboration Agreement beyond the effective date, we will amortize the remaining deferred revenue through March 25, 2016. As of December 31, 2015, the deferred revenue &#8211; current associated with this collaboration was $0.6 million. All such deferred revenue is expected to be recognized in the first quarter of 2016.

NIAID

In September 2008, we were awarded a third NIAID contract for $64.8 million under Contract No. HHSN272200800028C (&#8220;NIAID 3&#8221;) to continue development of our anti-botulinum antibody product candidates, including XOMA 3AB and additional product candidates directed against the B and E toxin serotypes. As part of the contract, we have developed, evaluated and produced the clinical supplies to support an Investigational New Drug (&#8220;IND&#8221;) application filing with the FDA for XOMA 3AB. A Phase 1 trial was completed on XOMA 3AB, with no product-related serious adverse events. Subsequently, XOMA manufactured XOMA 3B and XOMA 3E, which are currently on stability and are in the process of IND preparation.

In October 2011, we announced we had been awarded a fourth NIAID contract for up to $28.0 million over five years under Contract No. HHSN 272201100031C (&#8220;NIAID 4&#8221;) to develop broad-spectrum antitoxins for the treatment of human botulism poisoning directed against the C and D toxin serotypes. 

Takeda

In November 2006, we entered into a fully funded collaboration agreement with Takeda for therapeutic monoclonal antibody discovery and development activities under which we agreed to discover and optimize therapeutic antibodies against multiple targets selected by Takeda. Takeda agreed to make up-front, annual maintenance and milestone payments to us, fund our research and development and manufacturing activities for preclinical and early clinical studies and pay royalties on sales of products resulting from the collaboration. Takeda is responsible for clinical trials and commercialization of drugs after an IND submission and is granted the right to manufacture once a product enters into Phase 2 clinical trials. We have completed a technology transfer and do not expect to perform any further research and development services under this program. From 2011 through 2015, we received milestone payments relating to one currently active program.

Under the terms of this agreement, we may receive milestone payments aggregating up to $19.0 million relating to one undisclosed product candidate and low single-digit royalties on future sales of all products subject to this license. Our right to milestone payments expires on the later of the receipt of payment from Takeda of the last amount to be paid under the agreement or the cessation by Takeda of all research and development activities with respect to all program antibodies, collaboration targets and/or collaboration products. Our right to royalties expires on the later of 13.5 years from the first commercial sale of each royalty-bearing discovery product or the expiration of the last-to-expire licensed patent.

&#160;

In February 2009, we expanded our existing collaboration to provide Takeda with access to multiple antibody technologies, including a suite of research and development technologies and integrated information and data management systems. We may receive milestones of up to $3.3 million per discovery product candidate and low single-digit royalties on future sales of all antibo dy products subject to this license. Our right to milestone payments expires on the later of the receipt of payment from Takeda of the last amount to be paid under the agreement or the cessation by Takeda of all research and development activities with re spect to all program antibodies, collaboration targets and/or collaboration products. Our right to royalties expires on the later of 10 years from the first commercial sale of such royalty-bearing discovery product or the expiration of the last-to-expire licensed patent. 

Novartis &#8211; Anti-CD40 Antibody

In November 2008, we restructured our product development collaboration with Novartis. Under the restructured agreement, Novartis made a payment to us of $6.2 million in cash and reduced our existing debt by $7.5 million; agreed to fund all future research and development expenses; agreed to pay potential milestones of up to $14.0 million and royalty rates ranging from low-double-digit to high-teen percentage rates for certain antibody products binding to CD40 or prolactin receptor antibody programs; and has provided us with options to develop or receive royalties on four additional programs. In exchange, Novartis received control over the CD40 and prolactin receptor antibody programs, as well as the right to expand the development of these programs into additional indications outside of oncology. Novartis has initiated clinical studies to test CFZ533, an anti-CD40 antibody arising from its collaboration with XOMA, in de novo renal transplantation, Primary Sj&#246;gren's Syndrome and in moderate to severe myasthenia gravis. Novartis has returned control of the prolactin receptor antibody program, XOMA 213, to us and we are evaluating options for its continued development. In 2013, we received a $7.0 million milestone relating to one currently active program. Our right to milestone payments expires at such time as no collaboration product or former collaboration product is being developed or commercialized anywhere in the world and no royalty payments on these products are due. Our right to royalty payments expires on the later of the expiration of any licensed patent covering each product or 10 years from the launch of each product.

In September 2015, we and Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics, Inc. (&#8220;NVDI&#8221;), executed an amendment to their Amended and Restated Research, Development and Commercialization Agreement dated July 1, 2008, as amended, relating to anti-CD40 antibodies. The parties agreed to reduce the royalty rates that we are eligible to receive on sales of Novartis&#8217; clinical stage anti-CD40 antibodies. These royalties are tiered based on sales levels and now range from a mid-single digit percentage rate to up to a low double-digit percentage rate. 

In connection with the collaboration between XOMA and Novartis (then Chiron Corporation), a secured note agreement was executed in May 2005. The note agreement is secured by our interest in the collaboration and was due and payable in full in June 2015. On June 19, 2015, we and Novartis Vaccines Diagnostics, Inc. (&#8220;NVDI&#8221;), who assumed the note agreement, agreed to extend the maturity date of our secured note agreement from June 21, 2015 to September 30, 2015, which was then subsequently extended to September 30, 2020. At December 31, 2015, the outstanding principal balance under this note agreement totaled $13.7 million and was included in our long-term portion of interest bearing obligations in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015. Pursuant to the terms of the arrangement as restructured in November 2008, we will not make any additional borrowings on the Novartis note.

Novartis &#8211; Anti-TGF&#946; Antibody

In September 2015, we and Novartis International Pharmaceutical Ltd. (&#8220;Novartis International&#8221;) entered into a license agreement (the &#8220;License Agreement&#8221;) pursuant to which we granted Novartis International an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license to our anti-transforming growth factor beta (&#8220;TGF-beta&#8221;) antibody program. Under the terms of the License Agreement, Novartis International obtained worldwide rights to the TGF-beta antibody program and is solely responsible for the development and commercialization of antibodies and products containing antibodies arising from the TGF-beta antibody program. 

Under the License Agreement, we received a $37 million upfront fee. We are eligible to receive up to a total of $480 million in development, regulatory and commercial milestones. We also are eligible to receive royalties on sales of licensed products, which are tiered based on sales levels and range from a mid-single digit percentage rate to up to a low double-digit percentage rate. Novartis International&#8217;s obligation to pay royalties with respect to a particular product and country will continue for the longer of the date of expiration of the last valid patent claim covering the product in that country, or ten years from the date of the first commercial sale of the product in that country.

The License Agreement contains customary termination rights relating to material breach by either party. Novartis International also has a unilateral right to terminate the License Agreement on an antibody-by-antibody and country-by-country basis or in its entirety on one hundred eighty days&#8217; notice.

&#160;

Pfizer 

In August 2007, we entered into a license agreement (the &#8220;2007 Agreement&#8221;) with Pfizer Inc. (&#8220;Pfizer&#8221;) for non-exclusive, worldwide rights for our patented bacterial cell expression technology for research, development and manufacturing of antibody products. Under the terms of the 2007 Agreement, we received a license fee payment of $30.0 million in 2007.

From 2011 through 2015, we have received milestone payments, and we were also eligible for additional milestone payments and low single-digit royalties on future sales of all products subject to this license. In addition, we were also eligible to receive potential milestone payments aggregating up to $1.7 million for each additional qualifying product candidate. Our right to milestone payments would expire on the later of the expiration of the last-to-expire licensed patent or the tenth anniversary of the effective date. Our right to royalties would expire upon the expiration of the last-to-expire licensed patent. In December 2015, we entered into a settlement and amended license agreement with Pfizer, pursuant to which we granted Pfizer a fully-paid, royalty-free, worldwide, irrevocable, non-exclusive license rights to XOMA&#8217;s patented bacterial cell expression technology for phage display and other research, development and manufacturing of antibody products for cash payment by Pfizer of $3.8 million in full satisfaction of all obligations to us under the August 27, 2007 License Agreement between XOMA Ireland Limited and Pfizer Inc, including but not limited to potential milestone, royalty and other fees under the 2007 Agreement. 

In August 2005, we entered into a license agreement with Wyeth (subsequently acquired by Pfizer) for non-exclusive, worldwide rights for certain of XOMA&#8217;s patented bacterial cell expression technology for vaccine manufacturing. Under the terms of this agreement, we received a milestone payment in November 2012 relating to TRUMENBA&#174;, a meningococcal group B vaccine marketed by Pfizer. We receive a fraction of a percentage of sales of TRUMENBA as royalties. Our right to royalties expires on a country-by-country basis upon the later of the expiration of the last-to-expire licensed patent or 10 years from the first commercial sale of TRUMENBA.

Novo Nordisk

In December 2015, we entered into a license agreement with Novo Nordisk A/S (&#8220;Novo Nordisk &#8221;) pursuant to which we have granted to Novo Nordisk an exclusive, world-wide, royalty-bearing license to XOMA&#8217;s XMetA program of allosteric monoclonal antibodies that positively modulate the insulin receptor (the &#8220;XMetA Program&#8221;), subject to our retained commercialization rights for rare disease indications. Novo Nordisk has an option to add these additional rights to its license upon payment of an option fee.

Novo Nordisk will have worldwide rights to the XMetA Program and will be solely responsible for its expenses for the development and commercialization of antibodies and products containing antibodies arising from the XMetA Program, subject to the our retained rights described above. We have transferred certain proprietary know-how and materials relating to the XMetA Program to Novo Nordisk. Under the agreement, we received a $5.0 million, non-creditable, non-refundable, upfront payment. Based on the achievement of pre-specified criteria, we are eligible to receive up to $290.0 million in development, regulatory and commercial milestones. We are also eligible to receive royalties on sales of licensed products, which are tiered up to a high single digit percentage rate based on sales levels. Novo Nordisk&#8217;s obligation to pay development and commercialization milestones will continue for so long as Novo Nordisk is developing or selling products under the agreement, subject to the maximum milestone payment amounts set forth above. Novo Nordisk&#8217;s obligation to pay royalties with respect to a particular product and country will continue for the longer of the date of expiration of the last valid patent claim covering the product in that country, or ten years from the date of the first commercial sale of the product in that country.

The agreement contains customary termination rights relating to material breach by either party. Novo Nordisk also has a unilateral right to terminate the agreement in its entirety on ninety (90) days&#8217; notice.

Sale of Manufacturing Facility and Biodefense Assets 

On November 4, 2015, we entered into an asset purchase agreement (the &#8220;Nanotherapeutics Purchase Agreement&#8221;) with Nanotherapeutics, pursuant to which Nanotherapeutics agreed, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Nanotherapeutics Purchase Agreement, to acquire our biodefense business and related assets (including, subject to regulatory approval, certain contracts with the U.S. government), and to assume certain liabilities of XOMA (the &#8220;Transaction&#8221;). As part of the Transaction, the parties will, subject to the terms and conditions of the asset purchase agreement and the satisfaction of certain conditions, enter into an intellectual property license agreement (the &#8220;License Agreement&#8221;), pursuant to which we agree to license to Nanotherapeutics, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the License Agreement, certain intellectual property rights related to the purchased assets. Under the License Agreement, we are eligible for up to $4.5 million of cash payments upon Nanotheraputics&#8217; execution of a contract with the Defense Threat Reduction Agency. In addition, we are eligible to receive 15% royalties on net sales of products. 

&#160;

On November 5, 2015, we entered into an asset purchase agreement (the &#8220;Agenus Purchase Agreement&#8221;) with Agenus West, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Agenus Inc. (&#8220;Agenus&#8221;), pursuant to which Agenus agreed, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Agenus Purchase Agreement, to ac quire our pilot scale manufacturing facility in Berkeley, California, together with certain related assets, including a license to certain intellectual property related to the purchased assets, and to assume certain liabilities of XOMA, in consideration fo r the payment to us of up to $5.0 million in cash and the issuance to us of shares of Agenus&#8217;s common stock having an aggregate value of up to $1.0 million. The Agenus Purchase Agreement closed on December 31, 2015. At closing, we received cash of $4.7 mi llion, net of the assumed liabilities of $0.3 million. In addition to the cash consideration, we received 109,211 shares of common stock of Agenus with an aggregate value of $0.5 million. The remaining common stock of Agenus will only be received upon our satisfaction of certain operational matters, which we may or may not be able to satisfy. 

Financing Agreements

Hercules Loan and Security Agreement

In February 2015, we entered into a Loan and Security Agreement with Hercules, (the &#8220;Hercules Loan Agreement&#8221;) under which we borrowed $20.0 million. We used a portion of the proceeds received under the Hercules Loan Agreement to repay the outstanding principal, final payment fee, prepayment fee, and accrued interest of $5.5 million under our loan agreement with General Electric Capital Corporation.

The interest rate under the Hercules Loan Agreement will be calculated at a rate equal to the greater of either (i) 9.40% plus the prime rate as reported from time to time in The Wall Street Journal minus 7.25%, and (ii) 9.40%. Payments under the Hercules Loan Agreement are interest only until one month prior to the Amortization Date, defined as July 1, 2016. The interest only period will be followed by equal monthly payments of principal and interest amortized over a 30 month schedule through the scheduled maturity date of September 1, 2018 (the &#8220;Hercules Loan Maturity Date&#8221;). The entire principal balance, including a balloon payment of principal, as applicable, will be due and payable on the Hercules Loan Maturity Date. In addition, a final payment equal to $1.2 million will be due on the Hercules Loan Maturity Date, or such earlier date specified in the Hercules Loan Agreement. Our obligations under the Hercules Loan Agreement are secured by a security interest in substantially all of our assets, other than our intellectual property.

If we prepay the loan prior to the Hercules Loan Maturity Date, we will pay Hercules a prepayment charge, based on a prepayment fee equal to 3.00% of the amount prepaid, if the prepayment occurs in any of the first 12 months following the closing date, 2.00% of the amount prepaid, if the prepayment occurs after 12 months from the closing date but prior to 24 months from the closing date, and 1.00% of the amount prepaid if the prepayment occurs after 24 months from the closing date.

The Hercules Loan Agreement includes customary affirmative and restrictive covenants, but does not include any financial maintenance covenants, and also includes standard events of default, including payment defaults. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, a default interest rate of an additional 5% may be applied to the outstanding loan balances, and Hercules may declare all outstanding obligations immediately due and payable and take such other actions as set forth in the Hercules Loan Agreement. In connection with the Hercules Loan Agreement, we issued a warrant to Hercules that is exercisable for an aggregate of up to 181,268 shares of XOMA common stock at an exercise price of $3.31 per share (the &#8220;Hercules Warrant&#8221;). The Hercules Warrant may be exercised on a cashless basis and is exercisable for a term beginning on the date of issuance and ending on the earlier to occur of five years from the date of issuance or the consummation of certain acquisitions of XOMA as set forth in the Hercules Warrant. The number of shares for which the Hercules Warrant is exercisable and the associated exercise price are subject to certain proportional adjustments as set forth in the Hercules Warrant.

Research and Development

Our research and development expenses currently include costs of personnel, supplies, facilities and equipment, consultants, third-party costs and other expenses related to preclinical and clinical testing. In 2015, our research and development expenses were $70.9 million, compared with $80.7 million in 2014 and $74.9 million in 2013.

Our research and development activities can be divided into those related to our internal projects and those related to collaborative and contract arrangements, which are reimbursed by our collaborators. In 2015, research and development expenses relating to internal projects were $50.2 million, compared with $51.3 million in 2014 and $47.5 million in 2013. In 2015, research and development expenses related to collaborative and contract arrangements were $20.6 million, compared with $29.5 million in 2014 and $27.4 million in 2013. 

&#160;

Competition 

The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are subject to continuous and substantial technological change. Competition in antibody-based technologies is intense and is expected to increase as new technologies emerge and established biotechnology firms and large chemical and pharmaceutical companies continue to advance in the field. A number of these large pharmaceutical and chemical companies have enhanced their capabilities by entering into arrangements with or acquiring biotechnology companies or entering into business combinations with other large pharmaceutical companies. Many of these companies have significantly greater financial resources, larger research and development and marketing staffs, and larger production facilities than ours. Moreover, certain of these companies have extensive experience in undertaking preclinical testing and human clinical trials. These factors may enable other companies to develop products and processes competitive with or superior to ours. In addition, a significant amount of research in biotechnology is being carried out in universities and other non-profit research organizations. These entities are becoming increasingly interested in the commercial value of their work and may become more aggressive in seeking patent protection and licensing arrangements. Furthermore, many companies and universities tend not to announce or disclose important discoveries or development programs until their patent position is secure or, for other reasons, later. As a result, we may not be able to track development of competitive products, particularly at the early stages. There can be no assurance that developments by others will not render our products or technologies obsolete or uncompetitive.

Without limiting the foregoing, we are aware of the following competitors for the product and candidate shown in the table below. This table is not intended to be representative of all existing competitors in the market:

Government Regulation

The FDA and comparable regulatory agencies in state and local jurisdictions and in foreign countries impose substantial requirements upon the clinical development, pre-market approval, manufacture, marketing, import, export and distribution of biopharmaceutical products. These agencies and other regulatory agencies regulate research and development activities and the testing, approval, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, advertising and promotion of products and product candidates. Failure to comply with applicable FDA or other regulatory requirements may result in Warning Letters, civil or criminal penalties, suspension or delays in clinical development, recall or seizure of products, partial or total suspension of production or withdrawal of a product from the market. The development and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. We must obtain approval of our product candidates from the FDA before we can begin marketing them in the United States. Similar approvals are also required in other countries.

Product development and approval within this regulatory framework is uncertain, can take many years and requires the expenditure of substantial resources. The nature and extent of the governmental review process for our product candidates will vary, depending on the regulatory categorization of particular product candidates and various other factors.

The necessary steps before a new biopharmaceutical product may be sold in the United States ordinarily include:

&#160;

&#183; 

preclinical in vitro and in vivo tests, which must comply with Good Laboratory Practices (&#8220;GLP&#8221;); 

&#160;

&#183; 

submission to the FDA of an IND which must become effective before clinical trials may commence, and which must be updated annually with a report on development; 

&#160;

&#183; 

completion of adequate and well controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for its intended use; 

&#160;

&#183; 

submission to the FDA of a biologic license application (&#8220;BLA&#8221;), which must often be accompanied by payment of a substantial user fee; 

&#160;

&#183; 

FDA pre-approval inspection of manufacturing facilities for current Good Manufacturing Practices, or GMP, compliance and FDA inspection of select clinical trial sites for Good Clinical Practice (&#8220;GCP&#8221;), compliance; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

FDA review and approval of the BLA and product prescribing information prior to any commercial sale. 

&#160;

The results of preclinical tests (which include laboratory evaluation as well as preclinical GLP studies to evaluate toxicity) for a particular product candidate, together with related manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted as part of an IND to the FDA. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical trial, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. IND submissions may not result in FDA authorization to commence a clinical trial. A separate submission to an existing IND must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development. Further, an independent institutional review board (&#8220;IRB&#8221;), for each medical center proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that cen ter and it must monitor the study until completed. The FDA, the IRB, or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Clinical te sting also must satisfy extensive GCP regulations and regulations for informed consent and privacy of individually identifiable information. 

Clinical trials generally are conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or in some instances, be skipped. In Phase 1, the initial introduction of the product into humans, the product is tested to assess safety, metabolism, pharmacokinetics and pharmacological actions associated with increasing doses. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to evaluate the efficacy of the potential product for specific, targeted indications, determine dosage tolerance and optimum dosage and further identify possible adverse reactions and safety risks. Phase 3 and pivotal trials are undertaken to evaluate further clinical efficacy and safety often in comparison to standard therapies within a broader patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical sites. Phase 4, or post-marketing, trials may be required as a condition of commercial approval by the FDA and may also be voluntarily initiated by us or our collaborators. Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3 testing may not be completed within any specific period of time, if at all, with respect to any of our product candidates. Similarly, suggestions of safety, tolerability or efficacy in earlier-stage trials do not necessarily predict findings of safety and effectiveness in subsequent trials. Furthermore, the FDA, an IRB, or we may suspend a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Clinical trials are subject to central registration and results reporting requirements, such as on www.clinicaltrials.gov.

The results of preclinical studies, pharmaceutical development and clinical trials, together with information on a product&#8217;s chemistry, manufacturing, and controls, are submitted to the FDA in the form of a BLA, for approval of the manufacture, marketing and commercial shipment of the biopharmaceutical product. Data from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we or our collaborators interpret data. The FDA also may convene an Advisory Committee of external advisors to answer questions regarding the approvability and labeling of an application. The FDA is not obligated to follow the Advisory Committee&#8217;s recommendation. The submission of a BLA is required to be accompanied by a substantial user fee, with few exceptions or waivers. The user fee is administered under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, which sets goals for the timeliness of the FDA&#8217;s review. A standard review period is twelve months from submission of the application, while priority review is eight months from submission of the application. The testing and approval process is likely to require substantial time, effort and resources, and there can be no assurance that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. The FDA may deny review of an application by refusing to file the application or not approve an application by issuance of a complete response letter if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, require additional testing or information, or require risk management programs and post-market testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the product. Approval may occur with significant Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies, or REMS, which limit the clinical use in the prescribing information, distribution or promotion of a product. Once issued, the FDA may withdraw product approval if ongoing regulatory requirements are not met or if safety problems occur after the product reaches the market.

&#160;

Orphan drugs are those intended for use in rare diseases or conditions. As a result of the high cost of dev elopment and the low return on investment for rare diseases, certain governments provide regulatory and commercial incentives for the development of drugs for small disease populations. In the United States, the term &#8216;&#8216;rare disease or condition&#8217;&#8217; means an y disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 people in the United States. Applications for U.S. orphan drug status are evaluated and granted by the Office of Orphan Products Development (&#8220;OOPD&#8221;) of the FDA and must be requested before submitting a BLA. In the United States, orphan drugs are subject to the standard regulatory process for marketing approval but are exempt from the payment of user fees for licensure, may receive market exclusivity for a period of seven years and some tax benefits, and are eligible for OOPD grants. If a product with orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug or biological product for the same indication, except in very limited circumstances, for seven years. Competitors, however, may receive approval of different products for the indication for whi ch the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity. Orphan product exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same drug or biological product as defined by the FDA or if our product candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor&#8217;s product for the same indication or disease. If a drug or biological product designate d as an orphan product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan product exclusivity. 

Products manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including manufacture, labeling, advertising, distribution, promotion, recordkeeping, annual product quality review and reporting requirements. Adverse event experience with the product must be reported to the FDA in a timely fashion and pharmacovigilance programs to proactively look for these adverse events are mandated by the FDA. Manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMPs, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. Following such inspections, the FDA may issue notices on Form 483 and Warning Letters that could cause us to modify certain activities. A Form 483 notice, if issued at the conclusion of an FDA inspection, can list conditions the FDA investigators believe may have violated cGMP or other FDA regulations or guidance. Failure to adequately and promptly correct the observations(s) can result in further regulatory enforcement action. In addition to Form 483 notices and Warning Letters, failure to comply with the statutory and regulatory requirements can subject a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, such as suspension of manufacturing, seizure of product, injunctive action or possible civil penalties. We cannot be certain that we or our present or future third-party manufacturers or suppliers will be able to comply with the cGMP regulations and other ongoing FDA regulatory requirements. If we or our present or future third-party manufacturers or suppliers are not able to comply with these requirements, the FDA may halt our clinical trials, not approve our products, and require us to recall a product from distribution or withdraw approval of the BLA for that product. Failure to comply with ongoing regulatory obligations can result in delay of approval or Warning Letters, product seizures, criminal penalties, and withdrawal of approved products, among other enforcement remedies.

The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. These regulations include standards and restrictions for direct-to-consumer advertising, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, promotional activities involving the internet, and off-label promotion. While physicians may prescribe for off-label uses, manufacturers may only promote for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA has very broad enforcement authority under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and failure to abide by these regulations can result in penalties, including the issuance of a warning letter directing entities to correct deviations from FDA standards, and state and federal civil and criminal investigations and prosecutions.

Federal and state healthcare laws, including fraud and abuse and health information privacy and security laws, are also applicable to our business. We could face substantial penalties and our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects could be adversely affected. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include: the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce, or in return for, the purchase or recommendation of an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs; federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payers that are false or fraudulent; and the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (&#8220;HIPAA&#8221;), which created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and making false statements relating to healthcare matters and was amended by the Health Information Technology and Clinical Health Act (&#8220;HITECH&#8221;), and its implementing regulations, which imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. State law equivalents of each of the above federal laws exist, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.

&#160;

International Regulation 

In addition to regulations in the United States, we are subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of any future products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or market the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country.

Patents and Trade Secrets

Patent and trade secret protection are important to our business and our future will depend in part on our ability to obtain patents, maintain trade secret protection and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others. As a result of our ongoing activities, we hold and have filed applications for a number of patents in the United States and internationally to protect our products and important processes. We also have obtained or have the right to obtain exclusive licenses to certain patents and applications filed by others. However, the patent position of biotechnology companies generally is highly uncertain and consistent policy regarding the breadth of allowed claims has not emerged from the actions of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (&#8220;Patent Office&#8221;) with respect to biotechnology patents. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that our patents will afford protection against competitors with similar technologies or others will not obtain patents claiming aspects similar to those covered by our patent applications.

On January 6, 2015 we were awarded U.S. Patent No. 8,926,976 covering insulin receptor-activating antibodies having the functional properties of the lead antibody in our XMetA program, subsequently licensed to Novo Nordisk. On December 17, 2015 the European Patent Office issued a decision to grant European Patent 2 480 254 covering insulin receptor-activating antibodies having the functional properties of XOMA 358, the lead antibody in XOMA&#8217;s XMetD program. Additional patent applications covering our insulin receptor antibody programs are pending in the U.S. and certain other countries.

We have exclusive worldwide rights to a family of patents relating to our prolactin receptor antibody program, XOMA 213, following return of the program by Novartis. Issued patents in the family include US Patent No. 7,867,493 and EP 2 059 535.

We have established a portfolio of patents in the United States, Europe and certain other countries for our gevokizumab program. U.S. Patent Nos. 7,531,166 (which expires in 2027) and 7,582,742 cover gevokizumab and other antibodies and antibody fragments with similar binding properties for IL-1 beta, as well as nucleic acids, expression vectors and production cell lines for the manufacture of such antibodies and antibody fragments. US Patent No. 9,206,252 relates to pharmaceutical compositions of gevokizumab and other antibodies and antibody fragments with similar binding properties for IL-1 beta. U.S. Patent Nos. 7,744,865, 7,744,866 and 7,943,121 relate to additional IL-1 beta binding antibodies and binding fragments. U.S. Patent Nos. 7,695,718, 8,101,166, 8,586,036, 8,545,846, 8,377,429 and 9,163,082 relate to methods of treating Type 2 diabetes or Type 2 diabetes-induced diseases or conditions with high affinity antibodies and antibody fragments that bind to IL-1 beta, including gevokizumab. U.S. Patent No. 8,637,029 relates to methods of treating gout with certain doses of IL-1 beta binding antibodies or binding fragments. U.S. Patent No. 7,695,717 relates to methods of treating certain IL-1 related inflammatory diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis, with gevokizumab and other antibodies and antibody fragments with similar binding properties for IL-1 beta. U.S. Patent No. 7,829,093 relates to methods of treating diabetes mellitus (&#8220;Type 1&#8221;) with gevokizumab or other IL-1 beta antibodies and fragments having similar binding properties. U.S. Patent No. 7,829,094 relates to methods of treating certain cancers with gevokizumab or other IL-1 beta antibodies and fragments having similar binding properties, with the cancer being selected from multiple myeloma, acute myelogenous leukemia and chronic myelogenous leukemia. U.S. Patent No. 7,988,968 relates to methods of treating certain IL-1 beta related coronary conditions, including myocardial infarction, with gevokizumab or other IL-1 beta antibodies and fragments having similar binding properties. U.S. Patent No. 8,377,442 relates to methods of treating certain IL-1 beta related conditions, including inflammatory eye disease or uveitis, with gevokizumab or other IL-1 beta antibodies and fragments having similar binding properties. U.S. Patent Nos. 8,551,487 and 9,139,646 relate to methods of treating refractory uveitis with IL-1 beta binding antibodies and binding fragments. Also, patents have been granted by the European Patent Office and certain other countries for gevokizumab, as well as nucleic acids, expression vectors and production cell lines for the manufacture of gevokizumab.

In October 2015, we announced that we had exclusively licensed the global development and commercialization rights to our TGF&#946; antibody program to Novartis. The licensed intellectual property includes US Patent Nos. 8,569,464 and 9,145,458 covering XOMA&#8217;s lead TGF&#946; antibodies and methods of use thereof.

&#160;

We established a portfolio of patents related to our bacterial expression technology, including claims to methods for expression and secretion of recombinant proteins from bacteria, including immunoglobulin gene products, and improved methods and cells for expression of recombinant protein products. We have granted more than 60 licenses to biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies to use the Company&#8217;s patented and proprietary technologies rela ting to bacterial expression of recombinant pharmaceutical products. The last-to-expire patent licensed under the majority of these license agreements is Canadian patent 1,341,235, which is expected to expire in May 2018. 

In addition, we have developed a portfolio of patents and applications related to improvements to our bacterial expression technology, and to our display libraries. U.S. Patent Nos. 7,094,579, 7,396,661, 7,972,811, 7,977,068 and 8,476,040 relate to particular eukaryotic signal sequences and their use in methods for prokaryotic expression of polypeptides and for preparing polypeptide display libraries. WO 2012/106615 relates to the use of cytoplasmic fkpA and skp chaperones to enhance recombinant protein expression in bacteria. U.S. Patent Nos. 8,546,307 and 8,546,308 relate to novel triple tag sequences, phage display antibody libraries with such sequences, and methods of screening the libraries. WO 2011/038301 relates to novel methods of screening for kinetic modulating antibodies and WO 2012/092323 relates to display of antibodies or antibody fragments using a PDZ domain display system.

We also have established a portfolio of patents related to our mammalian expression technology, including U.S. Patent Nos. 7,192,737, 7,993,915, 7,794,976 and 8,497,096, which relate to methods of producing recombinant proteins using particular vectors, including expression vectors comprising multiple copies of a transcription unit encoding a polypeptide separated by at least one selective marker gene.

We have been granted patents related to our Targeted Affinity Enhancement (TAE)&#8482; technology, including U.S. Patent No. 9,102,711 and EP 2 242 843 directed to methods of mutating nucleic acids using certain primer sets.

In November 2013, we were awarded U.S. Patent No. 8,584,349, entitled "Flexible Manufacturing System." This patent is directed to a flexible system of movable manufacturing bays, adapted to easily and quickly connect to a central supply of utilities such as air, water, and electricity. This unique arrangement facilitates flexible design and eliminates change-over downtime, which translates into significantly reduced capital expenditures, production costs, and maintenance costs. The flexible manufacturing system can be applied to fields as diverse as pharmaceuticals, biologics, and electronics. In October 2014 we announced that the Texas A&#38;M University System agreed to a non-exclusive license to this technology.

If certain patents issued to others are upheld or if certain patent applications filed by others issue and are upheld, we may require certain licenses from others in order to develop and commercialize certain potential products incorporating our technology. There can be no assurance that such licenses, if required, will be available on acceptable terms.

Where appropriate, we also rely on trade secrets to protect aspects of our technology. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. We protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and collaborators. These parties may breach these agreements, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. Our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that we or our consultants or collaborators use intellectual property owned by others, we may have disputes with our collaborators or consultants or other third parties as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.

Financial Information about Geographic Areas

We believe, because the pharmaceutical industry is global in nature, international activities will be a significant part of our future business activities, and when and if we are able to generate income, a portion of that income may be derived from product sales and other activities outside the United States. One of our strategic goals is to establish XOMA as a commercial organization in the United States.

We have determined that we operate in one business segment as we only report operating results on an aggregate basis to the chief operating decision maker of the XOMA Corporation. Our property and equipment is held primarily in the United States.

Financial information regarding the geographic areas in which we operate and segment information is included in Note 14 to the December 31, 2015, Financial Statements: Concentration of Risk, Segment and Geographic Information.

Servier, NIAID and Novartis accounted for 43 percent, 26 percent, and 20 percent respectively, of our total revenue in 2013. At December 31, 2015, Five Prime, NIAID, Servier and Centocor accounted for 39 percent, 25 percent, 18 percent and 10 percent, respectively, of the accounts receivable balance. NIAID, Servier and Oncobiologics accounted for 44 percent, 34 percent and 12 percent, respectively, of our total accounts receivable balance at December 31, 2014.
