Forward-Looking Statements 

&#160; 

Certain statements, other than purely historical information, including estimates, projections, statements relating to our business plans, objectives, and expected operating results, and the assumptions upon which those statements are based, are &#8220;forward-looking statements.&#8221; These forward-looking statements generally are identified by the words &#8220;believes,&#8221; &#8220;project,&#8221; &#8220;expects,&#8221; &#8220;anticipates,&#8221; &#8220;estimates,&#8221; &#8220;intends,&#8221; &#8220;strategy,&#8221; &#8220;plan,&#8221; &#8220;may,&#8221; &#8220;will,&#8221; &#8220;would,&#8221; &#8220;will be,&#8221; &#8220;will continue,&#8221; &#8220;will likely result,&#8221; and similar expressions. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Our ability to predict results or the actual effect of future plans or strategies is inherently uncertain. Factors which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and future prospects include, but are not limited to: changes in economic conditions, legislative/regulatory changes, availability of capital, interest rates, competition, and generally accepted accounting principles. These risks and uncertainties should also be considered in evaluating forward-looking statements and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements.

Company Overview and Description of Business 

&#160; 

We were incorporated in the State of Delaware on November 18, 2004 for the purpose of merging with OLB.com (On-line Business), Inc., a New York corporation incorporated in 1993 (&#8220;OLB.com&#8221;). The merger was done for the purpose of changing our state of incorporation from New York to Delaware. 

&#160; 

As a result of the merger, we acquired all of the assets of OLB.com, including its intellectual property. In connection with the merger, each of the former common and preferred stockholders of OLB.com received five shares of our common stock in exchange for each outstanding share of OLB.com common and preferred stock and, in addition, the former holders of the Series A stock of OLB.com received one warrant for each such preferred share and the former holders of the Series B Preferred Stock of OLB.com received two warrants for each such preferred share, to purchase shares of our common stock. An aggregate of 1,345,098 shares of common stock were issued in connection with the merger. 

&#160; 

We are authorized to issue 200,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, and 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share. We currently have 13,479,297 shares of common stock issued and outstanding. No shares of preferred stock are currently outstanding. 

&#160; 

Our Business 

&#160; 

We currently offer monthly subscription packages which includes a health benefits package. These arrangements are generally renewable monthly and revenue is recognized over the renewal period. 

&#160; 

We also provide ecommerce development and consulting services on a project by project basis. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, we had one full time employee, Ronny Yakov, our Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer who with which we have signed a five-year employment agreement. The agreement pays Mr. Yakov $275,000 per year plus $1,500 per month car allowance. The agreement expires February 28, 2018. We utilize outside contractors as needed for other business needs. 

&#160; 

We cannot be assured of being able to attract quality employees in the future. The establishment of our business will be largely contingent on our ability to attract and retain personnel for the management team. There is no assurance that we can find suitable management personnel or will have the financial resources to attract or retain such people, if found. 

&#160; 

Regulation 

&#160; 

At this time, there are no federal or state certifications or other regulatory requirements applicable to our products and we are not aware of any pending federal or state legislation which would introduce regulatory requirements that would negatively impact or impede the sales and distribution of our products in the United States or elsewhere; however, our products and business practices may be subject to review by industry self-regulatory agencies and consumer affairs monitors. Actions resulting from such reviews could include, but not be limited to, cease and desist orders, fines and recalls.
