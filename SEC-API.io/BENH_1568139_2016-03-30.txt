 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

&#160; 

Overview 

&#160; 

Bio-En Holdings, Inc, a Delaware corporation, is a project and plant development company in the business of producing and selling ethanol and butanol made from municipal solid waste and other cellulosic fiber.

&#160;

We have planned, designed, engineered and prepared agreements to build and operate a facility using Gravity Pressure Vessel Technology in Weak Acid Hydrolysis to convert Biomass to Ethanol (the &#8220;Facility&#8221;). The Facility will be built on the Island of Malta and is anticipated to be fully operational by 18-24 months from full funding and therefore no earlier than the end of the 4th quarter of 2017.

&#160;

The Facility will combine technologies from the waste management industry and integrate the recycling of waste, control of carbon dioxide and other emissions, with the profitable production of fuel grade Ethanol.

&#160;

The Company has so far not been successful in obtaining the full funding required to establish the Facility.

&#160; 

Our Corporate History and Background 

&#160;

The Company, under the name Olivia, Inc., was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on January 6, 2014. The Company, through its merger &#8220;(Merger&#8217;) with Bio-En Corp (&#8220;BEC&#8221;) is in the development stage and is devoting substantially all of its efforts to the development of its business plan. The Company intends to be a world leader of setting the standard for waste to bio-fuel technologies. The Company intends to plan, design, and execute agreements to build, operate and maintain a bio-mass to energy facility on the island of Malta, which is contingent on sufficient capital funding. The Company&#8217;s fiscal year-end is December 31.

&#160;

Industry 

&#160;

The Company is a renewable energy company which intends to offer profitable solutions to environmental problems by the integration and application of proven technologies and methods that deal with waste materials and the processing of biomass to fuel grade ethanol or other biofuels. The Company is focused on the up-to-date use of established process engineering principles joined with specific patented technology available to it through a license agreement entered into on March 23, 2014 between BEC. and GeneSyst International, Inc. a Delaware corporation, the license agreement assigned by BEC to Company.

&#160;

Plan of Operation 

&#160;

The Company has received correspondence from Malta Enterprise, the governing body in Malta overseeing projects for the government indicating the Company has been given a green light to design, build and operate a facility to convert municipal solid waste and other forms of cellulosic biomass to ethanol subject to requirements established by Malta Enterprises and the government of Malta, as well as other intended governments (&#8220;Facility&#8221;). The Facility should be fully operational within 18-24 months of full funding.

&#160;

The planned Facility is designed to be a major GREEN project. The Facility will combine technologies from the waste management industry which will be integrated into the Facility&#8217;s overall waste recycling program, control of carbon dioxide and other emissions and the profitable production of fuel grade ethanol and other Biofuels.

&#160;

The Company plans to derive its revenue from gate fees for MSW (as defined below) brought to the plant, the sale of ethanol or other biofuels, sale of carbon dioxide and sale of excess electricity to Malta. No off-take contracts have been entered into as of this time.

&#160;

In addition to these traditional sources of revenue, the Company expects to derive additional revenue from biofuels production subsidies. The European Union (&#8220;EU&#8221;) recognizes that producing Biofuel food crops on crop land has considerable cost implications since they are staple foods and need significant subsidies to be converted to biofuels. The price and demand for fuel has contributed to escalating food price inflation over recent years causing serious hardship for poorer populations. The EU is expected to implement a major overhaul of biofuels production subsidies that favor the Company.

&#160;

Green Business Opportunity and Cellulosic Feedstock 

&#160; 

The past decade has seen soaring oil prices, Middle East turmoil, government Biofuel incentives, clean-tech venture investments and maturing technologies, all these factors contributing to the critical mass necessary to launch the Biofuel market in a meaningful way.

&#160;

Ethanol is a significant source of liquid fuel and its production from food grains is widespread. However, the use of the food grains in the production of ethanol along with the cost for fuel is causing widespread increases in food prices and governments are now seeking alternative feedstock and fuel sources to accommodate the increasing demand for clean fuels from sustainable sources other than food grains or fossil fuels.

&#160;

The global market for ethanol will be open to enormous opportunities and transitional challenges over the next ten years. A few issues hold the key to these growth opportunities. If the promises of competitive, large-scale cellulosic ethanol production is realized, and if national import/export policies for Biofuels are further liberalized, then the possibilities for ethanol to replace 20% of gasoline consumption in the USA, Europe, China and India may be actualized by the year 2020.

&#160;

&#160; 4 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Business Strategy 

&#160;

The Green Business Opportunity is not about green sentiment, anymore. It is about building national energy security and being part of a huge emerging market of a kind that may come once in a century.

&#160;

The Company intends to take advantage of the worldwide burgeoning demand for Biofuels, thus adding value to the Company and high returns for the Company&#8217;s investors by integrating world-class technology matched to a project for the conversion of solid waste feedstock (&#8220;MSW&#8221;) and other cellulosic feedstock into fuel grade ethanol and other Biofuel.

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s use of patented Gravity Pressure Vessel (&#8220;GPV&#8221;) technology will demonstrate its leadership in setting the standard for best practicable waste conversion to fungible Ethanol and other Biofuels for the world market in an environmentally friendly manner.

&#160;

The Company believes that its Malta project could be the future standard used to measure all projects of this type and would likely lead to additional projects in other parts of the world.

&#160;

Patent Technical Field and Description 

&#160; 

The present invention is generally directed toward a process whereby woody cellulosic material is converted to ethanol via acid hydrolysis of cellulosic material to sugars that are subsequently fermented. The acid hydrolysis takes place in a gravity pressure vessel. In particular, the present invention is directed to apparatus and methods for impregnating woody cellulosic material with an alkali to make it more amiable to treatment in the gravity pressure vessel. In more particular embodiments, this invention is also directed toward employing ultrasound in a gravity pressure vessel to aid in the processing of woody cellulosic material.

&#160;

Production and Facility 

&#160; 

The Company plans to produce 88.5 million liters (23.3 million gallons) of fuel grade Ethanol each year which it would sell under contract to offshore users and spot purchasers. The production volume can be adjusted to accommodate short-term increases in overall capacity.

&#160;

The Company plans to build a Biofuels and Ethanol production facility that will have an initial capacity to take in a mixture of raw materials amounting to 370,000 wet metric tons of Biomass per year. In addition, the Company has reached a preliminary understanding with the Maltese Government to take into the planned Malta Facility a major portion of the MSW that is generated by Malta and Gozo. The gross annual amount is approximately 250,000 metric tons, and the Company will become the only Government contractor employed to receive this MSW supply for processing and treatment. The plant is designed to meet the requirements for Zero Waste Back to Landfill.

&#160;

The planned Facility anticipates using MSW and various forms of Biomass as the raw feedstock in the production process. The GenySyst process is a wet-based procedure and requires a supply of water to initiate the operation of the process. This water supply can come from any non-salt water source, direct potable water, rain water, final effluent from a sewage works, or from recovered process water from businesses or from sewage sludge. Once initiated, the internal process water is continuously recycled. This water supply will be supplemented with make-up water contained within new supplies of Biomass and sources of non-potable water.

&#160;

All residual products and excess water produced from the plant will be treated in a small waste water treatment processing plant located on or adjacent to the site. The waste water treatment plant will be designed to produce water that is suitable for discharge into inland watercourses or for irrigation purposes, as well as make-up water or used in the production of electricity from the Combined Heat and Power (&#8220;CHP&#8221;) plant. Excess power not used at the Facility will be sold to the Malta grid.

&#160;

An Electrical Generation set will be installed on site as part of the Facility. This will allow the Facility to operate independently of the Malta Electrical Grid. The Facility may use residual heat and by-products, such as Methane and a CHP plant, to provide the power needed for the plant to operate. The Facility will be a net producer of heat energy that can be converted to electricity and sold to local users.

&#160;

All the Biomass contained within the process facility, or any further materials produced during the production process would be non-toxic, and can be reused or incorporated into construction materials and pavement foundations for roads.

&#160;

Production 

&#160; 

The quantity of Bio-fuel or Ethanol produced will vary according to the type and source of Biomass. The estimated range is from 550 liters per dry metric ton from pure cotton, 400 to 450 liters per dry metric ton of recovered paper and wood, 300 to 350 liters per dry metric ton from green waste in parks and gardens and food waste, to around 200 to 250 liters per metric ton from MSW.

&#160;

The sources of Biomass proposed for the facility include recovered paper, green waste from parks and gardens, MSW, as well as coastal sea weed and shore debris.

&#160;

&#160; 6 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

There appears to be ample supply of various sources of Biomass obtained within Malta or imported from the EU or to meet the feedstock needs of the facility. The Company plans to develop its first facility based on MSW and recovered paper, augmenting the feedstock with a blend of additional raw materials to increase bottom line revenues. Malta prohibits the importation of raw trash and garbage, but does allow pre-processed materials.

&#160;

Integration of Technologies for Mitigation and Production 

&#160; 

The Bio-En facility is designed to integrate existing proven technologies with GeneSyst&#8217;s GPV technology to convert the cellulose content in Biomass into fuel grade Ethanol, Biofuel and other byproducts that can be sold in the open market.

&#160;

Proven Technologies and Key Components 

&#160; 

The key components of a Mild Acid Hydrolysis Facility needed to convert municipal and agricultural wastes to Ethanol and Biofuel have been in use and functioning for many years. Two decades ago, a breakthrough occurred in the creation of a &#8220;continuous pressure cooker&#8221; that operated with extremely high thermal and mechanical efficiency coupled with industry setting records for on-line availability, which is now known as the GPV.

&#160;

The key element in this technology is how the GPV accepts and processes solid wastes in water. When the GPV technology was coupled with wastewater treatment technology, the joining of these technologies supported a process that achieved rapid, high volume processing of waste products and various other environmentally unfriendly raw materials into environmentally safe Biofuel at a low sustainable cost.

&#160;

The incorporation of municipal waste and other waste streams into the process economics results in a negative cost for feedstock. Company&#8217;s robust returns are a result of the low cost of its feedstock, which in fact is not a cost (liability) but a source of revenue (asset), since Malta pays a tipping fee to get rid of its MSW. The use of MSW and other waste feedstock ensures economically viable operations with or without tax incentives and meets the sustainability requirements which have been written into EU laws pertaining to the sustainability of Biofuel production. The use of grains and other foodstuffs to make Biofuel has caused widespread increases in the cost of food in Europe and is affecting the economics of everyday life.

&#160;

Extrapolation of Known Procedures 

&#160; 

Throughout this business summary predictions have been made based upon generally accepted engineering procedures to predict performance of the facility as well as the economic expectations to be derived from these practices. In order to be successful, it is necessary to build a facility that is more efficient and more effective than previous technologies employed by others. To accomplish this with minimal risk, certain protocols have been established by the Company&#8217;s engineers to insure that the plant to be designed and built will meet all requisite standards discussed throughout the body of this plan. The Company&#8217;s engineers believe these extrapolations are limited, conservative and reasonable in nature so as to result in a financially viable facility. However, some actual results may differ from projections due to unforeseen developments.

&#160;

Basis of the Technology 

&#160;

The process of turning Biomass (Celluloses) to the Saccharides by Weak Acid Hydrolysis prior to making Ethanol has been used in the United States in the Pulp and Paper industry for over 30 years, using small scale plants with heating under pressure in multiple batch tanks above ground. The GPV has been used for twenty years to oxidize wet waste materials. During this time GPVs were also used for the conversion of waste streams to commercial commodities, thus proving their viability and profitability.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Drivers Promoting Processing MSW to Ethanol 

&#160;

&#160; a. Need for a clean, non-polluting process for the manufacture of fuel grade Ethanol &#160; b. The absolute amount of waste produced is rising &#160; c. Unchecked emission of greenhouse gases may lead to a rise in global temperature &#160; d. In less developed countries, waste production per capita is rising, probably at an even faster rate than the EU, as per-capita GNP and living standards increase &#160; e. Developed countries are banning/limiting landfill and dumping of waste leading to an increased demand for waste processing and waste mitigation &#160; f. Less developed countries have acknowledged the need for waste management &#160; g. Release of toxic materials into water and air is prohibited in many countries &#160; h. More countries are banning or limiting landfill and dumping of waste to protect the environment &#160; i. Governments are increasingly enacting environmental taxation &#160; j. Recycling of materials is fundamental in modern waste treatment and disposal &#160; k. Oil, electricity and other energy prices are all rising &#160; l. Population is rising and land is getting increasingly expensive, particularly land used for growing feedstock for fuel &#160; m. Transportation costs are increasing - reflecting rising oil, land and labor prices &#160; n. Increasing demand for waste treatment in urban areas, coupled with ongoing health concerns requires innovative application of proven technologies/methods to treat waste economically &#160; o. The cost of food grain is rising due to their diversion to Biofuel production thus causing higher food prices and starvation &#160; p. Liquid energy in the form of Ethanol may have higher market value than other forms of energy conversion &#160;

Background of the GPV Technology 

&#160; 

The GPV was invented and developed by James Titmas, a professional engineer with 54 years of experience in water and waste treatment, and the founder of GeneSyst International Inc.

&#160;

The process of using the GPV in Weak Acid Hydrolysis to convert celluloses to saccharides was discovered in the 1820&#8217;s and used by Henry Ford in the 1920-30&#8217;s to provide the feed stock for producing fuel grade Ethanol.

&#160;

The use of a GPV increases the efficiency of converting celluloses to high value saccharides, and thus increases the resulting yield of Ethanol from Biomass and waste materials.

&#160;

The GeneSyst system updates this conversion process by using a shallow commercial water well chamber modified to be a sealed vacuum chamber in which hangs the GPV. After receipt and initial shredding of cellulosic materials, the Biomass is mixed with water and impregnated with a mild alkali solution. The processed Biomass then enters the outer annulus of the GPV passing downwards, pre-heating and accumulating pressure. In the reaction chamber at the bottom of the GPV, Oxygen is used to destroy tramp organics that inhibit fermentation followed by the introduction of a catalyst (dilute carbonic acid) to instigate the disassociation of the celluloses to saccharides (sugars). This oxidation step is exothermic and after pre-heating, the temperature is trimmed to 455&#186;F (235 o Celsius). With a small portion of un-reacted nitrogen and thermal expansion, the density of the mixture is lowered to allow natural convection to move the fluids through the GPV without pumping. The mixture, which is now sugar based, rises up the inner pipe after neutralization of its acid in the reaction chambers. The mixture continues to rise driven upwards past the downward flowing colder feed mix, and as it does, it allows its heat to pass through the wall of the inner heat exchanging pipe to the descending raw materials in the outer annulus of the GPV. At the surface the sugar mixture is then cleaned using conventional water processing equipment and forwarded for conversion to Ethanol or Biofuel ready for sale. All tanks and processing vessels are enclosed. The system is completely sealed to prevent loss of product, odors and environmental contamination. Ethanol produced from Biomass waste eliminates the production of new Green House Gases (GHG) arising from the waste. Ethanol is used up to an 85% concentration as a substitute for the refined fossil fuels as an additive to gasoline. It offers a further reduction in the emission of GHG giving additional benefits to the environment. The GHG emissions of landfill gasses are also dramatically reduced.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

The Process Advantage 

&#160; 

The process to extract the saccharides from cellulosic material uses a combination of higher temperatures with acid conditions. The higher the temperature, the lesser the amount of acid needed. This hydrolysis reaction process is nearly instantaneous and must be arrested before the acids decompose the saccharides created from de-polymerization of the cellulosic materials. In the case of the GPV the acidic conditions are neutralized to arrest the reaction and the heat energy is recovered.

&#160;

The process described above is the specific advantage made available by using a continuous plug flow GPV reaction chamber, combined with the advantages of no moving parts, a tolerance for large size pieces and use of many types of raw materials, the internal recycling of pressure and heat energy all combine to create high availability.

The process is continuous and not batching which leads to increased productivity at lower costs.

&#160;

&#160;

Recap of the Gravity Pressure Vessel and How It Works 

&#160; 

&#160; a. The GPV hangs freely in a 700 meter deep shaft &#160; b. The containment shaft consists of a steel tube fixed in a grout jacket &#160; c. The shaft is brought under vacuum pressure, like a vacuum flask &#160; d. The GPV is a closed outer tube with an open inner tube &#160; e. Celluloses waste in water is pumped through the outer pipe down and through the inner pipe up &#160;

&#160; 9 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; f. At the bottom of the pipe, celluloses converts to sugars in a low pH environment &#160; g. The acid is neutralized with alkaline to retain the sugars &#160; h. The up going stream heats the down going stream &#160; i. It is an energy efficient sterile chemical flow process without moving parts and gas emissions &#160; j. After the celluloses are cracked in the &#8220;reactor&#8221; chamber, the sugar dissolves and rises through the inner pipe to the closed sedimentation tanks on ground level &#160; k. Here the remaining inorganic dense and lightweight particles are removed for beneficial reuse. &#160; l. The Saccharides are then stripped of other valuable organic byproducts and passed forward for fermentation to ethanol &#160;

GeneSyst Schematic for Conversion of Biomass to Ethanol 

&#160;

&#160;

Project Description 

&#160; 

The Malta Facility is intended to be a Finance, Design, Construct and Operate Facility and is currently estimated to cost approximately $150 million to complete and to put into full operation.

&#160;

This facility is expected to be located on designated land allocated by the Government of Malta at the eastern end of the Hal Far Industrial Area. The site has an area of 55,000 square meters (13.25 acres) and is fully accessible being bounded on three sides by major roads suitable for HGV Class III vehicles. The site is in the south east of the island of Malta, within six (6)6 kilometers of Malta&#8217;s main airport (Luqa) and more importantly, three (3) kilometers of the Malta Free Port.

&#160;

The Malta Biomass to Ethanol Facilities is targeted to make upwards of 88 Million liters per year of the Bio-Ethanol. The source material to make this will be 270,000 dry metric tons equivalent per year of the Raw Material Biomass. It is anticipated that 80% of the feedstock come from sources on Malta and Gozo.

&#160;

&#160; 10 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

The ethanol produced at the facility will be made using the process known as Dilute-Acid Hydrolysis in conjunction with GeneSyst&#8217;s patented Gravity Pressure Vessel &#8482; along with remainder of plant engineering and design obtained from the waste water (sewage) treatment industry and traditional fermentation and distillation plant technology used in the Ethanol Industry.

&#160;

The issue of using non-invasive enzymes or GMO (genetically-modified-organisms) in the conversion process was a major point of discussion with the Advisory Board of Assessors and Engineers for the Government of Malta. Once it was proven that the plant did not pose a risk to humans, animals and the flora and fauna on the Island, the project was given an immediate go-ahead by the Malta Authorities.

&#160;

The Company has been in discussions with an Engineering, Procurement, Construction (&#8220;EPC&#8221;) contractor to design, construct and operate the facility and to oversee local sub-contractors, such as the civil engineering construction company Attard Construction, supported by Panta Lesco, who specializes in mechanical, electrical and ICA/SCADA (Instrumentation Control and Automation/System Collection and Data Acquisition). Both of these local sub-contractors have worked on projects in the Water and Waste Water (Sewage) Treatment and the Food and Chemical Process Industry. EPC is a prominent form of contracting agreement in the construction industry. The engineering and construction contractor will carry out the detailed engineering design of the project, procure all the equipment and materials necessary, and then construct to deliver a functioning facility or asset to their clients. Companies that deliver EPC Projects are commonly referred to as EPC Contractors.

&#160;

As soon as the project financing is in place, the Company&#8217;s in house engineers along with the EPC contractor and the sub-contractors will finalize the various protocols and strategies for the design and construction for the facility, and establish the parameters for the facility to be completed. During this period, the target dates for overall completion of the project will be set along with the purchase of Owners Protective Professional Indemnity Insurance to cover any risks concerning the design and operations of the project.

&#160;

The Company anticipates starting delivery of Ethanol or Biofuel as soon as the first phase of the plant is completed. The Company&#8217;s business implementation strategy has been to assemble a first class team to design and construct and operate the plant at the earliest possible time. Company will be using the appropriate FIDIC (F&#233;d&#233;ration International Des Ing&#233;nieurs-Conseils) Conditions of Contract to ensure that any issues are normalized under traditional working practices as used in the EU.

&#160;

This Biomass to Ethanol Facility will be developed according to a Design and Construct contract where a portion of the design may not be fully developed until construction is about to start. However, as soon as the financing is in place and mobilization of the designers and construction companies has occurred, this process will be started. This whole procedure will be nurtured through a VM/VE (Value Management/Value Engineering) audit trail which will be under constant review by the in-house staff and consultants for the Company.

&#160;

All the confirmatory site investigations and the residual planning assays with MEPA (Malta Environment and Planning Authority) need to be finalized before the actual construction begins. These investigations may be carried out simultaneously with the need to assess and confirm the supply of the raw materials used to make the Biofuels, and should be confirmed by the necessary laboratory testing which will be carried out in the local testing centers and University. At the same time, pre-orders should be lodged with the longest lead time items including that for the drilling company that will be needed to drill the bore-holes for the installation of the three gravity pressure vessels. All boreholes should be drilled to the common depth of 610 meters (2000 feet) needed for the process. The drilling of these boreholes and the installation of the steel-work will take approximately six (6) weeks. Two major drilling companies have been asked for quotes for this part of the operation and early indications suggest that one will be the most acceptable in terms of practice, record and price for this part of the work. Again, the lead time to obtain the fermentation and concentration plant for the production of the Ethanol will also be required to be ordered early on and this should be organized at the same time.

&#160;

&#160; 11 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

As soon as the first gravity pressure vessel is installed and operational, the sections making up the overall plant needed for full commercial operation, complete with its pre-treatment settlement tanks needed to prepare the Biomass, and its subsequent post gravity pressure vessel cleaning mechanical elements for cleaning the saccharides/sugars and treatment plant items may be put on-line making the plant ready for full service and for training personnel in operations and maintenance.

&#160;

This first train (unit) will also include the final waste water (or residual effluent) treatment process plant, the anaerobic digestion facility, its CHP (Combined Heat and Power) plant for creating electrical generation capacity and the residual water treatment component for discharging water for irrigation purposes.

&#160;

At the same time as this first unit is being installed, the construction and fitting out of the additional gravity pressure vessels that form the main service units of the overall plant will be carried to completion. Simultaneously with the development of the service units, the facilities for the processing and preparation of the Biomass will be ongoing along with the facilities for post gravity pressure vessel cleaning of the saccharides/sugars) and treatment items for fermentation and concentration of Biofuels and/or Ethanol.

&#160;

Once the Ethanol has been prepared it can be moved to its own on-site storage tanks so the Malta and the EU Customs and Excise Authority can inspect and confirm the amount and specifications of the fuel prior to its release and collection by Company&#8217;s own transportation fleet of HGV Class III articulated tankers to ship the fuel to the storage depot in the Malta Free Port for export. Within the Malta Free Port an additional storage tank for the Ethanol can be built to accommodate this need.

&#160;

Overall, the Malta Biomass to Ethanol Facility should take around 22 months to construct but because of the phased nature of construction and commissioning it will start delivering Ethanol well within this period &#8211; at around 12 to 15 months. It is anticipated that upon establishment of the full operating protocols the facility may become fully operational within 22 months of commissioning.

&#160;

Key Contractors 

&#160; 

Currently, the Company is in discussions with the following contractors:

&#160;

Design and Engineering 

&#160; 

&#160; a. David Xuereb &#38; Associates is anticipated to be the local firm of Architects and Engineers. The Maltese authorities approved the employment of David Xuereb &#38; Associates at an early stage in negotiations and the firm will be the single point of contact for the full design and all attendant issues of the facility. The design role should include the direct design input from GeneSyst as part of the licensing arrangements with GeneSyst. &#160;

&#160; b. Kevin H Ramsey Consulting may provide additional design work relating to the Civil and Process Engineering, which includes Chemical, Hydraulics, Thermodynamics etc. with Mechanical and Electrical, HV/LV and Power, and ICA/SCADA works. &#160;

&#160; c. The Malta College of Arts Science and Technology and the University of Malta, together with Queen's University in Belfast and the Carbolea Institute at the University of Limerick may also be providing services to assist in verifying the input materials through testing and analytical work. &#160;

&#160; 12 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Operations and Maintenance Contractor 

&#160; 

&#160; a. The Facility Operations and Maintenance (O &#38; M) is currently integrated into the operating expense budget projections. However, it is envisioned that the O &#38; M function will be organized as a separate Company Contractor under a separate contract expected with an EPC contractor. &#160;

&#160; b. The Biomass to Ethanol Facility is not a complex type of plant and uses traditional and standard equipment that is generally used across a wide selection of water, waste water, chemical and food process industries. The O &#38;M Contractor personnel will be trained people with experience from Malta based chemical and waste water and process industries. &#160;

&#160; c. Selected personnel will be trained on site and through coordinated courses at the Malta College of Arts Science and Technology. &#160; 

Plant Performance 

&#160;

The estimated quantity of Ethanol produced from different sources of Biomass ranges from 132 liters of Ethanol per metric ton, to over 340liters per metric ton from raw materials rich in fiber such as wood, low lignin pulp and sugar beet residues. It is estimated, over 40 different kinds of fiber sources may be available from population centers, many associated with negative cost sourcing, all of which are usable in GPV processing. Negative cost sourcing refers to buyer cost factors. Buyer cost factors are response adjustments that occur when dealing with a particular supplier. Buyer cost factors account for negative (and positive) aspects inherent in dealing with a particular supplier. Such aspects could include the risk involved in dealing with a particular supplier because of supplier location, or possible supplier past performance. For example, a new and untried supplier (or new manufacturing or shipping location for an incumbent supplier) exposes the buying organization to a higher risk of supply disruption simply because the buying organization has no experience of buying from the new supplier or location. Buyer cost factors are used in transformational bidding/quoting.

&#160;

The overall process has the potential to use a majority of the total volume of organic wastes from human activity. The process is believed to meet and exceed all public mandates to recycle. The conversion process has no air emissions. The separation, fermentation and distillation processes are well known and widely used.

Competing Technologies 

&#160; 

Gasification: The GPV or &#8220;Titmas Process&#8221; grew out of the need to meet the inherent failures of incineration and gasification processes. The problems arose from complications in recovery of first stage combustion energy (complex heat exchanger failures) incidence of toxic emissions from chlorinated and toxic inclusions in the feed stocks, char and clinker interference with continuance ash extraction, low &#8220;on line availability (less than 75%) failure to meet permit standards during start up and shut down protocols and an overall failure to &#8220;scale up&#8221; beyond weekly batch operations larger than 100 tons per day. Despite the known technical failings of gasification, promoters continue to garner investment of significant funds which will fail on observing the traditional problems have not been resolved. Examples of these failures include Brightstar, Thermoselect, Siemens-F&#252;rth, Range Fuel and others to name just a few. The losses to investors ranged from $200 million to $500 million US.

&#160; 

Mechanical Heat and Pressure: The generic family of processing materials, known as the &#8220;pump and tank&#8221; mechanical means of inducing higher temperatures in fluids via pumping and heat exchangers includes: wet oxidation (Zimproet. Al.) pyrolysis, acid hydrolysis (both concentrated and dilute). All have in common the use of heat to crack, decompose or make digestible complex organic debris &#8211; basically similar to cooking foods for the same reasons. The most common practitioner of these arts was the Zimpro process which built over 200 commercial plants between 1960 and 1990. Of these only 5 are still in operation by virtue of cannibalization of parts from other units. Again, the problems revolve around &#8220;on line availability,&#8221; mechanical complexity, moving parts, operator challenges and low yields. Attempts at strong acid hydrolysis in lieu of wet oxidation had the added complication of acid destruction of containment vessels. Yields in all cases were low due to the time period to manipulate the combination of the cellulose to sugar reaction (the combination of higher temperatures and acidic conditions) and complex mixtures of thick cellulosic semi-solid pastes obligated by the costs of pumping and containment. The longer the reaction, the more sugars were destroyed before extraction.

&#160;

Enzymatic Conversions: Rather than solve the problems of acid hydrolysis researchers moved to the more academic fields of enzyme enhancements which to date have turned out to require the use of expendable proteins for the saccharides conversion. Enzymes also held the promise of continuous academic study which also had a peculiar advantage in the research fields. Lignin remains problematic and some attempts are at hand to separate cellulose, hemi cellulose and lignin prior to further processing. Most of these are pursuing agricultural raw materials. The same problems of the processing of incoming MSW remain the same, noting that many components of agri-wastes and MSW share many characteristics and processing challenges in common. The real shortfall occurs from the seasonality of agricultural cellulose sources and the costs to collect and transport adequate quantities of agricultural chaff.

&#160; 

Customers 

&#160; 

At the present time the Company has not sought out any customers because the Facility has yet to be built. Prior to the completion of the first phase of plant construction, the Company intends to make its first entry onto the Biofuel Marketplace seeking a long-term contract for 80% of its production. The Company plans to sell 20% of its total production on the spot market or under short term contracts to take advantage of what it believes to be a rising market demand and subsequent increase in ethanol prices.

Government Regulation 

&#160;

European Union : The EU maintains two complementary pieces of legislation relating to renewable fuels: the Renewable Energy Directive (RED) and the Fuel Quality Directive (FQD). Together, these directives establish targets for the adoption of renewable fuels in EU member states by 2020. Transportation fuels are one category of fuels covered by these directives, and the targeted goals cover all renewable fuels &#8211; that is, they are not limited to ethanol. The FQD is relevant to the present discussion in that it establishes a limit of 10% for ethanol blending within EU member states, which are obligated to adopt national laws in conformance with the requirements of the directive.

&#160;

The European Commission&#8217;s Renewable Energy Directive (RED) requires that by 2020 all transportation fuels in the EU must contain 10% Biofuel. Individual EU states are free to incrementally build up to this target as they see fit, meaning that current mandated levels vary. Nevertheless, the fines incurred by fuel producers for not meeting local requirements offer some measure of demand stability. Of course, given that the mandates are dictated as percentages, declines in the consumption of the primary fuel for example, gasoline or diesel &#8211; will also affect Biofuel demand.

&#160;

The mandated requirements apply to Biofuels across the board, but there are numerous other legislative changes that are set to affect specific products in different ways. Biofuels produced from a raw material that is not part of the food chain, known as second-generation Biofuels, are set to count double when tallying up the bio-content of a fuel blend. This will include Biodiesel, which is made from used cooking oil and Ethanol produced from crude glycerin, which is itself a by-product of Biodiesel production. These changes add up to a positive future for the product, which has yet to enjoy widespread usage.

&#160;

Marketing Strategy and Sources of Revenue 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s business model is based on management&#8217;s belief that there is a significant market demand for fuel grade Ethanol and other Biofuels derived from sources other than agricultural feedstock and which are fully sustainable without impacting the food supply chain. The Company believes that its revenue model has the capability to provide substantial and predictable recurring revenue because it uses waste materials, MSW and agricultural waste at no feedstock costs to the enterprise. In addition to the negative feedstock costs, the Company will be receiving substantial gate fees for taking in the waste as well as other environmental cash credits from the EU. The Company has developed a multi-faceted revenue model that is expected, over time, to provide recurring revenue from the following sources:

&#160; 

&#160; a. Sales of Ethanol and other Biofuels &#160; b. Sales of byproducts &#160; c. Gate fees &#160; d. EU Environmental subsidies &#160;

Markets 

&#160; 

Biofuels have seen a spurt in the United States and the EU, with the latter planning to increase its annual production to about 10% of its liquid fuels by 2020. The United States has set up an ambitious target to produce about 8 billion gallons annually by 2012 and about 40 billion gallons by 2022. Though the energy companies are widening their portfolios to include Biofuels, the move is fraught by significant challenges such as types of fuels to be used, regulations and regulatory approvals, increased usage of land for cultivating Biofuel crops and diversion of food crops for fuel production which is resulting in the increase of food prices.

&#160;

&#160; 15 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

According to BCC Research, the global market for liquid biofuels outside North America reached $41.7 billion in 2015 and is projected to reach $89.6 billion in 2020, reflecting a five-year compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 16.5%. Focusing on the key challenges that still impede the realization of the billion-metric ton renewable fuels vision, this Memorandum integrates technological development and business development rationales to highlight the key technological developments that are necessary to industrialize Biofuels on a global scale. Technological issues addressed in this work include fermentation and downstream processing technologies, as compared to current industrial practice and process economics. Business issues that provide the lens through which the technological review is performed span the entire Biofuel value chain, from financial mechanisms to fund biotechnology start-ups in the Biofuel arena up to large green field manufacturing projects, to raw material farming, collection and transport to the bioconversion plant, manufacturing, product recovery, storage, and transport to the point of sale. Green Field manufacturing is form of foreign direct investment where a parent company starts a new venture in a foreign country by constructing new operational facilities from the ground up. In addition to building new facilities, most parent companies also create new long-term jobs in the foreign country by hiring new employees. Emphasis has been placed throughout the book on providing a global view that takes into account the intrinsic characteristics of various Biofuels markets from Brazil, the EU, the US, or Japan, to emerging economies as agricultural development and Biofuel development appear indissociably linked. Biofuels have emerged as a widely used renewable source of energy in the recent years. However, the rising demand for Biofuels in developed as well as developing countries has put a lot of pressure on - such as corn, sorghum, and soy, which are food crops. To ease off this pressure on food crops, scientists around the world are working on methods to convert lignocelluloses from plant waste material into Biofuels, instead of utilizing more food crops.

&#160;

Any types of Biomass derived from plant such as cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin are known as lingo-cellulosic Biomass. It is possible to categorize lingo cellulosic Biomass into four categories: energy crops, wood residues, agricultural residues and municipal paper waste.

&#160;

Lignocellulosic Biofuels have the potential to provide a large portion of cheap fuel for transportation especially if the available conversion processes are made cost effective. If technological hurdles are overcome, then a wide variety of lignocellulosic Biomass can be converted into Biofuels.

&#160;

Global cellulosic ethanol is expected to increase from 14.25m gallons in 2012 to 412.25m gallons in 2020, with commercial production anticipated to take off on a large scale in late 2013 and 2014, thanks to major players adding substantial production capacity and new companies joining the market. The US is expected to retain its market dominance until 2020.

&#160;

Ethanol is the most widely acclaimed alternative or additive for gasoline used for running vehicles, and the US ranked as number one producer of this biofuel using natural waste feedstock, states new analysis.

&#160;

Some EU countries such as France and Italy have cellulosic ethanol production infrastructure, but a limited supply of biomass feedstock. Growth of commercial production in these countries may feel the need to import feedstock from nearby countries or expand production to other countries with ample feedstock availability. A few producers with upcoming commercial scale plants in the US have already started signing agreements to procure agricultural residue and other kinds of cellulosic feedstock.
