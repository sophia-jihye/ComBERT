 ITEM 1. 

BUSINESS. 

GENERAL 

Carriage Services, Inc. (&#8220;Carriage,&#8221; the &#8220;Company,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; or &#8220;our&#8221;) was incorporated in the State of Delaware in December 1993 and is a leading provider of deathcare services and merchandise in the United States. We operate in two business segments: funeral home operations, which currently account for approximately 77% &#32;of our total revenue, and cemetery operations, which currently account for approximately 23% &#32;of our total revenue. At December 31, 2015 , we operated 167 &#32;funeral homes in 27 &#32;states and 32 &#32;cemeteries in 11 &#32;states. We mainly serve suburban and rural markets, where we primarily compete with smaller, independent operators and believe we are a market leader (first or second) in most of our markets. We provide funeral and cemetery services and products on both an &#8220;at-need&#8221; (time of death) and &#8220;preneed&#8221; (planned prior to death) basis. 

Our operations are reported in two business segments: 

Funeral Home Operations. &#32;Funeral homes are principally service businesses that provide funeral services (traditional burial and cremation) and sell related merchandise, such as caskets and urns. Given the high fixed cost structure associated with funeral home operations, we believe the following key factors affect our profitability: 

&#8226; 

demographic trends in terms of population growth and average age, which impact death rates and number of deaths; 

&#8226; 

our ability to establish and maintain market share positions supported by strong local heritage and relationships; 

&#8226; 

our ability to effectively respond to increasing cremation trends by packaging complimentary services and merchandise; 

&#8226; 

our ability to control salary, merchandise and other controllable costs; and 

&#8226; 

our ability to exercise pricing leverage related to our at-need business to increase average revenues per contract. 

Cemetery Operations. &#32;Cemeteries are primarily sales businesses that sell interment rights (grave sites and mausoleum spaces) and related merchandise, such as markers and outer burial containers. Cemetery revenues generated from at-need services and merchandise sales generally are subject to many of the same key profitability factors as our funeral home business. Our cemetery operating results are primarily affected by the following key factors: 

&#8226; 

size and success of our sales organization; 

&#8226; 

our ability to adapt to changes in the economy and consumer confidence; and 

&#8226; 

our response to fluctuations in capital markets and interest rates, which affect investment earnings on trust funds, finance charges on installment contracts and our securities portfolio within the trust funds. 

CURRENT YEAR DEVELOPMENTS 

Acquisitions. &#32;During 2015 , we acquired two funeral home businesses. We acquired a funeral home business in Clarksville, Tennessee in February 2015 and another funeral home business in Wake Forest, North Carolina in November 2015. The pro forma impact of the acquisitions on prior periods is not presented as the impact is not material to our reported results. The results of the acquired businesses are included in our results of operations from the date of acquisition. 

Construction of New Funeral Homes. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we completed the construction of and began operating three new funeral homes, two funeral homes in Texas and one funeral home in Florida. The funeral home constructed in Florida previously leased its facility and upon completion, moved operations to the newly constructed facility. 

Credit Facility. &#32;On May 20, 2015, we entered into a sixth amendment (the &#8220;Sixth Amendment&#8221;) to our secured bank credit facility with Bank of America, N.A. as administrative agent (the &#8220;Credit Agreement&#8221;), comprised of a $200 million revolving credit facility and a $125 million term loan (collectively, the &#8220;Credit Facility&#8221;). The Sixth Amendment provides that, among other things, we may repurchase our common stock so long as at the time of such repurchase there have been no defaults under the Credit Agreement, we have at least $15.0 million &#32;of unrestricted cash and undrawn borrowing capacity under the Credit Agreement and the senior leverage ratios is less than 3.25 &#32;to 1.00 . 

Subsequent Event. &#32;On February 9, 2016, we entered into a seventh amendment (the &#8220;Seventh Amendment&#8221;) to our Credit Facility. The Seventh Amendment resulted in, among other things, (i) reducing our LIBOR based variable interest rate 37.5 basis points, (ii) extending the maturity so that the Credit Agreement will mature at the earlier of (a) any date that is 91 days prior to the maturity of any subordinated debt (including the $143.75 million &#32;in principal amount of 2.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes issued on or about March 19, 2014 and due March 15, 2021 (the &#8220;Convertible Notes&#8221;) or (b) February 9, 2021, (iii) increasing and funding the term loan so that $150 million &#32;was outstanding upon the effectiveness of the Seventh Amendment, (iv) reducing the size of the revolver to $150 million , (v) increasing the accordion to $75 million &#32;and (vi) updating the amortization payments for the term loan facility so that the borrowings under the term loan facility are subject to amortization payments of $2.81 million &#32;at the end of each fiscal quarter beginning with the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2016 through the fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2017, $3.75 million &#32;at the end of each fiscal quarter beginning with the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2018 through the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2020 and $4.69 million &#32;at the end of each fiscal quarter beginning with the fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2020 through the fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2020. 

Share Repurchase Program. On May 19, 2015, our Board of Directors (the &#8220;Board&#8221;) approved a share repurchase program authorizing us to purchase up to an aggregate of $25.0 million &#32;of our common stock in accordance with Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;). On September 28, 2015, our Board authorized additional repurchases of $20.0 million &#32;of our common stock bringing the total authorized repurchase amount to $45.0 million . During 2015, we purchased 1,927,665 &#32;shares of our common stock for a total cost of $45.0 million , representing the entire authorized repurchase amount, at an average cost of $23.34 &#32;per share. Our shares were purchased in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. Purchases were at times and in amounts as management determined appropriate based on factors such as market conditions, legal requirements and other business considerations. Shares purchased pursuant to the repurchase program are currently held as treasury shares. 

Executive Leadership Changes. On May 21, 2015, L. William Heiligbrodt, as a result of his announced retirement as of March 4, 2016 from the Company, resigned as Executive Vice President, Principal Financial Officer and Secretary. Effective May 21, 2015, Carl B. Brink became the Company&#8217;s Principal Financial Officer and Viki K. Blinderman became the Company's Secretary. On August 4, 2015, the Board appointed Viki K. Blinderman and Carl B. Brink as Co-Chief Financial Officers. Ms. Blinderman also currently serves as the Company's Chief Accounting Officer, Principal Accounting Officer and Secretary and Mr. Brink currently serves as the Company's Treasurer. 

New Board Member. On September 28, 2015, our Board increased the total size of the Board from five to six members. On the same day, the Board elected Dr. Bryan Leibman to serve as a Class II Director until the 2016 annual meeting of shareholders. 

Capital. &#32;Our Board declared and paid four quarterly dividends of $0.025 &#32;per share. For our 2015 fiscal year, we paid approximately $1.8 million &#32;in dividends. 

DEATHCARE INDUSTRY 

Deathcare companies provide products and services to families in three principal areas: (i) ceremony and tribute, generally in the form of a funeral or memorial service; (ii) disposition of remains, either through burial or cremation; and (iii) memorialization, generally through monuments, markers or inscriptions. The deathcare industry in the United States is characterized by the following fundamental attributes (the statistics included in this Form 10-K are from reports compiled by Sundale Research, which are based on information from the U.S. Department of Commerce). 

Deaths and Death Rates 

During 2015, the number of deaths in the United States increased by approximately 1.9% following a 1.2% and a 2.1% increase in 2014 and 2013, respectively. The rapidly growing and aging population (more than half of the U.S. population will be over the age of 50 within five years), is expected to result in a considerable increase in the number of deaths, fueling growth in the funeral and cremation services and supplies industry. The number of Americans age 65 and over is expected to increase from 45.3 million in 2014 to 52.5 million in 2019, reflecting an average annual growth rate of 3.0%. Overall, the number of deaths in the United States is expected to increase by an average of 1.7% per year reaching an estimated 2.9 million in 2019. Beyond 2019, the annual death rate is projected to spike even more as older &#8220;Baby Boomers&#8221; start passing away. 

Burial and Cremation Rates 

While the number of deaths is expected to increase over the next few years, the burial rate is expected to continue to decline. In 2015, the number of burials in the United States decreased by an estimated 0.8%, following declines of 1.8% and 1.5% in 2014 and 2013, respectively. The number of burials in the United States is estimated to fall by an average of 1.5% per year through 2019, as the burial rate is expected to decrease by more than seven percentage points during this time. In 2015, the burial rate was estimated to be 51.6% and is estimated to fall to 45.2% in 2019. Nonetheless, the sheer volume of burials is expected to continue to outnumber cremations through 2016, before the burial rate drops below 50.0% during the 2017 to 2019 period. Even after burials no longer outnumber cremations, it is still estimated that there will be approximately 1.29 million burials in 2019. 

In 2015, the number of cremations in the United States increased by an estimated 4.9%, following increases of 4.8% and 6.8% in 2014 and 2013, respectively. Slower growth is expected through 2019, due in part to the sheer size of the market for cremations; however, shifting preferences will continue to lead to a considerable rise in cremations. The number of cremations in the United States is expected to grow by an average of 4.9% per year through 2019. In 2019, it is estimated that there will be approximately 1.57 million cremations in the United States and a cremation rate of 54.8%. There are several factors leading to the increase in the number of cremations in the United States including the money savings and convenience of cremations compared to a traditional burial. Additionally, cremation is being increasingly accepted as part of a package of funeral services that includes memorials, merchandise and options for the interment of cremated remains. Cemeteries are more affected by the increasing cremation trend than funeral homes. 

Highly Fragmented Ownership 

Our industry, after over 50 years of consolidation, remains highly fragmented, and succession planning issues have become more difficult and complex than ever. We believe Carriage offers a highly attractive succession planning option for owners who want their legacy family business to remain operationally prosperous in their local communities. We also believe that our decentralized operating framework will continue to attract some of the top, more entrepreneurial talent in our industry. 

The largest public operators, in terms of revenue, of both funeral homes and cemeteries in the United States are Service Corporation International (&#8220;SCI&#8221;), StoneMor Partners L.P. (&#8220;StoneMor&#8221;) and Carriage. We believe these three companies collectively represent approximately 20% of deathcare revenues in the United States. Independent businesses, along with a few privately owned consolidators, represent the remaining amount of industry revenue, accounting for an estimated 80% share. The top 50 deathcare companies account for about 25% of industry revenue. 

Heritage and Tradition 

Deathcare businesses have traditionally been family-owned businesses that have built a local heritage and tradition through successive generations, providing a foundation for ongoing business opportunities from established client family relationships and related referrals. Given the sensitive nature of our business, we believe that relationships fostered at the local level build trust in the community and are a key driver of market share. While new entrants may enter any given market, the time and resources required to develop local heritage and tradition serve as important barriers to entry. 

BUSINESS STRATEGY 

Our business strategy is based on strong, local leadership and entrepreneurial principles that we believe drive market share, revenue growth, and profitability in our local markets. We believe Carriage has the most innovative and transparent operating and reporting processes in the deathcare industry, which we are able to achieve through a decentralized, high-performance cultural operating framework linked with incentive compensation programs that attract top-quality industry talent at all levels. 

We are defined by our Mission Statement which states that &#8220;we are committed to being the most professional, ethical and highest quality funeral and cemetery service organization in our industry&#8221; and our Guiding Principles which state our core values, which are comprised of: 

&#8226; 

honesty, integrity and quality in all that we do; 

&#8226; 

hard work, pride of accomplishment and shared success through employee ownership; 

&#8226; 

belief in the power of people through individual initiative and teamwork; 

&#8226; 

outstanding service and profitability go hand-in-hand; and 

&#8226; 

growth of the Company is driven by decentralization and partnership. 

Our five Guiding Principles collectively embody our Being The Best &#32;high-performance cultural, operating framework. Our general operations and business strategy are built upon the execution of the following three models: 

&#8226; 

Standards Operating Model 

&#8226; 

4E Leadership Model; and 

&#8226; 

Strategic Acquisition Model. 

Standards Operating Model 

Our Standards Operating Model eliminated the use of financial budgets which freed up enormous amounts of time to focus and work on growing each local business de-centrally and improving the quality and skills of the staff. Instead of the budget and control model, our Standards Operating Model and the underlying standards which we refer to as &#8220; Being The Best, &#8221; focus on market share, people, and operating and financial metrics that drive long-term, sustainable revenue growth and earning power of our portfolio of businesses by employing leadership and entrepreneurial principles that fit the nature of our local, personal service, high-value business. Standards Achievement is the measure by which we judge the success of each business. Our Standards Operating Model align our financial incentives for Managing Partners of each business with 4E Leadership skills and their teams who consistently achieve a high level of standards. Our Standards Operating Model is not designed to produce maximum short-term earnings because Carriage does not believe such performance is sustainable and will ultimately stress the business, which very often leads to declining market share, revenues and earnings. Important elements of our Standards Operating Model include: 

&#8226; 

Balanced Operating Model &#8211; &#32;We believe a decentralized structure works best in the deathcare industry. Successful execution of our Standards Operating Model is highly dependent on strong local leadership, intelligent risk taking, entrepreneurial drive and corporate support aligned with the key drivers of a successful operation organized around three primary areas - market share, people and operating financial metrics. 

&#8226; 

Incentives Aligned with Standards &#8211; &#32;Empowering Managing Partners to do the right things in their operations and local communities, and providing appropriate support with operating and financial practices, will enable long-term growth and sustainable profitability. Each Managing Partner participates in a variable bonus plan whereby he or she earns a percentage of his or her respective business' earnings based upon the actual standards achieved as long as the performance exceeds our minimum standards. 

&#8226; 

The Right Local Leadership &#32;&#8211; Successful execution of our operating model is highly dependent on strong local leadership as defined by our 4E Leadership Model, intelligent risk taking and entrepreneurial empowerment. A Managing Partner&#8217;s performance is judged according to achievement of the standards for that business. 

&#160; 

4E Leadership Model 

Our 4E Leadership Model requires strong local leadership in each business to grow an entrepreneurial, decentralized, high-value, personal service and sales business at sustainable profit margins. Our 4E Leadership Model is based upon principles established by Jack Welch during his tenure at General Electric, and is based upon 4E qualities essential to succeed in a high-performance culture: Energy &#32;to get the job done; the ability to Energize &#32;others; the Edge &#32;necessary to make difficult decisions; and the ability to Execute &#32;and produce results. To achieve a high level of standards in a business year after year, we require &#8220;A Players&#8221; in charge that have the 4E Leadership skills to entrepreneurially grow the business by hiring, training and developing highly motivated and productive teams locally that produce results. 

Strategic Acquisition Model 

Our Standards Operating Model led to the development of our Strategic Acquisition Model, which guides our acquisition strategy. Both models, when executed effectively, will drive long-term, sustainable increases in market share, revenue and earnings and cash flow. We believe a primary driver of higher revenue and profits in the future will be the execution of our Strategic Acquisition Model using strategic ranking criteria to assess acquisition candidates. As we execute this strategy over time, we will acquire larger, higher margin strategic businesses. 

We have learned that the long-term growth or decline of a local branded deathcare business is reflected by several criteria that correlate strongly with five to ten year performance in volumes (market share), revenues and sustainable field-level earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (&#8220;EBITDA&#8221;) margins (a non-GAAP measure). We use the following criteria, to name a few, to rank the strategic position of each potential acquisition: 

&#8226; 

volume and price trends; 

&#8226; 

size of business; 

&#8226; 

size of market; 

&#8226; 

competitive standing; 

&#8226; 

demographics; 

&#8226; 

strength of brand; and 

&#8226; 

barriers to entry. 

The valuation of the acquisition candidate is then determined through the application of an appropriate after-tax cash return on investment that exceeds our cost of capital. 

Our belief in our Mission Statement and Guiding Principles that define us and proper execution of the three models that define our strategy have given us the competitive advantage in any market in which we compete. We believe that we can execute our three models without proportionate incremental investment in our consolidation platform infrastructure or additional fixed regional and corporate overhead. This competitive advantage is evidenced by the sustained earning power of our portfolio as defined by our EBITDA margin. Carriage&#8217;s deep understanding of each market landscape and our historical, successful competition in individual local markets more than reasonably ensures that we are promoting the interests of the consumer and supporting unfettered markets which, in turn, results in better pricing and more choices for the consumer. 

Other elements of our overall business strategy include the following: 

Enhancement of Funeral and Cremation Services. &#32;Personalization and pre-planning continue to be two of the most important trends in the funeral and cremation services and merchandise industry, but the move toward more cremations may be the most significant. This has been evident over the past several years, as the number of cremations rose at a considerable rate, while the number of deaths in the United States has been trending upward. Improving economic conditions and rising disposable incomes are leading to solid industry growth, as consumers are spending more on funeral and cremations services and merchandise. While this trend will likely continue through at least 2019, other factors will lead to rising industry revenues, including a steady increase in the number of deaths and more spending on additional or unique funeral and cremation services. The percentage of funeral services performed by our funeral homes for which cremation was chosen was 46.9% &#32;for the year ended December 31, 2013 , 47.3% &#32;for the year ended December 31, 2014 &#32;and 48.9% &#32;for the year ended December 31, 2015 . For the year ended December 31, 2015 , 65.8% &#32;of our total cremation services were direct cremations (where no memorial service or visitation is involved, although merchandise may be sold) and 34.2% &#32;included services, as compared to 67.0% &#32;and 33.0% , respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2014 . Shifting preferences will likely continue to lead to a considerable rise in cremations; as such, we are focused on increasing the percentage of our cremation customers that choose services. All of our funeral homes offer cremation products and services. While the average revenue for a cremation service is generally lower than that of an average traditional, full-service funeral, we have found that these revenues can be substantially enhanced by our emphasis on offering additional services and 

merchandise, including counseling referrals, video tributes, flowers, burial garments and memorial items such as urns, keepsake jewelry and other items that hold a portion of the cremated remains. 

Preneed Funeral Sales Program. &#32;We operate under a local, decentralized preneed sales strategy whereby each business location customizes its preneed program to its local needs. The performance of preneed funeral contracts is usually secured by placing the funds collected in trust for the benefit of the customer or by the purchase of a life insurance policy, the proceeds of which will pay for such services at the time of need. Insurance-funded contracts allow us to earn commission income to improve our near-term cash flow and offset a significant amount of the up-front costs associated with preneed sales. Trust funded contracts typically provide cash that is invested in various securities with the expectation that returns will exceed the growth factor in the insurance contracts. The cash flow and earnings from insurance contracts are more stable, but are generally lower than traditional trust fund investments. In markets that depend on preneed sales for market share, we supplement the arrangements written by funeral directors with sales sourced by sales counselors and third party sellers. 

Preneed Cemetery Sales Program. &#32;A significant portion of our historical cemetery revenues are represented by sales of cemetery property sold by our sales professionals on a preneed basis. General consumer confidence and discretionary income have a significant impact on our preneed sales success rate. In 2015 , our preneed cemetery sales increased 13.3% &#32;compared to 2014 . 

OUR STRENGTHS 

Market Leader. &#32;Our operations are located in principally suburban and rural markets, where we primarily compete with smaller, independent operators. We focus on markets that perform better than the industry average and are generally insulated from economic and demographic changes. 

High Performance, Decentralized, Partnership Culture. &#32;Our funeral homes and cemeteries are managed by Managing Partners, individuals with extensive deathcare experience, often within their local markets. Our Managing Partners have responsibility for day-to-day operations, but are required to follow operating and financial standards based on our Standards Operating Model that are custom designed for each of four business groupings. This strategy allows each local business to maintain its unique identity within its local market and to capitalize on its reputation and heritage while our senior management maintains supervisory controls and provides support services from our corporate headquarters. We believe our culture is very attractive to owners of premier independent businesses that fit our profile of suitable acquisition candidates. 

Flexible Capital Structure. &#32;We have no near-term debt maturity issues. We believe that our capital structure provides us with financial flexibility by allowing us to invest our cash flow in growth opportunities, such as business acquisitions and cemetery inventory projects. For additional information regarding our capital structure, please see Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Liquidity and Capital Resources. 

Stable Cash Flow. &#32;We have demonstrated the ability to generate strong and stable cash flow. Cash flow from operations for 2015 &#32;totaled $49.9 million , which was used primarily for the construction of three new funeral homes, two business acquisitions and our working capital needs. Our adjusted free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operations, adjusted by special items as deemed necessary, less cash for maintenance capital expenditures totaled $43.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 . Going forward, we intend to use our cash flow to acquire funeral home and cemetery businesses and to fund internal growth projects, such as cemetery inventory development. Our growth strategy is the primary way we expect to increase stockholder value. While we reassess our capital allocation strategy annually, we currently believe that our financial goals will best be achieved by continuing to improve the operating and financial performance of our existing portfolio of businesses while selectively investing our net cash flow in growth opportunities that generate a return on invested capital in excess of our weighted average cost of capital. 

Strong Field-Level Gross Profit Margins. &#32;We believe that we have strong field-level gross profit margins and that this performance is a testament to the success of our business strategies. Our strong margins and the ability to control costs are important advantages in a business such as ours that is characterized by a high fixed-cost structure. We will continue to seek ways to improve our financial performance, and we believe that our Standards Operating Model will continue to yield long-term improvement in our financial results. 

Effective Execution of Funeral Preneed Sales. &#32;We believe our local, decentralized strategy allows us to adapt our preneed sales selectively to best address the competitive situation in our particular markets. In highly competitive markets, we execute a more aggressive preneed sales program. In less competitive markets where we have a strong market position, we deploy a more passive preneed sales program. In certain of our markets, we do not deploy a formal preneed program. This approach allows us to target the investment in preneed sales to markets where we have the opportunity to reinforce our market share. Since approximately 80% &#32;of our funeral revenues are generated from at-need sales, we retain significant pricing leverage in our funeral business without having to rely on preneed sales. 

Integrated Information Systems. &#32;We have implemented information systems to support local business decisions and to monitor performance of our businesses compared to financial and performance standards. All of our funeral homes and cemeteries are connected to our corporate headquarters, which allows us to monitor and assess critical operating and financial data and analyze the performance of individual locations on a timely basis. Furthermore, our information system infrastructure provides senior management with a critical tool for monitoring and adhering to our established internal controls, which is critical given our decentralized model and the sensitive nature of our business operations. 

Proven Leadership Team. &#32;Our leadership team is comprised of nine members which we refer to as our Operations and Strategic Growth Leadership Team (&#8220;OSGLT&#8221;), headed by our founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Melvin C. Payne and our President and Vice Chairman of the Board, David J. DeCarlo. The team is also comprised of seven leaders of our operations, accounting, legal, tax, human resources and treasury departments and is characterized by a dynamic culture that focuses on addressing changing market conditions and emerging trends in the funeral services industry. We believe our culture emphasizing the 4Es (Energy, Energize Others, Edge and Execution) leadership characteristics is critical and will provide an important advantage as the deathcare industry evolves. We are committed to continue operating an efficient corporate organization and strengthening our corporate and local business leadership. Our businesses are organized into three regions, each headed by a Regional Partner who is a member of the OSGLT. This promotes more cooperation and synergy between our funeral and cemetery operations and supports the goal of market-share and volume growth in our most significant markets. 

OPERATIONS 

We conduct our funeral and cemetery operations only in the United States. Our operations are reported in two segments: funeral operations and cemetery operations. Information for each of our segments is presented below and in our financial statements set forth herein. 

Funeral Home Operations 

At December 31, 2015 , we operated 167 &#32;funeral homes in 27 &#32;states. Funeral home revenues currently account for approximately 77% &#32;of our total revenues. The funeral home operations are managed by a team of experienced deathcare industry professionals and selected region-level individuals with substantial management experience in our industry. See Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 21 for segment data related to our funeral home operations. 

Our funeral homes offer a complete range of services to meet a family&#8217;s deathcare needs, including consultation, the removal and preparation of remains, the sale of caskets and related funeral merchandise, the use of funeral home facilities for visitation and services and transportation services. Most of our funeral homes have a non-denominational chapel on the premises, which permits family visitation and services to take place at one location and thereby reduces transportation costs and inconvenience to the family. 

Funeral homes are principally service businesses that provide burial and cremation services and sell related merchandise, such as caskets and urns. The sources and availability of caskets and urns are from a small number of national providers that have distribution centers near our businesses. We typically order and receive the merchandise within twenty-four hours. Given the high fixed-cost structure associated with funeral home operations, we believe the following are key factors affecting our profitability: 

&#8226; 

demographic trends in terms of population growth and average age, which impact death rates and number of deaths; 

&#8226; 

establishing and maintaining leading market share positions supported by strong local heritage and relationships; 

&#8226; 

effectively responding to increasing cremation trends by packaging complementary services and merchandise; 

&#8226; 

controlling salary, merchandise and other controllable costs; and 

&#8226; 

increasing average revenues per contract. 

Cemetery Operations 

As of December 31, 2015 , we operated 32 &#32;cemeteries in 11 &#32;states. Cemetery revenues currently account for approximately 23% &#32;of our total revenues. The cemetery operations are managed by a team of experienced deathcare industry and sales professionals. See Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 21 for segment data related to our cemetery operations. 

Our cemetery products and services include interment services, the rights to interment in cemetery sites (primarily grave sites, mausoleum crypts and niches) and related cemetery merchandise, such as memorials and vaults. Cemetery operations generate 

revenues through sales of interment rights and memorials, installation fees, fees for interment and cremation memorialization products, finance charges from installment sales contracts and investment income from preneed cemetery merchandise trusts and perpetual care trusts. 

Cemetery revenues generated from at-need services and merchandise sales generally are subject to many of the same key profitability factors as our funeral home business. Our cemetery operating results are affected by the following key factors: 

&#8226; 

size and success of our sales organization; 

&#8226; 

our ability to adapt to changes in the economy and consumer confidence; and 

&#8226; 

our response to fluctuations in capital markets and interest rates which affect investment earnings on trust funds, finance charges on installment contracts and our securities portfolio within the trust funds. 

Preneed Programs 

We market funeral and cemetery services and products on a preneed basis at the local, business level. Preneed funeral or cemetery contracts enable families to establish, in advance, the type of service to be performed, the products to be used and the cost of such products and services. Preneed contracts permit families to eliminate issues of making deathcare plans at the time of need and allow input from other family members before the death occurs. We guarantee the price and performance of the preneed contracts to the customer. 

Preneed funeral contracts are usually paid on an installment basis. The performance of preneed funeral contracts is usually secured by placing the funds collected in trust for the benefit of the customer or by the purchase of a life insurance policy, the proceeds of which will pay for such services at the time of need. These methods are intended to fund preneed funeral contracts, cover the original contract price and generally include an element of growth (earnings) designed to offset future inflationary cost increases. Revenue from preneed funeral contracts, along with accumulated earnings, is not recognized until the time the funeral service is performed. The accumulated earnings from the trust investments and insurance policies are intended to offset the inflation in funeral prices. Additionally, we generally earn a commission from the insurance company from the sale of insurance-funded policies reflected as Preneed Insurance Commission within Funeral Revenues . The commission income is recognized as revenue when the period of refund expires (generally one year), which helps us defray the costs we incur to originate the preneed contract (primarily commissions we pay to our sales counselors). 

In addition to preneed funeral contracts, we also offer &#8220;pre-planned&#8221; funeral arrangements whereby a client determines in advance substantially all of the details of a funeral service without any financial commitment or other obligation on the part of the client until the actual time of need. Pre-planned funeral arrangements permit a family to avoid issues of making deathcare plans at the time of need and enable a funeral home to establish relationships with a client that may eventually lead to an at-need sale. 

Preneed sales of cemetery interment rights are usually financed through interest-bearing installment sales contracts, generally with terms of up to five years with such earnings reflected as Preneed Cemetery Finance Charges within Revenues from cemetery operations . In substantially all cases, we receive an initial down payment at the time the contract is signed. Preneed sales of cemetery interment rights are recorded as revenue when 10% &#32;of the contract amount related to the interment right has been collected. Merchandise and services may similarly be sold on an installment basis, but revenue is recorded when delivery has occurred. Allowances for bad debts and customer cancellations are recorded at the date that the contract is executed and periodically evaluated thereafter based upon historical experience. 

We sold 6,940 &#32;and 7,797 &#32;preneed funeral contracts, net of cancellations, during the years ended December 31, 2014 &#32;and 2015 , respectively. At December 31, 2015 , we had a backlog of 84,353 &#32;preneed funeral contracts and 63,178 &#32;preneed cemetery contracts to be delivered in the future. Approximately 19% &#32;of our funeral contract volumes during the years ended December 31, 2014 &#32;and 2015 &#32;originated through preneed contracts. Cemetery revenues that originated from preneed contracts represented approximately 49% &#32;of our net cemetery revenues for 2014 &#32;and 2015 . 

At December 31, 2015 , we employed a staff of 183 &#32;advance-planning and family service representatives for the sale of preneed products and services. Our advance-planning and family service representatives primarily assist families in making at-need and pre-need funeral, memorialization and cemetery arrangements through the selection and purchase of cemetery property, merchandise and services and ensuring that the expectations of our client families and their guests are exceeded. 

Trust Funds and Insurance Contracts 

We have established a variety of trusts in connection with funeral home and cemetery operations as required under applicable state laws. Such trusts include (i) preneed funeral trusts; (ii) preneed cemetery merchandise and service trusts; and (iii) cemetery perpetual care trusts. These trusts are typically administered by independent financial institutions selected by us. Investment management and advisory services are provided either by our wholly-owned registered investment advisory firm, CSV RIA, or by independent financial advisors. At December 31, 2015 , CSV RIA provided these services to two &#32;institutions, which have custody of 79% &#32;of our trust assets, for a fee based on the market value of trust assets. 

Preneed funeral sales generally require deposits to a trust or purchase of a third-party insurance product. Trust fund income earned and the receipt and recognition of any insurance benefits are deferred until the service is performed. Trust fund holdings and deferred revenue are reflected on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, while the insurance contracts are not on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. In most states, we are not permitted to withdraw principal or investment income from such trusts until the funeral service is performed. Some states, however, allow for the retention of a percentage (generally 10%) of the receipts to offset any administrative and selling expenses. The aggregate balance of our preneed funeral contracts held in trust, insurance contracts and receivables from preneed trusts was approximately $423.1 million &#32;as of December 31, 2015 . 

We are generally required under applicable state laws to deposit a specified amount (which varies from state to state, generally 50% to 100% of the selling price) into a merchandise and service trust fund for preneed cemetery merchandise and services sales. The related trust fund income earned is recognized when the related merchandise and services are delivered. We are generally permitted to withdraw the trust principal and accrued income when the merchandise is actually delivered, when the service is provided or when the contract is canceled. However, certain states allow the withdrawal of income prior to delivery when the regulations identify excess earnings in the trusts. We were able to withdraw $0.6 million &#32;in trust income prior to delivery in those states in 2014 . We did not withdraw any trust income in 2015 . Cemetery merchandise and service trust fund balances totaled approximately $63.3 million &#32;as of December 31, 2015 . 

In most states, regulations require a portion (generally 10%) of the sale amount of cemetery property and memorials to be placed in a perpetual care trust. The income from these perpetual care trusts provides funds necessary to maintain cemetery property and memorials in perpetuity. This trust fund income is recognized, as earned, in Revenues from cemetery operations . While we are entitled to withdraw the income from perpetual care trusts to provide for maintenance of cemetery property and memorials, we are restricted from withdrawing any of the principal balances of the trust fund. Perpetual care trust balances totaled approximately $43.1 million &#32;at December 31, 2015 .

SEASONALITY 

Our business can be affected by seasonal fluctuations in the death rate. Generally, the number of deaths is higher during the winter months because the incidences of death from influenza and pneumonia are higher during this period than other periods of the year. 

COMPETITION 

The operating environment in the deathcare industry has been highly competitive. Publicly traded companies operating in the United States include SCI, StoneMor and Carriage. In addition, a number of smaller private consolidators have been active in acquiring and operating funeral homes and cemeteries. 

Our funeral home and cemetery operations face competition in the markets that they serve. Our primary competition in most of our markets is from local independent operators. We have observed new start-up competition in certain areas of the country, which in any one market may have impacted our profitability because of the high fixed cost nature of funeral homes. Market share for funeral homes and cemeteries is largely a function of reputation and heritage, although competitive pricing, professional service and attractive, well-maintained and conveniently located facilities are also important. Because of the importance of reputation and heritage, market share increases are usually gained over a long period of time. The sale of preneed funeral services and cemetery property has increasingly been used by many companies as a marketing tool to build market share. 

There has been increasing competition from providers specializing in specific services, such as cremations, who offer minimal service and low-end pricing. We also face competition from companies that market products and related merchandise over the Internet and non-traditional casket stores in certain markets. These competitors have been successful in capturing a portion of the low-end market and product sales. 

REGULATION 

General. &#32;Our operations are subject to regulations, supervision and licensing under numerous federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, including extensive regulations concerning trust funds, preneed sales of funeral and cemetery products and services and various other aspects of our business. We believe that we comply in all material respects with the provisions of these laws, ordinances and regulations. 

Federal Trade Commission. &#32;Our funeral home operations are comprehensively regulated by the Federal Trade Commission (&#8220;FTC&#8221;) under Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act and a trade regulation rule for the funeral industry promulgated thereunder referred to as the &#8220;Funeral Rule.&#8221; The Funeral Rule defines certain acts or practices as unfair or deceptive and contains certain requirements to prevent these acts or practices. The preventive measures require a funeral provider to give consumers accurate, itemized pricing information and various other disclosures about funeral goods and services and prohibit a funeral provider from: (i) misrepresenting legal, crematory and cemetery requirements; (ii) embalming for a fee without permission; (iii) requiring the purchase of a casket for direct cremation; (iv) requiring consumers to buy certain funeral goods or services as condition for furnishing other funeral goods or services; (v) misrepresenting state and local requirements for an outer burial container; and (vi) representing that funeral goods and services have preservative and protective value. Additionally, the Funeral Rule requires the disclosure of mark-ups, commissions, additional charges and rebates related to cash advance items. 

Environmental. &#32;Our operations are also subject to stringent federal, regional, state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including legal requirements governing air emissions, waste management and disposal and wastewater discharges. For instance, the federal Clean Air Act and analogous state laws, which restrict the emission of pollutants from many sources, including crematories, may require us to apply for and obtain air emissions permits, install costly emissions control equipment, and conduct monitoring and reporting tasks. Also, in the course of our operations, we store and use chemicals and other regulated substances as well as generate wastes that may subject us to strict liability under the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and comparable state laws, which govern the treatment, storage, and disposal of nonhazardous and hazardous wastes, and the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, a remedial statute that imposes cleanup obligations on current and past owners or operators of facilities where hazardous substance releases occurred and anyone who transported or disposed or arranged for the transportation or disposal of hazardous substances released into the environment from such sites. In addition, the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, also known as the federal Clean Water Act, and analogous state laws regulate discharges of pollutants to state and federal waters. Underground and aboveground storage tanks that store chemicals and fuels for vehicle maintenance or general operations are located at certain of our facilities and any spills or releases from those facilities may cause us to incur remedial liabilities under the Clean Water Act or analogous state laws as well as potential liabilities for damages to properties or persons. Failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations could result in the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil, and criminal penalties, the imposition of investigatory, remedial and corrective action obligations, delays in permitting or performance of projects and the issuance of injunctions restricting or prohibiting some or all of our activities in affected areas. Moreover, accidental releases or spills may occur in the course of our operations, and we cannot assure you that we will not incur significant costs and liabilities as a result of such releases or spills, including any third party claims for damages to property, natural resources or persons. Also, it is possible that implementation of stricter environmental laws and regulations or more stringent enforcement of existing environmental requirements could result in additional, currently unidentifiable costs or liabilities to us, such as requirements to purchase pollution control equipment or implement operational changes or improvements. While we believe we are in substantial compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations, we cannot assure you that we will not incur substantial costs in the future. 

Worker Health and Safety . We are subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, as amended (&#8220;OSHA&#8221;), and comparable state statutes whose purpose is to protect the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standard, the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act and implementing regulations and similar state statutes and regulations require that we organize and/or disclose information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local governmental authorities and citizens. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations relating to worker health and safety. 

EMPLOYEES 

As of December 31, 2015 , we and our subsidiaries employed 2,317 &#32;employees, of whom 1041 &#32;were full-time and 1,276 &#32;were part-time. All of our funeral directors and embalmers possess licenses required by applicable regulatory agencies. We believe that we maintain a good relationship with our employees. None of our employees are represented by unions.
