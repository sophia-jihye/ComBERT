 Item 1. Business 

BUSINESS OVERVIEW 

HTA, a Maryland corporation, and HTALP, a Delaware limited partnership, were incorporated or formed, as applicable, on April 20, 2006 . 

HTA is a REIT and one of the leading owners and operators of medical office buildings (&#8220;MOBs&#8221;) located in key markets in the United States (&#8220;U.S.&#8221;). Our primary objective is to generate stockholder value through consistent and growing dividends and appreciation of real estate value. The Company has invested $3.6 billion &#32;to form a high quality portfolio of MOBs and other healthcare real estate assets located in core, critical locations in key markets throughout the U.S. 

We invest in MOBs that we believe are core, critical to the delivery of healthcare in this changing environment. Healthcare is the fastest growing segment of the U.S. economy, with an expected average growth rate of 6.0% between 2015 and 2024, with overall spending expected to increase to 19.6% of GDP by 2024 according to the U.S. Centers for Medicare &#38; Medicaid Services. Similarly, healthcare is experiencing the fastest employment growth in the U.S., a trend that is expected to continue over the next decade. These high levels of demand are driven by the aging U.S. population and the long-term impact of the Affordable Care Act of 2010 (the &#8220;Affordable Care Act&#8221;). As demand increases, healthcare services are increasingly being provided in the lower cost and more convenient outpatient settings, such as MOBs. As a result, HTA believes that well located MOBs will provide stable cash flows with relatively low vacancy risk, while allowing for potentially higher returns through their exposure to the fast growing healthcare sector. &#32; 

As of December 31, 2015 , our portfolio consisted of approximately 15.5 million &#32;square feet of gross leasable area (&#8220;GLA&#8221;). Approximately 97% &#32;of our portfolio, based on GLA, is located on the campuses of, or aligned with, nationally or regionally recognized healthcare systems. We believe these key locations and affiliations create significant demand from healthcare related tenants for our properties. Further, our portfolio is primarily concentrated within major U.S. metropolitan areas that we believe will grow economically and demographically over the coming years, with over 91% &#32;of our investment located in key markets that are among the 75 largest in the U.S. as measured by population. &#32; 

Effective December 15, 2014 , HTA completed a reverse stock split (the &#8220;Reverse Stock Split&#8221;) of its common stock. As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, every two issued and outstanding shares of common stock were converted into one share of common stock. HTA&#8217;s par value and shares authorized remained unchanged. Concurrently with the Reverse Stock Split, HTALP effected a corresponding Reverse Stock Split of its outstanding units of limited partnership interests. The weighted average shares/units outstanding and per share/unit amounts for all periods prior to 2015 have been adjusted retroactively to reflect the Reverse Stock Split. 

Our principal executive office is located at 16435 North Scottsdale Road, Suite 320, Scottsdale, AZ 85254, and our telephone number is (480) 998-3478. We maintain a website at www.htareit.com at which you may find additional information about us. The contents of the site are not incorporated by reference in, or otherwise a part of this filing. We make our periodic and current reports, as well as any amendments to such reports, available at www.htareit.com as soon as reasonably practicable after such materials are electronically filed with the SEC. These reports are also available in hard copy to any stockholder upon request.

&#8226; 

Part of our investment strategy also includes recycling assets that are now considered non-core or are located outside our key markets. During 2015 , we completed dispositions of six &#32;MOBs for an aggregate gross sales price of $35.7 million . 

&#8226; 

As of December 31, 2015 , we had total liquidity of $639.6 million , including cash and cash equivalents of $13.1 million &#32;and $626.5 million &#32;available on our unsecured revolving credit facility (includes the impact of $5.5 million &#32;of outstanding letters of credit). 

BUSINESS STRATEGIES 

Corporate Strategies 

Invest in and Maintain a Portfolio of Properties that are in the Most Valuable Locations for Healthcare Delivery 

The Company is focused on building and maintaining a portfolio consisting primarily of MOBs which allow for the efficient delivery of healthcare over the long-term. We believe that these types of properties which are located in key markets should increase the Company&#8217;s total enterprise value. To date, we have invested over $3.6 billion &#32;to create one of the largest portfolios of healthcare real estate focused on the MOB sector in the U.S. As a result, we look to allocate capital to properties that exhibit the following key attributes: 

&#8226; 

Located on the campuses of, or aligned with, nationally and regionally recognized healthcare systems in the U.S . We seek to invest in properties serving healthcare systems with dominant market share, high credit quality and those who are investing capital into their campuses. We believe our affiliations with these health systems help ensure long-term tenant demand. At December 31, 2015 , 97% &#32;of our portfolio was located on the campuses of, or aligned with, nationally and regionally recognized healthcare systems. 

&#8226; 

Attractive markets where we can maximize efficiencies through our asset management and leasing platform . We seek to own MOBs in primary and secondary markets with attractive demographics, economic growth and high barriers to entry. We have developed a strong presence across 15 to 20 key markets over the last nine years. In each of these markets we have established a strong asset management and leasing platform that has allowed us to develop valuable relationships with health systems, physician practices, universities and regional development firms that have led to investment and leasing opportunities. Our local platforms have also enabled us to focus on generating cost efficiencies as we gain scale across individual markets. As of December 31, 2015 , we have approximately 700,000 &#32;to 1.0 million &#32;square feet of GLA in each of our top ten markets and 91% &#32;of our GLA is located in the Top 75 metropolitan statistical areas (&#8220;MSAs&#8221;). We expect to establish this scale across 20 to 25 key markets as our portfolio expands. 

&#8226; 

Occupied with limited near term leasing risks . We seek to invest in and maintain well occupied properties that we believe are core, critical to the delivery of healthcare. We believe this in turn creates significant tenant demand for occupancy and also drives strong, long-term tenant retention as hospitals and physicians are reluctant to move or relocate, as evidenced by our 2015 &#32;Same-Property portfolio tenant retention rate of 80% . Further, we do not have an active development platform that seeks to invest in higher risk, lease-up opportunities. 

&#8226; 

Credit-worthy tenants . Our primary tenants are healthcare systems, academic medical centers and leading physician groups. These groups typically have strong and stable financial performance. We believe this helps ensure stability in our rental income and tenant retention over time. At December 31, 2015 , 61% &#32;of our annual base rent comes from credit-rated tenants, primarily health systems. A significant amount of our remaining rent comes from physician groups and medical healthcare system tenants that are credit-worthy, but do not have the size to benefit from a credit rating. 

&#8226; 

Balanced mix of tenants . Our primary focus is placed on ensuring an appropriate and balanced mix of tenants to provide synergies within both individual buildings and the broader health system campus. We actively invest in both multi-tenant properties, which generally have shorter term leases on smaller spaces, and single-tenant properties, which generally have longer term leases. The multi-tenant buildings provide for lower lease rollover risks in any particular year and regularly allow for rents to be reset to current market rates. We believe single-tenant buildings provide for steady long-term cash flow, but generally provide for more limited long-term growth. 

Maximize Internal Growth through Proactive Asset Management, Leasing and Property Management Oversight &#32; 

Our internal asset management team operates 94% &#32;of our total portfolio, a significant increase from 30% &#32;five years ago. We believe this direct approach allows us to maximize our internal growth by improving occupancy and operating efficiencies at our properties and optimizing rental rates. Specific components of our overall strategy include: 

&#8226; 

Maintaining regional offices in markets where we have a significant presence. This enables our in-house property management and leasing platform to (i) create close relationships with national and regional healthcare systems and other tenants and (ii) respond more directly and efficiently to their needs. HTA has five regional asset management headquarters, including its corporate headquarters in Scottsdale, Arizona. Our regional asset management headquarters are located in Albany, Atlanta, Charleston and Indianapolis. We have an additional 20 regional management offices located strategically in key markets across the U.S. 

&#8226; 

Improving the quality of service provided to our tenants by being attentive to their needs, managing expenses and strategically investing capital. During 2015 , we consistently achieved tenant retention for the Same-Property portfolio of 75% &#32;or more each quarter and tenant retention for the Same-Property portfolio for the year of 80% . 

&#8226; 

Using market knowledge and economies of scale to seek to continually reduce our operating costs. 

&#8226; 

Maintaining or increasing our average rental rates, actively leasing our vacant space and reducing leasing concessions. These leasing results contributed to our 3.0% or more Same-Property Cash NOI growth each quarter during 2015 . For additional information on Same-Property Cash NOI, see Item 7 - Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, which includes a reconciliation to net income and an explanation of why we present this non-GAAP financial measure. 

&#8226; 

Maintaining a core, critical portfolio of properties and building our reputation as a dedicated leading MOB owner and operator. 

Achieve External Growth through Targeted Investments 

We plan to grow externally through targeted investments that improve the quality of our portfolio and are accretive to our cost of capital. To achieve this growth in competitive markets, we seek: 

&#8226; 

Mid-sized investments in the $25 million to $75 million range. These transactions allow us to focus on the quality of individual properties and ensure they are accretive to our cost of capital. They also allow us to exhibit meaningful growth given our current mid-market size. 

&#8226; 

Long-term relationships with key industry participants. We will continue our emphasis on long-term relationship building as we have over the last nine years. These relationships are cultivated by our senior management team, with key industry participants, including health systems and local and regional developers, which have traditionally provided us with valuable sources of potential investment opportunities. 

&#8226; 

Local knowledge through our internal asset management platform. Our local personnel are participants in local industry activities which can provide insightful information with respect to potential opportunities. 

Actively Maintain Conservative Capital Structure 

We seek to actively manage our balance sheet to maintain our investment grade credit rating, to maintain conservative leverage and to preserve financing flexibility. This positioning will allow us to take advantage of strategic investment opportunities. In addition, we may also pursue dispositions of properties that we believe no longer align with our strategic objectives in order to redeploy capital. The strength of our balance sheet is demonstrated by our investment grade credit ratings. To maintain our strong and conservative balance sheet, we: 

&#8226; 

Continue to maintain a high level of liquidity. As of December 31, 2015 , we had $626.5 million &#32;available on our unsecured revolving credit facility. 

&#8226; 

Maintain access to multiple sources of capital, including public debt and equity, unsecured bank loans and secured property level debt. 

&#8226; 

Limit the amount of secured debt. During 2015 , the percentage of secured debt, including net premiums/discounts and deferred financing costs to capitalization, decreased to 6% &#32;from 9% &#32;in 2014. 

&#8226; 

Maintain a low leverage ratio. Our leverage ratio of debt to capitalization was 31.4% &#32;as of December 31, 2015 . 

&#8226; 

Maintain well laddered debt maturities. As of December 31, 2015 , we had $52.8 million , $116.6 million , and $14.4 million &#32;of debt principal payments due in 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively. 

&#8226; 

As of December 31, 2015 , the weighted average remaining term of our debt portfolio was 4.8 &#32;years, including extension options. During 2015, we lowered the average interest rate on our debt portfolio to 3.30% &#32;per annum, including the impact of interest rate swaps. 

HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY 

Healthcare Sector Growth 

We operate in the healthcare industry which we believe is benefiting from several significant macroeconomic events, including an aging population and the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. These trends are driving growth in healthcare spending at a rate significantly faster than the broader U.S. economy. 

The U.S. population is experiencing a significant aging of its population, as advancements in medical technology and changes in treatment methods enable people to live longer. This is expected to drive healthcare utilization higher as individuals consume more healthcare as they get older. Between 2015 and 2025, the U.S. population over 65 years of age is projected to increase by more than 38% and total almost 19% of the U.S. population as the baby boomer generation enters retirement. Individuals of this age spend the highest amounts on healthcare, averaging over $5,800 per individual over the age of 65 according to 2014 Consumer Expenditure Survey. This compares to healthcare expenditures of less than $1,600 per year for individuals under the age of 30. The older population group will increasingly require treatment and management of chronic and acute health ailments. We believe much of this increased care will take place in lower cost outpatient settings, which will continue to support MOB demand in the long term. 

Source: U.S. Census 2014 National Population Projections. 

The Affordable Care Act is a broad-based initiative that is expanding health insurance coverage for many Americans, further increasing the number of people who are able to utilize medical services. The Congressional Budget Office estimates an additional 25 million individuals will gain access to insurance coverage by 2017 as a result of this reform. As of Week 10 in the 2015-2016 enrollment period, an additional 8.7 million individuals had enrolled to receive coverage through the health insurance marketplaces. The Affordable Care Act&#8217;s focus on preventative care is also expected to increase the utilization of outpatient care into the future. 

Source: Congressional Budget Office - Insurance Coverage Provisions of the Affordable Care Act. 

Employment in the healthcare industry has steadily increased for at least 20 years despite three recessions. Healthcare-related jobs are among the fastest growing occupations, projected to increase by 19% between 2014 and 2024, significantly higher than the general U.S. employment growth projection of 7%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Additionally, the Bureau of Labor Statistics projects nine out of the top twelve occupations with the highest growth for workers will be in the healthcare sector. We expect the increased growth in the healthcare industry will correspond with a growth in demand for MOBs and other facilities that serve the healthcare industry. 

Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics. 

According to the latest data from 2014, Americas spent nearly $3.0 trillion, or 17.5% of total GDP, on healthcare expenditures, an increase of 5.3% from the previous year. The U.S. Centers for Medicare &#38; Medicaid Services project that total healthcare expenditures will reach approximately $5.4 trillion by 2024. Healthcare expenditures are projected to grow an average 6.0% annually through 2024 and account for 19.6% of GDP by 2024. This growth in healthcare expenditures reflects the increasing demand for healthcare. It is also driving demand for cost effective care which generally takes place in outpatient settings such as MOBs. 

Source: U.S. Centers for Medicare &#38; Medicaid Services. 

Medical Office Building Supply and Demand 

We believe that healthcare real estate, specifically MOBs, rents and valuations are less susceptible to changes in the general economy than general commercial real estate due to macroeconomic trends supporting the healthcare sector and the defensive nature of healthcare expenditures during economic downturns. For this reason, we believe MOB investments could potentially offer a more stable return to investors compared to other types of real estate investments. We also believe that demand for MOBs will increase due to a number of MOB specific factors, including: 

&#8226; 

Evolution in the healthcare industry whereby procedures that have traditionally been performed in hospitals, such as surgery, move to outpatient facilities as a result of shifting consumer preferences, limited space in hospitals, and lower costs. In addition, increased specialization within the medical field is driving the demand for MOBs suited specifically toward a particular specialty. 

&#8226; 

An increase in medical office visits due to the overall rise in healthcare utilization has in turn driven hiring within the healthcare sector. Additionally, the rate of employment growth in physicians&#8217; offices and outpatient care facilities has outpaced employment growth in hospitals during the past decade, further supporting the trend of increased utilization of healthcare services outside of the hospital. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, employment in physicians&#8217; offices is expected to increase by a cumulative 30.5% from 2014 to 2024 compared to a projected increase of 6.5% in total employment during this period. 

&#8226; 

High and improving credit quality of physician tenants. In recent years, MOB tenants have increasingly consisted of larger hospital and physician groups. These groups utilize their size and expertise to obtain high rates of reimbursement and share overhead operating expenses. We believe these larger groups are generally credit-worthy and provide stability and long term value for MOBs. 

&#8226; 

Construction of MOBs has been relatively constrained over the last five years, with high cost barriers to development in markets in which we invest.

PORTFOLIO OF PROPERTIES 

As of December 31, 2015 , our portfolio consisted of approximately 15.5 million &#32;square feet of GLA, with a leased rate of 92.0% &#32;(includes leases which have been executed, but which have not yet commenced). 

Our properties were primarily located on the campuses of, or aligned with, nationally and regionally recognized healthcare systems in the U.S. These include leading health systems such as Highmark-Allegheny Health Network, Greenville Hospital System, Tufts Medical Center, Hospital Corporation of America, Community Health Systems and Steward Health Care System. As of December 31, 2015 , 97% &#32;of our portfolio, based on GLA, was located on the campuses of, or aligned with, nationally and regionally recognized healthcare systems.

COMPETITION 

We compete with many other real estate investment entities, including financial institutions, pension funds, real estate developers, other REITs, other public and private real estate companies, and private real estate investors for the acquisition of MOBs and other facilities that serve the healthcare industry. During the acquisition process, we compete with others who may have a competitive advantage in terms of size, capitalization, local knowledge of the marketplace and extended contacts throughout the region. Any combination of these factors may result in an increased purchase price for properties or other real estate related assets of interest to us, which may reduce the number of opportunities available to us that meet our investment criteria. If the number of opportunities that meet our investment criteria are limited, our ability to increase stockholder value may be adversely impacted. 

We face competition in leasing available MOBs and other facilities that serve the healthcare industry to prospective tenants. As a result, we may have to provide rent concessions, incur charges for tenant improvements, offer other inducements, or we may be unable to timely lease vacant space in our properties, all of which may have an adverse impact on our results of operations. At the time we elect to dispose of our properties, we will also be in competition with sellers of similar properties to locate suitable purchase opportunities. 

We believe our focus on MOBs, our experience and expertise and our ongoing relationships with healthcare providers provide us with a competitive advantage. We have established an asset identification and acquisition network with healthcare providers and local developers, which provides for the early identification of and access to acquisition opportunities. In addition, we believe this broad network allows us to effectively lease available space, retain our tenants and maintain and improve our assets. 

GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS 

Healthcare-Related Regulations 

Overview. The healthcare industry is heavily regulated by federal, state and local governmental agencies. Our tenants generally are subject to laws and regulations covering, among other things, licensure, certification for participation in government programs, fraud and abuse, relationships with physicians and other referral sources, and reimbursement. Changes in these laws and regulations could negatively affect the ability of our tenants to satisfy their contractual obligations, including making lease payments to us. 

Healthcare Legislation. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (the &#8220;Affordable Care Act&#8221;) along with other healthcare reform efforts, provide comprehensive healthcare reform in the U.S. and will become effective through a phased approach, which began in 2010 and will be fully implemented by 2018. The laws are intended to reduce the number of individuals in the U.S. without health insurance and significantly change the means by which healthcare is organized, delivered and reimbursed. The Affordable Care Act expanded reporting requirements and responsibilities related to facility ownership and management, patient safety, quality of care, and certain financial transactions, including payments by the pharmaceutical and medical industry to doctors and teaching hospitals. In the ordinary course of their businesses, our tenants may be regularly subjected to inquiries, investigations and audits by federal and state agencies that oversee these laws and regulations. If they do not comply with the additional reporting requirements and responsibilities, our tenants&#8217; ability to participate in federal healthcare programs may be adversely affected. Moreover, there may be other aspects of the comprehensive healthcare reform legislation for which regulations have not yet been adopted, which, depending on how they are implemented, could adversely affect our tenants and their ability to meet their lease obligations to us. 

The Affordable Care Act has faced numerous judicial challenges with several reaching the U.S. Supreme Court. Although there continue to be judicial challenges to the Affordable Care Act, the Supreme Court has thus far upheld the Affordable Care Act, including, most recently, in their June 25, 2015 ruling on King v. Burwell . In addition to the legal challenges, there have been numerous Congressional attempts to amend and repeal the law. We cannot predict whether any of these attempts to amend or repeal the law will be successful. Through funding limitations in appropriations bills, Congress has limited and/or deferred money available to third-party payors under the Affordable Care Act. These funding restrictions have resulted in adverse financial consequences to some third-party payors and could negatively impact our tenants. Furthermore, we cannot predict how the Affordable Care Act might be modified, either through the legislative or judicial process, and how any such modification might impact our tenants&#8217; operations or the net effect of this law on us. Both our tenants and us may be adversely affected by the law. 

Reimbursement Programs. Sources of revenue for our tenants may include the federal Medicare program, Tricare, state Medicaid programs, private insurance carriers, health maintenance organizations, preferred provider arrangements and self-insured employers, among others. Medicare, Tricare and Medicaid programs, as well as numerous private insurance and managed care plans, generally require participating providers to accept government-determined reimbursement levels as payment in full for services rendered, without regard to facility charges. Changes in the reimbursement rate or methods of payment from third-party payors, including Medicare and Medicaid, could result in a substantial reduction in our tenants&#8217; revenues. 

In previous years, Medicare&#8217;s physician fee-for-service reimbursements were subject to a significant, automatic reduction in rates. Congress repeatedly enacted temporary legislation postponing the implementation of these physician rate cuts. In April 2015, the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015, enacted rules that establishes physician reimbursement rates that allow for steady increases in rates over the near future. 

Despite this &#8220;doc-fix&#8221; legislation, we cannot predict whether future Congressional proposals will seek to reduce physician reimbursements. Efforts by other such payors to reduce healthcare costs will likely continue, which may result in reductions or slower growth in reimbursement for certain services provided by some of our tenants. Further, revenue realizable under third-party payor agreements can change after examination and retroactive adjustment by payors during the claims settlement processes or as a result of post-payment audits. Payors may disallow requests for reimbursement based on determinations that certain costs are not reimbursable or reasonable, because additional documentation is necessary or because certain services were not covered or were not medically necessary. The recently enacted healthcare reform law and regulatory changes could impose further limitations on government and private payments to healthcare providers. In some cases, states have enacted or are considering enacting measures designed to reduce their Medicaid expenditures and to make changes to private healthcare insurance. In addition, the failure of any of our tenants to comply with various laws and regulations could jeopardize their ability to continue participating in Medicare, Tricare, Medicaid and other government sponsored payment programs. The financial impact on our tenants&#8217; failure to comply with such laws and regulations could restrict their ability to make rent payments to us. 

Various laws and Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (&#8220;CMS&#8221;) initiatives and rules are also reducing or changing medical provider compensation and reimbursement. Recent changes include, among others: 

&#8226; 

Section 603 of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, which eliminates certain facility fee reimbursements for outpatient centers that are located further than 250 yards from the main hospital campus. Existing health system facilities will continue to receive these facility fee reimbursements, but new facilities will not, resulting in minimal impact to our existing tenants&#8217; operations. 

&#8226; 

Alternative payment models and payment reforms that compensate medical providers by quality of care and other criteria over quantity of care. The Health Care Payment Learning and Action Network is a network which is seeking to implement these reforms and CMS has various rules, such as the Merit-Based Incentive Payment System and Alternative Payment Models, which are changing how it compensates medical providers. 

&#8226; 

Proposed and finalized CMS rules which impact payments for specific types of services such as the &#8220;Lower Extremity Joint Replacement&#8221; and adjust reimbursement rates for specific types of healthcare facilities. 

These new laws, initiatives and CMS rules reflect an ongoing effort to reduce healthcare costs and reimburse medical providers based on criteria other than fee-for-service. Although their impact is difficult to predict, these laws, initiatives and CMS rules may adversely impact medical providers&#8217; reimbursement and our tenants&#8217; ability to make rent payments to us. 

Fraud and Abuse Laws. There are various federal and state laws prohibiting fraudulent and abusive business practices by healthcare providers who participate in, receive payments from, or are in a position to make referrals in connection with, government-sponsored healthcare programs, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Additionally, the Affordable Care Act includes program integrity provisions that both create new authorities and expand existing authorities for federal and state governments to address fraud, waste and abuse in federal healthcare programs. Our lease arrangements with certain tenants may also be subject to these fraud and abuse laws. These laws include, among others: 

&#8226; 

the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, the offer, payment, solicitation or receipt of any form of remuneration in return for, or to induce, the referral or recommendation for the ordering of any item or service reimbursed by a federal healthcare program, including Medicare or Medicaid; 

&#8226; 

the Federal Physician Self-Referral Prohibition, commonly referred to as the &#8220;Stark Law,&#8221; which: (1) requires hospital landlords of facilities with financial relationships to charge a fair market value rent that does not take into account the volume or value of referrals and subject to specific exceptions; and (2) restricts physicians from making referrals for specifically designated health services for which payment may be made under Medicare and Medicaid programs to an entity with which the physician, or an immediate family member, has a financial relationship; 

&#8226; 

the False Claims Act, which prohibits any person from knowingly presenting or causing to be presented false or fraudulent claims for payment to the federal government, including claims paid by the Medicare and Medicaid programs; 

&#8226; 

the Civil Monetary Penalties Law, which authorizes the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to impose monetary penalties for certain fraudulent acts and regulatory violations and to exclude violators from participating in federal healthcare programs; 

&#8226; 

the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, which protects the privacy and security of personal health information; and 

&#8226; 

State laws which prohibit kickbacks, self-referrals and false claims, and are generally applicable to commercial and state payors. 

In the ordinary course of their business, our tenants may be subject to inquiries, investigations and audits by federal and state agencies that oversee applicable laws and regulations. Private enforcement of healthcare fraud has also increased, due in large part to amendments to the civil False Claims Act that were designed to encourage private individuals to sue on behalf of the government. These whistleblower suits, known as qui tam &#32;suits, may be filed by almost anyone, including present and former employees or patients. In addition to the False Claims Act, there may be civil litigation between private parties which seek damages for violations of federal and state laws. These types of actions may result in monetary penalties, punitive sanctions, damage assessments, imprisonment, increased governmental oversight, denial of Medicare and Medicaid payments and/or exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Investigation by a federal or state governmental body for violation of fraud and abuse laws, imposition of any of these penalties upon one of our tenants, and civil litigation could jeopardize that tenant&#8217;s ability to operate or to make rent payments to us. 

Healthcare Licensure and Certification. Some of our medical properties and our tenants may require a license, multiple licenses, a certificate of need (&#8220;CON&#8221;), or other certification to operate. Failure to obtain a license, CON, other certification, or loss of a required license, CON, or some other certification would prevent a facility from operating in the manner intended by the tenant. This event could adversely affect our tenants&#8217; ability to make rent payments to us. State and local laws also may regulate plant expansion, including the addition of new beds or services or acquisition of medical equipment and the construction of healthcare-related facilities, by requiring a CON or other similar approval. State CON laws are not uniform throughout the U.S. and are subject to change. We cannot predict the impact of state CON laws on our facilities or the operations of our tenants. 

Real Estate Ownership-Related Regulations 

Many laws and governmental regulations are applicable to our properties and changes in these laws and regulations, or their interpretation by agencies and the courts, occur frequently. For example: 

Costs of Compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act. Under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, as amended (the &#8220;ADA&#8221;), all places of public accommodation are required to comply with federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. Although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with present requirements of the ADA, none of our properties have been audited and we have only conducted investigations of a few of our properties to determine compliance. We may incur additional costs in connection with compliance with the ADA. Additional federal, state and local laws also may require modifications to our properties or restrict our ability to renovate our properties. We cannot predict the cost of compliance with the ADA or other legislation. We may incur substantial costs to comply with the ADA or any other legislation. 

Costs of Government Environmental Regulation and Private Litigation. Environmental laws and regulations hold us liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances which may be on our properties. These laws could impose liability on us without regard to whether we are responsible for the presence or release of the hazardous materials. Government investigations and remediation actions may cause substantial costs and the presence of hazardous substances on a property could result in personal injury or similar claims by private plaintiffs. Various laws also impose liability on persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances and such persons oftentimes must incur the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances at the disposal or treatment facility. These laws often impose liability whether or not the person arranging for the disposal ever owned or operated the disposal facility. As the owner and operator of our properties, we may be deemed to have arranged for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances. 

Use of Hazardous Substances by Some of Our Tenants. Some of our tenants routinely handle hazardous substances and wastes on our properties as part of their routine operations. Environmental laws and regulations subject these tenants, and potentially us, to liability resulting from such activities. Our leases require our tenants to comply with these environmental laws and regulations and to indemnify us for any related liabilities. We are unaware of any material noncompliance, liability or claim relating to hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products in connection with any of our properties. 

Other Federal, State and Local Regulations. Our properties are subject to various federal, state and local regulatory requirements, such as state and local fire and life safety requirements. If we fail to comply with these various requirements, we may incur governmental fines or private damage awards. While we believe that our properties are currently in material compliance with all of these regulatory requirements, we do not know whether existing requirements will change or whether future requirements will require us to make significant unanticipated expenditures that will adversely affect our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. We believe, based in part on engineering reports which are generally obtained by us at the time we acquire the properties, that all of our properties comply in all material respects with current regulations. However, if we were required to make significant expenditures under applicable regulations, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to pay distributions to our stockholders could be adversely affected. 

EMPLOYEES 

As of December 31, 2015 , we had approximately 181 employees, of which 1% &#32;are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. 

TAX MATTERS 

We filed an election with our 2007 federal income tax return to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#8220;Code&#8221;). We believe we have satisfied the requirements to qualify as a REIT for all tax years starting in 2007 and we intend to maintain our qualification as a REIT in the future. As a qualified REIT, with limited exceptions, we are generally not subject to federal and certain state income tax on net income that we currently distribute to stockholders. We expect to continue to make distributions sufficient to avoid income tax. 

While we believe that we are organized and qualified as a REIT and we intend to operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to qualify as a REIT, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in this regard. Our qualification as a REIT depends upon our ability to meet, through our annual operating results, asset diversification, distribution levels and diversity of stock ownership and the various qualification tests imposed under the Code. If we fail to maintain our qualification as a REIT, corporate level income tax would apply to our taxable income at the current corporate tax rates. As a result, the amount available for distributions to stockholders would be reduced and we would no longer be required to make distributions. Failure to qualify as a REIT could also adversely affect our ability to make investments and raise capital. 

Qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the Code for which there are limited judicial and administrative interpretations and involves the determination of a variety of factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control.
