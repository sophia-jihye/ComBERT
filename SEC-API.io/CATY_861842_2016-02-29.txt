Business of Bancorp 

&#160; 

Overview 

&#160; 

Cathay General Bancorp is a corporation that was organized in 1990 under the laws of the State of Delaware. We are the holding company of Cathay Bank, a California state-chartered commercial bank (&#8220;Cathay Bank&#8221; or the &#8220;Bank&#8221;), seven limited partnerships investing in affordable housing investments in which the Bank is the sole limited partner, GBC Venture Capital, Inc, and Asia Realty Corp. We also own 100% of the common stock of five statutory business trusts created for the purpose of issuing capital securities. In the future, we may become an operating company or acquire savings institutions, other banks, or companies engaged in bank-related activities and may engage in such other activities or acquire such other businesses as may be permitted by applicable law. Our principal place of business is currently located at 777 North Broadway, Los Angeles, California 90012, and our telephone number at that location is (213) 625-4700. In addition, certain of our administrative offices are located in El Monte, California, and our address there is 9650 Flair Drive, El Monte, California 91731. Our common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market and our trading symbol is &#8220;CATY&#8221;. 

&#160; 

We are regulated as a bank holding company by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (&#8220;Federal Reserve&#8221;). Cathay Bank is regulated as a California commercial bank by the California Department of Business Oversight (&#8220;DBO&#8221;) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (&#8220;FDIC&#8221;) . 

&#160; 

Subsidiaries of Bancorp 

&#160; 

In addition to its wholly-owned bank subsidiary, the Bancorp has the following subsidiaries: 

&#160; 

Cathay Capital Trust I, Cathay Statutory Trust I, Cathay Capital Trust II, Cathay Capital Trust III and Cathay Capital Trust IV . The Bancorp established Cathay Capital Trust I in June 2003, Cathay Statutory Trust I in September 2003, Cathay Capital Trust II in December 2003, Cathay Capital Trust III in March 2007, and Cathay Capital Trust IV in May 2007 (collectively, the &#8220;Trusts&#8221;) as wholly-owned subsidiaries. The Trusts are statutory business trusts. The Trusts issued capital securities representing undivided preferred beneficial interests in the assets of the Trusts. The Trusts exist for the purpose of issuing the capital securities and investing the proceeds thereof, together with proceeds from the purchase of the common securities of the Trusts by the Bancorp, in a certain series of securities issued by us, with similar terms to the relevant series of securities issued by each of the Trusts, which we refer to as &#8220;Junior Subordinated Notes.&#8221; The Bancorp guarantees, on a limited basis, payments of distributions on the capital securities of the Trusts and payments on redemption of the capital securities of the Trusts. The Bancorp is the owner of all the beneficial interests represented by the common securities of the Trusts. The purpose of issuing the capital securities was to provide the Company with a cost-effective means of obtaining Tier 1 capital for regulatory purposes. Because the Bancorp is not the primary beneficiary of the Trusts, the financial statements of the Trusts are not included in our Consolidated Financial Statements. 

&#160;

GBC Venture Capital, Inc. The business purpose of GBC Venture Capital, Inc. is to hold equity interests (such as options or warrants) received as part of business relationships and to make equity investments in companies and limited partnerships subject to applicable regulatory restrictions. 

&#160; 

Asia Realty Corp . Asia Realty Corp. was incorporated in January 2013 for the purpose of holding other real estate owned and became a subsidiary of the Bancorp as a result of the acquisition of Asia Bancshares. Asia Realty Corp. owned one foreclosed property with a carrying value of $3.0 million at December 31, 2015

Competition 

&#160; 

Our primary business is to act as the holding company for the Bank. Accordingly, we face the same competitive pressures as those expected by the Bank. For a discussion of those risks, see &#8220;Business of the Bank &#8212; Competition &#8221; below under this Item 1. 

&#160; 

Employees

Business of the Bank 

&#160; 

General 

&#160; 

Cathay Bank was incorporated under the laws of the State of California on August 22, 1961, is licensed by the California Department of Business Oversight (&#8220;DBO&#8221;) (previously known as the California Department of Financial Institutions or California State Banking Department), and commenced operations as a California state-chartered bank on April 19, 1962. Cathay Bank is an insured bank under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act by the FDIC, but it is not a member of the Federal Reserve. 

&#160; 

The Bank&#8217;s head office is located in the Chinatown area of Los Angeles, at 777 North Broadway, Los Angeles, California 90012. In addition, as of December 31, 2015, the Bank had branch offices in Southern California (21 branches), Northern California (12 branches), New York (12 branches), Illinois (three branches), Washington (three branches), Texas (two branches), Maryland (one branch), Massachusetts (one branch), Nevada (one branch), New Jersey (one branch), and Hong Kong (one branch) and a representative office in Shanghai and in Taipei. Deposit accounts at the Hong Kong branch are not insured by the FDIC. Each branch has loan approval rights subject to the branch manager&#8217;s authorized lending limits. Current activities of the Shanghai and Taipei representative offices are limited to coordinating the transportation of documents to the Bank&#8217;s head office and performing liaison services. 

&#160; 

Our primary market area is defined by the Community Reinvestment Act (the &#8220;CRA&#8221;) delineation, which includes the contiguous areas surrounding each of the Bank&#8217;s branch offices. It is the Bank&#8217;s policy to reach out and actively offer services to low and moderate income groups in the delineated branch service areas. Many of the Bank&#8217;s employees speak both English and one or more Chinese dialects or Vietnamese, and are thus able to serve the Bank&#8217;s Chinese, Vietnamese, and English speaking customers. 

&#160; 

As a commercial bank, the Bank accepts checking, savings, and time deposits, and makes commercial, real estate, personal, home improvement, automobile, and other installment and term loans. From time to time, the Bank invests available funds in other interest-earning assets, such as U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. government agency securities, state and municipal securities, mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities, corporate bonds, and other security investments. The Bank also provides letters of credit, wire transfers, forward currency spot and forward contracts, traveler&#8217;s checks, safe deposit, night deposit, Social Security payment deposit, collection, bank-by-mail, drive-up and walk-up windows, automatic teller machines (&#8220;ATM&#8221;), Internet banking services, and other customary bank services. 

&#160; 

The Bank primarily services individuals, professionals, and small to medium-sized businesses in the local markets in which its branches are located and provides commercial mortgage loans, commercial loans, Small Business Administration (&#8220;SBA&#8221;) loans, residential mortgage loans, real estate construction loans, home equity lines of credit, and installment loans to individuals for automobile, household, and other consumer expenditures. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Through Cathay Wealth Management business unit, the Bank provides its customers the ability to trade securities online and to purchase mutual funds, annuities, equities, bonds, and short-term money market instruments. All securities and insurance products provided by Cathay Wealth Management are offered by, and all Financial Consultants are registered with, Cetera Financial Services, a registered securities broker/dealer and licensed insurance agency and member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority and Security Investor Protection Corporation. Cetera Financial Services and Cathay Bank are independent entities. These products are not insured by the FDIC. 

&#160; 

Securities 

&#160; 

The Bank&#8217;s securities portfolio is managed in accordance with a written Investment Policy which addresses strategies, types, and levels of allowable investments, and which is reviewed and approved by our Board of Directors on an annual basis. 

&#160; 

Our investment portfolio is managed to meet our liquidity needs through proceeds from scheduled maturities and is also utilized for pledging requirements for deposits of state and local subdivisions, securities sold under repurchase agreements, and Federal Home Loan Bank (&#8220;FHLB&#8221;) advances. The portfolio is comprised of U.S. government securities, mortgage-backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations, corporate debt instruments, and mutual funds. 

&#160; 

Information concerning the carrying value, maturity distribution, and yield analysis of the Company&#8217;s securities portfolio as well as a summary of the amortized cost and estimated fair value of the Bank&#8217;s securities by contractual maturity is included in Part II &#8212; Item 7 &#8212; &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,&#8221; and in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

&#160; 

Loans 

&#160; 

The Bank&#8217;s Board of Directors and senior management establish, review, and modify the Bank&#8217;s lending policies. These policies include (as applicable) an evaluation of a potential borrower&#8217;s financial condition, ability to repay the loan, character, secondary repayment sources (such as guaranties), quality and availability of collateral, capital, leverage capacity and regulatory guidelines, market conditions for the borrower&#8217;s business or project, and prevailing economic trends and conditions. Loan originations are obtained through a variety of sources, including existing customers, walk-in customers, referrals from brokers or existing customers, and advertising. While loan applications are accepted at all branches, the Bank&#8217;s centralized document department supervises the application process including documentation of loans, review of appraisals, and credit reports. 

&#160; 

Commercial Mortgage Loans. Commercial mortgage loans are typically secured by first deeds of trust on commercial properties. Our commercial mortgage portfolio includes primarily commercial retail properties, shopping centers, and owner-occupied industrial facilities, and, secondarily, office buildings, multiple-unit apartments, hotels, and multi-tenanted industrial properties. 

&#160; 

The Bank also makes medium-term commercial mortgage loans which are generally secured by commercial or industrial buildings where the borrower uses the property for business purposes or derives income from tenants. 

&#160; 

Commercial Loans. The Bank provides financial services to diverse commercial and professional businesses in its market areas. Commercial loans consist primarily of short-term loans (normally with a maturity of up to one year) to support general business purposes, or to provide working capital to businesses in the form of lines of credit to finance trade. The Bank continues to focus primarily on commercial lending to small-to-medium size businesses within the Bank&#8217;s geographic market areas. The Bank participates or syndicates loans, typically more than $25 million in principal amount, with other financial institutions to limit its credit exposure. Commercial loan pricing is generally at a rate tied to the prime rate, as quoted in The Wall Street Journal , or the Bank&#8217;s reference rate. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

SBA Loans. The Bank originates U.S. Small Business Administration (&#8220;SBA&#8221;) loans under the national &#8220;preferred lender&#8221; status. Preferred lender status is granted to a lender that has made a certain number of SBA loans and which, in the opinion of the SBA, has staff qualified and experienced in small business loans. As a preferred lender, the Bank&#8217;s SBA Lending Group has the authority to issue, on behalf of the SBA, the SBA guaranty on loans under the 7(a) program which may result in shortening the time it takes to process a loan. In addition, under this program, the SBA delegates loan underwriting, closing, and most servicing and liquidation authority and responsibility to selected lenders. 

&#160; 

The Bank utilizes both the 504 program, which is focused on long-term financing of buildings and other long-term fixed assets, and the 7(a) program, which is the SBA&#8217;s primary loan program and which can be used for financing of a variety of general business purposes such as acquisition of land , buildings, equipment and inventory and working capital needs of eligible businesses generally over a 5- to 25-year term. The collateral position in the SBA loans is enhanced by the SBA guaranty in the case of 7(a) loans, and by lower loan-to-value ratios under the 504 program. The Bank has sold, and may in the future sell, the guaranteed portion of certain of its SBA 7(a) loans in the secondary market. SBA loan pricing is generally at a rate tied to the prime rate, as quoted in The Wall Street Journal . 

&#160; 

Residential Mortgage Loans. The Bank originates single-family-residential mortgage loans. The single-family-residential mortgage loans are comprised of conforming, nonconforming, and jumbo residential mortgage loans, and are secured by first or subordinate liens on single (one-to-four) family residential properties. The Bank&#8217;s products include a fixed-rate residential mortgage loan and an adjustable-rate residential mortgage loan. Mortgage loans are underwritten in accordance with the Bank&#8217;s and regulatory guidelines, on the basis of the borrower&#8217;s financial capabilities, an independent appraisal of the value of the property, historical loan quality, and other factors deemed relevant by the Bank&#8217;s underwriting personnel. It is the current practice of the Bank to sell all conforming fixed rate residential first mortgages that meet Government Sponsored Agency guidelines to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation on a cash basis as they are originated. The Bank retains all other mortgage loans it originates in its portfolio. As such, the Bank was not impacted by the rule pertaining to risk retention implementing the risk retention requirements of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the &#8220;Dodd-Frank Act&#8221;), since the Bank does not securitize any of the loans it sells or retains . 

&#160; 

Real Estate Construction Loans. The Bank&#8217;s real estate construction loan activity focuses on providing short-term loans to individuals and developers, primarily for the construction of multi-unit projects. Residential real estate construction loans are typically secured by first deeds of trust and guarantees of the borrower. The economic viability of the projects, borrower&#8217;s credit worthiness, and borrower&#8217;s and contractor&#8217;s experience are primary considerations in the loan underwriting decision. The Bank utilizes approved independent licensed appraisers and monitors projects during the construction phase through construction inspections and a disbursement program tied to the percentage of completion of each project. The Bank also occasionally makes unimproved property loans to borrowers who intend to construct a single-family residence on their lots generally within twelve months. In addition, the Bank makes commercial real estate construction loans to high net worth clients with adequate liquidity for construction of office and warehouse properties. Such loans are typically secured by first deeds of trust and are guaranteed by the borrower. 

&#160; 

Home Equity Lines of Credit. The Bank offers variable-rate home equity lines of credit that are secured by the borrower&#8217;s home. The pricing on the variable-rate home equity line of credit is generally at a rate tied to the prime rate, as quoted in The Wall Street Journal , or the Bank&#8217;s reference rate. Borrowers may use this line of credit for home improvement financing, debt consolidation and other personal uses. 

&#160; 

Installment Loans . Installment loans tend to be fixed rate and longer-term (one-to-six year maturities). These loans are funded primarily for the purpose of financing the purchase of automobiles and other personal uses of the borrower. 

&#160; 

Distribution and Maturity of Loans. Information concerning types, distribution, and maturity of loans is included in Part II &#8212; Item 7 &#8212; &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,&#8221; and in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Asset Quality 

&#160; 

The Bank&#8217;s lending and credit policies require management to regularly review the Bank&#8217;s loan portfolio so that the Bank can monitor the quality of its assets. If during the ordinary course of business, management becomes aware that a borrower may not be able to meet the contractual payment obligations under a loan, then that loan is supervised more closely with consideration given to placing the loan on non-accrual status, the need for an additional allowance for loan losses, and (if appropriate) partial or full charge-off. 

&#160; 

Under the Bank&#8217;s current policy, a loan will generally be placed on a non-accrual status if interest or principal is past due 90 days or more, or in cases where management deems the full collection of principal and interest unlikely. When a loan is placed on non-accrual status, previously accrued but unpaid interest is reversed and charged against current income, and subsequent payments received are generally first applied towards the outstanding principal balance of the loan. Depending on the circumstances, management may elect to continue the accrual of interest on certain past due loans if partial payment is received or the loan is well-collateralized, and in the process of collection. The loan is generally returned to accrual status when the borrower has brought the past due principal and interest payments current and, in the opinion of management, the borrower has demonstrated the ability to make future payments of principal and interest as scheduled. A non-accrual loan may also be returned to accrual status if all principal and interest contractually due are reasonably assured of repayment within a reasonable period and there has been a sustained period of payment performance, generally six months. 

&#160; 

Information concerning non-performing loans, restructured loans, allowance for credit losses, loans charged-off , loan recoveries, and other real estate owned is included in Part II &#8212; Item 7 &#8212; &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,&#8221; and in Note 5 and Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

&#160;

These products are priced in order to promote growth of deposits. 

&#160; 

The Bank&#8217;s deposits are generally obtained from residents within its geographic market area. The Bank utilizes traditional marketing methods to attract new customers and deposits, by offering a wide variety of products and services and utilizing various forms of advertising media. From time to time, the Bank may offer special deposit promotions. Information concerning types of deposit accounts, average deposits and rates, and maturity of time deposits is included in Part II &#8212; Item 7 &#8212; &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,&#8221; and in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

&#160; 

Borrowings 

&#160; 

Borrowings from time to time include securities sold under agreements to repurchase, the purchase of federal funds, funds obtained as advances from the FHLB, borrowing from other financial institutions, and the issuance of Junior Subordinated Notes. Information concerning the types, amounts, and maturity of borrowings is included in in Part II &#8212; Item 7 &#8212; &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,&#8221; and in Note 1 0 and Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

&#160;

&#160; 

Expansion 

&#160; 

We have engaged in expansion through acquisitions and may consider acquisitions in the future in order to compete for new deposits and loans, and to be able to serve our customers more effectively. 

&#160; 

On July 31, 2015 the Company completed the acquisition of New York-based Asia Bancshares, Inc., parent of Asia Bank. Asia Bank operated three branch locations in New York City and one branch location in the state of Maryland. The acquisition allowed the Company to expand its number of branches in New York City and to enter the state of Maryland. The purchase consideration consisted of fifty-five percent in Bancorp stock and forty-five percent in cash. The fair value of the consideration was $139.9 million, which consisted of 2,580,359 shares of Bancorp common stock valued at $82.9 million at the date of acquisition and $57.0 million in cash. 

&#160; 

Subsidiaries of Cathay Bank 

&#160; 

Cathay Community Development Corporation (&#8220;CCDC&#8221;) is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Bank and was incorporated in September 2006. The primary mission of CCDC is to help in the development of low-income neighborhoods in the Bank&#8217;s California and New York service areas by providing or facilitating the availability of capital to businesses and real estate developers working to renovate these neighborhoods. In October 2006, CCDC formed a wholly-owned subsidiary, Cathay New Asia Community Development Corporation (&#8220;CNACDC&#8221;), for the purpose of assuming New Asia Bank&#8217;s pre-existing New Markets Tax Credit activities in the greater Chicago area by providing or facilitating the availability of capital to businesses and real estate developers working to renovate these neighborhoods. 

&#160; 

Cathay Holdings LLC (&#8220;CHLLC&#8221;) was incorporated in December 2007, Cathay Holdings 2 LLC (&#8220;CHLLC2&#8221;) was incorporated in January 2008, and Cathay Holdings 3 LLC (&#8220;CHLLC3&#8221;) was incorporated in December 2008. They are wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Bank. The purpose of these subsidiaries is to hold other real estate owned in the state of Texas that was transferred from the Bank. As of December 31, 2015, CHLLC owned a property with a carrying value of $526,000. CHLLC2 and CHLLC3 did not own property at December 31, 2015. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

We face substantial competition for deposits, loans and other banking services, as well as acquisitions, throughout our market area from the major banks and financial institutions that dominate the commercial banking industry. We also compete for loans and deposits, as well as other banking services, such as payment services, with savings and loan associations, savings banks, brokerage houses, insurance companies, mortgage companies, credit unions, credit card companies and other financial and non-financial institutions and entities. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

In California, one larger Chinese-American bank competes for loans and deposits with the Bank and at least two super-regional banks compete with the Bank for deposits. In addition, there are many other Chinese-American banks in both Southern and Northern California. Banks from the Pacific Rim countries, such as Taiwan, Hong Kong, and China also continue to open branches in the Los Angeles area, thus increasing competition in the Bank&#8217;s primary markets. See discussion below in Part I &#8212; Item 1A &#8212; &#8220;Risk Factors.&#8221; 

&#160; 

To compete with other financial institutions in its primary service areas, the Bank relies principally upon local promotional activities, personal contacts by its officers, directors, employees, and stockholders, extended hours on weekdays, Saturday banking in certain locations, Internet banking, an Internet website ( www.cathaybank.com ), and certain other specialized services. The content of our website is not incorporated into and is not part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

&#160; 

If a proposed loan exceeds the Bank&#8217;s internal lending limits, the Bank has, in the past, and may in the future, arrange the loan on a participation or syndication basis with correspondent banks. The Bank also assists customers requiring other services not offered by the Bank to obtain these services from its correspondent banks. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, the Bank and its subsidiaries employed approximately 1,122 persons, including 533 banking officers. None of the employees are represented by a union. We believe that our employer-employee relations are good. 

&#160;

&#160; 

Regulation and Supervision 

&#160; 

General 

&#160; 

The Bancorp and the Bank are subject to significant regulation and restrictions by federal and state laws and regulatory agencies. This regulation is intended primarily for the protection of depositors and the deposit insurance fund, secondarily for the stability of the U.S. banking system, and not for the protection of stockholders. The following discussion of statutes and regulations is a summary and does not purport to be complete nor does it address all applicable statutes and regulations. This discussion is also qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text and to the implementation and enforcement of the statutes and regulations referred to in this discussion. 

&#160; 

Additional initiatives may be proposed or introduced before Congress, the California Legislature, and other governmental bodies in the future. Such proposals, if enacted, may further alter the structure, regulation, and competitive relationship among financial institutions and may subject us to increased supervision and disclosure and reporting requirements. In addition, the various bank regulatory agencies often adopt new rules and regulations and policies to implement and enforce existing legislation. It cannot be predicted whether, or in what form, any such legislation or regulatory changes in policy may be enacted or the extent to which the business of the Bank would be affected thereby. In addition, the outcome of examinations, any litigation, or any investigations initiated by state or federal authorities may result in necessary changes in our operations and increased compliance costs. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act 

&#160; 

The Dodd-Frank Act financial reform legislation significantly revised and expanded the rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement authority of the federal bank regulatory agencies. The numerous rules and regulations promulgated pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act have significantly impacted our operations and compliance costs. Various provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act are now effective and have been fully implemented, including the revisions in the deposit insurance assessment base for FDIC insurance and the permanent increase in coverage to $250,000; the permissibility of paying interest on business checking accounts; the removal of barriers to interstate branching; and required disclosure and shareholder advisory votes on executive compensation. Implementation in 2015 of additional Dodd-Frank Act regulatory provisions included aspects of (i) the final new capital rules, and (ii) the so called &#8220;Volcker Rule&#8221; restrictions on certain proprietary trading and investment activities. 

&#160; 

Capital Adequacy Requirements 

&#160; 

Bank holding companies and banks are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by state and federal banking agencies. Capital adequacy guidelines and, additionally for banks, prompt corrective action regulations (See &#8220;Prompt Corrective Action Provisions&#8221; below), involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items calculated under regulatory accounting practices. Capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about components, risk weighting, and other factors. The risk-based capital guidelines for bank holding companies and banks require capital ratios that vary based on the perceived degree of risk associated with a banking organization&#8217;s operations for both transactions reported on the balance sheet as assets, such as loans, and those recorded as off-balance sheet items, such as commitments, letters of credit and recourse arrangements. The risk-based capital ratio is determined by classifying assets and certain off-balance sheet financial instruments into weighted categories, with higher levels of capital being required for those categories perceived as representing greater risks and dividing its qualifying capital by its total risk-adjusted assets and off-balance sheet items. Bank holding companies and banks engaged in significant trading activity may also be subject to the market risk capital guidelines and be required to incorporate additional market and interest rate risk components into their risk-based capital standards. Under Basel III rules that became effective January 1, 2015 discussed under &#8220;New Capital Rules&#8221; below, there are four fundamental capital ratios: (i) a common equity Tier 1capital ratio, (ii) a total risk-based capital ratio, (iii) a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio. To be deemed &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; a bank holding company or bank must have (i) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio equal to or greater than 6.5%, (ii) a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio equal to or greater than 8 .0%, (iii) a total risk-based capital ratio equal to or greater than 10 .0%, and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage capital ratio equal to or greater than 5 .0%. At December 31, 2015, (i) the Bancorp&#8217;s and the Bank&#8217;s common equity Tier 1 capital ratios were 12.95% and 13.54%, respectively; (ii) their total risk-based capital ratios were, respectively, 15.30% and 14.79%; (iii) their Tier 1 risk-based capital ratios were, respectively, 14.03% and 13.54%; and (iv) their leverage capital ratios were, respectively, 11.95% and 11.53%, all of which ratios exceeded the minimum percentage requirements to be deemed &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; for regulatory purposes. The federal banking agencies may require banks and bank holding companies subject to enforcement actions to maintain capital ratios in excess of the minimum ratios otherwise required to be deemed &#8220;well -capitalized.&#8221; 

&#160; 

Failure to meet statutorily mandated capital guidelines or more restrictive ratios separately established for a financial institution could subject a bank or bank holding company to a variety of enforcement remedies, including issuance of a capital directive, the termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC, a prohibition on accepting or renewing brokered deposits, limitations on the rates of interest that the institution may pay on its deposits and other restrictions on its business. Significant additional restrictions can be imposed on FDIC-insured depository institutions that fail to meet applicable capital requirements under the regulatory agencies&#8217; prompt corrective action authority. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

New Capital Rules 

&#160; 

The federal bank regulatory agencies adopted final regulations in July 2013, which revised their risk-based and leverage capital requirements for banking organizations to meet requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act and to implement Basel III international agreements reached by the Basel Committee. Although many of the rules contained in these final regulations are applicable only to large, internationally active banks, most will apply on a phased in basis to all banking organizations, including the Bancorp and the Bank. The new capital rules took effect on January 1, 2015, but many elements are being phased-in. To the extent that the new capital rules are not fully phased-in, the prior capital rules continue to apply. 

&#160; 

The following are among the new requirements that are effective or being phased-in beginning January 1, 2015: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

An increase in the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio from 4.00% to 6.00% of risk-weighted assets. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

A new category and a required 4.50% of risk-weighted assets ratio is established for &#8220;common equity Tier 1&#8221; as a subset of Tier 1 capital limited to common equity. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

A minimum non-risk-based leverage ratio is set at 4.00% eliminating a 3.00% exception for higher rated banks. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

Changes in the permitted composition of Tier 1 capital to exclude trust preferred securities (other than certain grandfathered trust preferred securities), mortgage servicing rights and certain deferred tax assets and include unrealized gains and losses on available for sale debt and equity securities. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

A new additional capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of risk weighted assets over each of the required capital ratios will be phased in from 2016 to 2019 and must be met to avoid limitations in the ability of the Bank to pay dividends, repurchase shares or pay discretionary bonuses. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

The risk-weights of certain assets for purposes of calculating the risk-based capital ratios are changed for high volatility commercial real estate acquisition, development and construction loans, certain past due non-residential mortgage loans and certain mortgage-backed and other securities exposures. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

An additional &#8220;countercyclical capital buffer&#8221; is required for larger and more complex institutions. 

&#160; 

Without taking into account the capital conservation buffer, the new capital rules require the following minimum ratios: (i) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4.0%; (ii) a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 4.5%, (iii) a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6%, and (iv) a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0%. To be considered &#8220;well capitalized,&#8221; a bank holding company or bank would be required to have the following minimum ratios: (i) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 5.0%; (ii) a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.5%, (iii) a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0%, and (iv) a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0%. The new capital conservation buffer requirement will be phased in beginning in January 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets, increasing each year until fully implemented in January 2019 at 2.50% of risk-weighted assets. 

&#160; 

While the new capital rules set higher regulatory capital standards for the Bancorp and the Bank, bank regulators may also continue their past policies of expecting banks to maintain additional capital beyond the new minimum requirements. The implementation of the new capital rules or more stringent requirements to maintain higher levels of capital or to maintain higher levels of liquid assets could adversely impact the Bancorp&#8217;s net income and return on equity, restrict the ability of the Bank and/or the Bancorp to pay dividends or executive bonuses and require the raising of additional capital. 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, the Bancorp and the Bank met all applicable capital requirements under the new capital rules on a fully phased-in basis if such requirements were currently in effect . 

&#160; 

Liquidity Requirements 

&#160; 

In response to the endemic liquidity problems that accompanied the 2008 financial crisis and as part of the Basel III initiative, the federal regulatory agencies promulgated regulations in 2014 requiring the largest financial institutions to maintain an amount of high-quality liquid assets at least equal to those institutions&#8217; estimated net cash outflows over a 30-day stressed liquidity period. This ratio is referred to as the &#8220;liquidity coverage ratio&#8221; or &#8220;LCR.&#8221; The LCR requirement generally applies only to banking organizations with $250 billion or more in assets (or total consolidated on-balance sheet foreign exposure of $10 billion or more), and any subsidiary depository institution of such an organization with $10 billion or more in consolidated assets. In addition, pursuant to the authority granted to federal regulators under the Dodd- Frank Act to require enhanced prudential standards from banking organizations, bank holding companies with $50 billion or more in consolidated assets are subject to specific liquidity risk management requirements and liquidity stress testing and buffer requirements. Although smaller banking organizations, such as the Bancorp, are not subject to such specific liquidity requirements, appropriate liquidity management (including liquidity stress testing) has become an increasingly important focus of prudential regulation of smaller institutions by federal and state bank regulators. This emphasis had led many financial institutions to hold a higher percentage of lower-yielding, short term assets than they may have held in past years. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Final Volcker Rule 

&#160; 

In December 2013, the federal bank regulatory agencies adopted final rules that implement a part of the Dodd-Frank Act commonly referred to as the &#8220;Volcker Rule.&#8221; Under these rules and subject to certain exceptions, banking entities, including the Company and the Bank and its subsidiaries, will be restricted from engaging in activities that are considered proprietary trading and from sponsoring or investing in certain entities, including hedge or private equity funds that are considered &#8220;covered funds.&#8221; Bank holding companies and banks were generally required to conform their activities to the Volcker rule on or before July 21, 2015 although certain provisions are subject to delayed effectiveness under rules promulgated by the Federal Reserve. 

&#160; 

Except for divesting some investments aggregating less than $5 million as of December 31, 2015, we believe that the new rules will not require any material changes in our operations or business or security holdings . 

&#160; 

CFPB Actions 

&#160; 

The Dodd-Frank Act provided for the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (&#8220;CFPB&#8221;) as an independent entity within the Federal Reserve with broad rulemaking, supervisory, and enforcement authority over consumer financial products and services, including deposit products, residential mortgages, home-equity loans and credit cards. The CFPB&#8217;s functions include investigating consumer complaints, conducting market research, rulemaking, supervising and examining bank consumer transactions, and enforcing rules related to consumer financial products and services. CFPB regulations and guidance apply to all financial institutions and banks with $10 billion or more in assets, which are also subject to examination by the CFPB. As the Bank has more than $10 billion in assets, it is now examined for compliance with CFPB regulation by the CFPB in addition to examinations of the Bank by the FDIC and the DBO. 

&#160; 

The CFPB has enforcement authority over unfair, deceptive or abusive act and practices (&#8220;UDAAP&#8221;). UDAAP is considered one of the most far reaching new enforcement tools at the disposal of the CFPB and covers all consumer and small business financial products or services such as deposit and lending products or services such as overdraft programs and third-party payroll card vendors. It is a wide-ranging regulatory net that potentially picks up the gaps not included in other consumer laws, rules and regulations. Violations of UDAAP can be found in many areas and can include advertising and marketing materials, the order of processing and paying items in a checking account or the design of client overdraft programs. The scope of coverage includes not only direct interactions with clients and prospects but also actions by third-party service providers. The Dodd-Frank Act does not prevent states from adopting stricter consumer protection standards. State regulation of financial products and potential enforcement actions could also adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. 

&#160; 

Additionally, in 2014, the CFPB adopted revisions to Regulation Z, which implement the Truth in Lending Act, pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, and apply to all consumer mortgages (except home equity lines of credit, timeshare plans, reverse mortgages, or temporary loans). The revisions mandate specific underwriting criteria for home loans in order for creditors to make a reasonable, good faith determination of a consumer&#39;s ability to repay and establish certain protections from liability under this requirement for &#8220;qualified mortgages&#8221; meeting certain standards. In particular, it will prevent banks from making &#8220;no doc&#8221; and &#8220;low doc&#8221; home loans, as the rules require that banks determine a consumer&#8217;s ability to pay based in part on verified and documented information. We do originate certain &#8220;low doc&#8221; loans that meet specific underwriting criteria. Given the small volume of such loans, we do not believe that this regulation will have a significant impact on our operations. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Enhanced Prudentia l Standards 

&#160; 

Pursuant to Federal Reserve Board regulations promulgated under authority of the Dodd-Frank Act, as a publicly traded bank holding company with $10 billion or more (but less than $50 billion) in assets, we are required and have established and maintained a risk committee responsible for enterprise-wide risk management practices, comprised of an independent chairman and at least one risk management expert. A dditional stress testing is required for banking organizations having $50 billion or more of assets. The risk committee approves and periodically reviews the risk-management policies of the bank holding company&#8217;s global operations and oversees the operations of its risk-management framework. The bank holding company&#8217;s risk-management framework must be commensurate with its structure, risk profile, complexity, activities and size. At a minimum, the framework must include policies and procedures establishing risk-management governance and providing for adequate risk-control infrastructure for the bank holding company&#8217;s operations. In addition, the framework must include processes and systems to monitor compliance with the foregoing policies and procedures, including processes and systems designed to identify and report risk-management risks and deficiencies; ensure effective implementation of actions to address emerging risks and risk-management deficiencies; designate managerial and staff responsibility for risk management; ensure the independence of the risk-management function; and integrate risk-management and associated controls with management goals and the management compensation structure. 

&#160; 

As a bank holding company with more than $10 billion in assets, we are also required under the Dodd-Frank Act to conduct annual stress tests using various scenarios established by the Federal Reserve, including a baseline, adverse and severely adverse economic conditions (known as &#8220;Dodd Frank Act Stress Tests&#8221; or &#8220;DFAST&#8221;). The stress tests are designed to determine whether our capital planning, assessment of capital adequacy and risk management practices adequately protect the Bancorp and its affiliates in the event of an economic downturn. The Bancorp must establish adequate internal controls, documentation, policies and procedures to ensure the annual stress adequately meets these objectives. The Board of Directors must review our policies and procedures at least annually. We are required to report the results of our annual stress tests to the Federal Reserve, and we are required to consider the results of our stress tests as part of our capital planning and risk management practices. 

&#160; 

Interchange Fees 

&#160; 

Under the Durbin Amendment to the Dodd-Frank Act, the Federal Reserve adopted rules establishing standards for assessing whether the interchange fees that may be charged with respect to certain electronic debit transactions are &#8220;reasonable and proportional&#8221; to the costs incurred by issuers for processing such transactions. 

&#160; 

Interchange fees, or &#8220;swipe&#8221; fees, are charges that merchants pay to us and other card-issuing banks for processing electronic payment transactions. Under the final rules, the maximum permissible interchange fee is equal to no more than 21 cents plus 5 basis points of the transaction value for many types of debit interchange transactions. The Federal Reserve also adopted a rule to allow a debit card issuer to recover 1 cent per transaction for fraud prevention purposes if the issuer complies with certain fraud-related requirements required by the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve also has rules governing routing and exclusivity that require issuers to offer two unaffiliated networks for routing transactions on each debit or prepaid product. 

&#160; 

On July 31, 2013, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia found the interchange fee cap and the exclusivity provision adopted by the Federal Reserve to be invalid. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, or D.C. Circuit, reversed this decision on March 21, 2014, generally upholding the Federal Reserve&#8217;s interpretation of the Durbin Amendment and the Federal Reserve&#8217;s rules implementing it. On August 18, 2014, the plaintiffs in this litigation filed a petition for a writ of certiorari asking the U.S. Supreme Court to review the D.C. Circuit&#8217;s decision with respect to the interchange fee cap. The petition was denied on January 23, 2015. With the U.S. Supreme Court&#39;s denial of certiorari, the U.S. Court of Appeals decision will stand. We continue to monitor developments in the litigation surrounding these rules. 

&#160; 

Bank Holding Company and Bank Regulation 

&#160; 

The Bancorp is a bank holding company within the meaning of the Bank Holding Company Act and is registered as such with the Federal Reserve. The Bancorp is also a bank holding company within the meaning of Section 1280 of the California Financial Code. Therefore, the Bancorp and any of its subsidiaries are subject to examination by, and may be required to file reports with, the DBO. As a California commercial bank the deposits of which are insured by the FDIC, the Bank is subject to regulation, supervision, and regular examination by the DBO and by the FDIC, as the Bank&#8217;s primary federal regulator, and must additionally comply with certain applicable regulations of the Federal Reserve. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Bank holding companies and their bank and non-bank subsidiaries are subject to significant regulation and restrictions by federal and state laws and regulatory agencies. These laws, regulations and restrictions, which may affect the cost of doing business, limit permissible activities and expansion or impact the competitive balance between banks and other financial services providers, are intended primarily for the protection of depositors and the FDIC&#8217;s Deposit Insurance Fund, and secondarily for the stability of the U.S. banking system. They are not intended for the benefit of stockholders of financial institutions. The following discussion of key statutes and regulations to which the Bancorp and the Bank are subject is a summary and does not purport to be complete nor does it address all applicable statutes and regulations. This discussion is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full statutes and regulations. 

&#160; 

The wide range of requirements and restrictions contained in both federal and state banking laws include: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Requirements that bank holding companies and banks file periodic reports. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Requirements that bank holding companies and banks meet or exceed minimum capital requirements (see &#8220;Capital Adequacy Requirements&#8221; above) . 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Requirements that bank holding companies serve as a source of financial and managerial strength for their banking subsidiaries. In addition, the regulatory agencies have &#8220;prompt corrective action&#8221; authority to limit activities and require a limited guaranty of a required bank capital restoration plan by a bank holding company if the capital of a bank subsidiary falls below capital levels required by the regulators. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Limitations on dividends payable to stockholders. The Bancorp&#8217;s ability to pay dividends is subject to legal and regulatory restrictions. A substantial portion of the Bancorp&#8217;s funds to pay dividends or to pay principal and interest on our debt obligations is derived from dividends paid by the Bank. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Limitations on dividends payable by bank subsidiaries. These dividends are subject to various legal and regulatory restrictions. The federal banking agencies have indicated that paying dividends that deplete a depositary institution&#8217;s capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice. Moreover, the federal agencies have issued policy statements that provide that bank holding companies and insured banks should generally only pay dividends out of current operating earnings. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Safety and soundness requirements. Banks must be operated in a safe and sound manner and meet standards applicable to internal controls, information systems, internal audit, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth, and compensation, as well as other operational and management standards. These safety and soundness requirements give bank regulatory agencies significant latitude in exercising their supervisory authority and the authority to initiate informal or formal enforcement actions. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Requirements for notice, application and approval, or non-objection of acquisitions and certain other activities conducted directly or in subsidiaries of the Bancorp or the Bank. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act (&#8220;CRA&#8221;). The CRA requires that banks help meet the credit needs in their communities, including the availability of credit to low and moderate income individuals. If the Bank fails to adequately serve its communities, restrictions may be imposed, including denials of applications for branches, for adding subsidiaries or affiliate companies, for engaging in new activities or for the merger with or purchase of other financial institutions. In its last reported examination by the FDIC in July 2013, the Bank received a CRA rating of &#8220;Satisfactory.&#8221; 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act, the USA Patriot Act, and other anti-money laundering laws. These laws and regulations require financial institutions to assist U.S. government agencies in detecting and preventing money laundering and other illegal acts by maintaining policies, procedures and controls designed to detect and report money laundering, terrorist financing, and other suspicious activity. Regulatory authorities routinely examine financial institutions for compliance with these obligations, and failure of a financial institution to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, or to comply with all of the relevant laws or regulations, could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the institution, including causing applicable bank regulatory authorities not to approve merger or acquisition transactions when regulatory approval is required or to prohibit such transactions even if approval is not required. Regulatory authorities have imposed cease and desist orders and civil money penalties against institutions found to be violating these obligations. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Compliance with the regulations of the U.S. Treasury Department&#8217;s Office of Foreign Assets Control (&#8220;OFAC&#8221;). OFAC administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions against targeted foreign countries and regimes, under authority of various laws, including designated foreign countries, nationals and others. OFAC publishes lists of specially designated targets and countries. We and our bank are responsible for, among other things, blocking accounts of, and transactions with, such targets and countries, prohibiting unlicensed trade and financial transactions with them and reporting blocked transactions after their occurrence. Failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious legal and reputational consequences, including causing applicable bank regulatory authorities not to approve merger or acquisition transactions when regulatory approval is required or to prohibit such transactions even if approval is not required. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Limitations on the amount of loans to one borrower and its affiliates and to executive officers and directors. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Limitations on transactions with affiliates. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Restrictions on the nature and amount of any investments in, and the ability to underwrite, certain securities. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Requirements for opening of intra- and interstate branches. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Compliance with truth in lending and other consumer protection and disclosure laws to ensure equal access to credit and to protect consumers in credit transactions. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Compliance with provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (&#8220;GLB Act&#8221;) and other federal and state laws dealing with privacy for nonpublic personal information of customers. The federal bank regulators have adopted rules limiting the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose non-public information about consumers to unaffiliated third parties. These limitations require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and, in some circumstances, allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to an unaffiliated third party. These regulations affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial companies and conveyed to outside vendors. 

&#160; 

Under Section 1280 et seq . of the California Financial Code, California-based bank holding companies and their subsidiaries are subject to examination and supervision by, and may be required to file reports with, the DBO. DBO approvals are also required for bank holding companies to acquire control of banks. 

&#160; 

Additional Restrictions on Bancorp and Bank Activities 

&#160; 

Subject to prior notice or Federal Reserve approval, bank holding companies may generally engage in, or acquire shares of companies engaged in, activities determined by the Federal Reserve to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. Bank holding companies which elect and retain &#8220;financial holding company&#8221; status pursuant to the GLB Act may engage in these nonbanking activities and broader securities, insurance, merchant banking and other activities that are determined to be &#8220;financial in nature&#8221; or are incidental or complementary to activities that are financial in nature without prior Federal Reserve approval. Pursuant to the GLB Act and the Dodd-Frank Act, in order to elect and retain financial holding company status, a bank holding company and all depository institution subsidiaries of a bank holding company must be well capitalized and well managed, and, except in limited circumstances, depository subsidiaries must be in satisfactory compliance with the CRA. Failure to sustain compliance with these requirements or correct any non-compliance within a fixed time period could lead to divestiture of subsidiary banks or require all activities to conform to those permissible for a bank holding company. The Bancorp has not elected financial holding company status and does not believe it has engaged in any activities determined by the Federal Reserve to be financial in nature or incidental or complementary to activities that are financial in nature, which would, in the absence of financial holding company status, require notice or Federal Reserve approval . 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Pursuant to the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (&#8220;FDI Act&#8221;) and the California Financial Code, California state chartered commercial banks may generally engage in any activity permissible for national banks. Therefore, the Bank may form subsidiaries to engage in the many so-called &#8220;closely related to banking&#8221; or &#8220;nonbanking&#8221; activities commonly conducted by national banks in operating subsidiaries or subsidiaries of bank holding companies. Further, pursuant to the GLB Act, California banks may conduct certain &#8220;financial&#8221; activities in a subsidiary to the same extent as a national bank, provided the bank is and remains &#8220;well-capitalized,&#8221; &#8220;well-managed&#8221; and in satisfactory compliance with the CRA. The Bank currently has no financial subsidiaries. 

&#160; 

Regulation of the Bank 

&#160; 

As a California commercial bank whose deposits are insured by the FDIC, the Bank is subject to regulation, supervision, and regular examination by the DBO and the FDIC, as the Bank&#8217;s primary Federal regulator, and must also comply with certain applicable regulations of the Federal Reserve. Specific federal and state laws and regulations which are applicable to banks regulate, among other things, the scope of their business, their investments, their reserves against deposits, the timing of the availability of deposited funds, their activities relating to dividends, the nature and amount of and collateral for certain loans, servicing and foreclosing on loans, borrowings, capital requirements, certain check-clearing activities, branching, and mergers and acquisitions. California banks are also subject to statutes and regulations including Federal Reserve Regulation O and Federal Reserve Act Sections 23A and 23B and Regulation W, which restrict or limit loans or extensions of credit to &#8220;insiders,&#8221; including officers, directors, and principal shareholders, and affiliates, and purchases of assets from affiliates, including parent bank holding companies, except pursuant to certain exceptions and only on terms and conditions at least as favorable to those prevailing for comparable transactions with unaffiliated parties. The Dodd-Frank Act expanded definitions and restrictions on transactions with affiliates and insiders under Sections 23A and 23B , and also lending limits for derivative transactions, repurchase agreements and securities lending, and borrowing transactions . 

&#160; 

The Bank operates branches and/or loan production offices in California, New York, Illinois, Massachusetts, Texas, Washington, Nevada, Maryland, and New Jersey. While the DBO remains the Bank&#8217;s primary state regulator, the Bank&#8217;s operations in these jurisdictions are subject to examination and supervision by local bank regulators, and transactions with customers in those jurisdictions are subject to local laws, including consumer protection laws. The Bank also operates a branch in Hong Kong and a representative office in Taipei and in Shanghai. The operations of these foreign offices and branches (and limits on the scope of their activities) are subject to local law and regulatory authorities in addition to regulation and supervision by the DBO and the Federal Reserve. 

&#160; 

Enforcement Authority 

&#160; 

The federal and California regulatory structure gives the bank regulatory agencies extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, including policies with respect to the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes. The regulatory agencies have adopted guidelines to assist in identifying and addressing potential safety and soundness concerns before an institution&#8217;s capital becomes impaired. The guidelines establish operational and managerial standards generally relating to: (i) internal controls, information systems, and internal audit systems; (ii) loan documentation; (iii) credit underwriting; (iv) interest-rate exposure; (v) asset growth and asset quality; (vi) loan concentration; and (vii) compensation, fees, and benefits. Further, the regulatory agencies have adopted safety and soundness guidelines for asset quality and for evaluating and monitoring earnings to ensure that earnings are sufficient for the maintenance of adequate capital and reserves. If, as a result of an examination, the DBO or the FDIC should determine that the financial condition, capital resources, asset quality, earnings prospects, management, liquidity, or other aspects of the Bank&#8217;s operations are unsatisfactory or that the Bank or its management is violating or has violated any law or regulation, the DBO and the FDIC have residual authority to: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Require affirmative action to correct any conditions resulting from any violation or practice; 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Direct an increase in capital and the maintenance of higher specific minimum capital ratios, which may preclude the Bank from being deemed &#8220;well -capitalized&#8221; and restrict its ability to accept certain brokered deposits, among other things; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Restrict the Bank&#8217;s growth geographically, by products and services, or by mergers and acquisitions; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Issue, or require the Bank to enter into, informal or formal enforcement actions, including required Board resolutions, memoranda of understanding, written agreements and consent or cease and desist orders or prompt corrective action orders to take corrective action and cease unsafe and unsound practices; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Require prior approval of senior executive officer or director changes, remove officers and directors, and assess civil monetary penalties; and 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Terminate FDIC insurance, revoke the Bank&#8217;s charter, take possession of , close and liquidate the Bank, or appoint the FDIC as receiver. 

&#160; 

The Federal Reserve has similar enforcement authority over bank holding companies and commonly takes parallel action in conjunction with actions taken by a subsidiary bank&#8217;s regulators. 

&#160; 

In the exercise of their supervisory and examination authority, the regulatory agencies have recently emphasized corporate governance, stress testing, enterprise risk management and other board responsibilities; anti-money laundering compliance and enhanced high risk customer due diligence; vendor management; cyber security and fair lending and other consumer compliance obligations. 

&#160; 

Deposit Insurance 

&#160; 

The FDIC is an independent federal agency that insures deposits, up to prescribed statutory limits, of federally insured banks and savings institutions and safeguards the safety and soundness of the banking and savings industries. The FDIC insures our customer deposits through the Deposit Insurance Fund (the &#8220;DIF&#8221;) up to prescribed limits of $250,000 for each depositor pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act. The amount of FDIC assessments paid by each DIF member institution is based on its relative risk of default as measured by regulatory capital ratios and other supervisory factors. As an institution with $10 billion or more in assets, the FDIC uses a performance score and a loss-severity score to calculate an initial assessment rate for the Bank. In calculating these scores, the FDIC uses the Bank&#8217;s capital level and regulatory supervisory ratings and certain financial measures to assess the Bank&#8217;s ability to withstand asset-related stress and funding-related stress. The FDIC also has the ability to make discretionary adjustments to the total score based upon significant risk factors that are not adequately captured in the calculations. In addition to ordinary assessments described above, the FDIC has the ability to impose special assessments in certain instances. 

&#160; 

All FDIC-insured institutions are also required to pay assessments to the FDIC to fund interest payments on bonds issued by the Financing Corporation (&#8220;FICO"), an agency of the federal government established to recapitalize the predecessor to the DIF. These assessments will continue until the FICO bonds mature in 2017 through 2019 . 

&#160; 

Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC has established 2.0% as the designated reserve ratio (DRR), that is, the ratio of the DIF to insured deposits. The FDIC has adopted a plan under which it will meet the statutory minimum DRR of 1.35% (formerly 1.15%) by September 30, 2020, the deadline imposed by the Dodd-Frank Act. The Dodd-Frank requires the FDIC to offset the effect of the increase in the statutory minimum DRR to 1.35% on institutions with assets less than $10 billion. The FDIC has not yet announced how it will implement this offset or how larger institutions will be affected by it.

&#160;

&#160; 

We are generally unable to control the amount of assessments that we are required to pay for FDIC insurance. If there are additional bank or financial institution failures or if the FDIC otherwise determines, we may be required to pay even higher FDIC assessments than the recently increased levels. These increases in FDIC insurance assessments may have a material and adverse effect on our earnings and could have a material adverse effect on the value of, or market for, our common stock. 

&#160; 

Under the FDI Act, the FDIC may terminate deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC. 

&#160; 

Prompt Corrective Action Provisions 

&#160; 

The FDI Act requires the federal bank regulatory agencies to take &#8220;prompt corrective action&#8221; with respect to a depository institution if that institution does not meet certain capital adequacy standards, including requiring the prompt submission of an acceptable capital restoration plan. Depending on the bank&#8217;s capital ratios, the agencies&#8217; regulations define five categories in which an insured depository institution will be placed: well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized. At each successive lower capital category, an insured bank is subject to more restrictions, including restrictions on the bank&#39;s activities, operational practices or the ability to pay dividends. Based upon its capital levels, a bank that is classified as well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, or undercapitalized may be treated as though it were in the next lower capital category if the appropriate federal banking agency, after notice and opportunity for hearing, determines that an unsafe or unsound condition, or an unsafe or unsound practice, warrants such treatment. 

&#160; 

The prompt corrective action standards were changed when the new capital rule ratios became effective on January 1, 2015. Under the new standards, in order to be considered well-capitalized, the Bank is required to have met the new common equity Tier 1 ratio of 6.5%, an increased Tier 1 ratio of 8% (increased from 6%), a total capital ratio of 10% (unchanged) and a leverage ratio of 5% (unchanged). 

&#160; 

Dividends 

&#160; 

Holders of the Bancorp&#8217;s common stock are entitled to receive dividends as and when declared by the board of directors out of funds legally available therefore under the laws of the State of Delaware. Delaware corporations such as the Bancorp may make distributions to their stockholders out of their surplus, or in case there is no surplus, out of their net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared and/or the preceding fiscal year. However, dividends may not be paid out of a corporation&#8217;s net profits if, after the payment of the dividend, the corporation&#8217;s capital would be less than the capital represented by the issued and outstanding stock of all classes having a preference upon the distribution of assets. 

&#160; 

It is the Federal Reserve&#8217;s policy that bank holding companies should generally pay dividends on common stock only out of income available over the past year, and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the organization&#8217;s expected future needs and financial condition. It is also the Federal Reserve&#8217;s policy that bank holding companies should not maintain dividend levels that undermine their ability to be a source of strength to their banking subsidiaries. The Federal Reserve also discourages dividend policy payment ratios that are at maximum allowable levels unless both asset quality and capital are very strong. 

&#160; 

The terms of our Junior Subordinated Notes also limit our ability to pay dividends on our common stock. If we are not current on our payment of interest on our Junior Subordinated Notes, we may not pay dividends on our common stock. The amount of future dividends by the Bancorp will depend on our earnings, financial condition, capital requirements and other factors, and will be determined by our board of directors in accordance with the capital management and dividend policy. 

&#160; 

The Bank is a legal entity that is separate and distinct from its holding company. The Bancorp is dependent on the performance of the Bank for funds which may be received as dividends from the Bank for use in the operation of the Bancorp and the ability of the Bancorp to pay dividends to stockholders. Future cash dividends by the Bank will also depend upon management&#8217;s assessment of future capital requirements, contractual restrictions, and other factors. When phased in, the new capital rules will restrict dividends by the Bank if the capital conservation buffer is not achieved. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

The power of the board of directors of the Bank to declare cash dividends to the Bancorp is subject to California law, which restricts the amount available for cash dividends to the lesser of a bank&#8217;s retained earnings or net income for its last three fiscal years (less any distributions to stockholders made during such period). Where the above test is not met, cash dividends may still be paid, with the prior approval of the DBO , in an amount not exceeding the greatest of (i) retained earnings of the Bank; (ii) the net income of the Bank for its last fiscal year; or (iii) the net income of the Bank for its current fiscal year. Future cash dividends by the Bank will also depend upon management&#8217;s assessment of future capital requirements, contractual restrictions, and other factors. 

&#160; 

Operations and Consumer Compliance Laws 

&#160; 

The Bank must comply with numerous federal and state anti-money laundering and consumer protection statutes and implementing regulations, including the USA Patriot Act, the Bank Secrecy Act, the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, the CRA, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, as amended by the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the National Flood Insurance Act, the California Homeowner Bill of Rights and various federal and state privacy protection laws. The Bank and the Company are also subject to federal and state laws prohibiting unfair or fraudulent business practices, untrue or misleading advertising, and unfair competition. 

&#160; 

These laws and regulations also mandate certain disclosure and reporting requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must deal with customers when taking deposits, making loans, collecting loans, and providing other services. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations can subject the Bank to lawsuits and penalties, including enforcement actions, injunctions, fines or criminal penalties, punitive damages to consumers, and the loss of certain contractual rights. 

&#160; 

Federal Home Loan Bank System 

&#160; 

The Bank is a member of the FHLB of San Francisco. Among other benefits, each FHLB serves as a reserve or central bank for its members within its assigned region. Each FHLB is financed primarily from the sale of consolidated obligations of the FHLB system. Each FHLB makes available loans or advances to its members in compliance with the policies and procedures established by the board of directors of the individual FHLB. Each member of the FHLB of San Francisco is required to own stock in an amount equal to the greater of (i) a membership stock requirement with an initial cap of $15 million (100% of &#8220;membership asset value&#8221; as defined), or (ii) an activity based stock requirement (based on a percentage of outstanding advances). There can be no assurance that the FHLB will pay dividends at the same rate it has paid in the past, or that it will pay any dividends in the future. 

&#160; 

Impact of Monetary Policies 

&#160; 

The earnings and growth of the Bank are largely dependent on its ability to maintain a favorable differential or spread between the yield on its interest-earning assets and the rates paid on its deposits and other interest-bearing liabilities. As a result, the Bank&#8217;s performance is influenced by general economic conditions, both domestic and foreign, the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government, and the policies of the regulatory agencies. The Federal Reserve implements national monetary policies (such as seeking to curb inflation and combat recession) by its open-market operations in U.S. government securities, by adjusting the required level of reserves for financial institutions subject to its reserve requirements, and by varying the discount rate applicable to borrowings by banks from the Federal Reserve Banks. The actions of the Federal Reserve in these areas influence the growth of bank loans, investments, and deposits, and also affect interest rates charged on loans and deposits. The nature and impact of any future changes in monetary policies cannot be predicted. 

&#160; 

Securities and Corporate Governance 

&#160; 

The Bancorp is subject to the disclosure and regulatory requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, both as administered by the SEC. As a company listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, the Company is subject to NASDAQ listing standards for listed companies. The Bancorp is also subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, and other federal and state laws and regulations which address, among other issues, required executive certification of financial presentations, corporate governance requirements for board audit and compensation committees and their members, and disclosure of controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, auditing and accounting, executive compensation, and enhanced and timely disclosure of corporate information. NASDAQ has also adopted corporate governance rules, which are intended to allow stockholders and investors to more easily and efficiently monitor the performance of companies and their directors. Under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, management and the Bancorp&#8217;s independent registered public accounting firm are required to assess the effectiveness of the Bancorp&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015. These assessments are included in Part II &#8212; Item 9A &#8212; &#8220;Controls and Procedures.&#8221; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Federal Banking Agency Compensation Guidelines 

&#160; 

Guidelines adopted by the federal banking agencies pursuant to the FDI Act prohibit excessive compensation as an unsafe and unsound practice and describe compensation as excessive when the amounts paid are unreasonable or disproportionate to the services performed by an executive officer, employee, director or principal stockholder. In June 2010, the federal banking agencies issued comprehensive guidance on incentive compensation policies intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risk-taking. 

&#160; 

In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act requires the federal bank regulatory agencies and the SEC to establish joint regulations or guidelines prohibiting certain incentive-based payment arrangements. These regulators must establish regulations or guidelines requiring enhanced disclosure to regulators of incentive-based compensation arrangements. The agencies proposed such regulations in April 2011, but the regulations have not been finalized. 

&#160; 

The scope, content and application of the U.S. banking regulators&#8217; policies on incentive compensation continue to evolve. It cannot be determined at this time whether compliance with such policies will adversely affect the ability of the Bancorp and the Bank to hire, retain and motivate key employees. 

&#160; 

The Federal Reserve will review, as part of the regular, risk-focused examination process, the incentive compensation arrangements of banking organizations, such as us, that are not &#8220;large, complex banking organizations.&#8221; These reviews will be tailored to each organization based on the scope and complexity of the organization&#8217;s activities and the prevalence of incentive compensation arrangements. The findings of the supervisory initiatives will be included in reports of examination. Deficiencies will be incorporated into the organization&#8217;s supervisory ratings, which can affect the organization&#8217;s ability to make acquisitions and take other actions. Enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements, or related risk management control or governance processes, pose a risk to the organization&#8217;s safety and soundness and the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies. 

&#160; 

Audit Requirements 

&#160; 

The Bank is required to have an annual independent audit, alone or as a part of its bank holding company&#8217;s audit, and to prepare all financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The Bank and the Bancorp are also each required to have an audit committee comprised entirely of independent directors. As required by NASDAQ, the Bancorp has certified that its audit committee has adopted formal written charters and meets the requisite number of directors, independence, and other qualification standards. As such, among other requirements, the Bancorp must maintain an audit committee that includes members with banking or related financial management expertise, has access to its own outside counsel, and does not include members who are large customers of the Bank. In addition, because the Bank has more than $3 billion in total assets, it is subject to the FDIC requirements for audit committees of large institutions. 

&#160; 

Regulation of Non-Bank Subsidiaries 

&#160; 

Non-bank subsidiaries are subject to additional or separate regulation and supervision by other state, federal and self-regulatory bodies. Additionally, any foreign-based subsidiaries would also be subject to foreign laws and regulations.
