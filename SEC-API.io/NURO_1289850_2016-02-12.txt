 ITEM 1. BUSINESS Our Business &#151; An Overview NeuroMetrix is an innovative health-care company that develops wearable medical technology and point-of-care tests that help patients and physicians better manage chronic pain, nerve diseases, and sleep disorders. Our business is fully integrated with in-house capabilities spanning product development, manufacturing, regulatory affairs and compliance, sales and marketing, and customer support. We derive revenues from the sale of medical devices and after-market consumable products and accessories. Our products are sold in the United States and selected overseas markets, and are cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and regulators in foreign jurisdictions where appropriate. We have two principal product lines:

&#149; Wearable neuro-stimulation therapeutic devices &#149; Point-of-care neuropathy diagnostic tests 

&#160;

&#160;

Our core expertise in biomedical engineering has been refined over nearly two decades of designing, building and marketing medical devices that stimulate nerves and analyze nerve response for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. We created the market for point-of-care nerve testing and were first to market with sophisticated, wearable technology for management of chronic pain. We also have an experienced management team and Board of Directors. Chronic pain is a significant public health problem. It is defined by the National Institutes of Health as any pain lasting more than 12 weeks in contrast to acute pain which is a normal bodily response to injury or trauma. Chronic pain conditions include painful diabetic neuropathy, or PDN, arthritis, fibromyalgia, sciatica, musculoskeletal pain, cancer pain and many others. Chronic pain may be triggered by an injury or there may be an ongoing cause such as disease or illness. There may also be no clear cause. Pain signals continue to be transmitted in the nervous system over extended periods of time often leading to other health problems. These can include fatigue, sleep disturbance, decreased appetite, and mood changes which cause difficulty in carrying out important activities and contributing to disability and despair. In general, chronic pain cannot be cured. Treatment of chronic pain is focused on reducing pain and improving function. The goal is effective pain management. 

Chronic pain is widespread. It affects over 100 million adults in the United States and more than 1.5 billion people worldwide. The global market for pain management drugs and devices alone was valued at $35 billion in 2012. The estimated incremental impact of chronic pain on health care costs in the United States is over $250 billion per year and lost productivity is estimated to exceed $300 billion per year. 

The most common approach to chronic pain is pain medication. This includes over-the-counter drugs (such as Advil and Motrin), and prescription drugs including anti-convulsants (such as Lyrica and Neurontin) and anti-depressants (such as Cymbalta and Elavil). Topical creams may also be used (such as Zostrix and Bengay). With severe pain, narcotic pain medications may be prescribed (such as codeine, fentanyl, morphine, and oxycodone). The approach to treatment is individualized, drug combinations may be employed, and the results are often hit or miss. Side effects and the potential for addiction are real and the risks are substantial. 

Reflecting the difficulty in treating chronic pain, we believe that inadequate relief leads 25% to 50% of pain sufferers to turn to the over-the-counter market for supplements or alternatives to prescription pain medications. These include non-prescription medications, topical creams, lotions, electrical stimulators, dietary products, braces, sleeves, pads and other items. In total they account for over $4 billion in annual spending in the United States on pain relief products. 

High frequency nerve stimulation is an established treatment for chronic pain supported by numerous clinical studies demonstrating efficacy. In simplified outline, the mechanism of action involves intensive nerve stimulation to activate the body&#146;s central pain inhibition system resulting in widespread analgesia, or pain relief. The nerve stimulation activates brainstem pain centers leading to the release of endogenous opioids that act primarily through the delta opioid receptor to reduce pain signal transmission through the central nervous system. This therapeutic approach is available through deep brain stimulation and through implantable spinal cord stimulation, both of which require surgery and have attendant risks. Non-invasive approaches to neuro-stimulation (transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, or TENS) have achieved limited efficacy in practice due to device limitations, ineffective dosing and low patient compliance. 

Our Strategy There are large and important unmet medical needs in chronic pain treatment. Prescription pain medications and over-the-counter therapies are often inadequate and can lead to other health issues. We believe that controlled, personalized, neuro-stimulation to suppress pain provides an important complement to pain medications. As a medical device company with unique experience in designing devices to manage and alter peripheral nerve function, we believe we are well positioned to make neuro-stimulation widely available to chronic pain sufferers. We have direct experience with neuro-stimulation through our prescription SENSUS wearable pain management device which has been on the market for the past three years and Quell, our over-the-counter, or OTC, wearable device for pain relief which was launched in the second quarter of 2015 and builds upon the core SENSUS neuro-stimulation technology. 

Our primary objective is revenue growth. We expect this to be led by the successful market adoption of Quell. We also expect an important contribution to revenue from DPNCheck, our rapid, accurate diagnostic test for diabetic peripheral neuropathy. 

&#160;

&#160;

Our key business strategies include: 

Driving Commercial Adoption of Key Proprietary Products. &#149; Quell , our OTC wearable device for pain relief, was unveiled at the January 2015 Consumer Electronics Show (CES) and made commercially available in the United States during the second quarter of 2015. Following commercial launch through the end of 2015, approximately 13,800 Quell devices plus electrodes and accessories were shipped to consumers. Quell utilizes OptiTherapy, our proprietary non-invasive neuro-stimulation technology to provide relief from chronic intractable pain, such as nerve pain due to diabetes, fibromyalgia, arthritic pain, and lower back and leg pain. This advanced wearable device is lightweight and can be worn during the day while active, and at night while sleeping. It has been cleared by the FDA for treatment of chronic intractable pain without a doctor&#146;s prescription. Users of the device have the option of using their smartphones to automatically track and personalize their pain therapy. Quell was launched through two distribution channels: a professional channel using a direct sales force to target podiatrists, pain physicians, primary care physicians, and chiropractors who resell the product, and a direct-to-consumer channel using online marketing and lead generation. After establishing the professional and direct to consumer channels, we expanded distribution to include Amazon e-commerce sales and QVC direct response TV, or DRTV, sales. We are developing other distribution channels for broader access to the retail markets. We believe there are significant opportunities to market Quell outside of the United States, particularly in Western Europe, Japan and China; however, we do not intend to approach those markets until we have established a solid presence in the United States. &#149; DPNCheck, our diagnostic test for peripheral neuropathies, was made commercially available in the fourth quarter of 2011. DPNCheck revenues for the years December 31, 2015 and 2014 were approximately $2.3 million and $1.8 million, respectively. Our US sales efforts focus on Medicare Advantage providers who assume financial responsibility and the associated risks for the health care costs of their patients. We believe that DPNCheck presents an attractive clinical case with early detection of neuropathy allowing for earlier clinical intervention to help mitigate the effects of neuropathy on both patient quality of life and cost of care. Also, the diagnosis and documentation of neuropathy provided by DPNCheck helps clarify the patient health profile which, in turn, may have a direct, positive effect on the Medicare Advantage premium received by the provider. We believe that attractive opportunities exist outside the United States including Japan where we received regulatory approval and launched DPNCheck with our distribution partner Omron Healthcare in the third quarter of 2014; in China where we recently received regulatory approval and are working with Omron Healthcare toward commercial launch in the second half of 2016; and in Mexico where our distributor Scienta Farma received regulatory approval and initiated sales in the fourth quarter of 2015. Maintaining a High Level of Research and Development Productivity Our research and development, or R&#38;D, team successfully delivered Quell, an FDA cleared, technologically sophisticated, smart phone integrated product with electrodes and other accessories. We believe that there are no comparable products on the market. Our R&#38;D team is now charged with maintaining and expanding this Quell competitive technological advantage, and enhancing our intellectual property position, through continuing innovation. We expect innovation to take the form of device and software enhancements to improve the user experience, expanded smart phone applications, and new electrode features to optimize therapy. Technological innovation will continue to be one of our top priorities. 

Our Business Model Our products consist of a medical device used in conjunction with a consumable electrode or biosensor. Other accessories and consumables are also available to customers. Our goal for these devices is to build an installed base of active customer accounts and distributors that regularly order aftermarket products to meet their needs. We successfully implemented this model when we started our business with the NC-stat system and applied it to subsequent product generations including the ADVANCE system. Our recently developed products, Quell, SENSUS and DPNCheck, conform to this model. 

&#160;

&#160;

Marketed Products Quell Quell is a wearable device for relief of chronic intractable pain, such as nerve pain due to diabetes and lower back problems. It incorporates our OptiTherapy technology, a collection of proprietary approaches designed to optimize the clinical efficacy of nerve stimulation. These include high power electrical stimulation hardware with precise control, algorithms that automatically determine therapeutic stimulation intensity and compensate for nerve desensitization, and automated detection of user sleep and appropriate adjustment of stimulation level. Quell is comprised of (1) an electronic device carried in a neoprene band that is worn on the upper calf and (2) an electrode that attaches to the device and is the interface between the device and the skin. The device is lightweight and can be worn during the day while active, and at night while sleeping. It has been cleared by the FDA for treatment of chronic intractable pain and will be available OTC. Users of the device have the option of using their smartphones to automatically track and personalize their pain therapy. The device was unveiled at the Consumer Electronics Show in January 2015 and was made commercially available in June 2015. In an independent post-market clinical study of Quell initiated by NeuroMetrix, 81% of subjects reported an improvement in management of their chronic pain and health, and 67% reported a reduction in their use of pain medications. To encourage persons with chronic pain to try Quell, we offer a 60-day trial period during which the product can be returned for a full refund. We estimate, over time, we will see product returns in the range of 20%, as indicated by the results of the post-market clinical study. Quell is currently available at selected physician resellers including podiatrists, pain physicians, primary care physicians, and chiropractors, and also via e-commerce on our designated website at (quellrelief.com) and on Amazon.com, and via DRTV on QVC. We are developing other retail distribution channels to broaden access to consumers. Following commercial launch through the fourth quarter of 2015 approximately 13,800 devices and accessories were shipped to consumers with a total invoiced value of $3.1 million prior to the impact of product returns. 

SENSUS The SENSUS pain therapy device, the technological predecessor to Quell, is a prescription neuro-stimulation device based on TENS for relief of chronic, intractable pain. SENSUS, which was commercially launched in the first quarter of 2013, is a convenient and wearable device that offers physicians and their patients a non-narcotic pain relief option as a complement to medications. SENSUS is comprised of: (1) an electronic device with a strap that is worn on the upper calf and (2) an electrode which attaches to the device. We provide prescribing physicians with PC-based software that links to the device via a USB connection, thereby allowing them to download a record of the patient&#146;s use of the device. The SENSUS device and electrodes were cleared by the FDA for commercial distribution. When medically indicated and supported by proper documentation, TENS devices are generally reimbursed by Medicare and many commercial insurance companies under the DME benefit. We believe SENSUS will have a limited impact on future revenues. SENSUS customers have purchased approximately 10,000 devices through December 31, 2015. 

DPNCheck DPNCheck is a fast, accurate, and quantitative nerve conduction test that is used to evaluate systemic neuropathies such as diabetic peripheral neuropathy, or DPN. It is designed to be used by primary care physicians, endocrinologists, podiatrists and other clinicians at the point-of-care to objectively detect, stage, and monitor DPN. The device measures nerve conduction velocity and response amplitude of the sural nerve, a nerve in the lower leg and ankle. These parameters are widely recognized as sensitive and specific biomarkers of DPN. DPNCheck is comprised of: (1) an electronic hand-held device and (2) a single patient use biosensor. In addition, we provide users with PC-based software that links to the device via a USB connection. This PC software allows physicians to generate reports and manage their sural nerve conduction data. 

DPNCheck is a modified version of our previously marketed NC-stat nerve testing device that has the same clinical indications with respect to DPN. The modified device which costs less than the original device, has the same functionality with respect to sural nerve testing. More than 1.8 million patient studies have been performed using our NC-stat technology and there have been approximately 6.8 million nerve tests. It has 

&#160;

&#160;

been the subject of many published studies, including several studies specifically addressing the accuracy and clinical utility of the device in assessment of DPN. DPNCheck shipments commenced in late 2011 and approximately 2,900 device have been placed with customers through December 31, 2015 

ADVANCE System Our legacy neurodiagnostics business is based on the ADVANCE NCS/EMG System, or the ADVANCE System, which is a comprehensive platform for the performance of traditional nerve conduction studies. The ADVANCE System is comprised of: (1) the ADVANCE device and related modules, (2) various types of electrodes and needles, and (3) a communication hub that enables the physician&#146;s office to network their device to their personal computers and our servers for data archiving, report generation, and other network services. The ADVANCE System is most commonly used with proprietary nerve specific electrode arrays. These electrode arrays combine multiple individual electrodes and embedded microelectronic components into a single patient-use disposable unit. We currently market seven different nerve specific electrode arrays. 

Historically, the ADVANCE System has been marketed to a broad range of physician specialties including neurologists, orthopedic surgeons, primary care physicians, and endocrinologists, and utilized for a variety of different clinical indications including assessment of carpal tunnel syndrome, or CTS, low back and leg pain, and DPN. It is most commonly used in the assessment of CTS. Numerous papers have been published on the use of this technology in this clinical application. More than 1.8 million patient studies have been performed using our NC stat technology and there have been approximately 6.3 million nerve tests, including 700,000 sural nerve tests. As of December 31, 2015, we had an installed base of approximately 500 active customers using are ADVANCE System

* Support was discontinued in the first quarter of 2012. Customers Our customers include consumers, patients, physicians, clinics, hospitals, managed care organizations, retail health businesses, independent distributors in the United States and abroad, and durable medical equipment (DME) suppliers. With the commercial launch of Quell in the second quarter of 2015, our customer base has been expanded to include consumers and patients who purchase the device directly from us. Through December 31, 2015, approximately 13,800 devices were shipped. SENSUS was launched in early 2013 and is sold to DME suppliers who, in turn, distribute the product along with consumables directly to patients. 

&#160;

&#160;

SENSUS customers purchased approximately 2,900 devices during 2015. DPNCheck shipments commenced in late 2011 and approximately 2,900 devices had been placed with customers through December 31, 2015. These customers include managed care organizations, retail health businesses, endocrinologists, podiatrists and primary care physicians. As of December 31, 2015, we had an installed base of approximately 500 active customers using our ADVANCE System. These customers include primary care, internal medicine, orthopedic and hand surgeons, pain medicine physicians, neurologists, physical medicine and rehabilitation, or PM&#38;R, physicians, and neurosurgeons. At December 31, 2015, one customer accounted for 46% of accounts receivable and one customer accounted for 12% of revenue. 

Geographic Information Substantially all of our assets, revenues, and expenses for 2015, 2014, and 2013 were located at or derived from operations in the United States. In addition, we have had sales through distributors in Europe, Asia, the Middle East and various regions. During 2015, 2014, and 2013, international revenues accounted for approximately 19%, 19%, and 16%, respectively, of our total revenues. 

Sales, Marketing, and Distribution Quell was made commercially available in the United States during the second quarter of 2015. Initial distribution involved two channels: a professional channel using a direct sales force to target podiatrists, pain physicians, primary care physicians, and chiropractors who stock and resell the product, and a direct-to-consumer channel using our e-commerce website supported by social media plus traditional marketing. After establishing the professional and direct to consumer channels we expanded distribution to include ecommerce on Amazon.com and DRTV sales on QVC. We plan to make Quell more broadly available through retail distribution in 2016. Marketing for Quell is led by our Senior Vice President and General Manager, Consumer with support from marketing staff and supplemented by outside consultants. We believe there are opportunities for Quell outside the United States, particularly in Western Europe, Japan and China; however, we do not plan to address those markets until we have established a solid presence in the United States. 

SENSUS is sold through a combination of national and regional DME suppliers whose sales representatives call on endocrinologists, podiatrists, and primary care physicians that are challenged with trying to manage chronic pain in their patients, including patients with painful diabetic neuropathy. The efforts of DME suppliers are coordinated from our corporate office. 

Our U.S. sales efforts for DPNCheck are focused on managed care, and specifically Medicare Advantage providers and patient screening services, which we believe represents the most attractive market opportunity. We believe that attractive opportunities are developing in Japan where we received regulatory approval and launched DPNCheck with Omron Healthcare in 2014; in China where we recently received regulatory approval and are working with Omron Healthcare toward commercial launch in the second half of 2016; and in Mexico where our distributor Scienta Farma received regulatory approval and initiated sales in the fourth quarter of 2015. 

Our installed base of ADVANCE accounts is supported by our customer service department. We are not actively pursuing new ADVANCE customers. Interest expressed in new ADVANCE systems by potential customers is handled by our customer service department and our marketing department. Internationally, ADVANCE sales and account support is handled by our network of independent distributors. 

Our marketing support for SENSUS, NC-stat, DPNCheck and ADVANCE is provided by our Senior Vice President of Commercial Operations and staff in our corporate office. 

We invest in technical, clinical, and business practices training for our commercial operations team, marketing staff and sales representatives. We also require attendance at periodic sales and product training programs. Promotion and sales of medical devices are highly regulated not only by the FDA, but also by the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, and the Office of Inspector General, or OIG, and, outside the United States, by other international bodies, and are subject to federal and state fraud and abuse enforcement activities. See FDA and other Governmental Regulation below. 

&#160;

&#160;

Manufacturing and Supply We perform final assembly and servicing of our Quell, SENSUS and DPNCheck devices at our manufacturing facility in Massachusetts. The ADVANCE device, which is no longer in production, but for which we continue to sell accessories was previously manufactured by an outside manufacturer and is now serviced by us. Outside suppliers provide us the subassemblies and components that we use in manufacturing Quell, SENSUS and DPNCheck, as well as our consumable biosensor/electrodes. We do not currently maintain alternative suppliers of subassemblies and key components, or for consumable biosensor/electrodes. In outsourcing, we target companies that meet FDA, International Organization for Standardization, or ISO, and other quality standards supported by internal policies and procedures. Supplier performance is maintained and managed through a corrective action program ensuring all product requirements are met or exceeded. Following the receipt of products or product components from our third-party manufacturers, we conduct the necessary inspection, final assembly, packaging, and labeling at our corporate headquarters facility. We believe these manufacturing relationships minimize our capital investment, provide us with manufacturing expertise, and help control costs. 

Sunburst EMS, Inc. has been manufacturing devices and providing sub-assemblies to us since November 2005. Sunburst currently manufactures subassemblies for Quell, DPNCheck and SENSUS at a facility in Massachusetts. 

Polymer Flexible Circuits, Inc., or Parlex, has been manufacturing electrodes for us since 1999. In 2006 we entered into a manufacturing agreement with Parlex for the manufacture and supply of our requirements of nerve specific electrodes for resale in the United States. Under the agreement, Parlex agreed not to manufacture electrodes to be used to measure nerve conduction for any other company during the term of the agreement and, in some cases, for a period of one year thereafter. This agreement will continue indefinitely until terminated by either party upon not less than 18 months prior written notice to the other party. Parlex manufactures our electrodes at a facility in Massachusetts and also has the ability to perform certain manufacturing steps for our electrodes at a second site located in the United Kingdom. 

Katecho, Inc., a full service original equipment manufacturer, or OEM, specializing in medical and cosmetic devices, manufactures biosensors for use with our DPNCheck devices and electrodes for use with our SENSUS and Quell devices under normal commercial terms contained in our purchase orders. Katecho manufactures electrodes at its facility in Iowa. 

We and our third-party manufacturers are registered with the FDA and subject to compliance with FDA quality system regulations. We are also ISO registered and undergo frequent quality system audits by European agencies. Our ADVANCE System and DPNCheck are cleared for marketing within the United States, Canada, and the European Union. In addition, our neuro-stimulation systems, Quell and SENSUS, are cleared for marketing in the United States. Our facility is subject to periodic inspections by regulatory authorities, and may undergo compliance inspections conducted by the FDA and corresponding state agencies. As a registered device manufacturer, we will undergo regularly scheduled FDA quality system inspections. However, additional FDA inspections may occur if deemed necessary by the FDA. 

Research and Development We believe that we have research and development (R&#38;D) capability that is unique to the industry with nearly two decades of experience in developing diagnostic and therapeutic devices involving the stimulation and measurement of nerve signals for clinical purposes. This group has extensive experience in neurophysiology, biomedical instrumentation, signal processing, biomedical sensors, and information systems. Our R&#38;D team works closely with our marketing group and customers to design products that are focused on improving clinical outcomes. The team consists of ten people including two who hold M.D. degrees and three who hold Ph.D. degrees. It includes the extensive involvement of our founder and Chief Executive Officer who holds both M.D. and Ph.D. degrees and who also coordinates the clinical programs that we support. 

R&#38;D efforts currently encompass the following areas:

&#149; Quell Innovation . Quell utilizes our proprietary wearable intensive nerve stimulation (WINS) technology to provide relief from chronic pain which can encompass lower back problems, fibromyalgia, arthritis, painful diabetic neuropathy and others. Quell is unique among OTC 

&#160;

&#160;

neuro-stimulation products in its clinical indications, technology, personalization and digital health features. Our R&#38;D efforts to date have provided us first-to-market competitive advantage. We anticipate that success will attract competition and that we must continually innovate to maintain a leadership position. Accordingly, our R&#38;D team is developing the next generation Quell to improve the user experience, optimize therapy, expand health tracking, and modify the electrodes to help ensure appropriate usage. Also, we are exploring new clinical indications such as restless leg syndrome. We intend to strengthen our intellectual property position with the development of additional know-how and a growing body of patent applications. &#149; Support for DPNCheck. DPNCheck is our quantitative nerve conduction test for peripheral neuropathies including DPN. Its usage is growing in the Medicare Advantage market in the United States and in Japan where it was launched in 2014. DPNCheck recently received regulatory approval in China and we are working with Omron Healthcare toward commercial launch in the second half of 2016. The characteristics of these markets often require device modification for local acceptance which, in turn, involves our R&#38;D team. We are collaborating with Omron Healthcare in Asia for DPNCheck and anticipate continuing engineering support requirements. &#149; Support clinical studies for our wearable technology. We recently completed an independent post-market clinical study for Quell. Results were positive with 81% of subjects reporting an improvement in their chronic pain and overall health, and 67% reporting a reduction in their use of pain medications while using Quell. This study has been helpful to our marketing efforts and points to the need to continue to build the clinical foundation for Quell. During 2016 we intend to fund new clinical studies addressing the efficacy of our wearable technology. Research and development expenses were approximately $3.9 million, $4.1 million, and $3.4 million for 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. 

Clinical Program Our clinical program operates under the direction of our Chief Executive Officer. This may from time-to-time be comprised of internal, collaborative, and external clinical studies. Internal clinical studies are designed and implemented directly by us for the purposes of product design and early clinical validation. Collaborative studies are conducted together with leading researchers around the world to provide clinical validation and to explore the clinical utility of our products. External studies are entirely independent of us, although in many cases the researchers request unrestricted grants for financial and/or material support, such as for devices and consumables. External studies may examine the clinical performance and utility of our products or our products may be used as outcomes measures. We actively seek to publish our clinical study results in leading peer-reviewed journals while also encouraging our clinical collaborators and clinical study grant recipients to do the same. 

During the third quarter of 2015 we completed an external pilot study with a leading researcher at the Massachusetts General Hospital employing our wearable technology for restless leg syndrome, or RLS. The results indicated a meaningful reduction in RLS symptoms and as a result, we will consider a study in a larger RLS population. Also during the third quarter of 2015 we completed an external study managed by Ipsos-Vantis of our wearable technology for chronic pain among subjects with several diseases accompanied by chronic pain. The results indicated a statistically significant improvement in chronic pain and a reduction in use of pain medications. The encouraging results have led us to planning further studies during 2016 with the goal of expanding the clinical foundation for our wearable technology for chronic pain. 

Competition We believe there is no direct competition to our neuro-stimulation devices, Quell and SENSUS, for the treatment of chronic pain. The most common approach to chronic pain is pain medication. This includes over-the-counter drugs (such as Advil and Motrin), and prescription drugs including anti-convulsants (such as Lyrica and Neurontin) and anti-depressants (such as Cymbalta and Elavil). Topical creams may also be used (such as Zostrix and Bengay). With severe pain, narcotic pain medications may be prescribed (such as codeine, fentanyl, morphine, and oxycodone). The approach to treatment is individualized, drug combinations may be employed, and the results are often hit or miss. Side effects and the potential for addiction are real and the risks are substantial. 

&#160;

&#160;

Reflecting the difficulty in treating chronic pain, inadequate relief leads many pain sufferers to turn to the over-the-counter market for supplements or alternatives to prescription pain medications. These include non-prescription medications, topical creams, lotions, electrical stimulators, dietary products, braces, sleeves, pads and other items. In total they account for over $4 billion in annual spending in the United States on pain relief products. 

High frequency nerve stimulation is an established treatment for chronic pain supported by numerous clinical studies demonstrating efficacy. In simplified outline, the mechanism of action involves intensive nerve stimulation to activate the body&#146;s central pain inhibition system resulting in widespread analgesia, or pain relief. The nerve stimulation activates brainstem pain centers leading to the release of endogenous opioids that act primarily through the delta opioid receptor to reduce pain signal transmission through the central nervous system. This therapeutic approach is available through deep brain stimulation and through implantable spinal cord stimulation; however, both require surgery and have attendant risks. Non-invasive approaches to neuro-stimulation (transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, or TENS) have achieved limited efficacy in practice due to device limitations, ineffective dosing and low patient compliance. We believe that Quell and SENSUS clinical and market claims covering chronic pain and sleep, technical characteristics of high power and automation, and the digital health integration characteristics (Quell), place our products in a unique neuro-stimulation category. There are numerous manufacturers of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation devices including widely marketed over-the-counter TENS such as Sanofi&#146;s IcyHotSmartRelief, Omron PM3030 and Homedics RapidRelief. 

We believe that DPNCheck is currently the only objective and standardized test for DPN widely available at the point-of-care. The American Diabetes Association, or ADA, and other organizations recommend at least annual evaluation of all people with diabetes for DPN. Due to cost and availability, this screen is typically performed with a simple (5.07/10g) monofilament. This subjective method identifies late stage neuropathy where intervention is generally limited to foot care. Experts in the field have indicated that there is an unmet need for a practical, objective, and sensitive test for diabetic neuropathy that can be widely deployed in the regular care of all people with diabetes. Monofilaments (5.07/10g) are a commodity sold by a number of medical supply companies. 

There are several companies that sell neurodiagnostic devices that compete with our ADVANCE System. These companies include Cadwell Laboratories, Inc. and Natus Medical Incorporated. Natus Medical Incorporated has substantially greater financial resources than we do. Natus Medical Incorporated and Cadwell Laboratories, Inc. have established reputations as having effective worldwide distribution channels for medical instruments to neurologists and PM&#38;R physicians. 

Intellectual Property We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, and other intellectual property laws, nondisclosure agreements and other measures to protect our proprietary technology, intellectual property rights, and know-how. We hold issued utility patents covering a number of important aspects of our Quell, SENSUS, and DPNCheck and ADVANCE products. We believe that in order to have a competitive advantage, we must develop and maintain the proprietary aspects of our technologies. We also require our employees, consultants and advisors, whom we expect to work on our products, to agree to disclose and assign to us all inventions conceived, developed using our property, or which relate to our business. Despite any measures taken to protect our intellectual property, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. 

Patents As of December 31, 2015, we had 43 issued U.S. patents, two issued foreign patent, and 34 pending patent applications, including 15 U.S. applications, and 18 foreign national applications. Our wearable therapeutic products have one issued utility patent and two issued design patents. In addition, there are 26 pending utility and design patent applications. A utility patent was recently issued that covers the core technology deployed in our DPNCheck diagnostic device. We have filed two additional utility patent applications for our DPNCheck diagnostic device. 

&#160;

&#160;

With regard to our legacy neurodiagnostic products, our issued design patents began to expire in 2015, and our issued utility patents begin to expire in 2017. In particular, seven of our issued U.S. utility patents covering various aspects of the legacy neurodiagnostic products will expire on the same date in 2017. Although the patent protection for material aspects of these products covered by the claims of the patents will be lost at that time, we have additional patents and patent applications directed to other novel inventions that will have patent terms extending beyond 2017. 

The medical device industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent litigation based on allegations of patent infringement. Patent litigation can involve complex factual and legal questions, and its outcome is uncertain. Any claim relating to infringement of patents that is successfully asserted against us may require us to pay substantial damages. Even if we were to prevail, any litigation could be costly and time-consuming and would divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations. Our success will also depend in part on our not infringing patents issued to others, including our competitors and potential competitors. If our products are found to infringe the patents of others, our development, manufacture, and sale of these potential products could be severely restricted or prohibited. In addition, our competitors may independently develop similar technologies. Because of the importance of our patent portfolio to our business, we may lose market share to our competitors if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights. 

A patent infringement suit brought against us may force us or any strategic partners or licensees to stop or delay developing, manufacturing, or selling potential products that are claimed to infringe a third-party&#146;s intellectual property, unless that party grants us rights to use its intellectual property. In such cases, we may be required to obtain licenses to patents or proprietary rights of others in order to continue to commercialize our products. However, we may not be able to obtain any licenses required under any patents or proprietary rights of third parties on acceptable terms, or at all. Even if we were able to obtain rights to the third-party&#146;s intellectual property, these rights may be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same intellectual property. Ultimately, we may be unable to commercialize some of our potential products or may have to cease some of our business operations as a result of patent infringement claims, which could severely harm our business. 

Trademarks We hold domestic registrations for the trademarks NEUROMETRIX, Quell, DPNCheck, SENSUS, and NC-stat. We use a trademark for ADVANCE, OptiTherapy, and Wearable Pain Relief Technology. We hold certain foreign registrations for the marks NEUROMETRIX, NC-stat, and SENSUS. 

Third-Party Reimbursement Procedures performed with our neurodiagnostic medical devices including ADVANCE and DPNCheck may be paid for by third-party payers, including government health programs, such as Medicare, and private insurance and managed care organizations. The 2015 Physicians Fee Schedule published by CMS includes CPT 95905 for nerve conduction studies performed with pre-configured electrode arrays such as are used with the DPNCheck device and the ADVANCE System. 

We believe that physicians are generally receiving reimbursement under CPT 95905 from Medicare for nerve conduction studies performed for carpal tunnel syndrome using pre-configured electrode arrays that meet the medical necessity requirements in their local Medicare region but that commercial insurers are generally not providing reimbursement. Reimbursement by third-party payers is an important element of success for medical device companies. We do not foresee a significant near-term improvement in reimbursement for procedures performed with ADVANCE and DPNCheck. 

In the United States, some insured individuals are receiving their medical care through managed care programs which monitor and often require pre-approval of the services that a member will receive. Some managed care programs are paying their providers on a per capita basis a predetermined annual payment per member which puts the providers at financial risk for the services provided to their members. This is generally the case under Medicare Advantage where contracting insurers receive a monthly capitated fee from CMS to provide all necessary medical care to participating members. These capitated fees are adjusted under CMS&#146;s risk-adjustment model which uses health status indicators, or risk scores, to ensure the adequacy of payment. Members with higher risk codes generally require more healthcare resources than those with lower risk codes. 

&#160;

&#160;

In turn, the insurer fully absorbs the risk of patient health care costs. Insurers may share a portion of the risk with provider organizations such as independent practice associations (IPAs) with whom they contract to provide medical services to their members. Proper assessment of each member&#146;s health status and accurate coding helps to assure that insurers receive capitation fees consistent with the cost of treating these members. Nerve conduction testing can provide valuable, early identification of neuropathy leading to clinical interventions that can reduce health care costs. Also, these tests provide valuable input regarding each member&#146;s health risk status which can result in more appropriate capitated payments from CMS. We believe that the clinical and economic proposition for DPNCheck is attractive to Medicare Advantage insurers and risk bearing provider organizations. We are focusing our sales effort for DPNCheck on the Medicare Advantage managed care market segment. 

We believe that the SENSUS pain management therapeutic system is considered a durable medical equipment (DME) benefit and is reimbursed for chronic pain by Medicare and many commercial insurers under HCPCS code EO730 for the device and under HCPCS code A4595 for the consumable electrodes. These pre-existing codes apply to DME benefits employing transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation equipment. We expect that Quell will generally not be reimbursed by third party payers. 

We believe that the overall escalating cost of medical products and services has led to, and will continue to lead to, increased pressures on the healthcare industry to reduce the costs of products and services. 

Our success in selling DPNCheck, SENSUS and ADVANCE will depend upon, among other things, our customers receiving, and our potential customers' expectation that they will receive sufficient reimbursement or patient capitated premium adjustments from third-party payers for procedures or therapies using these products. See &#147;Risk Factors,&#148; &#147;If health care providers are unable to obtain sufficient reimbursement or other financial incentives from third-party health care payers related to the use of our products other than Quell, the adoption of our products and our future product sales will be materially adversely affected.&#148; 

FDA and Other Governmental Regulation FDA Regulation Our products are medical devices subject to extensive regulation by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and the regulations promulgated thereunder, as well as by other regulatory bodies in the United States and abroad. The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes on the basis of the amount of risk associated with the medical device and the controls deemed necessary to reasonably ensure their safety and effectiveness:

&#149; Class I, requiring general controls, including labeling, device listing, reporting and, for some products, adherence to good manufacturing practices through the FDA&#146;s quality system regulations and pre-market notification; &#149; Class II, requiring general controls and special controls, which may include performance standards and post-market surveillance; and &#149; Class III, requiring general controls and pre-market approval, or PMA, which may include post-approval conditions and post-market surveillance. Before being introduced into the market, our products must obtain market clearance or approval through the 510(k) pre-market notification process, the de novo review process or the PMA process, unless they qualify for an exemption from these processes. See &#147;Risk Factors,&#148; &#147;We are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA which could restrict the sales and marketing of the Quell, SENSUS and DPNCheck devices and the ADVANCE System, as well as other products for which we may seek FDA clearance or approval, and could cause us to incur significant costs.&#148; 

510(k) Pre-Market Notification Process To obtain 510(k) clearance, we must submit a pre-market notification demonstrating that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed Class I or II medical device or to a Class III device marketed prior to May 28, 1976 for which the FDA has not required the submission of a PMA application. In some cases, we may be required to perform clinical trials to support a claim of substantial equivalence. 

&#160;

&#160;

If clinical trials are required, we must submit an application for an investigational device exemption, or IDE, which must be cleared by the FDA prior to the start of a clinical investigation, unless the device and clinical investigation are considered non-significant risk by the FDA or are exempt from the IDE requirements. It generally takes three months from the date of the pre-market notification submission to obtain a final 510(k) decision, but it can be significantly longer. 

After a medical device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, requires the submission of a new 510(k) clearance or could require de novo classification or PMA. The FDA allows each company to make this determination, but the FDA can review the decision. If the FDA disagrees with a company&#146;s decision not to seek FDA authorization, the FDA may require the company to seek 510(k) clearance or PMA. The FDA also can require the company to cease marketing and/or recall the medical device in question until its regulatory status is resolved. 

De Novo Review Process If a previously unclassified new medical device does not qualify for the 510(k) pre-market notification process because there is no predicate device to which it is substantially equivalent, and if the device may be adequately regulated through general controls or special controls, the device may be eligible for de novo classification through what is called the de novo review process. In order to use the de novo review process, a company must receive a letter from the FDA stating that, because the device has been found not substantially equivalent to a legally marketed Class I or II medical device or to a Class III device marketed prior to May 28, 1976 for which the FDA has not required the submission of a PMA application, it has been placed into Class III. After receiving this letter, the company, within 30 days, must submit to the FDA a request for a risk based down classification of the device from Class III to Class I or II based on the device&#146;s moderate or low risk profile which meets the definition of a Class I or Class II medical device. The FDA then has 60 days in which to decide whether to down classify the device. If the FDA agrees that a lower classification is warranted, it will issue a new regulation describing the device type and, for a Class II device, publish a Special Controls guidance document. The Special Controls guidance document specifies the scope of the device type and the recommendations for submission of subsequent devices for the same intended use. If a product is classified as Class II through the de novo review process, then that device may serve as a predicate device for subsequent 510(k) pre-market notifications. 

PMA Process If a medical device does not qualify for the 510(k) pre-market notification process and is not eligible for clearance through the de novo review process, a company must submit a PMA application. The PMA requires more extensive pre-filing testing than is required in the 510(k) and is more costly, lengthy and uncertain. The FDA will decide within 45 days of receiving a PMA whether it is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review and if the PMA is complete, the FDA will notify the applicant that the PMA has been filed. The PMA process can take one to three years or longer, from the time the PMA application is filed with the FDA. The PMA process requires the company to prove that the medical device is safe and effective for its intended purpose. A PMA typically includes extensive pre-clinical and clinical trial data, and information about the device, its design, manufacture, labeling and components. Before approving a PMA, the FDA generally also performs an on-site inspection of manufacturing facilities for the product to ensure compliance with the FDA&#146;s quality system regulation, or QSR. 

If FDA approves the PMA, the approved indications may be more limited than those originally sought. In addition, FDA&#146;s approval order may include post-approval conditions that the FDA believes necessary to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution and post-market study requirements. Failure to comply with the post-approval conditions can result in adverse enforcement or administrative actions, including the withdrawal of the approval. Approval of a new PMA application or a PMA supplement may be required in the event of modifications to the device, including to its labeling, intended use or indication, or its manufacturing process that affect safety and effectiveness. 

&#160;

&#160;

Post-Approval Obligations After a device is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include:

&#149; the FDA&#146;s QSR, which requires manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other good manufacturing practice and quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the manufacturing process; &#149; labeling regulations and FDA prohibitions against the promotion of products for uncleared or unapproved uses (known as off-label uses), as well as requirements to provide adequate information on both risks and benefits; &#149; medical device reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to FDA any device that may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur; &#149; correction and removal reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and device recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA caused by the device which may present a risk to health; &#149; post-market surveillance regulations, which apply to Class II or III devices if the FDA has issued a post-market surveillance order and the failure of the device would be reasonably likely to have serious adverse health consequences, the device is expected to have significant use in the pediatric population, the device is intended to be implanted in the human body for more than one year, or the device is intended to be used to support or sustain life and to be used outside a user facility; &#149; regular and for cause inspections by FDA to review a manufacturer&#146;s facilities and their compliance with applicable FDA requirements; and &#149; the FDA&#146;s recall authority, whereby it can ask, or order, device manufacturers to recall from the market a product that is in violation of applicable laws and regulations. Regulatory Approvals and Clearances The ADVANCE System received 510(k) clearance as a Class II medical device in April 2008 for its intended use by physicians to perform nerve conduction studies and needle electromyography procedures. 

The NC-stat System is also a Class II medical device and has been the subject of several 510(k) clearances, the most recent in July 2006 (K060584). The NC-stat System is cleared for use to stimulate and measure neuromuscular signals that are useful in diagnosing and evaluating systemic and entrapment neuropathies. We believe our NC-stat DPNCheck, or DPNCheck, device is a technical modification to the 510(k) cleared NC-stat device and has the same intended use, and therefore does not raise safety or effectiveness questions. Under the FDA&#146;s published guidance on 510(k) requirements for modified devices, we do not believe that a 510(k) submission is required for DPNCheck. 

As transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulators, the SENSUS and Quell pain therapy devices are Class II medical devices which received 510(k) clearance from the FDA in August 2012 and July 2014, respectively. In November 2012, the FDA provided 510(k) clearance for the disposable electrode used in conjunction with the SENSUS device, and in July 2013, the FDA provided 510(k) clearance for the use of SENSUS during sleep. The intended use of the SENSUS pain management therapeutic system is the symptomatic relief and management of chronic pain. In July 2014, our Quell device received 510(k) clearance for over-the-counter use and in November 2014, our Quell disposable electrode received 510(k) clearance for over-the-counter use. The intended use of the Quell pain management therapeutic system is the symptomatic relief and management of chronic pain. The Quell device may also be used during nighttime sleep. 

Manufacturing Facilities Our facility, and the facility utilized by Sunburst, our contract device and sub-assembly manufacturer, have each been inspected by FDA in the past, and observations were noted. There were no findings that involved a significant violation of regulatory requirements. The responses to these observations have been 

&#160;

&#160;

accepted by the FDA and we believe that we and our contract manufacturer are in substantial compliance with the QSR. We expect that our facility will be inspected again as required by the FDA. If the FDA finds significant violations, we could be subject to fines, recalls, requirements to halt manufacturing, or other administrative or judicial sanctions. 

U.S. Anti-Kickback and False Claims Laws In the United States, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, as well as numerous state anti-kickback laws, prohibit the offer, payment, solicitation or receipt of kickbacks, bribes or other remuneration, whether direct or indirect, overt or covert, in cash or in kind, intended, among other things, to induce the purchase or recommendation of healthcare products and services. While the federal law applies only to products and services for which payment may be made by a federal healthcare program, the state laws may apply regardless of whether any public healthcare funds are involved. Violations of these laws can lead to severe civil and criminal penalties, including exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. These laws are potentially applicable to manufacturers of medical devices, such as us, and to hospitals, physicians and other potential purchasers of our products. 

Also, the federal False Claims Act, as well as many state false claims statutes, provides civil and criminal penalties for presenting, or causing to be presented, to third-party payers for reimbursement, claims that are false or fraudulent, or which are for items or services that were not provided as claimed. Under the federal False Claims Act, in addition to actions initiated by federal law enforcement authorities, the statute authorizes &#147;qui tam&#148; actions to be brought on behalf of the federal government by a private party in certain circumstances and, if successful, that private party can share in any monetary recovery. Any challenge by federal or state enforcement officials or others under these laws, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

Legacy Neurodiagnostics Business We were founded in 1996 as a science-based health care company. Our focus had been the development of innovative products for the detection, diagnosis, and monitoring of peripheral nerve and spinal cord disorders, such as those associated with carpal tunnel syndrome, lumbosacral disc disease and spinal stenosis, and diabetes. Our NC-stat System for the performance of nerve conduction studies at the point-of-care was commercially launched in 1999. The second generation NC-stat was released in 2002. In 2008, we brought to market the more sophisticated ADVANCE System for nerve conduction testing and performance of invasive needle electromyography. These systems were general purpose with broad application in evaluating and diagnosing nerve disorders. Numerous studies demonstrating the clinical accuracy and utility of these devices have been conducted and published in high quality peer-reviewed journals. Furthermore, these devices have been used in FDA sanctioned clinical trials for pharmacological agents and large scale epidemiological studies sponsored by the NIH, Center for Disease Control, or CDC, and other governmental agencies. The products have been cleared by the FDA, field tested for over a decade and highly regarded for their ease of use, accuracy and reproducibility of results. 

Following launch of NC-stat in 1999, we experienced rapid revenue growth, which led to our initial public offering in 2004. The health market, particularly the physician office segment, embraced the opportunity to perform nerve conduction tests which previously had always required referral to specialists. Point-of-care nerve testing was seen to provide a combination of improved patient care and patient convenience. The success of point-of-care nerve testing, a market which we created, was met with resistance in some sectors of the medical community, particularly by neurologists and physical medicine and rehabilitation physicians, both of which had traditionally provided nerve testing services. As a consequence of successful lobbying by these specialists, physicians using our technology experienced increased denials of coverage by third party payers resulting in their discontinuing usage and our difficulty in accruing new customer accounts. In late 2009 CMS included in the Physician Fee Schedule a new Category I CPT Code, CPT 95905, for nerve conduction studies performed using preconfigured electrode such as those employed with our products. During 2010 most Medicare fiscal intermediaries assumed coverage for CPT 95905 for at least some clinical indications; however, the health care environment has been such that we have been unable to secure broad coverage among private payers, which is essential to the success of our ADVANCE System product. This experience was reflected in our revenues for the legacy Neurodiagnostics business, which peaked in 2006 at 

&#160;

&#160;

$55.3 million. We reported revenue for our legacy Neurodiagnostics business of $2.3 million, $2.8 million, and $3.8 million in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. We currently manage this business to optimize cash flow. 

Employees As of December 31, 2015, we had a total of 48 full time employees. Of these employees, ten were in research and development, 20 in sales and marketing, eight in production/distribution, and ten in general and administrative services. One employee holds both M.D. and Ph.D. degrees, one employee holds an M.D. degree and two additional employees hold Ph.D. degrees. Our employees are not represented by a labor union and are not subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We have never experienced a work stoppage. We believe that we have good relations with our employees.
