 Item 1. Business Overview 

We are a revenue-generating, specialty pharmaceutical company focused on products for hospitals and ambulatory care settings, that is currently developing non-opioid products for treatment of serious acute pain. Our lead product candidate is a proprietary injectable form of meloxicam. Meloxicam is a long-acting preferential COX-2 inhibitor, and the oral form of meloxicam has been marketed by Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc. since the 1990s as Mobic &#174; . Intravenous, or IV, meloxicam has successfully completed multiple Phase II clinical trials for the treatment of moderate to severe pain. We believe injectable meloxicam compares favorably to competitive therapies in onset of pain relief, duration of pain relief, extent of pain relief and time to peak analgesic effect. Based on feedback from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, we have initiated a Phase III program that includes two pivotal clinical trials, as well as other trials. We expect to enroll a total of approximately 1,100 patients in these trials. One pivotal clinical trial, which began dosing in January 2016, is designed to demonstrate pain relief over a 24-hour period in a soft tissue, post-operative pain model (abdominoplasty) and the other pivotal clinical trial, for which we announced first patient dosing in February 2016, is designed to demonstrate pain relief over a 48-hour period in a hard tissue, post-operative pain model (bunionectomy). 

Our pipeline also includes Dex-IN, a proprietary intranasal formulation of dexmedetomidine, or Dex, which successfully completed a Phase II clinical trial in post-operative pain. Dex, which is in a class of drugs called alpha-2 adrenergic agonists, is an FDA approved and commercial injectable drug, sold by Hospira, Inc. in the United States under the brand name Precedex &#174; and by Orion Corporation, or Orion, in Europe under the brand name Dexdor &#174; . In October 2015, we met with the FDA to obtain feedback on the Phase II efficacy and safety data and our proposed Dex-IN clinical development program. Based on feedback from the FDA regarding Dex-IN&#146;s benefit-risk profile, specifically its efficacy and blood pressure effects, which was demonstrated in post-operative pain, and the subsequent requirements for a post-operative pain clinical program, we have determined not to pursue Dex-IN in post-operative pain due to time, cost and associated risk. We plan to pursue Dex-IN, as discussed with the FDA, in peri-procedural pain. If approved, Dex-IN would also be the first and only approved peri-procedural pain drug in its class of drugs. 

As our product candidates are not in the opioid class of drugs, we believe they will overcome many of the issues associated with commonly prescribed opioid therapeutics, including addiction, misuse/diversion, respiratory depression and constipation while maintaining analgesic, or pain relieving, effects. We are pursuing a Section 505(b)(2) regulatory strategy for injectable meloxicam and Dex-IN. 

We also have a sublingual formulation of Dex, Dex-SL, which may be appropriate for use in treating chronic pain. In addition to Dex, we have a second selective alpha-2 agonist product candidate in development, Fadolmidine, or Fado, which has been shown to be effective in a post-bunionectomy Phase II pain study conducted by Orion. Based on preclinical data, we believe Fado also shows promise in neuropathic pain. 

We own the worldwide rights to injectable meloxicam, which we acquired from Alkermes plc, or Alkermes, in April 2015. Under our license with Orion, upon regulatory approval, we will have commercial rights for Dex-IN and Dex-SL worldwide, except for Europe, Turkey, and the CIS (currently includes Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan), referred to herein as the Territory, for use in the treatment of pain in humans, in any dosage form for transdermal, transmucosal (including sublingual and intranasal), topical, enteral or pulmonary (inhalational) delivery, but specifically excluding delivery vehicles for administration by injection or infusion. Similarly, under our license agreement with Orion, upon regulatory approval, we will have commercial rights related to Fado in the Territory for all indications in humans. 

In summary, our product candidates for pain indications include: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; injectable meloxicam, a product candidate in development for the treatment of acute post-operative pain; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Dex-IN, a product candidate in development for the treatment of acute peri-procedural pain; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Dex-SL, a product candidate for the treatment of chronic pain; and &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Fado, a product candidate administered by injection into the intrathecal space for pain associated with surgery or certain types of chronic pain associated with nerve damage to local tissues (neuropathies), especially of the lower extremities, which can occur in diabetic patients. &#160;

Pipeline 

&#160;

We currently own and operate an 87,000 square foot, DEA-licensed manufacturing facility that makes five commercial products and receives royalties associated with the sales of these products. We manufacture the following products for our commercial partners: Ritalin LA &#174; , Focalin XR &#174; , Verelan PM &#174; , generic Verapamil and Zohydro ER &#174; , as well as development stage products. The campus includes an additional 10,000 square feet, which is comprised of administrative space and certain utilities areas. 

Background 

We have a limited operating history. We were incorporated in 2007, and began operating in 2008. We are currently developing non-opioid products for the treatment of acute pain. Our focus is on the development and commercialization of these products and other potential products that may be useful in hospitals or ambulatory care settings. 

We have funded our operations to date primarily from proceeds received from private placements of convertible preferred stock, convertible notes and common stock and our initial public offering of common stock, or IPO. On March 12, 2014, we announced the closing of the IPO of 4,312,500 shares of common stock, including the full exercise of the underwriters&#146; over-allotment, at a public offering price of $8.00 per share. Total gross proceeds from the IPO were $34.5 million before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses payable by us, resulting in net proceeds of $30.3 million. On July 7, 2015, we closed a private placement with certain accredited investors in which we sold 1,379,311 shares of common stock at a price of $11.60 per share, for net proceeds of approximately $14.8 million. 

We have incurred losses from operations since inception. As of December 31, 2015, we had an accumulated deficit of $31.1 million. Substantially all of our operating losses resulted from costs incurred in connection with our development programs, including our non-clinical and formulation development activities, manufacturing and clinical trials. We expect to incur increasing expenses over the next several years to develop injectable meloxicam, including two pivotal Phase III clinical trials for the management of acute post-operative pain. We also expect to incur additional expenses with regard to Dex, including a Phase II program in peri-procedural pain, and our other product candidates. Based upon additional financial resources, we may develop and commercialize our proprietary formulations of injectable meloxicam and Dex. 

We expect that annual results of operations will fluctuate for the foreseeable future due to several factors. As a result, we expect to continue to incur significant and increasing operating losses for the foreseeable future. 

On April 10, 2015, we completed our acquisition from Alkermes of certain assets, including the worldwide rights to injectable meloxicam and the contract manufacturing facility, royalty and formulation business in Gainesville, Georgia, now operating through our subsidiary, Recro Gainesville LLC, or Gainesville. We refer to the acquisition herein as the Gainesville Transaction. The Gainesville Transaction transformed our business through the addition of a revenue-generating manufacturing business and increase in our workforce as a result of the addition of the Gainesville employees. 

&#160;

The consideration paid in connection with the Gainesville Transaction consisted of $50.0 million, a $4.0 million working capital adjustment and a seven-year warrant to purchase 350,000 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $19.46 per share. In addition, we may be required to pay up to an additional $120.0 million in milestone payments upon the achievement of certain regulatory and net sales milestones and royalties on future product net sales related to injectable meloxicam. The up-front payment was funded with $50.0 million in borrowings under a credit agreement that we entered into with OrbiMed Royalty Opportunities II, LP, or OrbiMed, and cash on hand. The interest rate under the credit agreement is equal to LIBOR plus 14.0%, with a 1.0% LIBOR floor. Pursuant to the credit agreement, we issued OrbiMed a warrant to purchase an aggregate of 294,928 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $3.28 per share, subject to certain adjustments. 

Post-Operative Pain Market Overview 

Based upon statistics from the National Center for Health Statistics, it is estimated that there are over 100 million surgeries performed in the United States each year. Of these surgeries, we believe at least 50 million procedures require post-operative pain medication. While opioids are generally considered the most effective treatment for post-operative pain, they raise serious concerns due to addiction, illicit use, respiratory depression and other side effects, including constipation, nausea, vomiting and intolerance. Due to their addictive potential, opioids are regulated as controlled substances and are listed on Schedule II and III by the DEA. As a result of these side effects, pain sufferers tend to limit their use of opioids, resulting in as many as 40% of post-operative patients reporting inadequate pain relief. This reduces the quality of life for individuals and creates an economic burden estimated to be at least $560 to $635 billion a year in medical costs and lost productivity. According to a January 2016 article in the New England Journal of Medicine, overdose deaths from prescription painkillers (defined to mean opioid or narcotic pain relievers) has increased significantly over the past 14 years. It notes the following trends: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Prescription painkiller overdoses killed 18,893 people in the United States in 2014; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; In 2014, about 10.3 million Americans (age 12 or older) reported nonmedical use of prescription painkillers in the past year; and &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Emergency department visits involved with misusing or abusing prescription opioid painkillers increased 153% between 2004 and 2011. We believe that injectable meloxicam offers an attractive alternative for pain relief without the risks associated with opioids. Accordingly, we believe that physicians and third-party payors, including Medicare and Medicaid, are highly interested in new non-opioid pain therapies that provide effective pain relief without the adverse issues associated with opioids. 

Cancer Breakthrough Pain Market Overview 

In addition to peri-procedural pain relief, we believe Dex-IN may provide a good alternative therapeutic for cancer breakthrough pain relief. It is estimated that 80% of patients taking long-acting medication for chronic pain experience breakthrough pain. Breakthrough pain comes on very rapidly and can last from three to 30 minutes. Currently, cancer breakthrough pain is primarily treated with fast acting opioids&#151;mainly fentanyl, such as Fentora &#174; and Actiq &#174; (marketed by Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.). However, because these therapeutics are opioids, they raise the same concerns discussed above. 

Our Strategy 

We intend to maximize the value of our development candidates. This strategy could include developing our candidates through approval and ultimately self-commercialization, out-licensing, partnering on certain assets, or selling the Company or the assets. We believe our product candidates and their proposed indications target a narrow group of specialist prescribers which would allow for the successful marketing and commercialization of the product candidates by a company of our size. However, Dex-SL may target a broader group of prescribers and, if so, will likely require a partner. Our broader corporate strategy includes the following: 

Focus on developing IV meloxicam for acute post-operative pain. Our key goal is to file a new drug application, or NDA, and receive FDA approval of IV meloxicam for the management of moderate to severe pain. Based on feedback from the FDA, we initiated a Phase III program in 2016 that includes two pivotal clinical trials, as well as other trials. We expect to enroll a total of approximately 1,100 patients in these trials. One pivotal clinical trial, which began dosing in January 2016, is designed to demonstrate pain relief over a 24-hour period in a soft tissue, post-operative pain model and the other pivotal clinical trial, for which we announced first patient dosing in February 2016, is designed to demonstrate pain relief over a 48-hour period in a hard tissue, post-operative pain model. We believe developing IV meloxicam for the management of moderate to severe pain indication provides us the fastest and best path to building a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on options for pain management. Therefore, we are initially concentrating our management focus and resources on attaining this goal. 

&#160;

Evaluate Dex-IN for use in short clinical procedures associated with pain and discomfort that are performed in settings where IV access is not typically available. As discussed with the FDA, we plan to pursue Dex-IN in peri-procedural pain. 

Develop our manufacturing business . Our DEA-licensed facility currently manufactures five commercial products for pharmaceutical partners. We intend to seek additional manufacturing and related programs for commercial products through business development efforts, as well as through expanding development of our proprietary drug formulations. 

Leverage our management and development experience for other indications and product candidates. If we have sufficient additional resources, we plan to develop our existing drug candidates, as well as those we may identify in the future, for potential additional indications. While our current focus is on seeking FDA approval for IV meloxicam for the treatment of moderate to severe pain, we also have in development proprietary drug solutions for peri-procedural pain and pain resulting from cancer, musculoskeletal disorders and peripheral neuropathy. One goal is to leverage our drug development expertise along with innovative delivery systems to optimize absorption, improve effectiveness and reduce side effects to optimize pain relief and improve quality of life for the millions of people suffering from moderate-to-severe pain annually. We have multiple delivery systems in development, including intrathecal/epidural, transdermal, intranasal and sublingual platforms. 

Enter into strategic partnerships to maximize the potential of our product candidates outside of the United States. We intend to pursue strategic collaborations with other pharmaceutical companies to develop and commercialize our product candidates outside of the United States. We believe that our management expertise and unique product candidates make us an attractive partner to potential strategic companies. 

Meloxicam Overview 

Meloxicam is a long-acting, preferential COX-2 inhibitor that possesses anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic activities, which are believed to be related to the inhibition of cyclooxygenase, or COX, and subsequent reduction in prostaglandin biosynthesis. Meloxicam has been marketed by Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc. since the 1990s as an oral agent, Mobic &#174; . Mobic tablets and suspension are indicated for the relief of the signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis and the relief of the signs and symptoms of pauciarticular or polyarticular juvenile rheumatoid arthritis in patients 2 years or older. 

Meloxicam has a slow onset of action orally, and is not currently approved for the treatment of acute pain. The oral form has a prolonged absorption time, with the time of maximum observed plasma concentration, or tmax, being approximately 5-6 hours following oral administration, which is consistent with its poor aqueous solubility. Our proprietary injectable form of the drug, which utilizes NanoCrystal&#153; technology, provides a faster onset of action of meloxicam, thus providing a rapid and sustained treatment of acute pain via the IV or intramuscular, or IM, administration routes. 

Injectable Meloxicam Advantages 

We believe injectable meloxicam has a number of advantages over existing, FDA approved analgesics, including the following: 

Not considered a controlled substance. Meloxicam is not an opioid and not a controlled substance. Opioid therapeutics are currently controlled by the DEA under the Controlled Substances Act. Under this act, opioids have been scheduled based on their potential for abuse and/or addiction. For those opioids placed in Schedule II, federal law prohibits the refilling of prescriptions, thus requiring patients to request and physicians to write additional prescriptions for each refill. Examples of Schedule II opioids include codeine, fentanyl, sufentanil, hydrocodone and oxycodone. 

Does not cause respiratory depression. Meloxicam does not cause respiratory depression. Besides the addictive nature of opioids, we believe that medical practitioners are highly concerned with respiratory depression, which is a well-documented side effect of opioid use (all opioids, including fentanyl and oxycodone). Respiratory depression, which is defined by inadequate ventilation leading to increased carbon dioxide levels and respiratory acidosis, is an established outcome of opioid use. One of the more concerning adverse effects of chronic opioid use, for which tolerance does not develop, is respiratory depression during sleep, which can be life threatening. Meloxicam has demonstrated through multiple clinical trials and patient use that it does not cause respiratory depression. 

Onset of pain relief. While the oral form of meloxicam can take 60 minutes or more for pain relief, the utilization of NanoCrystal TM technology in the IV formulation results in a more rapid onset of pain relief of less than 10 minutes. Ketorolac, for example, can take up to 40 minutes for the onset of pain relief. 

&#160;

Duration of pain relief. IV meloxicam utilizing NanoCrystal TM technology has demonstrated the potential to be an effective analgesic for up to 18 to 24 hours after a single dose in clinical trials. IV forms of ketorolac, ibuprofen and acetaminophen provide effective pain relief up to four to six hours, resulting in the need for four to six doses for every 24 hours. 

Time to peak analgesic effect. Clinical data has demonstrated that IV meloxicam reaches peak analgesic effect within approximately 40 minutes of administration, reaching its peak faster than competing non-opioid therapeutics. Ketorolac can take between 1 to 2 hours to reach its peak analgesic effect. 

Additionally, we believe that IV meloxicam has an administration advantage in terms of bolus injection, whereas ibuprofen and acetaminophen can take up to 15 to 30 minutes to infuse. In addition, there is an IM formulation of meloxicam, while neither ibuprofen nor acetaminophen currently have IM formulations.

Clinical Trial Overview 

In January 2016, we began a pivotal Phase III clinical trial evaluating IV meloxicam for acute post-operative pain in patients following &#147;mini&#148; abdominoplasty surgery. In this multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, IV meloxicam&#146;s efficacy and safety will be evaluated in the management of post-operative pain following abdominoplasty surgery, a representative soft tissue surgery. Approximately 200 patients will be assigned randomly to a post-operative regimen of IV meloxicam (30 mg) or placebo in a 1:1 ratio, once every 24 hours, for up to 3 doses following surgery. The primary efficacy endpoint of this Phase III study is the summed pain intensity difference over the first 24 hours, or SPID24, compared to placebo. In February 2016, we announced that first patient dosing in a pivotal Phase III clinical trial evaluating IV meloxicam for acute post-operative pain in patients following bunionectomy surgery had begun. In this multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, IV meloxicam&#146;s efficacy and safety will be evaluated in the management of post-operative pain following bunionectomy surgery, a representative hard tissue surgery. Approximately 200 patients will be assigned randomly to a post-operative regimen of IV meloxicam (30 mg) or placebo in a 1:1 ratio, once every 24 hours, for up to 3 doses following surgery. The primary efficacy endpoint of this Phase III study is the summed pain intensity difference over the first 48 hours, or SPID48, compared to placebo. We expect to report top-line results from each of these Phase III studies by year end 2016. 

Multiple clinical trials have been conducted to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics and analgesic potential of IV meloxicam. Based on the results of these trials, we believe IV meloxicam has the potential to be a potent analgesic in the management of moderate to severe pain. 

Pharmacokinetic Studies 

Pharmacokinetic studies have examined single and multiple doses of IV meloxicam. In general terms, IV administration resulted in peak plasma concentrations immediately follow dosing. When compared to oral Mobic, IV meloxicam had similar areas under the plasma drug concentration-time curve and half-lives for doses of 15 mg, 30 mg and 60 mg. 

Study REC-15-014 

This was a Phase II, randomized, single-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating IV meloxicam in the management of post-operative pain following bunionectomy surgery. Fifty-nine patients who met the eligibility criteria were randomized to receive either IV meloxicam (30 mg or 60 mg dosage groups) or placebo once daily for two days. Following the beginning of treatment, patients remained under observation for 48 hours at study centers. Patients were followed for 7 days after the initial dose of study medication. There was an oral opioid rescue treatment available to all patients, if required. The primary objective of the trial was to evaluate the safety of IV meloxicam when administered as a bolus injection (over 15-30 seconds). 

The safety results demonstrated that IV meloxicam was well tolerated with no serious adverse events, bleeding events or injection site reactions. The most common adverse events, or AEs, were nausea, headache, dizziness, pruritus and vomiting and were comparable to the placebo group. There were no discontinuations due to AEs. The majority of treatment emergent AEs, or TEAEs, were mild in nature and determined by investigators to be &#147;not related&#148; or &#147;possibly related&#148; to study drug. There were no vital signs changes that necessitated treatment. There were no observed changes in the evaluation of ECGs. No clinically meaningful lab changes were observed in the meloxicam treatment groups (Table 1).

Secondary efficacy endpoints included use of opioid rescue medication, SPIDs over various time intervals, and patient global assessment, or PGA, of pain control. Both the 30 mg and 60 mg IV meloxicam treatment arms demonstrated statistically significant reductions in pain intensity, as measured by SPID48 (p=0.0007 and p=0.0027, respectively) compared to placebo (Figure 1). Although there were observed differences in opioid consumption among the meloxicam dose groups and the placebo group, in general these differences did not meet statistical significance. 

Figure 1: SPID48 

&#160;

Pain intensity was measured at various time points throughout the study. Differences in pain intensity were observed as early as 10 minutes and continued throughout the 48 hour observation period. Overall the 30 mg and 60 mg dose groups performed in a very comparable fashion (Figure 2). 

&#160;

&#160;

Study N1539-04 

This was a Phase II, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-and active-controlled study in 486 female subjects who underwent open abdominal hysterectomy. Following surgery on post-operative day 1, or Post Op Day 1, subjects received a single dose of either IV placebo, morphine or meloxicam 5 mg, 7.5 mg, 15 mg, 30 mg or 60 mg. Starting at the time of study drug administration and continuing for 24 hours thereafter, subjects had access to rescue medication. During the 24-hour double-blind evaluation period, efficacy measurements of pain intensity and pain relief were made using the 100-mm VAS to assess pain intensity and a 5-point categorical scale (ranging from none to complete) to assess pain relief. 

Overall, all active treatment doses produced statistically significant reductions in SPID24 (a co-primary endpoint) compared to placebo (p &#60;0.001), utilizing the LOCF analysis method. In addition, all active treatment doses also produced statistically significant improvement in TOTPAR24 (a co-primary efficacy endpoint) compared to placebo (p &#60;0.001). Statistically significant decreases in pain intensity from baseline were detected as early as 10 minutes post-dose and continued throughout the 24 hour postdose period. In general, the greatest decreases were seen in the 30 mg and 60 mg dose groups followed by the 15 mg group (Figure 3). 

&#160;

Figure 3: Pain Intensity Differences at Various Time Points 

&#160;

Rescue medication use during the 24-hour double-blind period was reduced by approximately 90% in the meloxicam 30 mg and 60 mg dose groups, and by 86%, 77%, 81%, and 71% in the 15 mg, 7.5 mg, 5 mg, and morphine groups, respectively, compared to placebo. Statistically significant differences were seen between each active group and placebo (p &#60;0.001). The percentage of subjects using rescue medication is presented in Figure 4. The median time to rescue (based on the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval for the 50th percentile) was greatest for meloxicam 30 mg (21.9 hours), followed by 60 mg (20.6 hours), 15 mg (18.3 hours), 5 mg (12.2 hours), 7.5 mg (8.3 hours), morphine (6.6 hours), and placebo (1.1 hours). 

&#160;

Study medication was well tolerated. A total of five serious adverse events, or SAEs, were reported in the study, and none were assessed as related to treatment. There were no clinically meaningful trends in vital signs, electrocardiograms or laboratory assessments. Adverse event rates were generally low and consistent with this surgical population under study (Table 2).

This Phase II study was a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled, active-controlled, single center study in 230 subjects who underwent third molar extraction surgery. Subjects received a single dose of either IV placebo, oral ibuprofen 400 mg, or IV meloxicam 15 mg, 30 mg or 60 mg. Starting at the time of study drug administration and continuing for 24 hours thereafter, subjects were given access to rescue medication for pain not relieved by the study drug. SPID24 was the primary endpoint utilizing the LOCF analysis method for this study. 

Overall, the results of this study consistently demonstrated that IV meloxicam produced the greatest reduction in pain, followed by the 30 mg and 15 mg doses, as well as ibuprofen 400 mg. Highly statistically significant differences were seen among the treatments for the primary endpoint, SPID24, as well as in every efficacy analysis. 

&#160;

The onset of action was rapid for the IV meloxicam doses, with statistically significant differences in pain intensity and pain reduction detected among the treatments as early as 10 minutes. For the IV meloxicam doses, analgesia was sustained, with statistically significant differences in pain intensity and pain relief evident through 24 hours postdose. 

The use of rescue medication was reduced by 93%, 86%, and 87% by the IV meloxicam 60 mg, 30 mg, and 15 mg doses, respectively, compared to placebo. 

Overall, treatment with IV meloxicam was well-tolerated after a single-dose up to 60 mg. There were no SAEs or discontinuations due to an adverse event, reported in this study. There were no clinically meaningful trends in vital signs or laboratory assessments. Adverse event rates were generally low and consistent with this surgical population. 

Study N1539-05 

This study was a Phase II, single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled, study conducted in subjects undergoing abdominal laparoscopic surgery. Allowed procedures included biliary tree surgery, common bile duct exploration/surgery, cholecystectomy and inguinal hernia surgery. Subjects received either IV placebo; IV ketorolac every 6 hours; or IV meloxicam 7.5 mg every 12 hours, 15 mg every 12 hours, or 30 mg once daily, for up to 48 hours. Rescue medication was available any time after the initial dose of study drug. The study was expected to enroll 250 subjects. However, the prior sponsor decided to terminate this study for business reasons. A total of 50 subjects had been enrolled prior to the study&#146;s discontinuation. Although a full efficacy analysis was not completed due to the early termination, analysis of the data from the enrolled subjects demonstrated that IV meloxicam 30 mg once daily produced a statistically significant difference compared to placebo for the SPID48. 

Overall, study medication was well tolerated. The most frequently reported AEs for all subjects were headache, dry mouth, dysuria, nausea, fatigue and dizziness. There was no apparent trend in occurrence of AEs and treatment group. One SAE was reported by a subject in the ketorolac group. One subject in the IV meloxicam 7.5 mg every 12 hours group discontinued due to maculopapular rash. 

Dexmedetomidine Overview 

Dex is a selective alpha-2 adrenergic agonist that has demonstrated sedative, analgesic and anxiolytic properties. Dex was developed in the 1990s by Abbott, initially for an indication as a short term sedative in the intensive care setting; however, a subsequent indication included use as a procedural sedative. Hospira currently markets IV Dex trademarked Precedex &#174; in the United States. Orion received European approval to market IV Dex as an ICU sedative in the European Union, trademarked as Dexdor &#174; . Dex has an extensive history of safe intravenous use, utilizing its sedative properties. We have formulated Dex at a significantly lower dose (perhaps as low as 1/10th for our intranasal product) than the currently recommended IV dosage levels. Based upon our lower dose, we have seen minimal sedation to date in our clinical trials while still demonstrating an analgesic effect. Because we are pursuing a 505(b)(2) regulatory strategy, we have the ability to reference and access the patient data from the IV registration studies in 4,765 Dex-treated patients conducted in connection with these approvals in support of our filings. 

We initially studied Dex-IN for the treatment of post-operative pain. In our completed Phase II trial, REC-14-013, Dex-IN met the primary endpoint of the clinical trial in demonstrating significant improvement for SPID48 compared with placebo (p &#163; 0.025). In October 2015, we met with the FDA to obtain feedback on the Phase II efficacy and safety data and for our proposed Dex-IN clinical development program. Based on feedback from the FDA regarding Dex-IN&#146;s benefit-risk profile, specifically its efficacy and blood pressure effects, which was demonstrated in post-operative pain, and the subsequent requirements for a post-operative pain clinical program, we have determined not to pursue Dex-IN in post-operative pain due to time, cost and associated risk. We plan to pursue Dex-IN, as discussed with the FDA, in peri-procedural pain. If approved, Dex-IN would also be the first and only approved peri-procedural pain drug in its class of drugs. 

Dex-IN Advantages 

We believe there is a clear unmet need for effective, well tolerated, non-opioid analgesics that can be used as a component of an effective peri-procedural pain management program. Based on the positive analgesic results observed in the Dex-IN Phase II post-operative pain study, and the safety profile and labeling for the marketed Dex product, we believe Dex has the potential to offer the following advantages: 

Dex has demonstrated anxiolytic, or anxiety-reducing, properties. In the NDA studies for Dex it was demonstrated that Dex is a drug that also has anxiolytic properties. Patients experiencing pain typically see an increase in anxiety. We believe Dex&#146;s ability to help lessen anxiety will be beneficial in the peri-procedural setting. 

Dex is not associated with constipation, nausea or vomiting. Dex&#146;s mechanism of action provides analgesic activity with very limited activity on the gastrointestinal tract, thus limiting the unwanted side effects of constipation, nausea and vomiting. 

&#160;

Dex does not cause respiratory depression. We believe that medical practitioners are highly concerned with respiratory depression, which is a well-documented side effect of opioid use (all opioids including fentanyl and oxycodone). Respiratory depression is defined by decreased lung ventilation leading to increased carbon dioxide levels and can be life threatening. Dex has demonstrated through multiple clinical trials and patient use that it does not cause respiratory depression. 

Dex is not a controlled substance. Opioid therapeutics are currently controlled by the DEA under the Controlled Substances Act. Under this act, opioids have been scheduled based on their potential for abuse and/or addiction. For those opioids placed in Schedule II, federal law prohibits the refilling of prescriptions, thus requiring patients to request and physicians to write additional prescriptions for each refill. Examples of Schedule II opioids include codeine, fentanyl, sufentanil, hydrocodone and oxycodone. 

Dex has not demonstrated habituative effects. Preclinical studies in monkeys and rats have showed that Dex has a weak potential for drug addiction and dependence. 

Patients utilizing Dex have been observed to be cognitively intact. We believe that patients utilizing opioid analgesics become cognitively impaired, impacting the patient&#146;s ability to perform routine mental and physical tasks. Based upon published studies, patients utilizing Dex do not appear to experience cognitive impairment. 

Clinical Trial Overview 

Under our investigational new drug applications, or INDs, we have studied various dosage forms of Dex in nine completed studies, including two Phase Ib and two Phase II placebo controlled studies, in over 300 subjects, to evaluate the analgesic efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of Dex. After an interim analysis in September 2014, we closed our Post Op Day 0 Phase II clinical trial of Dex-IN in the treatment of acute post-operative pain following bunionectomy surgery. While the trial was not expected to reach statistical significance, a trend toward analgesia was observed in a subset of patients. In our completed second Phase II trial, REC-14-013, Dex-IN met the primary endpoint of the clinical trial in demonstrating significant improvement in SPID48 compared with placebo (p &#163; 0.025). Based upon the results of these trials, we believe that our formulations of Dex have demonstrated analgesic potential for post-operative pain. In October 2015, we met with the FDA to obtain feedback on the Phase II efficacy and safety data, and for our proposed Dex-IN clinical development program. Based on feedback from the FDA regarding Dex-IN&#146;s benefit-risk profile, specifically its efficacy and blood pressure effects, which was demonstrated in post-operative pain, and the subsequent requirements for a post-operative pain clinical program, we have determined not to pursue Dex-IN in post-operative pain due to time, cost and associated risk. We plan to pursue Dex-IN, as discussed with the FDA, in peri-procedural pain. 

REC-14-013 

Our most recent completed Phase II study utilized Dex-IN initiating dosing of study medication on Post Op Day 1 following bunionectomy surgery. The Phase II trial was a randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Dex-IN in adult subjects undergoing bunionectomy surgery. Subjects were randomized to either a 50 mg dose of Dex-IN or a placebo intranasal dose given every six hours. Following the beginning of treatment, subjects remained under observation for 48 hours at study centers. Subjects were followed for seven days after the initial dose of study medication. There was an oral opioid rescue treatment available to patients in either treatment group. A total of 168 subjects were enrolled in the study. The key subject characteristics are listed in Table 3 below. One subject discontinued as a result of a serious adverse event of hypotension.

REC-13-012 

This Phase II trial was a randomized, multicenter double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Dex-IN, in 95 adult subjects undergoing bunionectomy surgery with treatment beginning on Post Op Day 0. While analgesia and a reduction in opioid use were observed in a subset of patients at the planned interim analysis, we elected to discontinue the study as it was not expected to reach statistical significance. In this study, Dex-IN was well tolerated with no serious adverse events reported. Four subjects discontinued due to symptomatic hypotension and one subject discontinued due to fever. Additionally, one subject discontinued placebo due to nausea and vomiting. 

No other adverse events of symptomatic hypotension were seen in the 95 patients treated. Asymptomatic decreases in blood pressure were seen throughout the study, including 10 Dex-IN patients that had an adverse event of &#147;BP decreased.&#148; In addition, one patient in the Dex-IN 50 mcg treatment group and two patients in the placebo treatment group had a heart rate of 50 bpm or below, along with a notable change from baseline heart rate. Lastly, no clinically significant changes were seen in electrocardiograms in any treatment group, and there were no clinically significant changes in clinical laboratory studies. 

Fadolmidine Overview 

Our third product candidate under development, Fado, also belongs to the alpha-2 adrenergic agonist receptor class. Fado is similar to Dex and different from clonidine in that it is a full agonist of all subtypes of alpha-2 adrenoreceptor. Unlike Dex, Fado does not cross the blood/brain barrier, and this accounts for the targeting of Fado use for either intrathecal administration for pain or anesthesia, or potentially for topical use to treat pain associated with regional nerve pain from underlying nerve damage, also called &#147;neuropathies.&#148; Various preclinical models of pain have been employed and have demonstrated Fado&#146;s potential as an analgesic, including its potential for use in neuropathies and post-operative pain. 

Fadolmidine Clinical Trials 

In Orion sponsored studies, the safety and efficacy of Fado had been assessed in one Phase I study and in one Phase II study. In these studies, a total of 130 subjects received Fado. The Phase II study was a randomized, single blind, controlled dose-escalation study. The aim of the study was to assess the safety, tolerability and efficacy of Fado when administered intrathecally with bupivacaine to induce spinal anesthesia in subjects undergoing bunionectomy surgery. Fado doses of 40, 60, 80, 100, 120, 140, 160, 180, 200, 220 and 240 mcg were administered with 5 mg of bupivacaine. At each dose level, six subjects were randomized to receive combination treatment, and one subject to receive only isobaric bupivacaine 10 mg. In this study, Fado was shown to have beneficial effects. The time to first post-operative dose of rescue drug (patient controlled &#147;mini&#148; doses of morphine, called PCA) was longer with increasing Fado dose, while total morphine use in the first ten hours was reduced. The subjects not only used less morphine, but also reported less pain. All doses of Fado appeared to delay the onset of pain while doses of Fado greater than 120 mcg also appeared to suppress pain. 

&#160;

Fado was well tolerated by subjects. Incontinence and bradycardia were observed only at the highest dose studied. The incidence of nausea and vomiting was higher on Fado compared to bupivacaine 10 mg alone, despite the reduction in intravenous morphine administered. Sedation did not appear to be increased on Fado. There were significant reductions in blood pressure after intrathecal Fado was added to bupivacaine. These reductions were dose-dependent. 

Contract Manufacturing Overview 

We currently own and operate an 87,000 square foot, DEA-licensed manufacturing facility that makes five commercial products, and we receive royalties associated with the sales of these products. This facility has been inspected by U.S., EU, Turkish and Brazilian regulatory authorities for compliance with required cGMP standards for continued commercial manufacturing. We manufacture the following products for our commercial partners: Ritalin LA &#174; (Novartis Pharma AG), Focalin XR &#174; (Novartis Pharma AG), Verelan PM &#174; (Kremers Urban Pharmaceuticals, Inc.), generic Verapamil (Actavis plc) and Zohydro ER &#174; (Pernix Therapeutics Holdings, Inc. and Paladin Labs Inc.). In each case, we either purchase active drug product from third parties or receive it from our commercial partners to formulate product using our technologies. The manufacture of these products for clinical trials and commercial use is subject to cGMPs and other regulatory agency regulations. Our manufacturing and development capabilities include formulation through process development, scale-up and full-scale commercial manufacturing and specialized capabilities for the development and manufacturing of controlled substances. 

Although some materials for our products are currently available from a single source or a limited number of qualified sources, we attempt to acquire an adequate inventory of such materials, establish alternative sources and/or negotiate long-term supply arrangements. We do not currently have any significant issues finding suppliers. However, there is no certainty that we will be able to obtain long-term supplies of our manufacturing materials in the future. 

Permits and Regulatory Approvals 

We hold various licenses for our Gainesville manufacturing activities. The primary licenses held are FDA Registrations of Drug Establishments and DEA Controlled Substance Registration. Due to certain U.S. state law requirements, we also hold certain state licenses for distribution activities throughout certain states. We also hold cGMP certifications for EU importation of products made in Gainvesville for sale in the EU. 

We do not generally act as the product authorization holder for products that have been developed on behalf of a commercial partner. In such cases, our commercial partner typically holds the relevant authorization from the FDA or other national regulator, and we support this authorization by furnishing a copy of the Drug Master File, or the chemistry, and manufacturing and related data to the relevant regulator or sponsor to provide adequate manufacturing support in respect of the product. We generally update this information annually with the relevant regulator. 

Material Customer Agreements 

We have entered into commercial supply agreements with each commercial partner of our contract manufacturing business. Under each of these commercial supply agreements, we generally license certain intellectual property to our commercial partners and manufacture and supply the respective products for each of our commercial partners. Each commercial partner generally remains responsible for distributing, marketing and promoting their respective products. 

Actavis 

Pursuant to an amended and restated license and supply agreement, or the License and Supply Agreement, between us and Watson Laboratories, Inc., a subsidiary of Actavis plc, or Actavis, we exclusively manufacture generic Verapamil for Actavis. We receive a percentage profit share from Actavis on all U.S. sales of Verapamil and are compensated for manufacturing the product at cost (or, where product is supplied in finished form, at manufacturing cost plus a mark-up). Actavis represented 33.0% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

Under the License and Supply Agreement, we also license certain intellectual property to Actavis and maintain the regulatory approval that is necessary to enable Actavis to distribute Verapamil in the United States. Actavis is responsible for distributing, marketing and promoting Verapamil in the United States. The License and Supply Agreement also contains certain restrictions in respect of manufacturing and selling competing products, although we are permitted to sell a branded version of Verapamil through a third party under the trade name Verelan &#174; . 

&#160;

Either party may terminate the License and Supply Agreement on an annual basis by serving the other with a written notice of termination 90 days prior to the contract anniversary date. Each party may also terminate the License and Supply Agreement in certain specified circumstances, including where their rates of return fall below certain specified thresholds. Actavis can terminate the License and Supply Agreement if we commit certain material breaches of contract, including failure to supply. If Actavis exercises this right, then it may elect to obtain a production license from us. In all other circumstances, we retain the right to use all technical and clinical data that has been generated under the License and Supply Agreement upon its termination. 

Intellectual Property 

We own and license patents and patent applications directed to the sale, use, manufacturing and formulating of injectable meloxicam. The patent protection for injectable meloxicam could lead to protection of injectable meloxicam through 2030, subject to any extensions or disclaimers. Additionally, we will seek, if appropriate, patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act, when applicable. The extensions under U.S. law may extend patent protection beyond 2030. 

We own patents and patent applications directed to the composition of, manufacturing of, and formulating of Zohydro ER &#174; . The patent protection for Zohydro ER &#174; could provide for protection of Zohydro ER &#174; through 2034, subject to any extensions or disclaimers. Additionally, we will seek, if appropriate, patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act, when applicable. The extensions under U.S. law may extend patent protection beyond 2034. 

We hold patent applications directed to the analgesia indication and formulations of Dex, and we are progressing through the patent application process globally. We believe that the combination of the unique indication and formulations, as well as the significant dosing differences with the routes of administration, will allow us to, with the applications filed, protect our products from other Dex entrants to the analgesia field, regardless of formulation. Our strategy, if successful in obtaining patent protection, could lead to protection of our product candidates through 2030, subject to any extensions or disclaimers. The term may be extended due to patent term adjustment as a result of delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in issuing any patent. Additionally, we will seek, if appropriate, patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act, when applicable. The extensions under U.S. law may extend patent protection beyond 2030. 

Intellectual Property Protection 

We intend to rely on a combination of patents and trade secrets, as well as confidentiality agreements and license agreements, to protect our product candidates. Our patent strategy is designed to facilitate commercialization of our current product candidates and future product candidates, as well as create barriers to entry for third parties. One focus of our claim strategy is on formulation claims and method of treatment claims. 

We are seeking patent protection in the United States and internationally for our product candidates. Our policy is to pursue, maintain and defend patent rights and to protect the technology, inventions and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business. We cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our technology. We also intend to rely on trade secrets to protect our product candidates. Our commercial success also depends in part on our non-infringement of the patents or proprietary rights of third parties. 

Our success will depend significantly on our ability to: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for our product candidates; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; defend our patents; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; develop trade secrets as needed and preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; and &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; operate our business without infringing the patents and proprietary rights of third parties. We have taken steps to build and will continue to build proprietary positions for our product candidates and related technology in the United States and abroad. 

As a result of the Gainesville Transaction, we are now the owners of patents (U.S. Patent Nos.: 6,228,398, 6,902,742 and 9,132,096) relating to Zohydro-ER &#174; , which we license to our commercial partner, Pernix Therapeutics Holdings, Inc., or Pernix, in the United States. These patents have expiration dates of November 1, 2019, November 1, 2019, and September 12, 2034, respectively. We also own Canadian patent applications that are still pending relating to the same technology, which we license to our commercial partner, Paladin Labs Inc., in Canada. We cannot predict if the Canadian patent application will ever issue as a patent. We 

&#160;

own patent applications and patents directed to nanoparticulate formulations of meloxicam that we expect to provide protection for injectable meloxicam, if injectable meloxicam gains marketing approval. The issued patents and any patents that may issue from various applications related to injectable meloxicam expire between 2016 and 2024, depending upon the application and patent. 

Additionally, as part of the Gainesville Transaction, we acquired ownership of various controlled release formulation patents including patents in the United States, Canada, and Europe. These patents are scheduled to expire between 2019 and 2026. 

We have in-licensed the Orion patent rights to Dex and Fado in the United States and internationally. For Dex, the composition of matter patent (U.S. Patent No. 4,910,214) expired in mid-January 2014. For Fado, the composition of matter patent (U.S. Patent No. 6,313,311) expires on October 2, 2016 with a possible patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act. Also for Fado, we have a pro-drug patent (U.S. Patent No. 7,759,496) that expires on April 10, 2025. If no additional patent protection is obtained, these patent expirations will impact our ability to prevent third parties from marketing generic equivalents. We have also licensed additional method of use patents for both Dex and Fado from Orion. We are also pursuing patent protection for the specific formulations, dosage forms and methods of use of our product candidates. 

Our Dex patent portfolio comprises three families of patent applications. A family (U.S. Application Serial No. 12/781,628; which was also filed as a PCT Application, International Application No. PCT/US10/35136) provides, among other things, methods of treating or preventing pain by administering to the oral mucosa of a mammal. The active ingredient, or salt, can be used to treat or prevent pain without significant sedation. The first family also provides, among other things, oral, transmucosal, analgesic pharmaceutical compositions comprising an oral, transmucosal pharmaceutically effective amount of the active ingredient, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle. The pharmaceutically effective amount of the active ingredient treats or prevents pain without significant sedation. The first family also provides oral transmucosal dispensing devices comprising the analgesic pharmaceutical composition. 

Another family (U.S. Application Serial No. 13/711,407; which was also filed as a PCT application, International Application No. PCT/US12/68988) provides, among other things, methods of treating or preventing pain by intranasally administering an intranasally effective amount of the active ingredient. This family also provides metered dose devices comprising a pharmaceutical composition comprising the active ingredient, or salt thereof. The metered dose devices can deliver a metered dose spray of the pharmaceutical composition intranasally that is analgesic in a mammal. 

The Dex patent applications are in various stages of prosecution, and no patent has been issued to date in the United States. Unless and until our pending applications issue, their protective scope is impossible to determine. Further, there is only one patent application in connection with Dex-IN, which is also relatively early in the review process, which may take months or years, and there is no guarantee that the patent will issue. It is impossible to predict whether or how many of these applications will result in issued patents and patents that issue may be challenged in the courts or patent offices in the United States and abroad. 

For the patent family regarding oral transmucosal Dex, if embodiments from the specification and/or present claims issued, the claims may cover: methods of treating or preventing pain without significant sedation via delivery of Dex to the oral mucosa; oral, transmucosal analgesic pharmaceutical compositions comprising Dex; and oral transmucosal dispensing devices containing Dex. For the patent family regarding Dex-IN, if embodiments from the specification and/or present claims issued, the claims may cover: methods of treating or preventing pain without significant sedation via delivering Dex intranasally; intranasal compositions comprising Dex; and/or metered dose devices containing Dex. 

If these patent applications are issued as patents, and if the appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity or other governmental fees are paid, the resulting patent protection in the United States may last into 2030, subject to any disclaimers or extensions. We note that the patent laws of foreign countries differ from those in United States, and the degree of protection afforded by foreign patents may be different from the protection offered by United States patents. 

In-Licensing Arrangements 

Alkermes plc 

As part of the Gainesville Transaction, we in-licensed, on a perpetual, royalty-free basis, technology relating to injectable meloxicam, from Alkermes. We have also licensed patents and applications relating to the formulations and manufacturing of injectable meloxicam, including the NanoCrystal TM technology. These patent applications are scheduled to expire between 2016 and 2030. 

&#160;

Orion Corporation 

Dexmedetomidine (Dex) License 

In August 2008, we entered into an exclusive license with Orion for the development and commercialization of Dex for use in the treatment of pain in humans in any dosage form for transdermal, transmucosal (including sublingual and intranasal), topical, enteral or pulmonary (inhalational) delivery, but specifically excluding delivery vehicles for administration by injection or infusion, in the Territory. We have the right to sublicense the rights under this license at any time. 

In consideration for this license, we are required to pay Orion lump sum payments on the achievement of certain developmental milestones and upon the achievement of certain commercial milestones. We will pay milestone payments to Orion of up to &#128;20.5 million ($22.4 million as of December 31, 2015) after regulatory approval of Dex dosage forms and upon achieving certain sales milestones. Although we have a separate agreement for the license of Dex in Japan that provides for separate development and commercial milestones, we expect that development of Dex for Japan will require a local partner that would be required to make sure milestone payments are made. We are also required to pay Orion a royalty on net sales that, during the term, generally varies from 10% to 20%, depending on annual sales levels, and in some circumstances, such as in the event of the marketing of a generic competitor or a competing product being released by Orion or its licensees, could drop to low single digits, so long as Orion is not engaged in the use, manufacturing and/or commercialization of a pharmaceutical product containing Dex, medetomidine or detomidine as a therapeutically active ingredient for treatment of pain in humans in any dosage form for transdermal, transmucosal (including sublingual), topical, enteral or pulmonary (inhalational) delivery (collectively, referred to as the Licensed Dosage Forms). Our royalty payments on net sales of Dex will be paid at varying percentages. Through December 31, 2015, no such milestones have been achieved. 

We are entitled to reference all regulatory filings made by Orion related to Dex, Dex products or the Dex active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API. Orion retained the rights to develop and commercialize Dex for all uses and indications other than pain in humans and for use in combination products in that field, and we have granted Orion a license to use our clinical trial data, patents and know-how for such purpose; provided, however that Orion cannot undertake development activities in the United States, Australia or South Africa with respect to treatment of pain in humans in any Licensed Dosage Form until four years after our first product is granted regulatory approval in the United States. 

We have a right of first refusal to commercialize any such product developed by Orion in the Territory. 

The initial term of this license is 15 years from the first commercial sale in the Territory. After the initial term, this license will be automatically extended for one or more periods of two years, unless either party provides written notice of termination at least six months prior to expiration. Each party has the right to terminate the agreement in connection with the bankruptcy, liquidation or dissolution of the other party or for a material breach that is uncured or without a reasonably acceptable plan to cure such breach within 90 days. In the event of termination, inventions created by Orion will remain Orion&#146;s property, and inventions created by us will remain our property. In the event that inventions are jointly created, the inventions will be the joint property of the parties. 

Fadolmidine (Fado) License 

In July 2010, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Orion for the development and commercialization of Fado for use as a human therapeutic, in any dosage form in the Territory. We have the right to sublicense the rights under such license at any time. 

In consideration for this license, we paid Orion an upfront payment and are required to pay certain lump-sum amounts on completion of certain development milestones, as well as on achievement of certain commercial milestones. We will pay milestone payments to Orion of up to &#128;12.2 million ($13.3 million as of December 31, 2015), based on regulatory filings and approval and on commercialized net sales levels. We will also pay Orion royalty payments on net sales of Fado ranging from 10% to 15%, so long as Orion is not engaged in the manufacture, use or sale of a competitive product containing Fado as a therapeutically active ingredient for treatment of human subjects, in the Territory, as defined in such agreement. Through December 31, 2015, no such milestones have been achieved. 

We are entitled to reference data as well as information in prior Orion regulatory filings (European Union/Finland) made by Orion related to Fado. Orion retained the rights to develop and commercialize Fado in the European Union, the CIS and Turkey subject to the terms and conditions of the license agreement. In addition, Orion is entitled to receive a license-back to any intellectual property and data developed by us, and, in the event Orion sublicenses the use of such intellectual property and data, Orion would be required to pay us a portion of our costs incurred in developing Fado. In the event of termination, inventions created by Orion will remain Orion&#146;s property, and inventions created by us will remain our property. In the event that inventions are jointly created, the inventions will be the joint property of the parties. 

&#160;

The term of the license agreement is 15 years from the first commercial sale of a product by us in any country in the Territory, as defined in such agreement. After the initial term, the license agreement will be automatically extended on the same terms and conditions for one or more successive three year periods, unless either party provides written notice six months prior to the expiration of the initial term or any renewal term. 

Each party has the right to terminate the agreement in connection with the bankruptcy, liquidation or dissolution of the other party, for a material breach that is uncured or for which a reasonably acceptable plan to cure such breach has not been developed within 90 days of receipt of written notice, upon our failure to develop and commercialize Fado as determined by Orion, which failure remains uncured or for which a reasonably acceptable plan to cure such failure has not been developed within 90 days of receipt of written notice, or if we or our licensees contest the Orion patent rights. 

Sales and Marketing 

Our current intent is to develop and commercialize our product candidates in the United States while out-licensing development and commercialization rights for other territories outside the United States for which we own the territorial rights. We believe the initial target audience for our product candidates will be specialty physicians, including surgeons, anesthesiologists and pain specialists. Our management team has experience building and launching therapeutics to specialty physicians. As this target audience is smaller than general practitioners, we believe we have the capabilities to build a sales and marketing infrastructure and effectively market our product candidates upon commercial approval. While our stated intention is to develop and commercialize our product candidates, we will evaluate potential strategic collaborations that could accelerate or enhance our development and, upon approval, commercial success of our product candidates. 

Pharmaceutical Manufacturing and Supply 

The source for Dex API is Orion&#146;s Fermion Chemical Division, and the source for bulk IV meloxicam formulation is Alkermes. We currently rely on contract manufacturers to produce drug product for IV meloxicam, Dex-In and Fado for our clinical studies cGMPs, with oversight by our internal managers. We plan to continue to rely on contract manufacturers to manufacture development quantities of our product candidates, as well as commercial quantities of our product candidates, if and when approved for marketing by the FDA. We currently rely on a single manufacturer for the clinical supplies of our drug product for each of our product candidates and do not currently have agreements in place for redundant supply or a second source for any of our product candidates. We have identified other drug product manufacturers that could satisfy our clinical study requirements, but this would require significant expense and could produce a significant delay in setting up the facility and moving equipment. Additionally, should a supplier or a manufacturer on whom we rely to produce a product candidate provide us with a faulty product or a product that is later recalled, we would likely experience significant delays and additional costs. 

Material Supply Agreements 

Meloxicam 

We are party to a Development, Manufacturing and Supply Agreement, or Supply Agreement, with Alkermes (through a subsidiary of Alkermes), pursuant to which Alkermes will provide (i) clinical and commercial bulk supplies of IV meloxicam formulation, and (ii) development services with respect to the Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls section of an NDA for IV meloxicam. Pursuant to the Supply Agreement, Alkermes will supply us with such quantities of bulk IV meloxicam formulation as shall be reasonably required for the completion of clinical trials of IV meloxicam, subject to a maximum of eight clinical batches in any twelve-month period, unless otherwise agreed by the parties. During the term of the Supply Agreement, we will purchase our clinical and commercial supplies of bulk IV meloxicam formulation exclusively from Alkermes for a period of time. Sterile fill-finish of Meloxicam will be completed by a third party fill-finish facility. If the first commercial sale of meloxicam occurs on or prior to December 31, 2020, the Supply Agreement will have an initial term expiring ten years following the date of such first commercial sale. The Supply Agreement will then automatically renew for successive one-year terms unless terminated by either party upon written notice at least 180 days prior to the expiration of the applicable term. If the first commercial sale of Meloxicam has not occurred by December 31, 2020, the Supply Agreement will expire on that date. 

The Supply Agreement may be terminated earlier (i) by us upon 180 days&#146; written notice following the date of first generic entry; (ii) by either party upon twelve months&#146; written notice following the first anniversary of the approval of the NDA for meloxicam; (iii) by either party upon written notice to the other party in the event of uncured material breach of the other party; and (iv) by Alkermes upon written notice in certain events of uncured non-payment. 

&#160;

Dex API 

We and Orion are parties to an API agreement, whereby Orion agrees to provide us API for the development and commercialization of the Dex and Fado product candidates. 

During the development period prior to obtaining regulatory approval, subject to advance notice to Orion, Orion will provide API without charge for agreed upon amounts. Any amounts ordered by us that are greater than the planned supply will be charged at 50% of the supply price for commercial product. We have agreed with Orion on the specifications for the cGMP for API and the stability testing, storage, handling and agreed quality of the API, as well as a dispute resolution process, should differences arise in interpretation of data for the API. 

The terms for commercial supply of Dex API by Orion are subject to regulatory approval. The initial term of the agreement is the later of 15 years from the first commercial sale and 15 years after the effective date of the agreement, and in each case, will be automatically extended for one or more periods of two years unless terminated. After the initial term, the agreement may be terminated upon six months&#146; notice to the other party. 

Device Manufacturing and Supply 

The single unit dose intranasal sprayer for Dex is manufactured by a supplier of proprietary components and devices, and equipment is leased from the device supplier for filling at a contract manufacturer. It is possible that we will continue with this arrangement through clinical development, evaluate the option of entering a manufacturing agreement with the device originator or evaluate alternative devices prior to commercialization. Suppliers of components, subassemblies and other materials are located in Europe, Asia and the United States. 

Competition 

The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. Our current and future competitors include pharmaceutical, biotechnology and specialty pharmaceutical companies. Many of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we have, such as more commercial resources, larger research and development staffs and more extensive marketing and manufacturing organizations. As a result, these companies may obtain marketing approval more rapidly than we are able to obtain and may be more effective in selling and marketing their products. Smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large, established companies. 

Our competitors may succeed in developing, acquiring or licensing technologies and drug products that are more effective or less costly than our product candidates or any other products that we may develop which could render our products obsolete and noncompetitive. We expect any products that we develop and commercialize to compete on the basis of, among other things, efficacy, safety, convenience of administration and delivery, price and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors. We also expect to face competition in our efforts to identify appropriate collaborators or partners to help commercialize our product candidates in our target commercial markets. 

In the post-operative pain relief setting, we believe patients are prescribed injectable acetaminophen, NSAIDs, sodium channel blockers and opioids, depending on the severity of pain. Specifically, acetaminophen, NSAIDs and sodium channel blockers, we believe, are prescribed for mild to moderate pain relief, whereas we believe opioids are prescribed for moderate to severe pain relief. While we will compete with all of these compounds in the post-operative pain setting, we believe injectable meloxicam will be prescribed for moderate to severe pain, competing with opioids and other non-opioid pain treatments. There are a number of pharmaceutical companies that currently market therapeutics in the pain relief area, including Johnson &#38; Johnson, Purdue Pharma, L.P., Endo Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Mallinckrodt plc, and Pacira Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Purdue and Endo are the primary competitors in the manufacture, marketing and commercialization of opioid therapeutics. Mallinckrodt commercializes an injectable formulation of acetaminophen. Pacira commercializes an intraoperative formulation of bupivacaine, a sodium channel blocker. As far as potential competitors in development, we are not aware of any other alpha-2 agonists compounds in development for post-operative pain relief. However, companies such as Adynxx, Inc., AcelRx Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Heron Therapeutics, Inc., Trevena, Inc. and Cara Therapeutics, Inc. are currently developing post-operative pain therapeutics that could compete with us in the future. 

In cancer breakthrough pain relief, we expect to compete against established companies, including Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Ltd., BioDelivery Sciences International, Inc., Kyowa Hakko, Insys Therapeutics, Inc. and Depomed, Inc. All of these potential competitors have various formulations of fentanyl, a fast-acting opioid. We are not aware of any non-fentanyl related therapeutics in development for the treatment of cancer breakthrough pain. 

&#160;

With our contract manufacturing facility, we compete with contract pharmaceutical manufacturing companies such as Catalent, Inc., Patheon Holdings Co&#246;peratief U.A., Adare Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Metrics, Inc., a subsidiary of Mayne Pharma Group Limited, and other packaging and manufacture-related service providers. 

Government Regulation 

Product Approval 

Governmental authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local level, and other in countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, marketing, export and import of products such as those we are developing. Our product candidates, including our formulations of injectable meloxicam, Dex and Fado, must be approved by the FDA before they may legally be marketed in the United States. 

U.S. Drug Development Process 

In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and ensuring compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process, or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDA&#146;s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, warning letters, corrective actions, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties or any other actions. The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies according to Good Laboratory Practices regulations; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to the FDA&#146;s current Good Clinical Practices, or cGCPs, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its intended use; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; submission to the FDA of an NDA for a new drug; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the drug is produced to assess compliance with cGMP; and &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; FDA review and approval of the NDA. The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. 

Once a pharmaceutical product candidate is identified for development, it enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity, formulation and stability, as well as animal studies. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature, to the FDA as part of the IND. The sponsor must also include a protocol detailing, among other things, the objectives of the initial clinical trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated if the initial clinical trial lends itself to an efficacy evaluation. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA places the clinical trial on a clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Clinical holds also may be imposed by the FDA at any time before or during trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. 

All clinical trials must be conducted under the supervision of one or more qualified investigators, in accordance with cGCP regulations. These regulations include the requirement that all research subjects provide informed consent. Further, an institutional review board, or IRB, must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at any institution. An IRB considers, among other things, whether the risks to individuals participating in the trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the information regarding the clinical trial and the consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. 

&#160;

Once an IND is in effect, each new clinical protocol, and any amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the IND for FDA review and to the IRBs for approval. Protocols detail, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety. 

Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Phase I. The product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing may be conducted in patients. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Phase II. Phase II trials involve investigations in a limited patient population to identify possible AEs and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage and schedule. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Phase III. Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for regulatory approval and product labeling. Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA, and safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected side effects. Phase I, Phase II and Phase III testing may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB&#146;s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. 

Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 

U.S. Review and Approval Processes 

The results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the drug, proposed labeling and other relevant information, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA for a new drug, requesting approval to market the product. 

As an alternate path to FDA approval, particularly for modifications to drug products previously approved by the FDA, an applicant may submit an NDA under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA. Section 505(b)(2) was enacted as part of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, and it permits the submission of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from clinical trials not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. The FDA interprets Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA to permit the applicant to rely upon the FDA&#146;s previous findings of safety and effectiveness for an approved product. The FDA requires submission of information needed to support any changes to a previously approved drug, such as published data or new studies conducted by the applicant, including bioavailability or bioequivalence studies, or clinical trials demonstrating safety and effectiveness. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for all or some of the label indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the Section 505(b)(2) applicant. 

The submission of an NDA is subject to the payment of a substantial user fee; a waiver of such fee may be obtained under certain limited circumstances. For example, the agency will waive the application fee for the first human drug application that a small business or its affiliate submits for review. 

In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, or PREA, which was reauthorized under the FDA Amendments Act of 2007, an NDA or supplement to an NDA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any drug for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted. 

&#160;

Section 505(b)(2) New Drug Applications. To the extent that a Section 505(b)(2) NDA relies on clinical trials conducted for a previously approved drug product or the FDA&#146;s prior findings of safety and effectiveness for a previously approved drug product, the Section 505(b)(2) applicant must submit patent certifications in its Section 505(b)(2) application with respect to any patents for the approved product on which the application relies that are listed in the FDA&#146;s publication, Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly referred to as the Orange Book. Specifically, the applicant must certify for each listed patent that, in relevant part, (1) the required patent information has not been filed; (2) the listed patent has expired; (3) the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is not sought until after patent expiration; or (4) the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by the proposed new product. A certification that the new product will not infringe the previously approved product&#146;s listed patent or that such patent is invalid or unenforceable is known as a Paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge one or more listed patents through a Paragraph IV certification, the FDA will not approve the Section 505(b)(2) NDA application until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired. Further, the FDA will also not approve, as applicable, a Section 505(b)(2) NDA application until any non-patent exclusivity, such as, for example, five-year exclusivity for obtaining approval of a new chemical entity, three-year exclusivity for an approval based on new clinical trials, or pediatric exclusivity, listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product, has expired. 

If the Section 505(b)(2) NDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the owner of the referenced NDA for the previously approved product and relevant patent holders within 20 days after the Section 505(b)(2) NDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement suit against the Section 505(b)(2) applicant. Under the FDCA, the filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of receipt of the notification regarding a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the Section 505(b)(2) NDA for 30 months, beginning on the date the patent holder receives notice, or until a court deems the patent unenforceable, invalid or not infringed, whichever is earlier. Even if a patent infringement claim is not brought within the 45-day period, a patent infringement claim may be brought under traditional patent law, but it does not invoke the 30-month stay. Moreover, in cases where a Section 505(b)(2) application containing a Paragraph IV certification is submitted after the fourth year of a previously approved drug&#146;s five year exclusivity period, and the patent holder brings suit within 45 days of notice of certification, the 30-month period is automatically extended to prevent approval of the Section 505(b)(2) application until the date that is seven and one-half years after approval of the previously approved reference product. The court also has the ability to shorten or lengthen either the 30-month or the seven and one-half year period if either party is found not to be reasonably cooperating in expediting the litigation. Thus, the Section 505(b)(2) applicant may invest a significant amount of time and expense in the development of its product only to be subject to significant delay and patent litigation before its product may be commercialized. Alternatively, if the NDA applicant or relevant patent holder does not file a patent infringement lawsuit within the specified 45 day period, the FDA may approve the Section 505(b)(2) application at any time, assuming the application is otherwise approvable. 

Notwithstanding the approval of many products by the FDA pursuant to Section 505(b)(2), over the last few years, some pharmaceutical companies and others have objected to the FDA&#146;s interpretation of Section 505(b)(2). If the FDA changes its interpretation of Section 505(b)(2), or if the FDA&#146;s interpretation is successfully challenged in court, this could delay or even prevent the FDA from approving any Section 505(b)(2) NDA that we submit. 

We are pursuing a regulatory strategy pursuant to Section 505(b)(2) in connection with our NDA submissions for Dex-IN based on the expiration of the originator&#146;s patent. In the NDA submissions for our other product candidates, we intend to follow the development and approval pathway permitted under the FDCA that we believe will maximize their commercial opportunities. 

FDA Review of New Drug Applications. The FDA reviews all NDAs submitted to ensure that they are sufficiently complete for substantive review before it accepts them for filing. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the NDA must be re-submitted with the additional information. The re-submitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is cGMP-compliant to assure and preserve the product&#146;s identity, strength, quality and purity. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. The FDA may refer the NDA to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts who provide advice and recommendations when requested by the FDA on matters of importance that come before the agency. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee. 

The approval process is lengthy and difficult, and the FDA may refuse to approve an NDA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical data or other data and information. Even if such data and information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. The FDA will issue a complete response letter if the agency decides not to approve the NDA in its present form. The complete response letter usually describes all of 

&#160;

the specific deficiencies that the FDA identified in the NDA. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical trials. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, withdraw the application or request an opportunity for a hearing. 

If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages, or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. In addition, the FDA may require Phase IV testing, which involves clinical trials designed to further assess a drug&#146;s safety and effectiveness after NDA approval, and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. 

Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity 

Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA marketing approval of our product candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product&#146;s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half of the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent and within sixty days of approval of the drug. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we intend to apply for restorations of patent term for patents that issue from some of our currently owned or licensed patents or patent applications to add patent life beyond their current expiration dates, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA. 

Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can also delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active pharmaceutical ingredient, or active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or a Section 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, the FDCA will not prevent the submission or approval of another full Section 505(b)(1) NDA, but such an NDA applicant would be required to conduct its own preclinical and adequate, well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. Further, a Section 505(b)(2) application may be submitted after four years if it contains a Paragraph IV certification that a listed patent is invalid, unenforceable, or not infringed for the applicant&#146;s drug product. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, Section 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application. Such clinical trials may, for example, support new indications, dosages, routes of administration or strengths of an existing drug, or for a new use, if new clinical investigations that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are determined by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application. This exclusivity, which is sometimes referred to as clinical investigation exclusivity, prevents the FDA from approving an application under a Section 505(b)(2) NDA or an ANDA for the same conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations before the expiration of three years from the date of approval. Such three-year exclusivity, however, would not prevent the approval of another application if the applicant submits a Section 505(b)(1) NDA and has conducted its own adequate, well-controlled clinical trials demonstrating safety and efficacy, nor would it prevent approval of an ANDA or a Section 505(b)(2) NDA product that did not incorporate the exclusivity-protected changes of the approved drug product. The FDCA, FDA regulations and other applicable regulations and policies provide incentives to manufacturers to create modified, non-infringing versions of a drug or competitive product. 

Pediatric exclusivity is another type of exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, provides an additional six months of exclusivity to be attached to any existing exclusivity (e.g., three or five year exclusivity) or patent protection for a drug. This six month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent protection, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric trial in accordance with an FDA-issued &#147;Written Request&#148; for such a trial. The current pediatric exclusivity provision was reauthorized in September 2007.

Post-Approval Requirements 

Any drugs for which we receive FDA approval will be subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements. In September 2007, the FDA Amendments Act of 2007 was enacted, giving the FDA enhanced post-marketing authority, including the authority to require post-marketing studies and clinical trials, labeling changes based on new safety information and compliance with risk evaluations and mitigation strategies approved by the FDA. The FDA strictly regulates labeling, advertising, promotion and other types of information on products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. Further, manufacturers of drugs must continue to comply with cGMP requirements, which are extensive and require considerable time, resources and ongoing investment to ensure compliance. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval. 

Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacturing and distribution of approved drugs are required to list their products and to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. The cGMP requirements apply to all stages of the manufacturing process, including the production, processing, sterilization, packaging, labeling, storage and shipment of the drug. Manufacturers must establish validated systems to ensure that products meet specifications and regulatory standards and test each product batch or lot prior to its release. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical quantities of our product candidates. Future FDA and state inspections may identify compliance issues at our site or at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution or may require substantial resources to correct. 

The FDA may withdraw a product approval if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market. Further, the failure to maintain compliance with regulatory requirements may result in administrative or judicial actions, such as fines, warning letters, holds on clinical trials, product recalls or seizures, product detention or refusal to permit the import or export of products, refusal to approve pending applications or supplements, restrictions on marketing or manufacturing, injunctions or civil or criminal penalties. 

From time to time, legislation is drafted, introduced and passed in the U.S. Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the approval, manufacturing and marketing of products regulated by the FDA. In addition to new legislation, the FDA regulations and policies are often revised or reinterpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our product candidates. It is impossible to predict whether further legislative or FDA regulation or policy changes will be enacted or implemented and what the impact of such changes, if any, may be. 

The Drug Enforcement Administration 

Certain products that we manufacture are regulated as a &#147;controlled substance&#148; as defined in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, or CSA, which establishes registration, security, recordkeeping, reporting, storage, distribution and other requirements administered by the DEA. The DEA is concerned with the control and handling of controlled substances, and with the equipment and raw materials used in their manufacture and packaging, in order to prevent loss and diversion into illicit channels of commerce. 

The DEA regulates controlled substances as Schedule I, II, III, IV or V substances, with Schedule II substances considered to present the highest risk of substance abuse and Schedule V substances the lowest risk. Certain active ingredients are listed by the DEA as Schedule II and Schedule III under the CSA. Consequently, their manufacture, shipment and storage are subject to a high degree of oversight and regulation. The DEA establishes annually an aggregate quota for how much certain controlled substances that we manufacture may be produced in total in the United States, based on the DEA&#146;s estimate of the quantity needed to meet legitimate scientific and medicinal needs. This limited aggregate amount that the DEA allows to be produced in the United States each year is allocated among individual companies, who must submit applications annually to the DEA for individual production and procurement quotas. We must receive an annual quota from the DEA in order to produce any Schedule II substance. The DEA may adjust aggregate production quotas and individual production and procurement quotas from time to time during the year, although the DEA has substantial discretion in whether or not to make such adjustments. Annual registration is required for any facility that manufactures, distributes, dispenses, imports or exports any controlled substance. The registration is specific to the particular location, activity and controlled substance schedule. 

The DEA requires facilities that manufacture controlled substances to maintain certain security requirements. Security requirements vary by controlled substance schedule, with the most stringent requirements applying to Schedule I and Schedule II substances. Required security measures include background checks on employees and physical control of inventory through measures such as cages, surveillance cameras and inventory reconciliations. Records must be maintained for the handling of all controlled 

&#160;

substances and periodic reports made to the DEA, for example, distribution reports for Schedule I and II controlled substances, Schedule III substances that are narcotics and other designated substances. Reports must also be made for thefts or losses of any controlled substance and to obtain authorization to destroy any controlled substance. In addition, special authorization and notification requirements apply to imports and exports. 

Failure to maintain compliance with applicable requirements, particularly as manifested in loss or diversion, can result in enforcement action that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The DEA may seek civil penalties, refuse to renew necessary registrations or initiate proceedings to revoke those registrations. In certain circumstances, violations could result in criminal proceedings. 

There is a risk that DEA regulations may interfere with the manufacture and supply of the drugs sold commercially, and thus with our ability to produce products in the volume needed to meet commercial demand. 

Foreign Regulation 

In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our product candidates to the extent we choose to clinically evaluate or sell any products outside of the United States. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval of a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country. As in the United States, post-approval regulatory requirements, such as those regarding product manufacture, marketing or distribution would apply to any product that is approved outside the United States. 

Third Party Payor Coverage and Reimbursement 

In both the United States and foreign markets, our ability to commercialize our product candidates successfully, and to attract commercialization partners for our product candidates, depends in significant part on the availability of adequate financial coverage and reimbursement from third party payors, including, in the United States, governmental payors such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs, managed care organizations, and private health insurers. Medicare is a federally funded program managed by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, through local fiscal intermediaries and carriers that administer coverage and reimbursement for certain healthcare items and services furnished to the elderly and disabled. As required by Medicare contracting reform, CMS is transitioning from fiscal intermediaries and carriers to Medicare Administrative Contractors for fee-for-service Medicare. Medicaid is an insurance program for certain categories of patients whose income and assets fall below state defined levels and who are otherwise uninsured that is both federally and state funded and managed by each state. The federal government sets general guidelines for Medicaid and each state creates specific regulations that govern its individual program. Each payor has its own process and standards for determining whether it will cover and reimburse a procedure or particular product. Private payors often rely on the lead of the governmental payors in rendering coverage and reimbursement determinations. Therefore, achieving favorable CMS coverage and reimbursement is usually a significant gating issue for successful introduction of a new product. The competitive position of some of our products will depend, in part, upon the extent of coverage and adequate reimbursement for such products and for the procedures in which such products are used. Prices at which we or our customers seek reimbursement for our product candidates can be subject to challenge, reduction or denial by the government and other payors. 

The U.S. Congress and state legislatures may, from time to time, propose and adopt initiatives aimed at cost containment, which could impact our ability to sell our product candidates profitably. For example, in March 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the associated reconciliation bill, which we refer to collectively as the Health Care Reform Law, a sweeping law intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms. Effective October 1, 2010, the Health Care Reform Law revised the definition of &#147;average manufacturer price&#148; for reporting purposes, which could increase the amount of Medicaid drug rebates to states once the provision is effective. Further, beginning in 2011, the new law imposed a significant annual fee on companies that manufacture or import branded prescription drug products. Substantial new provisions affecting compliance have also been enacted, which may require us to modify our business practices with healthcare practitioners. We will not know the full effects of the Health Care Reform Law until applicable federal and state agencies issue regulations or guidance under the new law. Although it is too early to determine the effect of the Health Care Reform Law, the new law appears likely to continue the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing, especially under the Medicare program, and may also increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs. Moreover, in the coming years, additional changes could be made to governmental healthcare programs that could significantly impact the success of our product candidates. 

&#160;

The cost of pharmaceuticals continues to generate substantial governmental and third party payor interest. We expect that the pharmaceutical industry will experience pricing pressures due to the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of managed care organizations and additional legislative proposals. Our results of operations could be adversely affected by current and future healthcare reforms. 

Some third party payors also require pre-approval of coverage for new or innovative devices or drug therapies before they will reimburse healthcare providers that use such therapies. While we cannot predict whether any proposed cost-containment measures will be adopted or otherwise implemented in the future, the announcement or adoption of these proposals could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain adequate prices for our product candidates and operate profitably. 

Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements 

In the United States, our activities are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including the CMS, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (e.g., the Office of Inspector General), the U.S. Department of Justice and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the Department of Justice, and state and local governments. These regulations include: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; the federal healthcare program anti-kickback law, which prohibits, among other things, persons from soliciting, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual, for an item or service or the purchasing or ordering of a good or service, for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; federal false claims laws which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other government reimbursement programs that are false or fraudulent, and which may apply to entities like us which provide coding and billing advice to customers; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which prohibits executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters and which also imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; the federal transparency requirements under the Health Care Reform Law, which require manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to report to the Department of Health and Human Services information related to physician payments and other transfers of value and physician ownership and investment interests; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; the FDCA, which, among other things, strictly regulates drug product marketing, prohibits manufacturers from marketing drug products for off-label use and regulates the distribution of drug samples; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; the federal Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, which made changes to HIPAA, including extending the reach of HIPAA beyond HIPAA covered entities, increasing the maximum civil monetary penalties for violations of HIPAA, granting enforcement authority to state attorneys general and imposing a breach notification requirement on HIPAA covered entities and business associates; and &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers, and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by federal laws, thus complicating compliance efforts. Employees 

We currently have 186 full-time employees and 2 temporary employees. None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements, and we consider relations with our employees to be good.
