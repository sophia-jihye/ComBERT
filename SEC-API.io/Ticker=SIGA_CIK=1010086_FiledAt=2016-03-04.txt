Overview 

&#160; 

SIGA Technologies, Inc. is referred to throughout this report as &#8220;SIGA,&#8221; &#8220;the Company,&#8221; &#8220;we&#8221; or &#8220;us.&#8221; 

&#160; 

We are a company specializing in the development and commercialization of solutions for serious unmet medical needs and biothreats. Our lead product is Tecovirimat, also known as ST-246&#174;, an orally administered antiviral drug that targets orthopoxviruses. While Tecovirimat is not yet licensed as safe or effective by the U.S. Food &#38; Drug Administration, it is a novel small-molecule drug that is being delivered to the Strategic National Stockpile under Project BioShield. 

&#160; 

BARDA Contract - Tecovirimat also known as ST-246&#174; 

&#160; 

On May 13, 2011, SIGA signed a contract with the U.S. Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (the &#8220;BARDA Contract&#8221;) pursuant to which SIGA agreed to deliver two million courses of Tecovirimat to the U.S. Strategic National Stockpile (&#8220;Strategic Stockpile&#8221;). The BARDA Contract is worth approximately $466 million, including $409.8 million for the manufacture and delivery of 1.7 million courses of Tecovirimat and $56 million of potential reimbursements related to development and supportive activities (the &#8220;Base Contract&#8221;). In addition to the Base Contract, the BARDA Contract also contains various options that are exercisable at BARDA&#8217;s discretion. The BARDA Contract expires in September 2020. 

Under the Base Contract with the U.S. Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (&#8220;BARDA&#8221;), BARDA has agreed to buy from SIGA 1.7 million courses of Tecovirimat. Additionally, SIGA expects to contribute to BARDA 300,000 courses of Tecovirimat at no additional cost to BARDA 

For courses of Tecovirimat that are physically delivered to the Strategic Stockpile, the Company has replacement obligations, at no cost to BARDA, in the event that the final version of Tecovirimat approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the &#8220; FDA &#8221; ) is different from any course of Tecovirimat that has been delivered to the Strategic Stockpile or if Tecovirimat does not meet any specified label claims, fails release testing or does not meet 38 month expiry period (from time of delivery to the Strategic Stockpile), or if Tecovirimat is recalled or deemed to be recalled for any reason. 

The Company is eligible for a $102.5 million hold back payment from BARDA if the FDA approves Tecovirimat, either in the currently delivered form or in a different form. The hold back payment is part of the $409.8 million of payments that can be received by the Company for the manufacture and delivery of 1.7 million courses of Tecovirimat. If the approved version of Tecovirimat is different from those delivered to the Strategic Stockpile, then the Company is obligated to replace the previously delivered courses, at no additional cost, to BARDA. If the final approved version of Tecovirimat differs from those delivered, the hold back payment would not be paid until the obligation to replace the previously delivered product at no additional cost is satisfied. 

The Base Contract with BARDA includes $409.8 million of payments, inclusive of upfront payments and milestone payments, that can be received by the Company for the manufacture and delivery of 1.7 million courses of Tecovirimat that are to be purchased by BARDA and physically delivered to the Strategic Stockpile. The timing and amount of specific payments to the Company are based on sub-payment tranches provided for in the Base Contract. As of December 31, 2015, the Company has received $249.2 million under the Base Contract related to the manufacture and physical delivery of courses of Tecovirimat. Included in this amount are a $41 million advance payment in 2011 for the completion of certain planning and preparatory activities related to the Base Contract, a $12.3 million milestone payment in 2012 for the completion of the product labeling strategy for Tecovirimat, a $8.2 million milestone payment in 2013 for the completion of the commercial validation campaign for Tecovirimat, and $187.7 million of payments for physical deliveries of 1.4 million courses of Tecovirimat to the Strategic Stockpile beginning in 2013 (an additional 259,200 courses were delivered at no cost to BARDA). Product deliveries of 1.3 million of those courses in 2013 and 2014 (including 259,200 courses delivered at no cost to BARDA) were at a provisional dosage of 600 mg administered once daily. Product deliveries of 383,754 courses in 2015 were at a provisional dosage of 600 mg administered twice per day (1,200 mg per day). 

The Company is eligible to receive an additional $160.6 million under the Base Contract for the manufacture, delivery and purchase by BARDA of courses of Tecovirimat. Included in this amount are: $37.6 million of payments following additional future physical deliveries of Tecovirimat to the Strategic Stockpile; a $20.5 million milestone payment for successful submission to the FDA of a complete application for Tecovirimat regulatory approval; and a $102.5 million hold back payment, which represents a 25% hold back on the $409.8 million of total payments tied to the manufacture and delivery of 1.7 million courses of Tecovirimat that are to be purchased by BARDA. The $102.5 million hold back payment would be triggered by FDA approval of Tecovirimat, as long as the Company does not have, as described above, a continuing product replacement obligation to BARDA. The $37.6 million of payments for product deliveries is currently targeted by the Company to be fully received by the first or second quarter of 2017. 

Product deliveries of Tecovirimat in 2015, and in the future, are expected to be at a provisional dosage of 600 mg administered twice per day (1,200 mg per day). This is a change from the provisional dosage that was in effect when product deliveries were made in 2013 and 2014 (600 mg per day). In 2013 and 2014, the provisional dosage of courses delivered to the Strategic Stockpile was 600 mg administered once a day. The change in the provisional dosage is based on FDA guidance received by the Company in 2014, subsequent to the delivery of 1.3 million courses of Tecovirimat. Based on the current provisional dosage of 600 mg administered twice per day (1,200 mg per day), the Company currently expects to supplement previously delivered courses of Tecovirimat, at no additional cost to BARDA, with additional dosages so that all of the courses previously delivered to BARDA will be at the new provisional dosage. The Company and BARDA agreed to an amendment (the &#8220;BARDA Amendment&#8221;) of the BARDA Contract to reflect the foregoing, which modification was approved by the Bankruptcy Court in April 2015 (see below "Administration of Chapter 11 Case" for additional detail). 

The Company expects to incur significant incremental costs with the production of additional dosage. The provisional dosage for Tecovirimat may be subject to additional changes based on possible additional FDA guidance. At the current provisional dosage of 600 mg administered twice per day (1,200 mg per day), the Company expects that total manufacturing costs, as a percentage of the $409.8 million that can be received by the Company for the manufacture and delivery of 1.7 million courses of 

Tecovirimat, will be less than 25%. This percentage estimate is subject to material change if, among other things, the provisional dosage changes or if $409.8 million is not received by the Company from BARDA. 

The Base Contract with BARDA includes $56 million of potential reimbursement for development and supportive activities. These activities are reimbursed primarily on a cost-plus basis after each individual activity is authorized by BARDA and after costs are incurred. As of December 31, 2015, the Company has received, or invoiced, $15.3 million of reimbursement payments under the Base Contract for development and supportive activities. 

The BARDA Contract also separately contains $122.7 million of options that, if exercised by BARDA: would result in a $50 million payment to the Company in the event of FDA approval for extension to 84-month expiry for Tecovirimat (from 38 month expiry as required in the Base Contract); would fund up to $58.3 million of development and supportive activities such as work on a smallpox prophylaxis indication for Tecovirimat; and/or would fund $14.4 million of production-related activities related to warm-base manufacturing. In 2015, BARDA exercised two options related to extending the indication of the drug to the geriatric and pediatric populations. The stated value of these exercises was minimal. BARDA may not exercise additional options in the future. Options are exercisable by BARDA at its sole discretion. BARDA has indicated that it will evaluate, after the FDA&#8217;s review and evaluation of stability data, the Company's request that BARDA exercise the option for the $50 million payment to the Company in the event of FDA approval of 84-month expiry for Tecovirimat. 

The Company has been actively pursuing FDA approval of Tecovirimat for purposes of receiving the $102.5 million hold back payment (discussed above) as well as for strategic purposes. The Company is pursuing FDA approval under the &#8220;animal rule.&#8221; As such, the Company has completed multiple monkeypox and variola efficacy studies in non-human primates and has also completed a series of rabbitpox efficacy studies in rabbits. At this point in time, the Company does not expect additional substantive efficacy studies to be required prior to the filing of a New Drug Application (&#8220;NDA&#8221;). In the second quarter of 2015, the Company launched an expanded clinical human safety trial with first patient dosing. This clinical trial is expected to provide essential human safety data and to represent the last major step in support of an NDA filing with the FDA. SIGA is targeting the second or third quarter of 2017 for completion of testing and analysis of data for the expanded clinical human safety trial. An NDA filing is targeted for late 2017. 

Notwithstanding the above, there can be no assurance that the FDA will approve an NDA for Tecovirimat. Upon FDA approval of an NDA for Tecovirimat, the Company would be able to address replacement obligations, if any, relating to courses of Tecovirimat that have been delivered to the Strategic National Stockpile. 

Lead Product - Tecovirimat&#8482; also known as St-246&#174; 

SIGA believes that Tecovirimat is among the first new small-molecule drugs delivered to the Strategic Stockpile under the Project BioShield Act of 2004 (&#8220;Project BioShield&#8221;). Tecovirimat is an investigational product that is not currently approved by the FDA as a treatment of smallpox or any other indication. Nevertheless, the FDA has designated Tecovirimat for &#8220;fast-track&#8221; status, creating a path for expedited FDA review and eventual regulatory approval. Tecovirimat is a novel, patented drug that is easy to store, transport and administer. There could be several uses for an effective smallpox antiviral drug: to reduce mortality and morbidity in those infected with the smallpox virus, to protect the non-immune who risk developing smallpox following virus exposure, and as an adjunct to the smallpox vaccine in order to reduce the frequency of serious adverse events due to the live virus used for vaccination. 

Tecovirimat&#8217;s regulatory path, and SIGA&#8217;s development activities related to Tecovirimat, are materially guided by the results of an FDA Advisory Committee meeting that was convened in December 2011 (the &#8220;Advisory Committee&#8221;). The Advisory Committee was convened to consider proposals for using a surrogate orthopoxvirus model and to determine what elements of the &#8220;animal rule&#8221; constitute &#8220;enough&#8221; evidence for approval of a drug for the treatment of smallpox. The Advisory Committee&#8217;s recommendation confirmed that the monkeypox, rabbitpox and ectromelia models, especially in combination, could suitably provide appropriate evidence of efficacy for treatment of smallpox. Subsequent to the Advisory Committee, SIGA has had substantive meetings and communications with the FDA regarding the regulatory path of Tecovirimat. Development activities for Tecovirimat are based on the Advisory Committee&#8217;s recommendation, and take into account meetings and communications with the FDA. 

Tecovirimat has Orphan Drug designation for both the treatment and prevention of smallpox, and in late 2010, Tecovirimat received Orphan Drug designation for the broader indication of treatment of orthopoxvirus infections (vaccinia, variola, monkeypox and cowpox). An Investigational New Drug (&#8220;IND&#8221;) application for an intravenous (IV) formulation of Tecovirimat was filed with FDA in September 2012 and SIGA received a safe to proceed letter from FDA in November 2012 along with a letter granting fast-track status. SIGA expects to initiate a phase 1 single ascending dose safety and pharmacokinetic study for the IV formulation in 2016. 

Chapter 11 Filing 

On September 16, 2014 (the &#8220;Petition Date&#8221;), the Company filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter 11 of Title 11 of the United States Code (the &#8220;Bankruptcy Code&#8221;) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (the &#8220;Bankruptcy Court&#8221;) chapter 11 Case Number 14-12623 (SHL). The Company is continuing to operate its business as a &#8220;debtor-in-possession&#8221; in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code. 

The Company commenced the chapter 11 case to preserve and to ensure its ability to satisfy its commitments under the BARDA Contract (as defined in Note 3 to the financial statements) and to preserve its operations, which likely would have been jeopardized by the enforcement of a judgment stemming from the litigation with PharmAthene, Inc. ( &#8220; PharmAthene&#8221;) (see below "PharmAthene Litigation"). While operating as a debtor-in-possession under chapter 11, the Company pursued an appeal of the Delaware Court of Chancery Final Order and Judgment (as defined below), without having to post a bond. On December 23, 2015, the Delaware Supreme Court affirmed the Delaware Court of Chancery Final Order and Judgment. 

&#32;On December 15, 2015, the Company filed a Plan of Reorganization. Subsequent to the initial filing, amendments have been made to the Plan of Reorganization (as amended, the &#8220; POR&#8221;). The POR is supported by the official committee of unsecured creditors appointed in the Company's chapter 11 case. Please see the section titled Plan of Reorganization &#32;for details regarding the POR. The implementation of the POR is subject to confirmation thereof by the Bankruptcy Court in accordance with the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and the occurrence of the effective date under the POR. 

PharmAthene Litigation 

On August 8, 2014, the Delaware Court of Chancery issued its Remand Opinion and related order in the litigation initiated against the Company in 2006 by PharmAthene. In the Remand Opinion, the Court of Chancery determined, among other things, that PharmAthene is entitled to a lump sum damages award for its lost profits related to Tecovirimat, with interest and fees, based on United States government purchases of the Company's smallpox drug allegedly anticipated as of December 2006. On January 15, 2015, the Delaware Court of Chancery entered its Final Order and Judgment awarding PharmAthene approximately $195 million, including pre-judgment interest up to January 15, 2015 (the &#8220;Outstanding Judgment&#8221;). On January 16, 2015, the Company filed a notice of appeal of the Outstanding Judgment with the Delaware Supreme Court and, on January 30, 2015, PharmAthene filed a notice of cross appeal. On October 7, 2015, the Delaware Supreme Court heard oral argument, en banc. On December 23, 2015 the Delaware Supreme Court affirmed the Outstanding Judgment (the &#8220; Delaware Supreme Court Affirmation&#8221;). As of December 31, 2015, the accrued obligation under the Delaware Court of Chancery Final Order and Judgment, including post-judgment interest, is estimated to be $205 million. The Company's pending chapter 11 case prevents PharmAthene from taking any enforcement action with respect to the Outstanding Judgment. The Outstanding Judgment is to be treated and satisfied under the POR. 

Administration of Chapter 11 Case 

On September 17, 2014, the Company received Bankruptcy Court approval of certain &#8220;first-day&#8221; motions, which preserved the Company's ability to continue operations without interruption in chapter 11. As part of the &#8220;first-day&#8221; motions, the Company received approval to pay or otherwise honor certain pre-petition obligations generally designed to support the Company's operations. Additionally, the Bankruptcy Court confirmed the Company's authority to pay for goods and services received post-petition in the ordinary course of business. 

In October 2014 , the U.S. Trustee for the Southern District of New York (the &#8220;U.S. Trustee&#8221;) appointed an official committee of unsecured creditors (the &#8220;UCC&#8221;). The UCC has a right to be heard on any issue in the Company&#8217;s chapter 11 case. There can be no assurance that the UCC will support the Company&#8217;s positions on matters to be presented to the Bankruptcy Court. 

As part of the chapter 11 case, the Company has retained, pursuant to Bankruptcy Court authorization, legal and other professionals to advise the Company in connection with the administration of its chapter 11 case and its litigation with PharmAthene, and certain other professionals to provide services and advice in the ordinary course of business. From time to time, the Company may seek Bankruptcy Court approval to retain additional professionals. 

Pursuant to an order of the Bankruptcy Court, dated October 28, 2014, the Company was authorized to pay pre-petition obligations to certain service providers that are fully reimbursable by BARDA pursuant to the BARDA Contract (as defined in Note 4). Pursuant to an order of the Bankruptcy Court, dated January 14, 2015, the Company was authorized to satisfy a fully- 

secured term loan provided by General Electric Capital Corporation in the approximate amount of $1.8 million. Such amount, and related fees, was paid by the Company on January 16, 2015 and all liens securing the credit facility were released. 

Pursuant to orders entered by the Bankruptcy Court in April 2015, the Company was authorized to consummate the following transactions: assumption of the BARDA Contract, as amended by the BARDA Amendment (as defined in Note 4 to the financial statements); assumption of the Company&#8217;s commercial manufacturing agreement (the &#8220;Commercial Manufacturing Agreement&#8221;) with Albemarle Corporation (&#8220;Albemarle&#8221;), as amended by a 2015 amendment (the &#8220;2015 Amendment&#8221;); and assumption of the Company&#8217;s lease with Research Way Investments, as amended by the Tenth Addendum to Commercial Lease, for the Company&#8217;s research and development facility located at 4575 S.W. Research Way, Corvallis, Oregon. The 2015 Amendment to the Commercial Manufacturing Agreement with Albemarle provides the Company with improved pricing on future purchases of active pharmaceutical ingredient (&#8220;API&#8221;) for Tecovirimat. As part of the assumption of the Commercial Manufacturing Agreement, as amended, on April 30, 2015, the Company paid Albemarle&#8217;s prepetition claim under the Commercial Manufacturing Agreement of approximately $2.7 million. The Tenth Addendum to the Commercial Lease with Research Way Investments reduced the Company's rent costs for the research and development facility by approximately $35,000 per month, starting May 1, 2015. Additionally, as part of the Tenth Addendum, Research Way Investments withdrew its proof of claim for $971,451 filed in the Bankruptcy Court. 

Plan of Reorganization 

On December 15, 2015, the Company filed a Plan of Reorganization. Subsequent to the initial filing, amendments have been made to the Plan of Reorganization (as amended, the &#8220;POR&#8221;). Implementation of the POR is subject to confirmation thereof by the Bankruptcy Court in accordance with the provisions of the United States Bankruptcy Code and the occurrence of the effective date under the POR. The POR is supported by the UCC. There can be no assurance that the POR will be confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court. The POR, as more fully described below, addresses, among other things, how the Company will treat and satisfy its liabilities relating to the period prior to the commencement of its chapter 11 case, including all claims held by PharmAthene. 

By the order dated February 16, 2016, the Bankruptcy Court approved the Company&#8217;s Disclosure Statement for the POR (the &#8220;Disclosure Statement&#8221;), thereby enabling the Company to solicit acceptances or rejections of the POR from those creditors entitled to vote on the POR. The Bankruptcy Court has scheduled a hearing to consider confirmation of the POR for April 5, 2016. 

The POR provides for, among other things: 

&#8226; Prepetition unsecured claims (other than PharmAthene&#8217;s claim) will be paid in cash in full. 

&#8226; Upon the effective date of the POR, ownership of existing shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock shall remain unaltered by the POR; however, existing shares will be subject to potential future cancellation (without receipt of any consideration) in the event that PharmAthene&#8217;s claim is satisfied through the issuance of newly issued shares of SIGA stock (option (ii) described below). 

&#8226; Once the Delaware Supreme Court enters final judgment on the December 23 ruling (which is expected to occur on or about March 22, 2016), the Company will have 120 days (subject to a possible 90 day extension) to select one of the following options to satisfy PharmAthene&#8217;s claim under the POR: (i) payment in full in cash of the Company's obligation under the Delaware Court of Chancery Final Order and Judgment, which is estimated to be approximately $205 million as of December 31, 2015; (ii) delivery to PharmAthene of 100% of newly-issued stock of SIGA, with all existing shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock being cancelled with no distribution to existing shareholders on account thereof; or (iii) such other treatment as is mutually agreed upon by the Company and PharmAthene. 

* The 120 day period can be extended for a maximum of 90 additional days in exchange for payment by the Company of $20 million to PharmAthene to be applied to payments to be made under option (i) set forth above (if selected), and otherwise nonrefundable. 

* In addition, PharmAthene shall be paid $5 million on the effective date of the POR to be applied to payments to be made under option (i) set forth above (if selected), and otherwise nonrefundable. 

&#8226; The POR requires the Company to comply with certain affirmative and negative covenants from the date the POR becomes effective until the covenants are terminated as provided under the POR, and if the Company breaches any covenant, PharmAthene is entitled to exercise certain remedies provided in the POR. 

Pre-Petition Claims 

As a result of the chapter 11 filing, the payment of pre-petition liabilities is generally subject to compromise pursuant to a plan of reorganization. Generally, under the Bankruptcy Code, actions to enforce or otherwise effect payment of pre-bankruptcy filing liabilities are stayed. Although payment of pre-petition claims generally is not permitted, the Bankruptcy Court granted the Company authority to pay certain pre-petition claims in designated categories and subject to certain terms and conditions. Among other things, the Bankruptcy Court authorized the Company to pay certain pre-petition claims relating to employees, critical vendors, a fully-secured pre-petition term loan, and services for which the Company receives reimbursement from the government. 

On October 30, 2014, the Company filed its schedules of assets and liabilities and statement of financial affairs (the &#8220;Schedules&#8221;) with the Bankruptcy Court. The Bankruptcy Court entered an order setting March 30, 2015 as the deadline for filing proofs of claim (the &#8220;Bar Date&#8221;). The Bar Date is the date by which claims against the Company relating to the period prior to the commencement of the Company's chapter 11 case must be filed if such claims are not listed in liquidated, non-contingent and undisputed amounts in the Schedules, or if the claimant disagrees with the amount, characterization or classification of its claim as reflected in the Schedules. Claims that are subject to the Bar Date and which are not filed on or prior to the Bar Date may be barred from participating in any distribution that may be made under a plan of reorganization in the Company's chapter 11 case. 

As of February 15, 2016 approximately 126 proofs of claim were outstanding (including claims that were previously identified on the Schedules), a portion of which assert, in part or in whole, unliquidated claims. Prior to the Bar Date, PharmAthene asserted a claim in the amount of $194,649,042, which reflects pre-judgment interest up to January 15, 2015 on the Delaware Court of Chancery Final Order and Judgment. It is estimated that, as of December 31, 2015, the accrued obligation to PharmAthene under the Delaware Court of Chancery Final Order and Judgment, including post-judgment interest, is $205 million. Excluding the PharmAthene claim, all other liquidated proofs of claim amount to $3,037,125. 

Separately, a contingent and unliquidated claim was filed by BARDA prior to the Bar Date in the amount of $109,339,609 in connection with amounts BARDA identified as subject to repayment in the event that the Company fails to perform under the terms of the BARDA Contract. As a result of the assumption of the BARDA Contract, as described above, BARDA withdrew the claim on August 4, 2015. 

Certain proof of claims that have been filed relate to amounts which have been paid by the Company as of December 31, 2015. 

The Company will ask the Bankruptcy Court to disallow claims that the Company believes are duplicative, have been later amended or superseded, are without merit, are overstated, have already been paid, or should be disallowed for other reasons. In addition, as a result of this process, the Company may identify additional liabilities that will need to be recorded or reclassified to Liabilities Subject to Compromise. The resolution of such claims could result in material adjustments to the Company&#8217;s financial statements. The determination of how liabilities will ultimately be treated cannot be made until the Bankruptcy Court confirms a plan of reorganization and such plan becomes effective. Accordingly, the ultimate amount or treatment of such liabilities is not determinable at this time. 

Other Matters Related to the Chapter 11 Case 

By motion filed with the Bankruptcy Court on April 8, 2015 (the &#8220;UCC 2004 Motion&#8221;), the UCC sought authority to take discovery under Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 2004 (&#8220;Rule 2004&#8221;) with respect to certain discrete matters. Rule 2004 permits a creditors&#8217; committee appointed in a chapter 11 case or other party in interest, subject to Bankruptcy Court approval, to conduct broad discovery relating to the acts, conduct, property and liabilities of a debtor or with respect to any matter that may affect the administration of the debtor&#8217;s bankruptcy case. The UCC 2004 Motion was filed for the purpose of determining whether the Company's estate has claims against certain officers and directors in connection with the matters sought to be investigated pursuant to the UCC 2004 Motion. 

Pursuant to an order of the Bankruptcy Court, dated June 16, 2015 (the &#8220;2004 Order&#8221;), the UCC 2004 Motion was granted, in part, with regard to certain discovery requests specifically listed in the UCC 2004 Motion. 

By a motion filed with the Bankruptcy Court on September 1, 2015, the UCC sought further discovery under Rule 2004 from PharmAthene and certain third parties with respect to one of the matters set forth in the UCC 2004 Motion. By order of the Bankruptcy Court dated October 2, 2015, the terms of which were agreed to by the Company and the UCC, the UCC was authorized to obtain certain additional discovery from PharmAthene related to the PharmAthene litigation. 

As of the date hereof, the Company, pursuant to the 2004 Order, has provided to the attorneys for the UCC the discovery already produced by the Company to PharmAthene in the PharmAthene litigation. No document requests or deposition subpoenas have been served by the UCC on the Company. 

The POR provides that, subject to confirmation and upon the effective date of the POR, all claims sought to be investigated by the UCC in connection with the UCC 2004 Motion will be released. 

NASDAQ/OTC Markets 

On September 16, 2014, the Company received a letter from the NASDAQ Stock Market LLC asserting that, based on the Company&#8217;s chapter 11 filing, the Company no longer met the continuing listing requirements necessary to maintain its listing on the NASDAQ Stock Market and would be promptly delisted. On March 18, 2015, after the expiration of an extension of time granted pursuant to a Company appeal, the Company received a letter from the NASDAQ hearings panel stating that the Company's securities would be delisted from the NASDAQ Stock Market. On March 20, 2015, the Company's common shares were suspended from trading on the NASDAQ Global Market at the opening of business and the Company's shares began trading on the OTC Markets under the "SIGAQ" symbol. 

Manufacturing 

SIGA does not have a manufacturing infrastructure and does not intend to develop one for the manufacture of Tecovirimat. SIGA relies on and uses third parties known as Contract Manufacturing Organizations (&#8220;CMOs&#8221;) to procure commercial raw materials and supplies, and to manufacture Tecovirimat. SIGA's CMOs apply methods and controls in facilities that are used for manufacturing, processing, packaging, testing, analyzing and holding pharmaceuticals which conform to current good manufacturing practices (&#8220;cGMP&#8221;), the standard set by FDA for manufacture of pharmaceuticals intended for human use. 

For the manufacture of Tecovirimat, the Company uses the following CMOs: Albemarle Corporation (&#8220;Albemarle&#8221;); Powdersize, Inc. (&#8220;Powdersize&#8221;), and Catalent Pharma Solutions LLC (&#8220;Catalent&#8221;). 

In August, 2011, SIGA entered into an agreement with Albemarle. The agreement was amended in April, 2015. Albemarle manufactures, tests and supplies active pharmaceutical ingredient (&#8220;API&#8221;) for use in Tecovirimat. SIGA agreed that, during the term of the agreement, SIGA will purchase 75% of its internal and external API requirements from Albemarle at a fixed price per kilogram. There is no minimum amount of API kilograms that must be used or acquired by SIGA. The following events are excluded from the &#8220;75% API&#8221; requirement: (i) if a contract entered into by SIGA for the sale of final drug product (&#8220;FDP&#8221;) requires that the product used as the API for such FDP be manufactured outside the U.S. and Albemarle is unwilling or unable to subcontract such manufacture to a party or parties that meet the terms of the agreement, (ii) if a contract entered into by SIGA for the sale of FDP in an intravenous formulation requires different specifications than those provided for under the agreement and the parties are not able to reach agreement on the necessary changes to the specifications or on pricing, or (iii) if Albemarle fails to perform any of its obligations under the agreement and does not cure such failure within 30 days of written notice from SIGA. SIGA is required to pay Albemarle within 45 days of their invoice date. Albemarle is required to deliver API that conforms with specifications outlined in the agreement; the Company is not required to pay for API that does not meet specifications. The Company has 120 days to reject any shipments that do not meet specifications or are damaged. In addition to receiving payments for API deliveries, Albemarle is also paid for related services, such as stability testing. The Company&#8217;s agreement with Albemarle continues for an initial term that shall continue until December 31, 2017.The Company has an option to extend the term up to an additional twelve months, if necessary, to fulfill its obligations under the BARDA Contract. Commencing ninety days prior to the termination date, the parties will negotiate in good faith in an effort to agree upon revised product pricing to be applicable during a renewal term of the agreement. In the event the parties are unable to agree to revised pricing during the ninety day negotiation period, then the agreement shall continue for a sixteen week period utilizing pricing in effect at the conclusion of the term; the agreement shall terminate at the end of such sixteen week period. 

Powdersize micronizes and tests API for use in Tecovirimat. The Company&#8217;s agreement with Powdersize continues for an initial term that is the longer of the period ending on (i) August 15, 2014 or (ii) the date the Company has fulfilled its delivery obligations under the BARDA Contract. Thereafter, this agreement may be renewed as provided for in such agreement. 

Catalent granulates, encapsulates, tests and packages Tecovirimat. Catalent sub-contracts the packaging services to Packaging Coordinators, Inc., a CMO that purchased Catalent&#8217;s packaging business. In addition, Catalent provides services related to commercial stability testing of drug product and preparation for tabulated stability and trend analysis for each time point. The Company&#8217;s agreement with Catalent continues for an initial term that is the longer of the period ending December 15, 2014 or the date the Company has fulfilled its delivery obligations under the BARDA Contract. Thereafter, this agreement may be renewed as provided for in such agreement. 

Any manufacturing failures or delays by SIGA&#8217;s CMOs could cause delays in delivery of Tecovirimat into the Strategic Stockpile. 

Market for Biological Defense Programs 

&#160; 

The market for biodefense countermeasures reflects continued awareness of the threat of global terror and biowarfare activity. The U.S. government is the largest source of development and procurement funding for academic institutions and biopharmaceutical companies conducting biodefense research or developing vaccines, anti-infectives and immunotherapies directed at potential agents of bioterror or biowarfare. U.S. government spending on biodefense programs includes development funding awarded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, BARDA and Department of Defense (&#8220;DoD&#8221;), and procurement of countermeasures by BARDA, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (&#8220;CDC&#8221;) and DoD. 

&#160; 

Project BioShield, which became law in 2004, authorizes the procurement of countermeasures for biological, chemical, radiological and nuclear attacks for the Strategic Stockpile, which is a national repository of medical assets and countermeasures designed to provide federal, state and local public health agencies with medical supplies needed to treat and protect those affected by terrorist attacks, natural disasters, industrial accidents and other public health emergencies. Project BioShield initially provided appropriations of $5.6 billion to be expended over ten years. The initial $5.6 billion appropriation expired on September 30, 2013. In 2013, Congress reauthorized Project BioShield as part of the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Reauthorization Act of 2013. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016 (also known as the 2016 omnibus spending bill) includes an annual appropriation of $1.02 billion for activities related to medical countermeasures for biological and other threats to civilian populations. Of this, $510 million has been set aside for procurement (reflecting an approximate doubling from Fiscal Year 2015), and $511 million has been set aside for advanced development and administrative expenses. 

In addition to the U.S. government, we believe that other potential additional markets for the sale of biodefense countermeasures include: 

&#8226; 

foreign governments, including both defense and public health agencies; 

&#8226; 

state and local governments, which may be interested in these products to protect, among others, emergency responders, such as police, fire and emergency medical personnel; 

&#8226; 

healthcare providers, including hospitals and clinics; and 

&#8226; 

non-governmental organizations and multinational companies, including transportation and security companies. 

Other Product Candidate 

&#160; 

Dengue fever, an acute febrile disease characterized by a sudden onset of fever and an abnormally high internal body temperature, is caused by one of four serotypes of dengue virus of the genus Flavivirus. Dengue fever can be classified as classical dengue fever, severe dengue (which includes the life threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever syndrome), or dengue shock syndrome. Dengue virus may be transmitted via the bite of an infected Aedes aegypti mosquito, which is found in tropical and sub-tropical regions around the world. 

Each year, regional epidemics of dengue fever cause significant morbidity and mortality. Regional epidemics also cause social disruption and substantial economic burden in affected areas, in part due to increased hospitalization rates and necessary mosquito control. The World Health Organization estimates that forty percent of the world's population is at risk with an estimated 50-100 million people infected with the virus each year. There is currently no approved antiviral or vaccine for the treatment or prevention of dengue-mediated disease. We have identified a lead pre-clinical drug candidate with activity against all four serotypes of virus and which has shown efficacy in a murine model of disease. 

We are seeking partners for our Dengue Antiviral drug candidate to support further development activity. 

Research Agreements 

&#160; 

We obtain funding in the form of grants or contracts from various agencies of the U.S. government to support our research and development activities. Currently, in addition to the BARDA Contract, we have one contract and one grant with varying expiration dates through February 2018 that provide for potential future aggregate research and development funding for specific projects of approximately $7.2 million. This amount includes, among other things, options that may or may not be exercised at the U.S. government&#8217;s discretion. We may not utilize all available funds under the grant covering the pre-clinical drug candidate. Moreover, the contracts and grants contain customary terms and conditions and include the U.S. government&#8217;s right to terminate or restructure a grant for convenience at any time. We have entered into the following collaborative research arrangements and contracts: 

&#160; Smallpox Antiviral Drug Development 

&#32;In 2006, we were awarded a contract from the National Institute of Health (&#8220;NIH&#8221;) totaling approximately $21 million for the continued development of ST-246, now also known as Tecovirimat. In 2008, we were awarded a $55.1 million contract from NIH to support the development of additional formulations and orthopox-related indications for ST-246. In 2008, NIH increased an existing $16.5 million contract to $20.0 million. In August 2011, these contracts were restructured and transferred to BARDA so that $14.0 million was eligible to cover performance through February 2013. Subsequently, the period of performance for a portion of the remaining funds available under the contract was extended to February 2018. As of December 31, 2015, $5.8 million remains available to us under the restructured contract. 

In September 2009, we received a three-year, $3.0 million Phase II grant from NIH to fund the continued development of ST-246 for the treatment of smallpox vaccine-related adverse events. This grant concluded in February 2013. 

&#160; 

Dengue Antiviral Drug Development 

In May 2011, we received a 5-year grant of $6.5 million from NIH to continue funding for the development of antiviral drugs for dengue. The grant has been extended to April 2017. As of December 31, 2015, there is $1.4 million available under this grant. 

General 

&#160; 

We receive cash payments from NIH and BARDA on a monthly basis, as services are performed or goods are purchased. Our current contract and grant, other than the BARDA Contract, do not include milestone payments. Amounts under contract and grant agreements, including the BARDA Contract, are not guaranteed and can be canceled at any time for reasons such as non-performance or convenience of the U.S. government and, if canceled, we will not receive funds for additional work under the agreements. 

&#160; 

For a discussion of research and development expenses, see Item 7, &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.&#8221; 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly evolving technology and intense competition. Our competitors include most of the major pharmaceutical companies, each of which has financial, technical and marketing resources significantly greater than ours. Biotechnology and other pharmaceutical competitors in the biodefense space include, but are not limited to, Bavarian Nordic AS, Chimerix Inc., and Emergent BioSolutions. Academic institutions, governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations are also conducting research activities and seeking patent protection and may commercialize products on their own or through joint ventures. 

&#160; 

Tecovirimat faces significant competition for U.S. government funding for both development and procurement of medical countermeasures for biological, chemical, radiological and nuclear threats, diagnostic testing systems, and other emergency preparedness countermeasures. 

&#160; 

Our commercial opportunities could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than products that we may develop. In addition, we may not be able to compete effectively if our product candidates do not satisfy governmental procurement requirements, particularly requirements of the U.S. government with respect to biodefense products. 

&#160; 

Human Resources and Research Facilities 

&#160; 

As of February 29, 2016, we had 29 &#32; full-time employees. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we consider our employee relations to be satisfactory. Our research and development facilities are located in Corvallis, Oregon, where we lease approximately 9,237 square feet under a lease agreement signed in January 2007, as amended in May 2011, and in April 2015, which expires in December 2017. 

Intellectual Property and Proprietary Rights 

&#160; 

SIGA&#8217;s commercial success will depend in part on its ability to obtain and maintain patent protection for its proprietary technologies, drug targets, and potential products and to preserve its trade secrets. Because of the substantial length of time and expense associated with bringing potential products through the development and regulatory clearance processes to reach the marketplace, the pharmaceutical industry places considerable importance on obtaining patent and trade secret protection. The patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. No consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed in biotechnology patents has emerged to date. Accordingly, SIGA cannot predict the type and extent of claims allowed in these patents. 

&#160; 

SIGA also relies upon trade secret protection for its confidential and proprietary information. No assurance can be given that other companies will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to SIGA&#8217;s trade secrets or that SIGA can meaningfully protect its trade secrets. 

SIGA exclusively owns its key patent portfolio, which relates to its leading drug candidate ST-246 (Tecovirimat). SIGA's key patent portfolio currently consists of nine U.S. utility patents, thirteen issued foreign patents, five U.S. utility patent applications, one international PCT patent applications and sixty two foreign patent applications.

The principal and material patent applications covering Tecovirimat include patent filings in multiple jurisdictions, including the United States, Europe, Asia, Africa, Australia, and other commercially significant markets. We hold 67 patent applications currently pending with respect to various compositions of Tecovirimat, methods of manufacturing, methods of treatment, and dosage forms. Expiration dates for pending patents, if granted, will fall between 2024 and 2034. 

Tecovirimat is currently SIGA&#8217;s sole clinical-stage drug candidate. In addition to the Tecovirimat patent portfolio, SIGA also has patents covering pre-clinical drug candidates. Substantially all of the pre-clinical patent portfolio is for Dengue Antiviral drug candidate. SIGA is currently seeking partners for its Dengue Antiviral drug candidate to support further development activity. 

FDA regulations require that patented drugs be sold under brand names that comply with various regulations. SIGA must develop and make efforts to protect these brand names for each of its products in order to avoid product piracy and to secure exclusive rights to these brand names. SIGA may expend substantial funds in developing and securing rights to adequate brand names for our products. SIGA currently have proprietary trademark rights in SIGA&#174;, ST-246&#174; and other brands used by us in the United States and certain foreign countries, but we may have to develop additional trademark rights in order to comply with regulatory requirements. SIGA consider securing adequate trademark rights to be important to its business. 

Government Regulation 

&#160; 

Regulatory Approval Process 

Regulation by governmental authorities in the United States and other countries is a significant factor in the production and marketing of any biopharmaceutical product that we may develop. The nature and the extent to which such regulations may apply to us will vary depending on the nature of any such product. Virtually all of our potential biopharmaceutical products will require regulatory approval by governmental agencies prior to non-governmental commercialization. In particular, human therapeutic products are subject to rigorous pre-clinical and clinical testing and other approval procedures by FDA and similar health authorities in foreign countries. Various federal statutes and regulations also govern or influence the manufacturing, safety, labeling, storage, record keeping and marketing of such products. The process of obtaining these approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial resources. 

&#160; 

In order to test clinically, and to produce and market products for diagnostic or therapeutic use, a company must comply with mandatory procedures and safety standards established by FDA and comparable agencies in foreign countries. Before beginning human clinical testing of a potential new drug in the United States, a company must file an IND application and receive clearance from FDA. An IND application is a summary of the pre-clinical studies that were conducted to characterize the drug, including toxicity and safety studies, information on the drug&#8217;s composition and the manufacturing and quality control procedures used to produce the drug, as well as a discussion of the human clinical studies that are being proposed. 

The pre-marketing clinical program required for approval by FDA for a new drug typically involves a time-consuming and costly three-phase process. In Phase I, trials are conducted with a small number of healthy subjects to determine the early safety profile, the pattern of drug distribution, metabolism and elimination. In Phase II, trials are conducted with small groups of patients afflicted with a target disease in order to determine preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and expanded evidence of safety. In Phase III, large scale, multi-center comparative trials, which may include both controlled and uncontrolled studies, are conducted with patients afflicted with a target disease in order to provide enough data for statistical proof of efficacy and safety required by FDA and other authorities. 

&#160; 

FDA closely monitors the progress of each of the three phases of clinical testing and may, in its discretion, reevaluate, alter, suspend or terminate the testing based on the data that has been accumulated to that point and its assessment of the risk/benefit ratio to the patients involved in the testing. Estimates of the total time typically required for carrying out such clinical testing vary between two and ten years. Upon completion of such clinical testing, a company typically submits an NDA to FDA that summarizes the results and observations of the drug during the clinical testing. Based on its review of the NDA, FDA will decide whether to approve the drug. This review process can be quite lengthy, and approval for the production and marketing of a new pharmaceutical product can require a number of years and substantial funding. There can be no assurance that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. 

&#160; 

FDA amended its regulations, effective June 30, 2002, to include the &#8220;animal rule&#8221; in circumstances that would permit the typical clinical testing regime to approve certain new drug and biological products used to reduce or prevent the toxicity of chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear agents not otherwise naturally present for use in humans based on evidence of safety 

in healthy subjects and evidence of effectiveness derived only from appropriate animal studies and any additional supporting data. FDA has indicated that approval for therapeutic use of Tecovirimat will be determined under the &#8220;animal rule.&#8221; 

&#160; 

Once the product is approved for sale, FDA regulations govern the production process and marketing activities, and a post-marketing testing and surveillance program may be required to monitor a product&#8217;s usage and effects. Product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained. Many other countries in which products developed by us may be marketed impose similar regulatory processes. 

&#160; 

FDA regulations also make available an alternative regulatory mechanism that may lead to use of the product under limited circumstances. The Emergency Use Authorization (&#8220;EUA&#8221;) authority allows the FDA Commissioner to strengthen the public health protections against biological, chemical, radiological and nuclear agents that may be used to attack the American people or the U.S. armed forces. Under this authority, the FDA Commissioner may allow medical countermeasures to be used in an emergency to diagnose, treat or prevent serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions caused by such agents when appropriate findings are made concerning the nature of the emergency, the availability of adequate and approved alternatives, and the quality of available data concerning the drug candidate under consideration for emergency use. We have provided data to FDA to support an EUA for Tecovirimat in the event of a smallpox attack. In November 2012, CDC filed an IND application for use of Tecovirimat in emergency situations until an EUA is in place. In December 2012, CDC received a &#8220;safe to proceed&#8221; letter from FDA for this IND. In August 2013, CDC filed a pre-EUA request for which FDA currently holds an open file. 

&#160; 

Legislation and Regulation Related to Bioterrorism Counteragents and Pandemic Preparedness 

Because some of our drug candidates are intended for the treatment of diseases that may result from acts of bioterrorism or biowarfare or for pandemic preparedness, they may be subject to the specific legislation and regulation described below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

&#160; 

Project BioShield 

Project BioShield and related 2006 federal legislation provide procedures for biodefense-related procurement and awarding of research grants, making it easier for HHS to commit funds to countermeasure projects. Project BioShield provides alternative procedures under the Federal Acquisition Regulation, the general rubric for acquisition of goods and services by the U.S. government, for procuring property or services used in performing, administering or supporting biomedical countermeasure research and development. In addition, if the Secretary of HHS deems that there is a pressing need, Project BioShield authorizes the Secretary of HHS to use an expedited award process, rather than the normal peer review process, for grants, contracts and cooperative agreements related to biomedical countermeasure research and development activity. 

Under Project BioShield, the Secretary of HHS, with the concurrence of the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security and upon the approval of the President, can contract to purchase unapproved countermeasures for the Strategic Stockpile in specified circumstances. Congress is notified of a recommendation for a Strategic Stockpile purchase after Presidential approval. Project BioShield specifies that a company supplying the countermeasure to the Strategic Stockpile is paid on delivery of a substantial portion of the countermeasure. To be eligible for purchase under these provisions, the Secretary of HHS must determine that there are sufficient and satisfactory clinical results or research data, including data, if available, from pre-clinical and clinical trials, to support a reasonable conclusion that the countermeasure will qualify for approval or licensing within eight years. Project BioShield also allows the Secretary of HHS to authorize the emergency use of medical products that have not yet been approved by FDA. To exercise this authority, the Secretary of HHS must conclude that: 

&#8226; 

the agent for which the countermeasure is designed can cause serious or life-threatening disease; &#160; 

&#8226; 

the product may reasonably be believed to be effective in detecting, diagnosing, treating or preventing the disease; &#160; 

&#8226; 

the known and potential benefits of the product outweigh its known and potential risks; and &#160; 

&#8226; 

there is no adequate alternative to a product that is approved and available. 

Although this provision permits the Secretary of HHS to circumvent FDA approval (entirely, or in part) for marketing, its use in this manner would likely be limited to rare circumstances. Prior to the award of the BARDA Contract in May 2011, the Secretary of HHS concluded that ST-246 would qualify within eight years for approval by the FDA for therapeutic use against smallpox. 

&#160; 

Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act 

The Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act, or PREP Act, provides immunity for manufacturers from claims under state or federal law for &#8220;loss&#8221; arising out of the administration or use of a &#8220;covered countermeasure.&#8221; However, injured persons may still bring a suit for &#8220;willful misconduct&#8221; against the manufacturer under some circumstances. &#8220;Covered countermeasures&#8221; include security countermeasures and &#8220;qualified pandemic or epidemic products&#8221;, including products intended to diagnose or treat pandemic or epidemic disease, as well as treatments intended to address conditions caused by such products. For these immunities to apply, the Secretary of HHS must issue a declaration in cases of public health emergency or &#8220;credible risk&#8221; of a future public health emergency. Since 2007, the Secretary of HHS has issued 8 declarations under the PREP Act to protect from liability countermeasures that are necessary to prepare the nation for potential pandemics or epidemics, including a declaration on October 10, 2008 that provides immunity from tort liability as it relates to smallpox. The PREP Act was Amended in 2015 to extend protection for smallpox and other countermeasures from December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2022. 

&#160; 

Foreign Regulation &#32; 

As noted above, in addition to regulations in the United States, we might be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our drug candidates. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we may have to obtain approval of a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The actual time required to obtain clearance to market a product in a particular foreign jurisdiction varies substantially, based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the pharmaceutical drug candidate, the specific requirements of that jurisdiction, and in some countries whether FDA has previously approved the drug for marketing. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, marketing authorization, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. Certain foreign jurisdictions, including the European Union, have adopted biodefense-specific regulation akin to that available in the United States such as a procedure similar to the &#8220;animal rule&#8221; promulgated by FDA. 

&#160; 

Regulations Regarding Government Contracting 

The status of an organization as a government contractor in the United States and elsewhere means that the organization is also subject to various statutes and regulations, including the Federal Acquisition Regulation, which governs the procurement of goods and services by agencies of the United States. These governing statutes and regulations can impose stricter penalties than those normally applicable to commercial contracts, such as criminal and civil damages liability and suspension and debarment from future government contracting. In addition, pursuant to various statutes and regulations, government contracts can be subject to unilateral termination or modification by the government for convenience in the United States and elsewhere, detailed auditing requirements, statutorily controlled pricing, sourcing and subcontracting restrictions and statutorily mandated processes for adjudicating contract disputes.
