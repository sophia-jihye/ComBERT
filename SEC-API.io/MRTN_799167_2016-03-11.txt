 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

&#160; 

Overview 

&#160; 

We are one of the leading temperature-sensitive truckload carriers in the United States. We specialize in transporting and distributing food and other consumer packaged goods that require a temperature-controlled or insulated environment. In 2015, we generated $665.0 million in operating revenue, which consists of revenue from our Truckload, Dedicated, Intermodal and Brokerage operations. Approximately 69% of our Truckload and Dedicated revenue resulted from hauling temperature-sensitive products and 31% from hauling dry freight. We operate throughout the United States and in parts of Canada and Mexico, with substantially all of our revenue generated from within the United States. We provide regional truckload carrier services in the Southeast, West Coast, Midwest, South Central and Northeast regions. Our primary medium-to-long-haul traffic lanes are between the Midwest and the West Coast, Southwest, Southeast, and the East Coast, as well as from California to the Pacific Northwest. In 2015, our average length of haul was 547 miles. 

&#160; 

Our growth strategy is to expand our business organically by offering shippers a high level of service and significant freight capacity. We market primarily to shippers that offer consistent volumes of freight in the lanes we prefer and are willing to compensate us for a high level of service. With our fleet of 2,740 company and independent contractor tractors, we are able to offer service levels that include up to 99% on-time performance and delivery within the narrow time windows often required when shipping perishable commodities. 

&#160; 

We have four reporting segments &#8211; Truckload, Dedicated, Intermodal and Brokerage. Financial information regarding these segments can be found in Footnote 17 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. 

&#160; 

The primary source of our operating revenue is provided by our Truckload segment through a combination of regional short-haul and medium-to-long-haul full-load transportation services. We transport food and other consumer packaged goods that require a temperature-controlled or insulated environment across the United States and into and out of Mexico and Canada. 

&#160; 

Our Dedicated segment provides customized transportation solutions tailored to meet individual customers&#8217; requirements, utilizing temperature-controlled trailers, dry vans and other specialized equipment within the United States. Our customer contracts range from three to five years and are subject to annual rate reviews. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Our Intermodal segment transports our customers&#8217; freight within the United States primarily utilizing our temperature-controlled trailers and also, previously, our dry containers on railroad flatcars for portions of trips, with the balance of the trips using our tractors or, to a lesser extent, contracted carriers. In March 2015, we disposed of the overhead-intensive dry containers that were used in a portion of our intermodal operations. 

&#160; 

Our Brokerage segment arranges for smaller third-party carriers to transport freight for our customers in temperature-controlled trailers and dry vans within the United States and into and out of Mexico while we retain the billing, collection and customer management responsibilities. Our Brokerage segment also included the revenue of MW Logistics, LLC, or MWL, a third-party provider of logistics services to the transportation industry, until we deconsolidated our 45% interest in MWL effective March 28, 2013. 

&#160; 

Organized under Wisconsin law in 1970, we are a successor to a sole proprietorship Roger R. Marten founded in 1946. In 1988, we reincorporated under Delaware law. Our executive offices are located at 129 Marten Street, Mondovi, Wisconsin 54755. Our telephone number is (715) 926-4216. 

&#160; 

We maintain a website at www.marten.com . We are not including the information contained on our website as a part of, nor incorporating it by reference into, this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We post on our website, free of charge, documents that we file with or furnish to the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and proxy statements, as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish such material to, the Securities and Exchange Commission. We also provide a link on our website to Forms 3, 4 and 5 that our officers, directors and 10% stockholders file with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 

&#160; 

Marketing and Operations 

&#160; 

We approach our business as an integrated effort of marketing and operations. Our emphasis in marketing is directed to the temperature-sensitive market, which is generally service-sensitive, as opposed to being solely price competitive. We target food and consumer packaged goods companies whose products require temperature-sensitive services and who ship multiple truckloads per week. By emphasizing high-quality service, we seek to become a core carrier for our customers. In 2015, our largest customer was Wal-Mart. 

&#160; 

Our marketing efforts are conducted by a staff of 210 sales, customer service and support personnel under the supervision of our senior management team. Marketing personnel travel within their regions to solicit new customers and maintain contact with existing customers. Customer service managers regularly contact customers to solicit additional business on a load-by-load basis. 

&#160; 

Our operations and sales personnel strive to improve our asset productivity by seeking freight that allows for rapid turnaround times, minimizes non-revenue miles between loads, and carries a favorable rate structure. Once we have established a customer relationship, customer service managers work closely with our fleet managers to match customer needs with our capacity and the location of revenue equipment. Fleet managers use our optimization system to assign loads to satisfy customer and operational requirements, as well as to meet the routing needs of our drivers. We attempt to route most of our trucks over selected operating lanes, which we believe assists us in meeting customer requirements, balancing traffic, reducing non-revenue miles, and improving the reliability of delivery schedules. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

We employ technology in our operations when we believe that it will allow us to operate more efficiently and the investment is cost-justified. Examples of the technologies we employ include: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Terrestrial- and satellite-based tracking and messaging that allows us to communicate with our drivers, obtain load position updates, provide our customers with freight visibility, and download operating information such as fuel mileage and idling time for the tractor engines and temperature setting and run time for the temperature-control units on our trailers. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Freight optimization software that assists us in selecting loads that match our overall criteria, including profitability, repositioning, identifying capacity for expedited loads, driver availability and home time, and other factors. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Electronic data interchange and internet communication with customers concerning freight tendering, invoices, shipment status, and other information. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Electronic logging devices in our tractors to monitor drivers&#8217; hours of service. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Auxiliary power units installed on our company-owned tractors that allow us to decrease fuel costs associated with idling our tractors. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Fuel-routing software that optimizes the fuel stops for each trip to take advantage of volume discounts available in our fuel network. 

&#160; 

We believe this integrated approach to our marketing and operations, coupled with our use of technology, has allowed us to provide our customers with a high level of service and support our revenue growth in an efficient manner. For example, we had a non-revenue mile percentage of 7.5% during 2015, which points to the efficiency of our operations and we believe compares favorably to other temperature-sensitive and dry van trucking companies. 

&#160; 

Major Customers 

&#160; 

A significant portion of our revenue is generated from our major customers. In 2015, our top 30 customers accounted for approximately 59% of our revenue, and our top ten customers accounted for 38% of our revenue. We have emphasized increasing our customer diversity which is shown by the decrease in the portion of our revenue with our top customers. In 2010, our top 30 customers accounted for approximately 78% of our revenue, and our top ten customers accounted for 52% of our revenue. Each of our top ten customers has been a significant customer of ours for the last ten years. We believe our relationships with these key customers are sound, but we are dependent upon them and the loss of some or all of their business could have a materially adverse effect on our results. 

&#160; 

Drivers and Other Personnel 

&#160; 

We believe that maintaining a safe and productive professional driver group is essential to providing excellent customer service and achieving profitability. As of December 31, 2015, 135 of our drivers have driven more than one million miles for us without a preventable accident, while 40 of our drivers have driven more than two million miles and 11 have driven more than three million miles for us without a preventable accident. 

&#160; 

We select drivers, including independent contractors, using our specific guidelines for safety records, including drivers&#8217; Compliance, Safety, Accountability, or CSA, scores, driving experience, and personal evaluations. We maintain stringent screening, training, and testing procedures for our drivers to reduce the potential for accidents and the corresponding costs of insurance and claims. We train new drivers at a number of our terminals in all phases of our policies and operations, as well as in safety techniques and fuel-efficient operation of the equipment. All new drivers also must pass DOT required tests prior to assignment to a vehicle. 

&#160; 

We primarily pay company-employed drivers a fixed rate per mile. The rate increases based on length of service. We also compensate drivers after one hour of detention, for inclement weather and for road service delays. Drivers also are eligible for bonuses based upon safe, efficient driving. We pay independent contractors a fixed rate per mile. Independent contractors pay for their own fuel, insurance, maintenance, and repairs. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Competition in the trucking industry for qualified drivers is normally intense and is expected to increase. Our operations have been impacted, and from time-to-time we have experienced under-utilization and increased expense, as a result of a shortage of qualified drivers. We place a high priority on the recruitment and retention of an adequate supply of qualified drivers. 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, we had 3,577 employees. This total consists of 2,716 drivers, 312 mechanics and maintenance personnel, and 549 support personnel, which includes management and administration. As of that date, we also contracted with 65 independent contractors. None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining unit. We consider relations with our employees to be good. 

&#160; 

Revenue Equipment 

&#160; 

Our revenue equipment programs are an important part of our overall goal of profitable growth. We evaluate our equipment decisions based on factors such as initial cost, useful life, warranty terms, expected maintenance costs, fuel economy, driver comfort, customer needs, manufacturer support, and resale value. We generally operate newer, well-maintained equipment with uniform specifications to minimize our spare parts inventory, streamline our maintenance program, and simplify driver training. 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, we operated a fleet of 2,740 tractors, including 2,675 company-owned tractors and 65 tractors supplied by independent contractors. The average age of our company-owned tractor fleet at December 31, 2015 was approximately 1.5 years. In 2015, we replaced our company-owned tractors within an average of 4.1 years after purchase. 

&#160; 

Peterbilt and Freightliner manufacture most of our company-owned tractors. Maintaining a relatively new and standardized fleet allows us to operate most miles while the tractors are under warranty to minimize repair and maintenance costs. It also enhances our ability to attract drivers, increases fuel economy, and improves customer acceptance by minimizing service interruptions caused by breakdowns. We adhere to a comprehensive maintenance program during the life of our equipment. We perform most routine servicing and repairs at our terminal facilities to reduce costly on-road repairs and out-of-route trips. We do not have any agreements with tractor manufacturers pursuant to which they agree to repurchase the tractors or guarantee a residual value, and we therefore could incur losses upon disposition if resale values of used tractors decline. 

&#160; 

The EPA adopted revised emissions control regulations, which required progressive reductions in exhaust emissions from diesel engines through 2010, for engines manufactured in October 2002 and thereafter. The revised regulations decrease the amount of emissions that can be released by tractor engines and affect tractors produced after the effective date of the regulations. The last of three stepped reductions in exhaust emissions was effective for engines manufactured in January 2010 and thereafter. As of December 31, 2015, 2,664 tractors, representing over 99% of the company-owned tractors in our fleet, have tractor engines which were manufactured in January 2010 or thereafter and, therefore, were required to meet the revised design requirements. Compliance with these regulations has increased the cost of new tractors as manufacturers have significantly increased new equipment prices, in part to meet the more stringent engine design requirements imposed by the EPA. 

&#160; 

We historically have contracted with independent contractors to provide and operate a portion of our tractor fleet. Independent contractors own their own tractors and are responsible for all associated expenses, including financing costs, fuel, maintenance, insurance, and taxes. The percentage of our fleet provided by independent contractors was 2.4% as of December 31, 2015 compared to 2.1% as of December 31, 2014 and 2.2% as of December 31, 2013. 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, we operated a fleet of 4,700 trailers, consisting of 3,977 refrigerated trailers and 723 dry trailers. Most of our trailers are equipped with Thermo-King refrigeration units, air ride suspensions, and anti-lock brakes. The average age of our trailer fleet at December 31, 2015 was approximately 2.6 years. In 2015, we replaced our company-owned trailers within an average of 5.1 years after purchase. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Insurance and Claims 

&#160; 

We self-insure for a portion of our claims exposure resulting from workers&#8217; compensation, auto liability, general liability, cargo and property damage claims, as well as employees&#8217; health insurance. We are responsible for our proportionate share of the legal expenses relating to such claims as well. We reserve currently for anticipated losses and expenses. We periodically evaluate and adjust our insurance and claims reserves to reflect our experience. We have $10.4 million in standby letters of credit to guarantee settlement of claims under agreements with our insurance carriers and regulatory authorities. We maintain insurance coverage for per-incident and total losses in excess of the amounts for which we self-insure up to specified policy limits with licensed insurance carriers. Insurance carriers have raised premiums for many businesses, including trucking companies. As a result, our insurance and claims expense could increase, or we could raise our self-insured retention when our policies are renewed. We believe that our policy of self-insuring up to set limits, together with our safety and loss prevention programs, are effective means of managing insurance costs. 

&#160; 

Fuel 

&#160; 

Our operations are heavily dependent upon the use of diesel fuel. The price and availability of diesel fuel can vary and are subject to political, economic, and market factors that are beyond our control. Fuel prices fluctuated dramatically and quickly at various times during the last three years. We actively manage our fuel costs by purchasing fuel in bulk in Mondovi, Wisconsin and at a number of our other maintenance facilities throughout the country and have volume purchasing arrangements with national fuel centers that allow our drivers to purchase fuel at a discount while in transit. During 2015, over 99% of our fuel purchases were made at these designated locations. To help further reduce fuel consumption, we have equipped our company-owned tractors with auxiliary power units since 2007. These units reduce fuel consumption by providing quiet climate control and electrical power for our drivers without idling the tractor engine. We have also invested in satellite tracking equipment for the temperature-control units on our trailers that has improved fuel usage through management of required temperature settings and run time of the units. 

&#160; 

We further manage our exposure to changes in fuel prices through fuel surcharge programs with our customers and other measures that we have implemented. We have historically been able to pass through a significant portion of long-term increases in fuel prices and related taxes to customers in the form of fuel surcharges. These fuel surcharges, which adjust with the cost of fuel, enable us to recover a substantial portion of the higher cost of fuel as prices increase, except for non-revenue miles, out-of-route miles or fuel used while the tractor is idling. As of December 31, 2015, we had no derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuel price fluctuations. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

We are one of the leading carriers operating in the temperature-sensitive segment of the truckload market. This market is highly competitive and fragmented. We compete with many other truckload carriers that provide temperature-sensitive service of varying sizes and, to a lesser extent, with less-than-truckload carriers, railroads, and other transportation companies, many of which have more equipment, a wider range of services, and greater capital resources than we do or have other competitive advantages. In particular, several of the largest truckload carriers that offer primarily dry-van service also offer temperature-sensitive service, and these carriers could attempt to increase their business in the temperature-sensitive market. We also compete with other motor carriers for the services of drivers, independent contractors, and management employees. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our business are service, freight rates, capacity, use of technology and financial stability. As one of the largest and best-capitalized carriers focused on the temperature-sensitive segment, we believe we are well positioned to compete in that segment. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Regulation 

&#160; 

The United States Department of Transportation, or DOT, and various state and local agencies exercise broad powers over our business, generally governing such activities as authorization to engage in motor carrier operations, safety and insurance requirements. Our company drivers and independent contractors also must comply with the safety and fitness regulations promulgated by the DOT, including those relating to drug and alcohol testing and hours-of-service. 

&#160; 

The DOT, through the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, or FMCSA, imposes safety and fitness regulations on us and our drivers. In December 2010, the FMCSA introduced the Compliance, Safety, Accountability, or CSA, system to measure and evaluate the on-road safety performance of commercial carriers and individual drivers. CSA&#8217;s Motor Carrier Safety Measurement System replaced the former SafeStat system and has removed a number of drivers from the industry as carriers are less willing to hire and retain drivers with marginal ratings, which has increased competition for qualified drivers. The FMCSA issued in January 2016 a proposed Safety Fitness Determination rule that would replace the current system utilizing CSA scores. The proposed methodology would integrate on-road safety data from inspections with the results of carrier investigations and accident reports. A final rule is expected in 2016 or 2017. 

&#160; 

The FMCSA issued a regulatory rule effective in July 2013 that revised the hours-of-service requirements for drivers, which designate the length of time that drivers are allowed to drive and work. The rule retained the 11-hour driving maximum under which the industry has been operating since 2004. However, changes to the &#8220;34-hour restart&#8221; provision and required breaks effectively reduced the maximum workweek for drivers. These changes reduced on-duty non-driving time and moderately decreased industry productivity. Omnibus bills adopted in December 2014 and December 2015 have suspended the additional restrictions effective in July 2013 to the &#8220;34-hour restart&#8221; provision. The restart rules are required by law to remain suspended until a comprehensive study on the impact of the rules is presented to Congress, who will determine any policy changes based on their review. This review is expected to take place in 2016. 

&#160; 

In January 2011, the FMCSA issued a regulatory proposal that would require commercial carriers to track compliance with hours-of-service regulations using electronic logging devices, or ELD&#8217;s, which was vacated and sent back to the FMCSA for further analysis and review in September 2011 by the 7 th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21 st Century Act, or MAP-21 Act, included a provision directing the FMCSA to develop a final ELD rule in 2013, which was delayed until its issuance in December 2015. The final rule requires compliance beginning in December 2017. Our entire tractor fleet has been equipped with ELD&#8217;s since early 2011. 

&#160; 

The EPA adopted revised emissions control regulations, which required progressive reductions in exhaust emissions from diesel engines through 2010, for engines manufactured in October 2002 and thereafter. The revised regulations decrease the amount of emissions that can be released by tractor engines and affect tractors produced after the effective date of the regulations. The last of three stepped reductions in exhaust emissions was effective for engines manufactured in January 2010 and thereafter. As of December 31, 2015, 2,664 tractors, representing over 99% of the company-owned tractors in our fleet, have tractor engines which were manufactured in January 2010 or thereafter and, therefore, were required to meet the revised design requirements. Compliance with these regulations has increased the cost of new tractors as manufacturers have significantly increased new equipment prices, in part to meet the more stringent engine design requirements imposed by the EPA. 

&#160; 

We are also subject to various environmental laws and regulations dealing with the handling of hazardous materials, fuel storage tanks, air emissions from our facilities, engine idling, and discharge and retention of storm water. These regulations did not have a significant impact on our operations or financial results in 2013 through 2015.
