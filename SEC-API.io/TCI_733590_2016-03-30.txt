 ITEM 1. &#160; BUSINESS &#160; 

General 

&#160; 

As used herein, the terms &#8220;TCI&#8221;, &#8220;the Company&#8221;, &#8220;We&#8221;, &#8220;Our&#8221;, or &#8220;Us&#8221; refer to Transcontinental Realty Investors, Inc. a Nevada corporation which was formed in 1984. The Company is headquartered in Dallas, Texas and its common stock is listed and trades on the New York Stock Exchange (&#8220;NYSE&#8221;) under the symbol (&#8220;TCI&#8221;). 

&#160; 

TCI is a &#8220;C&#8221; corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes and files an annual consolidated income tax return with American Realty Investors, Inc. (&#34;ARL&#34;), whose common stock is traded on the NYSE under the symbol (&#8220;ARL&#8221;). Subsidiaries of ARL own approximately 80.9% of the Company&#8217;s common stock. Accordingly, TCI&#8217;s financial results are consolidated with those of ARL&#8217;s on Form 10-K and related Consolidated Financial Statements. ARL&#8217;s common stock is listed and trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol (&#8220;ARL&#8221;). We have no employees. 

&#160; 

On July 17, 2009, the Company acquired an additional 2,518,934 shares of common stock of Income Opportunity Realty Investors, Inc. (&#8220;IOT&#8221;), and in doing so, increased its ownership from approximately 25% to over 80% of the shares of common stock of IOT outstanding. Upon acquisition of the additional shares in 2009, IOT&#8217;s results of operations began consolidating with those of the Company for tax and financial reporting purposes. As of December 31, 2015, TCI owned 81.1% of the outstanding IOT common shares. Shares of IOT common stock are listed and traded on the NYSE MKT under the symbol (&#8220;IOT&#8221;). 

&#160; 

At the time of the acquisition, the historical accounting value of IOT&#8217;s assets was $112 million and liabilities were $43 million. In that the shares of IOT acquired by TCI were from a related party, the values recorded by TCI are IOT&#8217;s historical accounting values at the date of transfer. The Company&#8217;s fair valuation of IOT&#8217;s assets and liabilities at the acquisition date approximated IOT&#8217;s book value. The net difference between the purchase price and historical accounting basis of the assets and liabilities acquired is $25.9 million and has been reflected by TCI as deferred income. The deferred income will be recognized upon the sale of the land that IOT held on its books as of the date of sale, to an independent third party. 

&#160; 

TCI&#8217;s Board of Directors is responsible for directing the overall affairs of TCI and for setting the strategic policies that guide the Company. As of April 30, 2011, the Board of Directors delegated the day-to-day management of the Company to Pillar Income Asset Management, Inc. (&#8220;Pillar&#8221;), a Nevada corporation, under a written Advisory Agreement that is reviewed annually by TCI&#8217;s Board of Directors. The directors of TCI are also directors of ARL and IOT. The Chairman of the Board of Directors of TCI also serves as the Chairman of the Board of Directors of ARL and IOT. The officers of TCI also serve as officers of ARL, IOT and Pillar. 

&#160; 

Since April 30, 2011, Pillar, the sole shareholder of which is Realty Advisors, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company, the sole member of which is Realty Advisors, Inc. (&#8220;RAI&#8221;), a Nevada corporation, the sole shareholder of which is May Realty Holdings, Inc. (&#8220;MRHI&#8221;, formerly known as Realty Advisors Management, Inc. &#8220;RAMI&#8221;, effective August 7, 2014), a Nevada corporation, the sole shareholder of which is a trust known as the May Trust, became the Company&#8217;s external Advisor and Cash Manager. Pillar&#8217;s duties include, but are not limited to, locating, evaluating and recommending real estate and real estate-related investment opportunities. Pillar also arranges, for the Company&#8217;s benefit, debt and equity financing with third party lenders and investors. Pillar also serves as an Advisor and Cash Manager to ARI and IOT. As the contractual advisor, Pillar is compensated by TCI under an Advisory Agreement that is more fully described in Part III, Item 10. &#8220;Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance &#8211; The Advisor&#8221;. TCI has no employees. Employees of Pillar render services to TCI in accordance with the terms of the Advisory Agreement.

&#160; 

&#160; 

On January 1, 2012, the Company entered into a development agreement with Unified Housing Foundation, Inc. (&#8220;UHF&#8221;) a non-profit corporation that provides management services for the development of residential apartment projects in the future. This development agreement was terminated December 31, 2013. The Company has also invested in surplus cash notes receivables from UHF and has sold several residential apartment properties to UHF in prior years. Due to this ongoing relationship and the significant investment in the performance of the collateral secured under the notes receivable, UHF has been determined to be a related party. 

&#160; 

Our primary business is the acquisition, development and ownership of income-producing residential and commercial real estate properties. In addition, we opportunistically acquire land for future development in in-fill or high-growth suburban markets. From time to time and when we believe it appropriate to do so, we will also sell land and income-producing properties. We generate revenues by leasing apartment units to residents, and leasing office, industrial and retail space to various for-profit businesses as well as certain local, state and federal agencies. We also generate revenues from gains on sales of income-producing properties and land. 

&#160; 

At December 31, 2015, our income-producing properties consisted of: 

&#160; 

&#183; Eight commercial properties consisting of five office buildings, two retail properties and one industrial warehouse comprising in aggregate approximately 1.9 million square feet; &#160; 

&#183; A golf course comprising approximately 96.09 acres; &#160;

&#183; 48 residential apartment communities comprising 7,983 units, excluding apartments being developed. &#160; 

The following table sets forth the location of our real estate held for investment (income-producing properties only) by asset type as of December 31, 2015: 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; We finance our acquisitions primarily through operating cash flow, proceeds from the sale of land and income-producing properties, and debt financing primarily in the form of property-specific, first-lien mortgage loans from commercial banks and institutional lenders. We finance our development projects principally with short-term, variable-rate construction loans that are refinanced with the proceeds of long-term, fixed-rate amortizing mortgages when the development has been completed and occupancy has been stabilized. When we sell properties, we may carry a portion of the sales price generally in the form of a short-term, interest bearing seller-financed note receivable, secured by the property being sold. We may also from time to time enter into partnerships or joint ventures with various investors to acquire land or income-producing properties or to sell interests in certain of our properties.

&#160; 

We join with various third-party development companies to construct residential apartment communities. We are in the predevelopment process on several residential apartment communities but have not yet begun construction. At December 31, 2015, we had three apartment projects in development. The third-party developer typically holds a general partner, as well as a limited partner interest in a limited partnership formed for the purpose of building a single property while we generally take a limited partner interest in the limited partnership. We may contribute land to the partnership as part of our equity contribution or we may contribute the necessary funds to the partnership to acquire the land. We are required to fund all required equity contributions while the third-party developer is responsible for obtaining construction financing, hiring a general contractor and for the overall management, successful completion, initial lease-up and delivery of the project. We generally bear all the economic risks and rewards of ownership in these partnerships and therefore include these partnerships in our consolidated financial statements. The third-party developer is paid a developer fee typically equal to a percentage of the construction costs. When the project reaches stabilized occupancy, we acquire the third-party developer&#8217;s partnership interests in exchange for any remaining unpaid developer fees. 

&#160;

&#160; 

At December 31, 2015, our apartment projects in development included (dollars in thousands):

&#160;

(1) Costs include construction hard costs, construction soft costs and loan borrowing costs.

&#160;

We have made investments in a number of large tracts of undeveloped and partially developed land and intend to a) continue to improve these tracts of land for our own development purposes or b) make the improvements necessary to ready the land for sale to other developers. 

&#160; 

At December 31, 2015, our investments in undeveloped and partially developed land consisted of the following (dollars in thousands): 

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Location &#160; Date(s) Acquired &#160; &#160; Acres &#160; &#160; Cost &#160; Primary Intended Use &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; McKinney, TX &#160; 1997-2008 &#160; &#160; &#160; 54 &#160; &#160; $ 9,264 &#160; Mixed use Dallas, TX &#160; 1996-2013 &#160; &#160; &#160; 192 &#160; &#160; &#160; 36,440 &#160; Mixed use Kaufman County, TX &#160; 2008 &#160; &#160; &#160; 25 &#160; &#160; &#160; 2,547 &#160; Multi-family Farmers Branch, TX &#160; 2008 &#160; &#160; &#160; 240 &#160; &#160; &#160; 29,796 &#160; Mixed use Kaufman County, TX &#160; 2011 &#160; &#160; &#160; 2,900 &#160; &#160; &#160; 46,062 &#160; Mixed use Various &#160; 1990-2008 &#160; &#160; &#160; 254 &#160; &#160; &#160; 12,780 &#160; Various Total Land Holdings &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 3,665 &#160; &#160; $ 136,889 &#160; &#160;

Significant Real Estate Acquisitions/Dispositions and Financings 

&#160; 

A summary of some of the significant transactions for the year ended December 31, 2015, are discussed below : 

&#160; 

Purchases 

&#160; 

For the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company acquired five income-producing apartment complexes from third parties in the states of Texas (3), Tennessee (1) and Alabama (1), increasing the total number of units by 990, for a combined purchase price of $82.9 million. In addition, the Company acquired seven income-producing apartment complexes from related parties in the states of Texas (2), Florida (2), Tennessee (1), Mississippi (1), and Kansas (1) increasing the total number of units by 1,155, for a combined purchase price of $30.4 million. The Company also purchased a commercial office building in Texas, comprised of 92,723 square feet, for $16.8 million. 

&#160; 

Sales 

&#160; 

For the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company sold approximately 579 acres of land located in Texas to independent third parties for a total sales price of $102.9 million. We recorded a total gain of $18.9 million from the sales. In November 2015, the Company sold approximately 88 acres of land located in the U.S. Virgin Islands to an unrelated party. The sale represents most of the development land owned by the Company in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Total cash consideration for the sale was $33.9 million. We recorded a gain of $12.0 million related to the transaction. 

&#160;

&#160; 5 &#160; 

&#160; 

In November 2015, the Company entered into a sales contract with an unrelated party. The contract was for most of the developable land owned by the Company in the Mercer Crossing Development located in Farmers Branch, Texas. In addition, IOT, ARL and RAI also sold land in this transaction. Total consideration for the sale was $75 million. The ultimate allocation of sales proceeds to the parties involved is yet to be determined and will be completed when the final use of the land, certain development commitments are completed and the note is collected. The agreement between TCI and the other parties related to this transaction provides for TCI to hold the subordinated note from the buyer in the amount of $50 million. At the closing, the note payable to related parties of $16.1 million was paid off. Due to an inadequate down payment from the buyer and the level of seller financing involved, the transaction is being accounted for under the deposit method. Under the deposit method, no revenue is recognized and the asset sold remains on the Company&#8217;s books until the criteria for full revenue recognition is met. 

&#160; 

In addition, one income-producing apartment complex consisting of 200 units located in Ohio was foreclosed upon. The Company recorded a gain of $0.7 million related to the extinguishment of debt. 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, the Company has 91 acres of land, at various locations that were sold to related parties in multiple transactions. These transactions are treated as &#8220;subject to sales contract&#8221; on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Due to the related party nature of the transactions TCI has deferred the recording of the sales in accordance with ASC 360-20. 

&#160; 

We continue to invest in the development of apartment projects. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, we have expended $16.7 million related to the construction or predevelopment of various apartment complexes and capitalized $0.2 million of interest costs. 

&#160; 

Business Plan and Investment Policy 

&#160; 

Our business objective is to maximize long-term value for our stockholders by investing in residential and commercial real estate through the acquisition, development and ownership of apartments, commercial properties and land. We intend to achieve this objective through acquiring and developing properties in multiple markets and operating as an industry-leading landlord. We believe this objective will provide the benefits of enhanced investment opportunities, economies of scale and risk diversification, both in terms of geographic market and real estate product type. We believe our objective will also result in continuing access to favorably priced debt and equity capital. In pursuing our business objective, we seek to achieve a combination of internal and external growth while maintaining a strong balance sheet and employing a strategy of financial flexibility. We maximize the value of our apartments and commercial properties by maintaining high occupancy levels while charging competitive rental rates, controlling costs and focusing on tenant retention. We also pursue attractive development opportunities either directly or in partnership with other investors. 

&#160; 

For our portfolio of commercial properties, we generate increased operating cash flow through annual contractual increases in rental rates under existing leases. We also seek to identify best practices within our industry and across our business units in order to enhance cost savings and gain operating efficiencies. We employ capital improvement and preventive maintenance programs specifically designed to reduce operating costs and increase the long-term value of our real estate investments. 

&#160; 

We seek to acquire properties consistent with our business objectives and strategies. We execute our acquisition strategy by purchasing properties which management believes will create stockholder value over the long-term. We will also sell properties when management believes value has been maximized or when a property is no longer considered an investment to be held long-term. 

&#160; 

We are continuously in various stages of discussions and negotiations with respect to development, acquisition, and disposition of projects. The consummation of any current or future development, acquisition, or disposition, if any, and the pace at which any may be completed cannot be assured or predicted. 

&#160; 

Substantially all of our properties are owned by subsidiary companies, many of which are single-asset entities. This ownership structure permits greater access to financing for individual properties and permits flexibility in negotiating a sale of either the asset or the equity interests in the entity owning the asset. From time-to-time, our subsidiaries have invested in joint ventures with other investors, creating the possibility of risks that do not exist with properties solely owned by a TCI subsidiary. In those instances where other investors are involved, those other investors may have business, economic, or other objectives that are inconsistent with our objectives, which may in turn, require us to make investment decisions different from those if we were the sole owner. 

&#160; 

Real estate generally cannot be sold quickly. We may not be able to promptly dispose of properties in response to economic or other conditions. To offset this challenge, selective dispositions have been a part of our strategy to maintain an efficient investment portfolio and to provide additional sources of capital. We finance acquisitions through mortgages, internally generated funds, and, to a lesser extent, property sales. Those sources provide the bulk of funds for future acquisitions. We may purchase properties by assuming existing loans secured by the acquired property. When properties are acquired in such a manner, we customarily seek to refinance the asset in order to properly leverage the asset in a manner consistent with our investment objectives. 

&#160;

&#160; 6 &#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Our businesses are not generally seasonal with regard to real estate investments. Our investment strategy seeks both current income and capital appreciation. Our plan of operation is to continue, to the extent our liquidity permits, to make equity investments in income-producing real estate such as apartments and commercial properties. We may also invest in the debt or equity securities of real estate-related entities. We intend to pursue higher risk, higher reward investments, such as improved and unimproved land where we can obtain reasonably-priced financing for substantially all of a property&#8217;s purchase price. We intend to continue the development of apartment properties in selected markets in Texas and in other locations where we believe adequate levels of demand exist. We intend to pursue sales opportunities for properties in stabilized real estate markets where we believe our properties&#8217; value has been maximized. We also intend to be an opportunistic seller of properties in markets where demand exceeds current supply. Although we no longer actively seek to fund or purchase mortgage loans, we may, in selected instances, originate mortgage loans or we may provide purchase money financing in conjunction with a property sale. 

&#160; 

Our Board of Directors has broad authority under our governing documents to make all types of investments, and we may devote available resources to particular investments or types of investments without restriction on the amount or percentage of assets that may be allocated to a single investment or to any particular type of investment, and without limit on the percentage of securities of any one issuer that may be acquired. Investment objectives and policies may be changed at any time by the Board without stockholder approval. 

&#160; 

The specific composition from time-to-time of our real estate portfolio owned by TCI directly and through our subsidiaries depends largely on the judgment of management to changing investment opportunities and the level of risk associated with specific investments or types of investments. We intend to maintain a real estate portfolio that is diversified by both location and type of property. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

The real estate business is highly competitive and TCI competes with numerous companies engaged in real estate activities (including certain entities described in Part III, Item 13. &#8220;Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence&#8221;), some of which have greater financial resources than TCI. We believe that success against such competition is dependent upon the geographic location of a property, the performance of property-level managers in areas such as leasing and marketing, collection of rents and control of operating expenses, the amount of new construction in the area and the maintenance and appearance of the property. Additional competitive factors include ease of access to a property, the adequacy of related facilities such as parking and other amenities, and sensitivity to market conditions in determining rent levels. With respect to apartments, competition is also based upon the design and mix of the units and the ability to provide a community atmosphere for the residents. We believe that beyond general economic circumstances and trends, the degree to which properties are renovated or new properties are developed in the competing submarket are also competitive factors. See also Part I, Item1A. &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221;. 

&#160; 

To the extent that TCI seeks to sell any of its properties, the sales prices for the properties may be affected by competition from other real estate owners and financial institutions also attempting to sell properties in areas where TCI&#8217;s properties are located, as well as aggressive buyers attempting to dominate or penetrate a particular market. 

&#160; 

As described above and in Part III, Item 13. &#8220;Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence&#8221;, the officers and directors of TCI serve as officers and directors of ARL and IOT. Both ARL and IOT have business objectives similar to those of TCI. TCI&#8217;s officers and directors owe fiduciary duties to both IOT and ARL as well as to TCI under applicable law. In determining whether a particular investment opportunity will be allocated to TCI, IOT, or ARL, management considers the respective investment objectives of each Company and the appropriateness of a particular investment in light of each Company&#8217;s existing real estate and mortgage notes receivable portfolio. To the extent that any particular investment opportunity is appropriate to more than one of the entities, the investment opportunity may be allocated to the entity which has had funds available for investment for the longest period of time, or, if appropriate, the investment may be shared among all three or two of the entities. 

&#160; 

In addition, as described in Part III, Item 13. &#8220;Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence&#8221;, TCI competes with related parties of Pillar having similar investment objectives related to the acquisition, development, disposition, leasing and financing of real estate and real estate-related investments. In resolving any potential conflicts of interest which may arise, Pillar has informed TCI that it intends to exercise its best judgment as to what is fair and reasonable under the circumstances in accordance with applicable law. 

&#160; 

We have historically engaged in and will continue to engage in certain business transactions with related parties, including but not limited to asset acquisitions and dispositions. Transactions involving related parties cannot be presumed to be carried out on an arm&#8217;s length basis due to the absence of free market forces that naturally exist in business dealings between two or more unrelated entities. Related party transactions may not always be favorable to our business and may include terms, conditions and agreements that are not necessarily beneficial to or in the best interests of the Company. 

&#160;
