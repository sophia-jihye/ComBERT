 Item 1. 

Business. 

&#160; 

We were formed as a Delaware corporation on January 31, 2002. On March 14, 2013, we changed our corporate name from Lapis Technologies, Inc. to Micronet Enertec Technologies, Inc. The Company&#8217;s shares have been traded on the NASDAQ Capital Market, or NASDAQ, since April 29, 2013. 

&#160; 

We operate primarily through two Israel-based companies, Enertec Systems 2001 Ltd, or Enertec, our wholly-owned subsidiary, and Micronet Ltd, or Micronet, in which we have a controlling interest, which develop, manufacture, integrate and globally market rugged computers, tablets and computer-based systems and instruments for the commercial, defense and aerospace markets. Our products, solutions and services are designed to perform in severe environments and battlefield conditions. 

Micronet is publicly-traded on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, or TASE, and operates in the growing commercial mobile resource management, or MRM, market and is a global developer, manufacturer and provider of mobile computing platforms, designed for integration into fleet management and mobile workforce management solutions. As further described in this Annual Report, in June 2014, Micronet expanded its MRM business and operations in the U.S. market through the acquisition of Beijer Electronics Inc., or Beijer, a U.S.-based vehicle business and operations located in Utah, and as a result added to its business U.S.-based facilities which include manufacturing and technical support infrastructure, sales and marketing capabilities as well as expanded its U.S. customer base and presence with local fleets and local MRM service providers. Micronet currently operates via its Israeli and U.S. facilities, the first located in Azur, Israel, near Tel Aviv, and the second located in Salt Lake City, Utah. 

Micronet designs, develops, manufactures and sells rugged mobile computing devices that provide fleet operators and field workforces with mobile computing solutions in challenging work environments. Micronet&#8217;s vehicle cabin installed and portable tablets are designed to increase workforce productivity, enhance corporate efficiency and customer service by offering computing power and communication capabilities. Micronet products provide fleet operators with visibility into vehicle location, fuel usage, speed and mileage and allow for the installation of software applications and communication integration. This enables the users to manage the drivers in various aspects such as: driver identification, reporting hours worked, customer/organization working procedures and protocols, route management and navigation based on tasks and time schedule. End users may also receive real time messages for various services such as pickup and delivery, repair and maintenance, status reports, alerts, notices relating to start and ending of work, digital forms, issuing and printing of invoices and payments. 

&#160; 

Micronet&#8217;s customers consist primarily of Application Service Providers, or ASPs, and solution providers specializing in the MRM market. These companies sell Micronet&#8217;s products as part of their MRM systems and solutions. Currently, Micronet does not sell directly to end users. Micronet customers are generally MRM solution and service providers, ASP providers in the transportation market, including long haul, local fleets&#8217; student transportation (yellow busses) and fleet and field management systems for constructions and heavy equipment. Micronet products are used by customers in over 20 countries. The United States currently constitutes its largest market, representing approximately 83% and 85% of revenue for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2015, Micronet&#8217;s three largest customers represented approximately 18%, 16% and 11% of Micronet&#8217;s revenues, respectively, and 11%, 10% and 6% of the Company&#8217;s total revenues, respectively. During 2015, no other customer accounted for more than 10% of Micronet&#8217;s revenue. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

In May 2014, Micronet entered into an asset purchase agreement with Beijer, pursuant to which, on June 2, 2014, Micronet acquired certain assets and liabilities of the Beijer&#8217;s U.S. vehicle business and operations related to the supply of panels to various transportation segments, or the Vehicle Operations, including all related intellectual property, product rights, production files, customer base, sales and marketing network, sales leads and initiatives, technical support operation and all related agreements and certain inventory. As part of the transaction, the Mobile Resource Management/Fleet Management, or MRM/FM, division employees joined Micronet to ensure a successful continuous operation and growth of the Company. In consideration for the purchased assets, Micronet paid approximately $7.1 million to Beijer. Upon the closing of the transaction, Micronet incorporated a wholly-owned U.S.-based subsidiary in the state of Utah under the name Micronet Inc., through which the purchased business is conducted. The purchased Vehicle Operations and the purchased MRM/FM division expand and complement the Micronet product line in the field of commercial mobile resource management and offer additional products. The combined business currently offers the MRM market and mainly the North America market comprehensive product lines targeting different market segments including the largest and fastest growing local fleets, as well as long haul, heavy equipment and workforce field verticals. Micronet has consolidated its marketing and sales efforts taking advantage of the superior product offerings and the market demand. The acquisition strengthens Micronet&#8217;s focus on the U.S. market, broadens its customer base and expands its operations into new verticals. The acquisition also has diversified the Company&#8217;s customer base and improved the infrastructure necessary to support our future growth. 

On February 18, 2016, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement, or the Asset Purchase Agreement, with Novatel Wireless, Inc., or the Seller, pursuant to which the Company agreed to acquire certain assets and liabilities of the Seller used in the operation of its telematics hardware business, or the Telematics Business Acquisition. Pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement, the Company would pay to the Seller total cash consideration of approximately $12 million, or the Cash Consideration, and deliver to the Seller a promissory note in the principal amount of $12 million, or the Note, and together with the Cash Consideration, the Purchase Price. The Company would be obligated to repay the principal amount of the Note in two installments of $6 million each, payable on the first and second anniversaries of the closing date. The Company expected to finance the Telematics Business Acquisition primarily with new debt and or equity. The Purchase Price and Note were subject to adjustment under certain circumstances. The Asset Purchase Agreement provided that the Telematics Business Acquisition would close on or before March 31, 2016, subject to certain extensions and termination provisions. On April 11, 2016, the Seller notified the Company that it was terminating the Asset Purchase Agreement due to failure to meet such closing deadline and certain conditions required to extend it, and demanded a termination fee equal to $250,000 pursuant to the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement. 

Enertec operates in the defense and aerospace markets and designs, develops, manufactures and supplies various customized military computer-based systems, simulators, automatic test equipment and,electronic instruments. Enertec&#8217;s solutions and systems are designed according to major aerospace integrators&#8217; requirements and market technological needs and are integrated by them into critical systems such as command and control, missile fire control, maintenance of military aircraft and missiles for use by the Israeli Air Force, Israeli Navy and by foreign defense entities. 

Approximately 79% and 82% of Enertec&#8217;s revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 respectively, were from independent business units or groups within Israeli Aerospace Industries Ltd., or IAI, the leading Israeli defense system integrator, and approximately 5% and 7%, respectively, were from business units of Rafael Advanced Defense Systems Ltd., or Rafael, another Israeli government-owned major defense developer and integrator of critical weapon systems. We believe that these leading Israeli systems integrators (which consist of various and distinct business units or groups, each of which is a different potential customer) diversify our business, markets and revenue streams. The system integrators that are our primary customers market their solutions throughout the world and across the full spectrum of military applications (land, sea and air). Command and control systems represented approximately 49% and 45% of Enertec&#8217;s revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and our automated test equipment represented approximately 51% and 55% of Enertec&#8217;s revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Management believes that the demand for our products, systems and solutions is not affected significantly by fluctuations in any particular geographic market outside the State of Israel because our products, systems and solutions can be tailored to fit the needs of these different disciplines and are not limited to any specific geographic region. 

Our overall strategy focuses on continued internal growth through diligent efforts in our traditional growing markets with new technologies and innovative systems and products, as well as the development of new potential segments and markets. To enhance our growth, we also look for appropriate acquisitions to complement and expand our offerings, as well as support our goals and increase our competitive strengths. Currently, we concentrate the majority of our resources, including our marketing and sales efforts, in the United States and, Israeli and European markets. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Subsidiaries 

&#160; 

We have two primary operating subsidiaries. We are the sole owner of Enertec Systems 2001 Ltd, an Israeli corporation, or Enertec. We also have a controlling interest in Micronet. Both Enertec and Micronet are held via our wholly-owned holding company Enertec Electronics Ltd, or Enertec Electronics, which operate the following businesses: 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#183; 

Enertec, which operates in the defense and aerospace markets and designs, develops, manufactures and supplies various customized military computer-based systems, simulators, automatic test equipment and electronic instruments. In March 2011, Enertec became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Enertec Management Ltd., a private Israeli company, wholly owned by Enertec Electronics. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Micronet, an Israel-based manufacturer and developer of rugged computers, tablets and computer based systems in which we hold a controlling interest. We currently own 62.86% of Micronet&#8217;s outstanding common shares and 62.73% on a fully diluted basis . As described above, in June 2014, Micronet completed the acquisition of Beijer&#8217;s MRM U.S.-based operations and business into its newly-formed wholly owned U.S. subsidiary operating under the name Micronet Inc. Micronet maintains marketing, assembly and sales operations in the United States. 

Enertec 

&#160; 

Enertec operates in the defense and aerospace markets. It designs, develops and manufactures computer based instruments and aerospace electronic solutions designed to operate in severe environments and battlefield conditions, primarily for military use in air, space land and sea. Enertec&#8217;s products are grouped into three material product lines: computer-based command and control systems, automatic test equipment, and power supplies. The command and control systems are integrated in mission critical air defense missiles and other weapon systems and are designed to operate in severe environments. The automatic test equipment line includes a variety of test systems and simulators that test and assure combat readiness of various aircraft and missiles. The power supplies are uniquely designed to support our systems and are also supporting our customers as stand-alone solutions. Enertec&#8217;s solutions and systems are tailored to customers&#8217; specifications and are, or are integrated into, critical weapon systems. Among our main solutions are: 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

ruggedized portable command and control systems; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

command and control stations; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

fire control systems for missiles; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

military aircraft support systems; and 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

missile simulators and missiles defense related embedded / integrated systems. 

Enertec holds high security clearance in Israel for the most sensitive defense programs. Our solutions and systems are marketed mainly by the leading Israeli defense industries (system integrators) and are used by the Israeli defense forces specifically by the Israeli Air Force and Israeli Navy as well as by other foreign defense entities served by our customers. Enertec is registered as a Single Site quality management system in conformance with ISO 9001: 2008 and AS9100-C, the international standards for quality assurance and quality design. These standards are important to customers that order custom-made products and are made up of a combination of quality system requirements. 

&#160; 

Enertec generates revenue mostly through funded development, which involves the development of a small number of products, systems or solutions for evaluation. Thereafter, we anticipate moving to the production phase and generating revenue through direct sales from the mass production of its developed product. Enertec generates additional revenue from the customization and upgrades to its products. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

New products 

&#160; 

In addition to our traditional systems and products, we have been developing new systems, solutions and products in the following areas: (1) operationally resilient computers integrated into various weapon systems, (2) missile launch platforms, (3) command and control systems, (4) missiles communications systems, (5) generic testers for military equipment, and (6) power distributer units for robotic application (air, sea and land). These systems and products utilize advanced know-how developed by Enertec&#8217;s trained and highly-skilled technical personnel. During 2015, we focused our development resources and solution capabilities in the missile defense area and accordingly, received a significant order in this area of business. Management believes that Enertec&#8217;s know-how, capabilities and expertise will enable us to further increase our product offerings to existing and other customers&#8217; strategic projects in space land, air and sea. 

Market conditions 

&#160; 

The defense market, in which we operate through Enertec, includes the design and manufacturing of electronic systems developed to enhance large-scale military land, airborne and seaborne tactical platforms. These systems include operational resilient military computer based systems, simulators, automatic test equipment and electronic instruments that are used or integrated in critical weapon systems such as command and control systems, missile fire control systems, support military aircraft systems and other defense systems and equipment such as night visions systems, unmanned aerial vehicle, or UAV, systems, laser products, airborne photography measures, processing and display of data systems and communications systems. In the Israeli defense market, Israeli providers supply a significant portion of their products to the Israeli defense forces specifically in view of the continuing defense needs of the State of Israel. However, the Israeli defense industry is also a well-respected exporter of its products to armies and defense forces worldwide and such international markets provide for stable demand for military and defense products. 

We expect a continuing demand in the missile defense niche based on the increasing and growing use by defense forces around the world in various missiles and other electronic systems in different sectors such as self-defense missile systems, guided unmanned weapon systems, attack (air, sea and land) missiles and other missile systems. In view of the continuing defense trends to rely on missiles and missile defense systems as a significant factor in the defense strategy of armed forces worldwide, the global missile and missile defense system market is expected to continue to grow, according to the Global Missiles and Missile Defense Systems Market 2014-2024 report, published by Strategic Defense Intelligence on October 28, 2014. Cumulatively, the markets for missiles and missile defense systems are likely to account for the highest proportion of spending in the global missile and missile defense systems market. 

We believe that we are currently well positioned with our proprietary know-how, capabilities and expertise in missile systems technologies to meet the expected demand, and expect this segment of the market to continue to be a major contributor to our business growth in the coming years. 

&#160; 

Marketing strategies 

&#160; 

Our sales and marketing efforts are focused on developing new business opportunities as well as generating follow-on sales from our existing customers. Our sales efforts in view of our products, solutions and services are generated primarily through our internal sales team, although we also retain third-party global selling agents from time to time. Various members of our senior management also serve as effective sales representatives who contribute to the generation of military and corporate business due to their long-standing customer relationships with leading industry integrators and knowledge of our customers&#8217; mission-critical technologies, requirements and needed solutions. We continue to explore various Israeli and international business partnerships to increase our sales and market penetration. We actively participate in trade shows involving technology and electronics defense operations. Additionally, our business development efforts include our website, preparation and distribution of marketing materials, advertising directed toward the defense and homeland security market and product demonstrations. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Our strategy is to anticipate the needs of our clients, the relevant demand and needs in our market niches, to make investments in research and development (including developing know-how, capable manpower) and initiate the development of those products and solutions that we believe will meet the market and customers&#8217; needs best. By doing so, we shorten our time to market, improve our market position from a technology perspective, and gain an edge on our competition. Furthermore, we have been able to identify those current and potential clients that we believe are likely to place large orders, and we focus our attention on developing our relationship with them. When successful, we are in an excellent position to offer both basic and advanced, sophisticated products enabling us to expand our relationship with these clients and resulting in additional revenue streams. In these cases, deepening our relationship with our clients creates the opportunity to incorporate our solutions into our customers&#8217; core components and critical systems. 

By continuously diversifying into new and more complex products and fully scaled systems, we have been able to set Enertec apart from its competition. We also continue to increase our suite of custom products based on our proprietary designs and technologies. These products are core components of several long-term military programs spearheaded by our customers, which historically have expected purchase lifecycles over periods of up to 10 years. In addition, we have been recognized as a certified supplier for the U.S. Department of Defense and for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization alliance countries. We are currently in the midst of our marketing and sales efforts to promote our product offerings with major U.S. defense organizations. 

Since we expect a continuing demand for our products and solutions in the missile defense niche based on the increasing threats and demand for proper solutions in this market segment as described above, we are continuing to concentrate research, development and marketing efforts in this market segment. We believe we are well positioned to transform such knowledge into revenues. We expect this segment to continue to be an important, stable and material contributing activity in our overall business in the coming years. 

&#160;

Customers 

&#160; 

Enertec&#8217;s customers are primarily leading Israeli defense system integrators. The system integrators&#8217; customers are the Israeli Ministry of Defense and other ministries of defense worldwide. The balance of our sales is made directly to the Israeli defense and armed forces (mainly the IDF) that place direct orders. 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, approximately 84% of our annual revenues were from independent business units or groups within Rafael and the IAI, the two leading Israeli defense system integrators, as compared to 89% at December 31, 2014. These leading Israeli system integrators (which consist of various and distinct business units or groups, each of which is a different potential customer) create diversity to our business, markets and revenue streams. 

&#160; 

The system integrators that are our primary customers market their solutions throughout the world and across the full spectrum of military applications (land, sea and air). Management believes that the demand for our products, systems and solutions is not affected significantly by fluctuations in any particular geographic market outside the State of Israel because our products, systems and solutions can be tailored to fit the needs of these different disciplines and are not limited to any specific geographic region. 

&#160; 

Backlog 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, Enertec had a backlog of orders for our systems, products and services in the amount of approximately $7.3 million (including $1.6 million in framework orders, which are orders that can be exercised from time to time but are an obligation of ours for the entire amount). As of December 31, 2014, Enertec had a backlog of orders for our systems, products and services in the amount of approximately $8.1 million (including $1.8 million in framework orders). 

Competition 

&#160; 

The defense market in which we operate through Enertec is fractured, intensely competitive and our main competition comes from customers' internal development and manufacturing divisions and a number of relatively small private Israeli companies that specialize in electronic systems. This intensely competitive market is characterized by rapidly changing technologies, evolving industry standards, frequent new product introductions and changes in customer requirements. In order to maintain our competitive strength, we must continue to develop and introduce on a timely and cost-effective basis, new products and product features which are in line with the technological developments and emerging industry standards. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Suppliers 

&#160; 

Our suppliers are diversified, and we are not dependent upon a limited number of suppliers for essential raw materials, components, services or other items. In order for us to maintain the standards required by our customers, we require that our suppliers be well-established, with facilities and manufacturing capabilities that comply with our relevant standards. Although we are not dependent on any one supplier, disruptions in normal business arrangements due to the loss of one or a few suppliers could adversely affect us. Disruptions also may be experienced if our existing suppliers are no longer able to meet our requirements or if there is an industry shortage of electronic or mechanical components. Not only could these disruptions limit our production capacity, but also, if there is a shortage of components, such disruption could result in higher costs. The raw materials we use are either electronic components purchased from suppliers, or mechanical components primarily manufactured by local subcontractors. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately 85 full-time employees at Enertec and 4 full-time employees at Enertec Electronics. Of these employees, 67 are employed in engineering and manufacturing positions, and the remainder are employed in sales, management and administrative positions. Our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining agreement, and we have never experienced a work stoppage. We believe we have good relations with our employees. 

&#160; 

Israeli labor laws and regulations apply to all employees based in Israel. The laws principally cover matters such as paid vacation, paid sick days, length of the workday, payment for overtime and severance payments upon the retirement or death of an employee or termination of employment under specified circumstances. The severance payments may be funded, in whole or in part, through a managers&#8217; insurance fund or a pension fund. The payments to the managers&#8217; insurance fund or pension fund toward severance amount to 8.3% of wages. Furthermore, Israeli employees and employers are required to pay predetermined sums to the National Insurance Institute of Israel. Since January 1, 1995, these amounts also include payments for health insurance. The payments to the National Insurance Institute amount to approximately 13.7% of wages, of which the employee contributes 60% and the employer contributes 40%. 

Research and development expenditures 

&#160; 

Research and development costs totaled approximately $559,000 and $528,000 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, which equates to approximately 6% and 5% of Enertec&#8217;s revenues during these years, respectively. These expenditures have adequately satisfied our research and development requirements. We are using our engineering resources to research and design new technologies, products and solutions that we expect to implement into the new projects and large military programs of our core customers. 

&#160; 

Seasonal aspects of our business 

&#160; 

The sales of military products and solutions experience seasonal variations because the Israeli Ministry of Defense frequently delays project approvals until near the end of the fiscal year. Therefore, new orders to the military suppliers, including Enertec, are delayed until the second half of the year. In addition, some of our customers require increased deliveries during the last weeks of the year in order to fulfill contractual delivery obligations to their own customers. As a result, we often experience an increase in our fourth quarter sales relative to sales in other quarters. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Intellectual property 

&#160; 

Although we are not dependent on patents or trademark protection with regard to Enertec&#8217;s business and do not expect to be at any time in the future, proprietary rights and unique know-how are important to Enertec&#8217;s business because its ability to remain competitive in the market is dependent to a significant degree on its proprietary solutions and the technologies on which they are based. Enertec develops systems, products and solutions for its clients on a &#8220;work for hire&#8221; basis. Although, Enertec does not claim any rights in the products or services that it provides, its proprietary modules and subsystems play an integral and significant part in the development of the solutions, systems, products and services that it ultimately delivers. To protect its proprietary rights in these modules and subsystems, Enertec primarily relies on a combination of copyright and trade secret laws, internal knowledge and know-how, technological innovations and agreements with third parties, such as license agreements. In addition, Enertec employs internal controls such as the use of confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements. Enertec believes its proprietary technology incorporates processes, know-how, methods, algorithms, hardware and software that are the result of more than ten years of experience resulting in in-house expertise and thus are not easily copied. Further, most of the production process is performed in-house with the exception of certain components that are manufactured by subcontractors. This limited outsourcing process allows Enertec to maintain the majority of its proprietary information and know-how within the Company and lowers its exposure to the risk of its technology solutions being copied or used by any third parties. 

&#160; 

Enertec&#8217;s management, together with its research and development team, closely and continuously monitors the technological developments in the market. Enertec considers and evaluates on an ad hoc basis whether technology and proprietary assets should be acquired through independent in-house development or through the purchase of patent or other technology licenses. 

Regulation 

&#160; 

Enertec&#8217;s electronic products must comply with the Underwriters Laboratories, or UL standards of the United States and the Conformit&#233; Europ&#233;enne, or CE, standards of Europe to be eligible for sale in the respective countries subject to these standards. Each system must be tested, qualified and labeled under the relevant standards. This is a complicated and expensive process and once completed, the approved product may not be altered for sale.

Market opportunity 

&#160; 

We believe that Micronet is well positioned to pursue a substantial market opportunity. The MRM market, in which we operate through Micronet, is growing and is expected to continue its growth in the coming years. Our management analysis, supported by market research, estimated that on a global basis, subscribers to MRM services will grow to approximately 32 million by the end of 2016. Further, as indicated in market research reports, in the United States, which historically has been Micronet&#8217;s largest market, there are currently approximately 8.2 million units in service with MRM systems, and this number is projected to grow to approximately 10 million by the end of 2016. In 2015, the global penetration rate of MRM systems was approximately 12% and the global penetration rate is forecasted to grow to approximately 14% by the end of 2016. In the United States, market penetration is projected to grow from 25% in 2015 to almost 30% by the end of 2016. 

This market opportunity is driven, among other things, by new and further comprehensive legislation and regulatory requirements imposed on fleet management operators by the Federal Motor Safety Administration, or FMCSA, which include the need to comply with regulatory Hours of Service, or HOS, driver activity reporting requirements. 

On December 10, 2015, the FMCSA announced the adoption of the final rules and implementation schedule of its Electronic Logging Device mandate, or ELD mandate. The ELD mandate enables professional truck drivers and commercial motor carriers to track HOS compliance easily and efficiently. By 2019, truck drivers and carriers subject to the ELD Mandate rules are required to use certified, registered ELDs that comply with the requirements of the ELD regulations.

Sales and Marketing 

&#160; 

Micronet&#8217;s customers consist primarily of ASP's, and solution providers specializing in the fleet and MRM markets. Currently, Micronet does not sell to end users. Its customers are generally leading service providers of commercial solutions that integrate a wide range of positioning technologies and computing fleet communications in the MRM market. 

Micronet products are used by customers in over 20 countries. The United States currently constitutes Micronet&#8217;s largest market, representing approximately 83% of Micronet&#8217;s revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 85% for the year ended December 31, 2014. In any given year, a single customer may account for a significant portion of Micronet&#8217;s revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2015, our 5 largest customers represented approximately individually 18%, 16%, 11%, 7% and 6% of Micronet&#8217;s revenues, respectively. In the year ended December 31, 2015, no other customer accounted for more than 10% of Micronet&#8217;s revenues. Our sales team consisted of 3 dedicated sales managers as of December 31, 2015. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Research and Development 

&#160; 

Micronet believes that one of its core competitive strengths is the breadth of its expertise in mobile data technologies, particularly in MRM technologies for the management of vehicle fleets and mobile workforces. Micronet has developed this expertise over a period of 30 years. It has an experienced engineering and product development team. In order to keep up with the rapid technology evolution and the changing needs of the markets in which it operates, Micronet continues to focus on its innovation and the development of new products and technologies, by continuing to make the necessary investments in research and development. 

&#160; 

Micronet upgrades and enhances its existing products on an on-going basis, including based on input from its clients and partners and from other sources. Enhancements include the addition of capabilities, improvement of product functionality and performance, and adding features to the existing hardware in order to offer customers a variety of solutions. 

&#160;

In addition, Micronet seeks to design and manage product life cycles through a controlled and structured process. It involves customers and industry experts from its target markets in the definition and refinement of its product development. Product development emphasis is placed on meeting industry standards, ease of integration, cost reduction, design-for manufacturability, versatility and innovation, and quality and reliability. 

&#160; 

During the fiscal years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, Micronet spent NIS 7.7 million (approximately $1.9 million) and NIS 8.2 million (approximately $2.3 million), respectively, on research and development activities. Micronet uses its own resources to finances its research and development activities and none of the cost of such activities is borne by its customers. 

In April 2013, Micronet submitted to the Israeli Office of the Chief Scientist of the Ministry of Economy, or OCS, a request for financial support within a framework of a research and development program for a new product. In September 2013, a grant to Micronet in a total amount of NIS 5.5 million (approximately $1.5 million) was approved by the OCS. This grant was provided by the OCS for a period of one year (starting April 2013) at a level of 30% from the aforementioned amount. In addition, during 2014 Micronet received further confirmation for a grant from the OCS in the total amount of NIS 5.5 million (approximately $1.5 million). This grant was provided by the OCS for a period of one year (starting April 2014) at a level of 40% from the aforementioned amount. During 2015, Micronet received further confirmation for a grant from the OCS in the total amount of NIS 5.1 million (approximately $1.3 million) at a level of 40% from the aforementioned amount. We are obligated to pay royalties to the OCS amounting to 3%-3.5% of the sales of the products and other related revenues generated from such projects linked to the dollar plus Libor interest rate. To date, Micronet has received an aggregate of NIS 4.5 million (approximately $1.2 million) from the OCS under these three grants. 

&#160;

Competition 

&#160; 

Micronet operates in a highly competitive industry. Further, during the last few years, competition in the field of mobile computers has significantly increased with the mass entrance and introduction to the market of smart phones, tablets, and laptops, as well as various GPS-based hand-held devices featuring additional functionalities. 

&#160; 

Micronet&#8217;s current business is focused on customers that are implementing &#8220;tailor made&#8221; solutions characterized by highly professional, mission critical and complex technological solutions. These solutions are based on Micronet&#8217;s products and must sustain and maintain performance under extreme and challenging field conditions for extended periods of time. 

&#160; 

Micronet operates in a competitive market. Its competitors are private companies or companies that do not disclose their sales or other financial information, making it difficult to estimate Micronet&#8217;s market share and position in the market. Micronet believes that its most significant competitors include: CalAmp Corp., Morey Corporation (U.S.A.), Mobile Devices Corporation, MOTIA Co. Ltd, Advantech Co., Ltd. and Garmin USA, Inc. In addition, some service providers consider the use of their in house development capabilities for the supply of their internal needs for mobile devices. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

This intensely competitive industry is characterized by rapidly changing technologies, evolving industry standards, frequent new product introductions and changes in customer requirements. In order to maintain its competitive strength, Micronet must continue to develop and introduce on a timely and cost-effective basis, new products and product features which are in line with the technological developments and emerging industry standards and address the increasingly sophisticated needs of its customers. 

&#160; 

Micronet&#8217;s management believes its strongest competitive advantages are the durability of its products and reputation in the industry. Its competitive strengths include the following: 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

30 years of field-proven experience, including engineering and manufacturing know-how; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

ability to deliver solutions and products to organizations and customers that are leaders in their respective industries; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

ability to integrate advanced technological capabilities to develop new solutions and products with its own manufacturing infrastructures and facilities, with full control over the end-to-end production process and cost-efficiencies; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

short &#8220;food chain&#8221; professional and direct marketing methodology focused on main target customers; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

reputation as a leading supplier in relevant markets; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

lasting working relationships with customers; 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#183; 

an experienced, dedicated and competent management team; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

ELD compliant products; and 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Proprietary technology and know-how that allows rapid configuration and implementation of new solutions to meet the special customer needs. 

&#160;

Micronet currently operates via two facilities, the first located in Azur, Israel, near Tel Aviv, and the second located in Salt Lake City, Utah. These two operating facilities give Micronet additional manufacturing and marketing flexibility to serve the market&#8217;s needs, reduce its operational risk, improve its U.S. presence and provide management with additional tools to support the business. 

Manufacturing 

&#160; 

With the exception of certain components purchased from subcontractors, Micronet manufactures and assembles its products and solutions using its own facilities in Israel and the United States using its capabilities and resources, which enable it to control and manage the manufacturing and assembly process and ensure timely delivery. The Israeli facilities are primarily used for the manufacturing process while the United States facilities are primarily used for final assembly and shipment activities. The manufacturing process includes development of electronic cards, assembly of microchips on the electronic cards and the assembly thereof within the unit, final testing and quality tests. On a case by case basis, subcontractors specializing in certain development or manufacturing aspects may be retained to achieve improvement, efficiency or reduction of costs of development and/or manufacturing processes. 

&#160; 

Following certain enhancements in its manufacturing and production capabilities, Micronet has excess manufacturing capacity and has the ability to meet current or foreseeable manufacturing needs without making any significant investments. Implemented enhancements include: 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

upgraded production and assembly line and purchased new machinery with significant higher component implementation scale; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

increased factory facilities and upgraded various infrastructures; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

entered into agreements with subcontractors in the field that operate additional manufacturing facilities, and have significant procurement and manufacturing capabilities and resources that are available to Micronet; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Certified subcontractors to perform manufacturing process to ensure flexible manufacturing infrastructures and deployment that can be used for disaster recovery scenarios or rapid increase in production needs. 

If additional manufacturing resources are needed to meet increased demand for Micronet&#8217;s products, manufacturing capacity can be enhanced by outsourcing manufacturing processes, recruiting and training additional employees, adding shifts to the labor cycle and purchasing additional manufacturing equipment and machinery or other required infrastructures. 

Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

Proprietary rights are important to Micronet&#8217;s business because its ability to remain competitive in the market is dependent to a significant degree on its proprietary solutions and products and the technology on which they are based. To protect its proprietary rights, Micronet primarily relies on a combination of copyright and trade secret laws, internal know-how, and agreements with third parties, such as license agreements. In addition, Micronet employs internal controls such as the use of confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements. Micronet believes its proprietary technology incorporates processes, know-how, methods, algorithms, hardware and software that are the result of more than 20 years of experience and in-house expertise and thus are not easily copied. Further, most of the production process is performed in house, with the exception of certain specific components that are manufactured by a subcontractor. This limited outsourcing process allows Micronet to maintain the majority of its proprietary information and know-how within the company and lowers its exposure to the risk of its products or solution being copied or used by any third parties. 

&#160; 

There is a significant amount of litigation with respect to intellectual property in the industry in which Micronet operates. Micronet has not, to date, been the subject of any claims or proceedings with regards to infringement of third party&#8217;s proprietary rights and it believes that its products, solutions and services do not violate or infringe any third party&#8217;s intellectual property rights. In light of the strong competition in the industry and the innovative solutions and technologies incorporated by Micronet into its recent products, Micronet has been exploring the use of patent applications and is in the process of filing certain patent applications related to its products in the United States, solutions and proprietary technologies. These patents, to the extent granted, are expected to assist Micronet to maintain its technological and competitive position in the market. 

&#160; 

Micronet&#8217;s management, together with its research and development team, monitor closely and continuously all technological developments in the market. Micronet considers and evaluates on an ad hoc basis whether technology and proprietary assets should be acquired through independent in-house development or through the purchase of patents or other technological licenses. Where the purchase of third party proprietary technology, solution or products is required and can be of advantage to its business, Micronet would purchase a license and pay appropriate royalties or license fees. Micronet currently has all third-party licenses that it believes are necessary to maintain and develop its business. 

&#160; 

Government Regulation 

&#160; 

Micronet&#8217;s business is subject to certain international standards such as U.S. Federal Communications Commission, or FCC, Part 15B, FCC ID, CE and Restriction of Hazardous Substances, or RoHS, which define compatibility of interface and telecommunications standards to those implemented in Europe by the European Commission and in the United States by the FCC. Its solutions and products also comply with the E-Mark European standard, which is the standard that defines the compatibility of interface and telecommunications to all appliances installed in and around an automobile. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, Micronet had approximately 64 full-time employees. Of these employees, 31 are employed in manufacturing positions, and the remainders are employed in sales, research and development, management and administrative positions. Our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining agreement, and we have never experienced a work stoppage. We believe we have good and sustainable relations with our employees. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Israeli labor laws and regulations apply to all employees based in Israel. The laws principally address matters such as paid vacation, paid sick days, length of the workday, payment for overtime and severance payments upon the retirement or death of an employee or termination of employment under specified circumstances. The severance payments may be funded, in whole or in part, through a managers&#8217; insurance fund or a pension fund. The payments to the managers&#8217; insurance fund or pension fund toward severance amount to 8.3% of wages. Furthermore, Israeli employees and employers are required to pay predetermined sums to the National Insurance Institute of Israel. Since January 1, 1995, these amounts also include payments for health insurance. 

The payments to the National Insurance Institute amount to approximately 14.4% of wages, of which the employee contributes 60.5% and the employer contributes 39.5%. 

We, including all of our subsidiaries, employed an aggregate of 153 employees on December 31, 2015.
