 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

We are a diversified real estate development and agribusiness company committed to responsibly using our land and resources to meet the housing, employment, and lifestyle needs of Californians and create value for our shareholders. Current operations consist of land planning and entitlement, land development, commercial sales and leasing, leasing of land for mineral royalties, water asset management and sales, grazing leases, income portfolio management, farming, and ranch operations. 

These activities are performed through our five major segments: 

&#8226; 

Real Estate - Commercial/Industrial 

&#8226; 

Real Estate - Resort/Residential 

&#8226; 

Mineral Resources 

&#8226; 

Farming 

&#8226; 

Ranch Operations 

Our prime asset is approximately 270,000 acres of contiguous, largely undeveloped land that, at its most southerly border, is 60 miles north of Los Angeles and, at its most northerly border, is 15 miles east of Bakersfield. We create value by securing entitlements for our land, facilitating infrastructure development, strategic land planning, development, and conservation, in order to maximize the highest and best use for our land. 

. 

We are involved in several joint ventures, which facilitate the development of portions of our land. We are also actively engaged in land planning, land entitlement, and conservation projects. 

Business Objectives and Strategies 

Our primary business objective is to maximize long-term shareholder value through the monetization of our land-based assets. A key element of our strategy is to entitle and then develop large-scale residential and mixed use real estate communities to serve the growing populations of Southern and Central California. We are currently engaged in commercial sales and leasing at our fully operational commercial/industrial center. All of these efforts are supported by diverse revenue streams generated from other operations, including farming, mineral resources and our various joint ventures. 

The following table shows the revenues from continuing operations, segment profits and identifiable assets of each of our continuing industry segments for the last three years:

(1) During the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company reclassified revenues and expenses previously classified as commercial/industrial into a new segment called Ranch Operations. Ranch operations comprise of grazing leases, game management and other ancillary services supporting the ranch. 

(2) During the fourth quarter of 2014, the Company determined hay crop sales previously recorded in the resort/residential revenues segment fit most appropriately with our farming revenues segment. The Company has reclassified prior periods to conform to the current year presentation. 

(3) Segment profits are revenues less operating expenses, excluding investment income and expense, corporate expenses, equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures, and income taxes. 

(4) Total Assets by Segment include both assets directly identified with those operations and an allocable share of jointly used assets. Corporate assets consist of cash and cash equivalents, refundable and deferred income taxes, land, buildings and improvements. 

Real Estate Development Overview 

Our real estate operations consist of the following activities: real estate development, commercial sales and leasing, land planning and entitlement, income portfolio management and conservation. 

Interstate 5, one of the nation&#8217;s most heavily traveled freeways, brings in excess of 75,000 vehicles per day through our land, which includes 16 miles of Interstate 5 frontage on each side of the freeway and the commercial land surrounding four interchanges. The strategic plan for real estate focuses on development opportunities along the Interstate 5 and State Road 138 corridors, which includes the Tejon Ranch Commerce Center, or TRCC, Centennial at Tejon Ranch, or Centennial, a master planned community on our land in Los Angeles County, Mountain Village at Tejon Ranch, or MV, a resort and residential community, and Grapevine at Tejon Ranch, or Grapevine, a master planned community on our land in Kern County. TRCC includes developments east and west of Interstate 5 at TRCC-East and TRCC-West, respectively. 

Our real estate activities within our commercial/industrial segment include: entitling, planning, and permitting of land for development; construction of infrastructure; the construction of pre-leased buildings; the construction of buildings to be leased or sold; and the sale of land to third parties for their own development. The commercial/industrial segment also includes activities related to communications leases, and landscape maintenance fees. Our real estate operations within our resort/residential segment at this time include costs for land entitlement, land planning and pre-construction engineering, and land stewardship and conservation activities. 

Operating Segments 

Real Estate - Commercial/Industrial 

Construction: 

During 2015, we completed the construction of a multi-tenant commercial building within TRCC-East. The multi-tenant building was leased to Starbucks and Pieology, a quick service pizza offering. During 2015 we also completed construction on a real estate pad in TRCC-East and entered into a ground lease with Carl's Jr. All three restaurants are fully operational at December 31, 2015. We also began construction of a second multi-tenant building to be occupied by Habit Burger and Baja Fresh. We expect these two offerings to be fully operational during the second quarter of 2016. 

During 2014, we completed road, utility, and water infrastructure, to open up development south of the TravelCenters of America travel plaza site. This infrastructure provided support for the construction and opening of the Outlets at Tejon in August 2014. This infrastructure is also supporting the development of additional retail opportunities such as restaurants and fuel stations. 

The following is a summary of the Company's retail and industrial real estate developments as of December 31, 2015:

Note: The Tejon Ranch Public Facilities Financing Authority, or TRPFFA, is a joint powers authority formed by Kern County and Tejon-Castac Water District, or TCWD, to finance public infrastructure within the Company&#8217;s Kern County developments. TRPFFA, through bond sales, will reimburse the Company for qualifying infrastructure costs at TRCC. The project resides on 1,450 acres of our land, of which 460 acres will be developed. &#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Leasing: 

Within our commercial/industrial segment, we lease land to various types of tenants. We currently lease land to two auto service stations with convenience stores, 13 fast-food operations, two full-service restaurants, one motel, an antique shop, and a United States Postal Service facility. 

In addition, the Company leases several microwave repeater locations, radio and cellular transmitter sites, and fiber optic cable routes; 32 acres of land to Pastoria Energy Facility, L.L.C., or PEF, for an electric power plant; and one office building in Rancho Santa Fe, California. 

The sale and leasing of commercial/industrial real estate is very competitive, with competition coming from numerous and varied sources around California. Our most direct regional competitors are in the Inland Empire region of Southern California and areas north of us in the San Joaquin Valley of California. The principal factors of competition in this industry are price, availability of labor, proximity to the port complex of Los Angeles/Long Beach and customer base. A potential disadvantage to our development strategy is our distance from the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach in comparison to the warehouses and distribution centers located in the Inland Empire, a large industrial area located east of Los Angeles which continues its expansion eastward beyond Riverside and San Bernardino to include Perris, Moreno Valley, and Beaumont. Strong demand for large distribution facilities is driving development farther east in a search for large entitled parcels. During 2015, vacancy rates in the Inland Empire were comparable to 2014 at 4.3%, primarily due to an increase in the development of buildings for lease. Without this increase in new development in the Inland Empire the vacancy rate would have declined in that region. The low vacancy rates have also led to an increase in lease rates of 12% within the Inland Empire. As lease rates increase in the Inland Empire, we may begin to have greater pricing advantages due to our lower land basis.

For the year ended December 31, 2015 we had no leases that expired, nor did we have any material lease renewals. 

Joint Ventures: 

We are also involved in multiple joint ventures with several partners. Our joint venture with TravelCenters of America, or TA/Petro, owns and operates two travel and truck stop facilities, and also operates four separate gas stations with convenience stores within TRCC-West and TRCC-East. During 2015, TA/Petro began construction of a fifth convenience store and Shell gas station which opened in the first quarter of 2016. We are involved in three joint ventures with Rockefeller Development Group which includes the following: Five West Parcel LLC, which owns a 606,000 square foot building in TRCC-West that is fully leased, 18-19 West LLC, which owns 61.5 acres of land for future development within TRCC-West, and TRCC/Rock Outlet Center LLC that operates the Outlets at Tejon. 

Real Estate - Resort/Residential 

Our resort/residential segment activities include land entitlement, land planning and pre-construction engineering and land stewardship and conservation activities. We have three major resort/residential communities within this segment: MV, which has entitlement approvals and is in the tentative tract map process; Centennial received preliminary zoning within the Antelope Valley Area Plan, or AVAP, and has begun the specific plan process in LA County for approvals of phase one entitlement; and Grapevine is on land owned within Kern County that is in the entitlement process. The entitlement process precedes the regulatory approvals necessary for land development and routinely takes several years to complete. The Conservation Agreement we entered into with five major environmental organizations in 2008 is designed to minimize opposition from environmental groups to these projects and eliminate or reduce the time spent in litigation once governmental approvals are received. Litigation by environmental groups has been a primary cause of delay and loss of financial value for real estate development projects in California. 

Mountain Village at Tejon Ranch: 

MV is planned to be an exclusive, very low-density, resort-based community that will provide owners and guests with a wide variety of recreational opportunities, lodging and spa facilities, golf facilities, a range of housing options, and other exclusive services and amenities that are designed to distinguish MV as the resort community of choice for the Southern California market. MV is being developed by Tejon Mountain Village LLC, or TMV LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. MV encompasses 5,082 acres for a mixed use development to include housing, retail, and commercial industrial components. MV will include 3,450 homes, 160,000 square feet of commercial development and more than 21,000 acres of open space. 

In November 2015, the Board of Directors of the Company approved the detailed business plan that will guide the ultimate development and marketing of MV. The Board also authorized the management team to move forward with the creation of Tentative Tract Maps, which is a two year process estimated to be completed in late 2017. 

During July 2014, the Company acquired full ownership of TMV LLC through the purchase of DMB TMV LLC's interest in the former joint venture for $70,000,000 in cash. 

The Company's decision to obtain full ownership of MV reflects the Company's growth as a fully integrated real estate company and demonstrates our belief in the future success of the development. 

MV is fully entitled and all necessary permits have been issued to begin development once the mapping process is complete. Timing of MV development in the coming years will be dependent on the continued improvement of the economy and an improvement in the second home real estate market. In moving the project forward we will focus on the completion of the mapping process, consumer and market research studies and fine tuning of development business plans as well as defining the capital funding sources for this development. 

Centennial at Tejon Ranch: 

The Centennial development is a large master-planned community development encompassing approximately 11,000 &#32;acres of our land within Los Angeles County. Upon completion of Centennial, it is estimated that the community will include approximately 19,333 homes, and 10.1 million square feet of commercial development. Centennial will also incorporate business districts, schools, retail and entertainment centers, medical facilities and other commercial office and light industrial businesses that, when complete, would create a substantial number of jobs. Centennial is being developed by Centennial Founders, LLC, a consolidated joint venture in which we have a 75.57% &#32;ownership interest as of December 31, 2015 . Our partners in this joint venture are TRI Pointe Homes, Lewis Investment Company and CalAtlantic. Centennial is envisioned to be an ecologically friendly and commercially viable development. 

During the fourth quarter of 2014, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors approved the AVAP. The AVAP is designed to guide future development and conservation in the northern-most region of unincorporated Los Angeles County. Centennial is included in the AVAP as part of the west Economic Opportunity Area, or EOA, where future development would be directed. This particular EOA is located along Highway 138 and encompasses the vast majority of Centennial's proposed boundaries. The final approval of the AVAP will provide Centennial with land use and zoning for residential and commercial development. In June 2015, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors gave final approval for the AVAP. 

We are currently preparing the project level Environmental Impact Report, or EIR, and specific plan for Los Angeles County and anticipate the filing of those documents during 2016, with possible completion in 2017. 

Grapevine at Tejon Ranch: 

Grapevine is an approximately 15,315-acre potential development area located on the San Joaquin Valley floor area of our lands, adjacent to TRCC. The 2008 Conservation Agreement allows for the development of up to 12,400 acres in this area. California regulatory dynamics may impact the future ability to entitle new development so we began the land planning and entitlement process for Grapevine during 2013 to take advantage of the existing favorable pro-business and political climate in Kern County. We are currently focusing on approximately 8,000 &#32;acres for a mixed use development to include housing, retail, and commercial industrial components. Grapevine is proposed to include 12,000 to 14,000 homes and more than 3,000 acres of open space and parks. In 2015, we revised our estimate for commercial and industrial development from 10.7 million to 5.1 million square feet to reduce traffic mitigation costs. We are currently preparing the project level Environmental Impact Report, or EIR, and specific plan for Kern County and anticipate filing those documents during 2016, with possible Kern County Board of Supervisors approval within the next twelve months. The entire approval and litigation process will take several years and the investment of several million dollars to successfully complete. 

The greatest competition for the Centennial and Grapevine communities will come from California developments in the Santa Clarita Valley, Lancaster, Palmdale, and Bakersfield. The developments in these areas will be providing similar housing product as our developments. The principal factors of competition in this industry are pricing of product, amenities offered, and location. We will attempt to differentiate our developments through our unique setting, land planning and different product offerings. MV will compete generally for discretionary dollars that consumers will allocate to recreation and second homes, so its competition will range over a greater area and variety of projects. 

As we embark on the aforementioned master planned communities, we understand that it can take up to 25 years, or greater, to complete from commencement of construction. The entitlement process for development of property in California is complex, lengthy (spanning multiple years) and costly, involving numerous state and county regulatory approvals. We are unable to determine anticipated completion dates for our real estate development projects with certainty because the time for completion is heavily dependent on the regulatory approvals necessary for land development. Also, as a real estate developer, we are cognizant of the micro- and macro-economic factors that have a significant influence on the real estate sector. As a developer, one would be at an economic disadvantage to bring product to market with no willing or able buyers. This ebb and flow of the economy also plays into the timing of our completion date. Costs will also fluctuate over the life of these projects as a result of the cost of labor and raw materials and the timing of approvals and other activity. The uncertainty of estimated costs to completion is compounded by the potential impact of inflation, which will fluctuate with the equally uncertain completion dates for our projects.

Mineral Resources 

Mineral resources consist of oil and gas royalties, rock and aggregate royalties, royalties from a cement operation leased to National Cement, and the management of water assets and water infrastructure. Based on the expansion of our water operations we determined during the third quarter of 2014 that water assets and water management fit most appropriately within our mineral resources segment. We continue to look for opportunities to grow our mineral resource revenues through expansion of leasing and encouraging new exploration. Within our water assets we are expanding our resources through new well drilling programs, while at the same time looking for opportunities to continue to purchase water as we have in the past. As we did in 2015 and 2014, we will look to sell excess water over our internal needs on a temporary basis until that water is needed by us in our real estate and agricultural operations. 

We expect no new oil drilling activity and continued slowing in production through 2016 based on current oil prices. We expect the lower oil prices will also negatively impact our 2016 royalty revenues as compared to 2015 royalty revenues. 

We lease certain portions of our land to oil companies for the exploration and production of oil and gas. We however do not engage in any oil exploration or extraction activities. As of December 31, 2015 , approximately 7,300 acres were committed to producing oil and gas leases from which the operators produced and sold approximately 445,000 &#32;barrels of oil and 315,000 &#32;MCF (each MCF being 1,000 cubic feet) of dry gas during 2015 . Our share of production, based upon average royalty rates during the last three years, has been 149, 179, and 196, barrels of oil per day for 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 , respectively. Approximately 273 active oil wells were located on the leased land as of December 31, 2015 . Royalty rates on our leases averaged approximately 13% of oil production in 2015 . We also had a development and exploration lease with Sojitz Energy Venture, Inc. covering approximately 50,000 acres in the San Joaquin Valley portion of the Company&#8217;s land that ended during February 2015 due to a business decision of Sojitz to focus their drilling efforts in the Gulf of Mexico, which lead Sojitz to not meet the drilling requirements of the lease. We are currently evaluating potential new leases for portions of this land. At the time Sojitz exited the lease, they were not producing oil from the lease. 

Estimates of oil and gas reserves on our properties are unknown to us. We do not make such estimates, and our lessees do not make information concerning reserves available to us. 

We have approximately 2,000 acres under lease to National Cement Company of California, Inc., or National, for the purpose of manufacturing Portland cement from limestone deposits found on the leased acreage. National owns and operates a cement manufacturing plant on our property with a capacity of approximately 1,000,000 tons of cement per year. The amount of payment that we receive under the lease is based upon shipments from the cement plant, which increased during 2015 &#32;compared to 2014 . The improvement in shipments is due to an increase in road construction activity as compared to the prior years. The term of this lease expires in 2026, but National has options to extend the term for successive periods of 20 and 19 years. Proceedings under environmental laws relating to the cement plant are in process. The Company is indemnified by the current and former tenants and at this time we have no cost related to the issues at the cement plant. See Item 3, &#8220;Legal Proceedings,&#8221; for a further discussion. 

We also lease 521 acres to Granite Construction and Griffith Construction for the mining of rock and aggregate product that is used in construction of roads and bridges. The royalty revenues we receive under these leases are based upon the amount of product produced from the many sites. 

Our royalty interests are contractually defined and based on a percentage of production and are received in cash. Our royalty revenues fluctuate based on changes in the market prices for oil, natural gas, and rock and aggregate product, the inevitable decline in production of existing wells and quarries, and other factors affecting the third-party oil and natural gas exploration and production companies that operate on our lands including the cost of development and production. 

In August 2015, we entered into an agreement with PEF our current lessee under a power plant lease. Beginning in 2016, PEF may purchase from us up to 2,000 acre feet of water and from January 2017 through July 2030, PEF may purchase from us up to 3,500 acre feet of water per year, with an option to extend the term. PEF is under no obligation to purchase water from us in any year, but is required to pay us an annual option payment equal to 30% &#32;of the maximum annual payment. The price of the water under the agreement is $1,025 per acre foot of annual water, subject to 3% annual increases commencing January 1, 2017. The Company's commitments to sell water can be met through current water assets. 

Farming Operations 

In the San Joaquin Valley, we farm permanent crops including the following acreage: wine grapes&#8212;1,641 almonds&#8212;1,683; and pistachios&#8212;1,054. We manage the farming of alfalfa and forage mix on 775 acres in the Antelope Valley and we periodically lease 810 acres of land that is used for the growing of vegetables. 

We sell our farm commodities to several commercial buyers. As a producer of these commodities, we are in direct competition with other producers within the United States, or U.S., and throughout the world. Prices we receive for our commodities are determined by total industry production and demand levels. We attempt to improve price margins by producing high quality crops through proven cultural practices and by obtaining better prices through marketing arrangements with handlers. 

Sales of our grape crop typically occurs in the third and fourth quarters of the calendar year, while sales of our pistachio and almond crops also typically occur in the third and fourth quarter of the calendar year, but can occur up to a year or more after each crop is harvested. 

In 2015 , we sold 56% of our grape crop to one winery, 22% to a second winery and the remainder to two other customers. These sales are under long-term contracts ranging from one to 12 years. In 2015 , our almonds were sold to various commercial buyers, with the largest buyer accounting for 63% of our almond revenues. Our pistachio sales were adversely impacted by abnormally low yields caused by the mild winter and as such, sales were insignificant. We do not believe that we would be adversely affected by the loss of any or all of these large buyers because of the markets for these commodities, the large number of buyers that would be available to us, and the fact that the prices for these commodities do not vary based on the identity of the buyer or the size of the contract. 

Our almond, pistachio, and wine grape crop sales are highly seasonal with a majority of our sales occurring during the third and fourth quarters. Nut and grape crop markets are particularly sensitive to the size of each year&#8217;s world crop and the demand for those crops. Large crops in California and abroad can rapidly depress prices. Crop prices, especially almonds, are also adversely affected by a strong U.S. dollar which makes U.S. exports more expensive and decreases demand for the products we produce. The value of the U.S. dollar in prior years has helped to maintain strong almond prices in overseas markets, but we are now seeing this change as the U.S. dollar has strengthened against the Euro. The full potential impact of an increasing U.S. dollar to our pricing and revenue is not known at this time but we have seen a decline in near term almond prices. 

Weather conditions, such as warmer than normal winter temperatures, could impact the number of tree and vine dormant hours, which are integral to tree and vine growth. We will not know if there has been a negative impact on 2016 production until late spring or early summer of 2016. 

Our water entitlement for 2016, available from the California State Water Project, or SWP, when combined with supplemental water, is adequate for our farming needs. The State Department of Water Resources, or DWR, has announced its estimated water supply delivery at 30% &#32;of full entitlement. We expect 2016 rainfalls to provide some relief from the drought California has been experiencing. However, we are cognizant that rainfall in 2016 may not be sufficient to compensate for the drought we have experienced in California over the last several years. The current 30% &#32;allocation of state SWP water is not enough for us to farm our crops, but our additional water resources, such as groundwater and surface sources, and those of the water districts we are in, should allow us to have sufficient water for our farming needs. It is too early in the year to determine the impact of lower than normal water supplies and the ongoing drought on 2016 California crop production for almonds, pistachios, and wine grapes, but it could continue to negatively impact statewide production. See discussion of water contract entitlement and long-term outlook for water supply under Item 2, &#8220;Properties.&#8221; Also see Note 6, (Long-Term Water Assets) of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our water assets. 

Ranch Operations 

During the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company reclassified certain revenues and expenses previously classified as commercial/industrial into a new segment called Ranch Operations. 

Ranch operations consist of game management revenues and ancillary land uses such as grazing leases and filming. Within game management we operate our High Desert Hunt Club, a premier upland bird hunting club. The High Desert Hunt Club offers over 6,400 acres and 35 hunting fields, each field providing different terrain and challenges. The hunting season runs from mid-October through March. We sell individual hunting packages as well as memberships. 

Ranch operations also includes Hunt at Tejon, which offers a wide variety of guided big game hunts including trophy Rocky Mountain elk, deer, turkey and wild pig. We offer guided hunts and memberships for both the Spring and Fall hunting seasons. At December 31, 2015, game management accounts for 36% of the total revenue from ranch operations. 

In addition, the ranch operations segment is in charge of upkeep, maintenance, and security of all 270,000 acres of land. 

Approximately 196,000 acres are used for two grazing leases, which account for 33% of total revenues from ranch operations at December 31, 2015. 

General Environmental Regulation 

Our operations are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations including laws relating to water, air, solid waste and hazardous substances. Although we believe that we are in material compliance with these requirements, there can be no assurance that we will not incur costs, penalties, and liabilities, including those relating to claims for damages to property or natural resources, resulting from our operations. Environmental liabilities may also arise from claims asserted by adjacent landowners or other third parties. We also expect continued legislation and regulatory development in the area of climate change and greenhouse gases. It is unclear as of this date how any such developments will affect our business. Enactment of new environmental laws or regulations, or changes in existing laws or regulations or the interpretation of these laws or regulations, might require expenditures in the future. We historically have not had material environmental liabilities. 

Customers 

We had no customers account for 10% or more of our revenues from continuing operations in 2015 &#32;and 2014. In 2015 and 2014, the PEF power plant lease generated approximately 7% of our total revenues. No other client tenant represents 5% or more of our revenues in 2015 &#32;and 2014. In 2013, Stockdale Oil and Gas, a subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum Corporation, an oil and gas leaseholder, accounted for 10% of our revenues from continuing operations. 

Organization 

Tejon Ranch Co. is a Delaware corporation incorporated in 1987 to succeed the business operated as a California corporation since 1936. 

Employees 

At December 31, 2015 , we had 155 full-time employees. We believe that we have good relations with our employees. We have adopted a Compliance with State and Federal Statutes, Rules and Regulations Reporting Policy that applies to all of our employees. Its receipt and review by each employee is documented and verified quarterly. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. 

Reports 

We make available free of charge through our Internet website, www.tejonranch.com, our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to these reports filed or to be furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with or furnish it to the SEC. We also make available on our website our corporate governance guidelines, charters of our key Board of Directors&#8217; Committees (audit, compensation, nominating and corporate governance, and real estate), and our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics for Directors, Officers, and Employees. These items are also available in printed copy upon request. We intend to disclose future amendments to certain provisions of our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics for Directors, Officers, and Employees, or waivers of such provisions granted to executive officers and directors, on the web site within four business days following the date of such amendment or waiver. Any document we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, may be inspected, without charge, at the SEC&#8217;s public reference room at 100 F Street, N.E. Washington, D.C. 20549 or at the SEC&#8217;s internet site address at http://www.sec.gov .
