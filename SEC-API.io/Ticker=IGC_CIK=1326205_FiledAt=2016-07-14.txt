Business Overview and Corporate History of Our Company

&#160;

In the United States, through our research on phytocannabinoid-based therapies, we develop intellectual property for the treatment of life altering or life threatening conditions; and for the purpose of leasing we build state-of-the-art farming facilities. In India, and China, we lease equipment, trade commodities and electronic components, and in Malaysia we plan to develop manage and sell residential and commercial real estate.

&#160;

Phytocannabinoids are chemical compounds that exert a range of effects on the human body, including impacting the immune response, gastrointestinal maintenance and motility, muscle functioning, and nervous system response and functioning. We have filed five provisional patents with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (&#8220;USPTO&#8221;), in the combination therapy space, for the indications of pain, medical refractory epilepsy and cachexia as part of our intellectual property strategy focused on the phytocannabinoid based health care industry. There is no guarantee that filing a provisional or a non-provisional patent application will result in a successful registration with the USPTO. In addition, when federal laws become more favorable, we intend to build leading edge facilities that we can use to grow, extract, and supply pharmaceutical grade phytocannabinoids.

In Hong Kong, through a majority owned subsidiary, we operate a trading business. Most of our revenue comes from this business. However, for some time, we have been in the process of pivoting away from this business, as there has been a macroeconomic slow-down in this sector, to higher margin niche businesses such as indoor farming, specialized construction and specialty leasing, by organically developing or acquiring this expertise.

Our strategy is to focus on businesses that can generate earnings, and to invest in and develop phytocannabinoid-based intellectual property that can build shareholder value. This important diversification, we believe differentiates us from the majority of publicly traded cannabinoid-based bio-pharmaceutical companies as it mitigates the risks inherent in the nascent cannabinoid-based bio-pharmaceutical industry.

&#160;

We are a Maryland corporation formed in April 2005 for the purpose of acquiring one or more businesses with operations primarily in India through a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition or other similar business combination. In March 2006, we completed an initial public offering of our common stock. In February 2007, we incorporated India Globalization Capital, Mauritius, Limited (&#8220;IGC-M&#8221;), a wholly-owned subsidiary, under the laws of Mauritius. In March 2008, we completed acquisitions of interests in two companies in India, Sricon Infrastructure Private Limited (&#8220;Sricon&#8221;) and Techni Bharathi Limited (&#8220;TBL&#8221;). Since March 31, 2013, we beneficially own 100% of TBL after completing the acquisition of the remaining 23.13% of TBL shares that were still owned by the founders of TBL. The 23.13% of TBL was acquired by IGC-MPL, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of IGC-M. TBL shares are held by IGC-M. TBL is focused on the heavy equipment leasing business. In October 2014, pursuant to a Memorandum of Settlement with Sricon and related parties and in exchange for the 22% minority interest we had in Sricon, we received approximately five acres of prime land in Nagpur, India, valued around $5 million, based on various factors including real estate demand in India and exchange rate. The land is located a few miles from MIHAN, which is the largest development zone in terms of investment in India. The Company beneficially registered the land in its name on March 4, 2016.

In February 2009, IGC-M beneficially purchased 100% of IGC Mining and Trading Private Limited (&#8220;IGC-IMT&#8221;) based in Chennai, India. IGC-IMT was formed in December 2008, as a privately held start-up company engaged in the business of trading iron ore. Its current activity is to trade iron ore. In July 2009, IGC-M beneficially purchased 100% of IGC Materials, Private Limited (&#8220;IGC-MPL&#8221;) based in Nagpur, India, which conducts our quarrying business, and 100% of IGC Logistics, Private Limited (&#8220;IGC-LPL&#8221;) based in Nagpur, India, which is involved in the transport and delivery of ore, cement, aggregate and other materials. Together, these companies carry out our iron ore trading business in India.

In December 2011, we acquired a 95% equity interest in Linxi HeFei Economic and Trade Co., known as Linxi H&#38;F Economic and Trade Co., a People&#8217;s Republic of China-based company (&#8220;PRC Ironman&#8221;), by acquiring 100% of the equity of H&#38;F Ironman Limited, a Hong Kong company (&#8220;HK Ironman&#8221;). Together, PRC Ironman and HK Ironman are referred to as &#8220;Ironman.&#8221; In February 2015, IGC filed a lawsuit in the circuit court of Maryland, against 24 defendants related to the acquisition of Ironman, seeking to have the court order rescission of the underlying Acquisition Agreement and to void any past or future transfer of IGC shares to the defendants. It is anticipated that the lawsuit will go to trial in mid-2017. The assets of Ironman are currently shown on the balance sheet of IGC. However, adjudication of the court case in favor of IGC would mean that the Ironman assets would be removed from the balance sheet of IGC reducing the total assets and additional paid in capital. Please see the risk factor on Ironman and the financial note 3 on the accounting impact on IGC&#8217;s balance sheet.

In January 2013, we incorporated IGC HK Mining and Trading Limited (&#8220;IGC-HK&#8221;) in Hong Kong. IGC-HK is a wholly owned subsidiary of IGC-M. In September 2014, we changed the subsidiary&#8217;s name to IGC Cleantech Ltd (&#8220;IGC-CT&#8221;).

&#160;

In May 2014, we completed the acquisition of 51% of the outstanding share capital of Golden Gate Electronics Limited, a corporation organized and existing under the laws of Hong Kong and now known as IGC International ("IGC-INT"). IGC-INT, headquartered in Hong Kong, operates an e-commerce platform for the trading of commodities and electronic components. The purchase price of the acquisition consisted of up to 1,209,765 shares of our common stock, valued at approximately $1,052,496 on the closing date of the acquisition. As we are curtailing our low margin trading activity and realigning resources to the phytocannabinoid industry and real estate development and international project management industry, we are negotiating an exit from our ownership of Golden Gate. We anticipate exiting this acquisition and eventually the trading business.

In June 2014, we entered into an agreement with TerraSphere Systems LLC to develop multiple facilities to produce organic leafy green vegetables utilizing TerraSphere&#8217;s advanced pesticide-free organic indoor farming technology. Under the agreement, we will own 51% of each venture once production is operational, and will have a right of first refusal to participate in all future build-outs. Additionally, in consideration for our issuance of 50,000 shares of common stock, we received a seven-year option to purchase TerraSphere Systems for cash or additional shares of our common stock. We are negotiating a conversion of the investment into shares of a Canadian public vehicle that TerraSphere expects to merge into.

In December 2014, we entered into a Purchase Agreement with Apogee Financial Investments, Inc. (&#8220;Apogee&#8221;), the previous sole owner of the outstanding membership interests of Midtown Partners &#38; Co., LLC, a Florida limited liability company registered as a broker-dealer under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (&#8220;Midtown Partners&#8221;), to acquire 24.9% of the outstanding membership interests in Midtown Partners. In consideration of the initial membership interests, we issued to Apogee 1,200,000 shares of our common stock. As a result of Apogee&#8217;s inability to obtain requisite approvals to sell us their remaining interest in Midtown Partners, we will remain a 24.9% owner in Midtown Partners for the foreseeable future. We are not seeking to consummate the acquisition of the remaining interest in Midtown Partners at this time.

In February 2016, we completed the acquisition of 100% of the outstanding share capital of Cabaran Ultima Sdn. Bhd., a corporation organized and existing under the laws of Malaysia (&#8220;Ultima&#8221;), from RGF Land Sdn. Bhd. (&#8220;Land&#8221;), the sole shareholder of Ultima, pursuant to the terms of a Share Purchase Agreement among the parties. Ultima holds 51% of RGF Cabaran Sdn. Bhd., which holds 75% of RGF Construction Sdn. Bhd. The purchase price of the acquisition consists of up to 998,571 shares of our common stock, valued at approximately $169,758 on the closing date of the Share Purchase Agreement. Ultima and its management&#8217;s expertise include the following: (i) building agro-infrastructure for growing medicinal plants and botanical extraction, and (ii) construction of high-end luxury complexes such as service apartments, luxury condominiums and hotels.

Industry Overview and Target Markets of Our Company

We are developing a product portfolio of phytocannabinoid-based therapies for the treatment of a wide range of therapeutic indications including treatment of neuropathic and cancer pain, epilepsy, end of life supportive care and debilitating pain management, and adjunctive supportive therapies of chronic neurological and oncological diagnoses, all of which are life altering or life threatening. Our target market for some of these therapies is very large. In 2012, the Journal of Pain reported that the annual estimated national cost of treating pain ranges from $560 billion to $635 billion, which is more than the cost of the nation&#8217;s priority health conditions. We are also developing veterinarian therapies including the treatment of epilepsy in dogs and cats, which represent a significantly smaller but important market. Our target market for products developed through these efforts would be humans, and veterinarian animals. There is also no guarantee that filing a provisional or a non-provisional patent application will result in a successful registration with the USPTO. For our development to become products we would have to conduct FDA approved trials that will take between five and seven years. Regulatory approvals for applications in the veterinarian space are significantly shorter and this is an area that we are focused on.

We are also designing indoor vertical farming facilities, processes and technology that allow us to position ourselves to grow legal cannabis and provide phytocannabinoids to the industry, if and when permitted by federal laws. According to a January 2013 market research report by ArcView, the legal cannabis market was about $1.43 billion and is expected to grow 64% in 2014 to about $2.34 billion. The market is expected to grow to about $10.2 billion over the next five years based on statewide legalization. Our internal estimate, based on data from Colorado, is that the market for cannabis consumption, if all states and the federal government were to legalize recreational use of cannabis, would be about $40 billion. This is consistent with most demand-based studies that estimate the market between $10 billion to $40 billion based on a variety of variables including pricing. We expect the market for peripheral products including phytocannabinoid-based nutraceuticals and pharmaceuticals to be larger. There can be no assurance when or if U.S. federal laws will change to legalize use of cannabis.

According to new research from International Data Corporation (IDC), published in a press release on June 2, 2015, the worldwide Internet of Things market will grow from $655.8 billion in 2014 to $1.7 trillion in 2020. Devices, connectivity and IT services will make up the majority of the IoT market in 2020. Together, they are estimated to account for over two-thirds of the worldwide IoT market in 2020, with devices (modules/sensors) alone representing 31.8% of the total. By 2020, IDC expects that IoT purpose-built platforms, application software and "as a service" offerings will capture a larger percentage of revenue. We target smaller original equipment manufacturers (&#8220;OEMs&#8221;) that require electronic components for manufacturing devices like routers, lights, cameras, watches and other health care devices. Our platform allows us to connect supply chains in Japan, China and other countries with OEMs. Our current share of the electronic trading market is less than 1% based on revenue.

&#160;

&#160;

Products and Services by Business Area in Fiscal 2016

&#160;

Phytocannabinoid based therapies

Phytocannabinoids are chemical compounds that exert a range of effects on the human body, including impacting the immune response, gastrointestinal maintenance and motility, muscle functioning, and nervous system response and functioning. We have filed five provisional patents with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (&#8220;USPTO&#8221;), in the combination therapy space, for the indications of pain, medical refractory epilepsy and cachexia as part of our intellectual property strategy focused on the phytocannabinoid-based health care industry. In September 2015, the USPTO notified us that our provisional patent application (Prov. 62/050,864) based on a novel therapy that uses cannabinoid extracts for the treatment of pain was converted to a utility patent (PCT/US2015/050342, internal formulation IGC501). This formulation uses a combination of phytocannabinoids in a cream, for topical applications, for relieving pain in patients with psoriatic arthritis, fibromyalgia, scleroderma and other conditions. We intend to file the respective non-provisional patent application within 12 months of the provisional patent application. The American Pain Society recommends that pain be made more visible and categorized as the fifth vital sign. The treatment of pain is a great challenge for health care professionals as it often can debilitate individuals in ways that affects their day-to-day functioning, significantly impacting the nation&#8217;s productivity. Since 1999 there has been a 22 percent increase in the number of women who attribute their disability to arthritis. Health economists writing in The Journal of Pain , in September 2012, reported that the annual estimated national cost of pain ranges from $560 billion to $635 billion, more than the costs of the nation&#8217;s priority health conditions. A major disadvantage of using currently available drug therapies to treat severe chronic pain is that opioid based drugs may lead to side effects like hallucinations, constipation, sedation, nausea, respiratory depression, and dysphoria.

We have filed three phytocannabinoid based provisional patents (Prov. 1644/15, Prov. 1642/15, Prov. 1672/16) for the treatment of multiple types of seizure disorders and epilepsy in humans, dogs, and cats. About 3 million people in the United States and 50 million worldwide are affected by Epilepsy (Sander, 2003). Epilepsy is due to multiple factors including the modulation of Sodium, Potassium, GABA and NMDA channels. Modulating one or more of these receptors are required to maximally control epilepsy. It is believed that mono-therapy is adequate in up to 25 percent of patients. The onset of epileptic seizures can be life threatening including long-term implications (Lutz, 2004) including mental health problems, cognitive deficits and morphological changes (Swann, 2004, Avoli et al., 2005). The onset of epilepsy also greatly affects lifestyle as sufferers live in the fear of consequential injury or the inability to perform daily tasks (Fisher et al., 2000). Current medications using phenytoin provoke a skin rash in 5 to 10% of patients receiving the drug for the treatment of seizures and other disorders. Seizures in dogs and cats are caused by abnormal brain activity; they can be subtle or cause violent convulsions. Some seizures only occur once but repeated seizures require treatment to prevent larger areas of the brain from becoming affected.

In addition, we have filed a phytocannabinoid based provisional patent (Prov. 1646/15) for treating cachexia and eating disorders in humans and veterinary animals. About 1.3 million humans in the United States are affected each year by cachexia which is a weakness and wasting away of the body due to severe illness such as cancer, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson&#8217;s disease, HIV/AIDS and other progressive illnesses. Cachexia is secondary to an underlying disease such as cancer or AIDS and is a positive risk factor for death. It is often seen at the end-stage of cancer (Payne, et al. 2012; Rapini et al. 2007). Cancer induced cachexia is responsible for about 20% of all cancer deaths. It physically weakens patients to the extent that response to standard treatments is poor (Lainscak, et al. 2007; Bossola, et al. 2007).

There is no guarantee that filing a provisional or a non-provisional patent application will result in a successful registration with the USPTO. In addition, when federal laws become more favorable, we intend to build leading edge facilities that we can use to grow, extract, and supply pharmaceutical grade phytocannabinoids.

Trading of electronic components

&#160;

Our electronic trading activity currently centers on the sale of components manufactured in China and Japan to customers that make products mostly for the Internet of Things and health care. We operate an electronic e-commerce platform that connects supply chains with OEMs in China, Hong Kong, Europe, Japan and a few other countries. Global prices for electronic components have traditionally decreased over time as manufacturing moves to higher automation and lower cost areas. Our current share of the overall market is less than 1% based on revenue.

&#160; &#160;

The following are the relevant features of the trading activities carried out by our subsidiary in Hong Kong:

&#160;

The company carries out its trading activity based on purchase orders placed by product manufacturers in China, Japan, and Hong Kong. We, in turn, place orders with our listed vendors, located in several countries. There are no long-term contracts both for the purchases and sales made by the subsidiary. During fiscal 2016, our subsidiary did not carry out any value addition to the components sold and the purchases were made based on spot pricing of components. The Company does carry an inventory of components that it believes to be in high demand. There is no hedging of currency.

&#160;

With respect to the transportation and storage of goods, our subsidiary contracts with local transportation agents for the transportation of goods and manages rental space for storage of components. We have a long-term contract for the warehouse.

In the table included under Note 14 of our consolidated financial statements, we had total property, plant and equipment of $7,074,437 as of March 31, 2016. Of this amount, the value of the three iron ore beneficiation plants in China, including the one under construction (under capital work-in progress) was $6,198,006. We have initiated legal proceedings against the original owners of the mines and beneficiation plants and expect a resolution in fiscal year 2017.

Construction management and rental of heavy equipment

&#160;

According to Deloitte and KOTRA, the total market size of the construction industry in India is estimated at $126 billion. However, various plans by the Indian government to build and modernize Indian infrastructure have yet to materialize. As such, we are less focused on the rental of heavy equipment in India. Through our subsidiary, TBL, we are engaged in renting heavy construction equipment. Our subsidiary has experience in the construction industry having in the past, constructed highways, rural roads, tunnels, dams, airport runways and housing complexes, mostly in southern states. Our current share of the overall market in India is less than 1% based on revenue.

Golden Gate Acquisition

&#160;

On May 31, 2014, we completed the acquisition of 51% of the issued and outstanding share capital of Golden Gate Electronics Limited, a corporation organized and existing under the laws of Hong Kong (&#8220;Golden Gate&#8221;), from Sunny Tsang Hon Sang, the sole shareholder of Golden Gate, pursuant to the terms of a Stock Purchase Agreement by and among the parties. Golden Gate, headquartered in Hong Kong, operates an e-commerce platform for trading of commodities and electronic components. The purchase price of the acquisition consists of up to 1,209,765 shares of our common stock, valued at approximately $1,052,496 on the closing date of the Stock Purchase Agreement. The name of Golden Gate was changed to IGC International.

&#160;

Golden Gate, headquartered in Hong Kong, operates an e-commerce platform that connects supply chains with OEMs. Golden Gate operates several bank lines of credit facilities and uses an electronic trading e-commerce platform to position itself as the supply chain partner for equipment manufacturers, traders and service providers. It is an international broker that strives to solve urgent sourcing needs. Golden Gate was profitable in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2014, with unaudited revenue of approximately $10,000,000.

&#160;

Pursuant to the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement, the shares are issuable in four installments, with 205,661 shares having been issued at closing. The balance of the shares are issuable in increments of (i) 205,660 shares following the audit for our fiscal year ending March 31, 2015 for achieving target revenue of HK$75.0 million, and earnings of HK$2.25 million for the period from July 1, 2014 to March 31, 2015, (ii) 399,222 shares following the audit for our fiscal year ending March 31, 2016 for achieving target revenue of HK$160.0 million, and earnings of HK$8.0 million during the 2016 fiscal year, and (iii) 399,222 shares following the audit for our fiscal year ending March 31, 2017 for achieving target revenue of HK$235.0 million, and earnings of HK$14.0 million during the 2017 fiscal year, with the shares delivered by us in each period on a prorated basis if the earnings targets are not fully satisfied. For convenience, on June 4, 2014, the U.S. dollar foreign exchange rate in late New York trading was $1.00 =HK$7.75

&#160;

Notwithstanding the foregoing targets, in the event Golden Gate completes an initial public offering in China or Hong Kong before September 30, 2017, and less than all of our shares have then been issued under the Stock Purchase Agreement, the remaining unissued shares will be issued to Golden Gate, provided the initial public offering price values Golden Gate higher than in accordance with this transaction.

&#160;

The Stock Purchase Agreement provides for "put" options under various circumstances that would allow us and Golden Gate to reverse the transaction by returning each other's shares. The put option held by Mr. Tsang Hon Sang would be triggered based on our share price dropping below certain minimum preset share prices for extended periods of time or the suspension of trading or delisting of our shares. The put option held by us would be triggered if Golden Gate has accumulated negative earnings for any of the next three fiscal years, and both parties have a put option if certain loan facilities cannot be renewed or new bank loans cannot be obtained. Our current share of the electronic trading market is less than 1%. As we are curtailing our low margin trading activity and realigning resources to the phytocannabinoid industry and real estate development and international project management industry, we are negotiating an exit from our ownership of Golden Gate. We anticipate exiting this acquisition and eventually the trading business.

&#160;

Partnership with TerraSphere Systems

&#160;

On June 27, 2014, we entered into an agreement with TerraSphere Systems, LLC to develop multiple facilities to produce organic leafy green vegetables utilizing TerraSphere&#8217;s advanced pesticide-free organic indoor farming technology. Under the agreement, IGC will own 51% of each venture once production is operational. We are negotiating a conversion of the advance into shares of a Canadian public vehicle that TerraSphere expects to merge into.

Midtown Partners &#38; Co., LLC Purchase Agreement

On December 18, 2014, IGC entered into a Purchase Agreement with Apogee, the previous sole owner of the outstanding membership interests of Midtown Partners &#38; Co., LLC, a Florida limited liability company registered as a broker-dealer under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (&#8220;Midtown&#8221;), and acquired, in an initial closing, 24.9% of the outstanding membership interests in Midtown. In consideration of the initial membership interests, we are required to issue to Apogee 1,200,000 shares of our common stock (subject to downward adjustment based on certain Q4 2014 financial statement matters). Following the receipt of all required SEC, FINRA and other regulatory approvals, we have agreed to acquire, in a final closing, the remaining 75.1% of the outstanding membership interests in Midtown in consideration of our issuance to Apogee of an additional 700,000 shares of our common stock (subject to downward adjustment based on certain financial statement matters prior to the final closing). The agreement had a deadline of June 30, 2015, for Apogee and Midtown Partners to obtain the requisite approvals from FINRA. Apogee did not file for approval on time, and consequently pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, there are several penalties that will apply, including the cancellation of 700,000 shares of IGC stock and a penalty of $125,000 owed by Apogee to us. We are not seeking to consummate the acquisition of the remaining interest in Midtown Partners at this time. Midtown&#8217;s market share of the investment banking market is less than 1%. 

Cabaran Ultima Sdn. Bhd. Acquisition

On February 11, 2016, we completed the acquisition of 100% of the outstanding share capital of Cabaran Ultima Sdn. Bhd., a corporation organized and existing under the laws of Malaysia (&#8220;Ultima&#8221;), from RGF Land Sdn. Bhd (&#8220;Land&#8221;), the sole shareholder of Ultima, pursuant to the terms of a Share Purchase Agreement among the parties. Ultima holds 51% of RGF Cabaran Sdn. Bhd., which holds 75% of RGF Construction Sdn. Bhd. The purchase price of the acquisition consists of up to 998,571 shares of our common stock, valued at approximately $169,758 on the closing date of the Share Purchase Agreement. Ultima and its management&#8217;s expertise include the following: (i) building agro-infrastructure for growing medicinal plants and botanical extraction, and (ii) construction of high-end luxury complexes such as service apartments, luxury condominiums and hotels. Ultima&#8217;s market share of the real estate project planning, construction, and management industry in Malaysia is less than 1%. 

&#160;

Our Customers

&#160;

In fiscal year 2016, our customers were product developers and product manufacturers that make routers, cameras, and health care products. In India, our present and past customers include the National Highway Authority of India, several state highway authorities, the Indian railways, and private construction companies.

&#160;

Growth and Expansion Strategy

&#160;

Our current focus is in two areas:

&#160;

&#183; C ontinuing with the investments in the development of a portfolio of phytocannabinoid-based therapies; and 

&#160;

&#183; E xpanding the real estate development and management in both India and Malaysia. 

Competition and Competitive Advantage

&#160;

The development of phytocannabinoid-based therapies is currently not very competitive. The largest amount of research in this area is done in Israel. The most significant research and FDA approved trials are done by one large pharmaceutical company, and to a lesser extent by two other large firms. In the United States there is very little wide spread research while most of the research is concentrated in Israel. This is mostly because the United States Drug Enforcement Administrating (&#8220;DEA&#8221;) classifies phytocannabinoid extracts as a Schedule 1 drug. This means that phytocannabinoids are characterized as &#8220;high potential for abuse,&#8221; and &#8220;no currently accepted medical use&#8221;. Further, any study conducted in the US must be registered and approved by the DEA and raw materials purchased through the National Institute of Drug Abuse (NIDA). We compete with two large pharmaceutical companies, and three small companies. There are several microcap companies that also compete in this space. Our competitive advantage is based on experience and deep knowledge of medicine, biochemistry, intellectual property protection, FDA trials, extraction techniques, knowledge of plant strains, access to foreign markets where testing has less regulatory hurdles, and a strategy that is well differentiated. In the electronic trading and leasing business we compete on price, low overheads and low marketing expenses.

&#160;

Sales and Marketing

&#160;

For our electronic business, our sales force located in Hong Kong and China consists of individuals that have expertise and contacts in the electronic product development sector. The sales professional follows the list of bidders for the supply of electronic components and partners with component manufacturers to bid on the order. Much of this is automated by our e-commerce platform that connects manufacturers to product developers. Once a contract is awarded, we then ensure smooth and high quality logistics and supply to meet deadlines. Frequently, our sales force will call on suppliers and customers and negotiate an acceptable price point for the components. Typically, the sales cycle lasts between one to two weeks.

&#160;

Technology Platform and Intellectual Property

We have intellectual property attorneys that file patents or provisional patent applications for a combination of copyright, trademark and trade secret laws of general applicability, employee confidentiality and invention assignment agreements and other intellectual property protection methods to safeguard our technology, research and development. We have applied for preliminary patents on phytocannabinoid-based therapies in the areas of pain management, medical refractory epilepsy and cachexia. The Company holds all rights to the patents that have been filed by us with the USPTO.

Employees and Consultants

&#160;

As of July 14, 2016, we employed a work force of approximately 65 employees and contract workers in the United States, Hong Kong, China, India and Malaysia. We have a total of 31 full-time employees, with the rest being part-time or seasonal. In addition, we have several advisors that are highly qualified in their specific areas of expertise.

Governmental Regulations

&#160;

In the United States, 25 states, Guam, Puerto Rico and The District of Columbia have allowed (subject to licensing) the cultivation, processing and sale of cannabis. However, cannabis including certain phytocannabinoids derived from the plant, specifically the psychoactive compound Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and the non-psychoactive, medically useful compound Cannabidiol (CBD) are both considered to be Schedule 1 drugs under the Control Substances Act (CSA). The implication for us is that testing such as determining drug efficacy and toxicity screening of our formulations in the US will require arduous procedural registration and approval from the DEA and sourcing from the NIDA. In order to remain compliant with both federal and state laws we have deferred testing formulations in the US and expect to pursue such testing in a foreign country where it is legal to do so. Our business is impacted by government regulations surrounding the transfer of money to and from foreign countries. India, Malaysia, and China have strict foreign exchange regulations that make it difficult to move money in and out of these countries. Because we are a US based company we are subject to US laws that govern money laundering and this results in arduous amounts of paper work, delays, and extreme amounts of scrutiny.
