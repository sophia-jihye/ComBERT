&#160;

Our Company 

&#160;

We are a provider of advanced wound care solutions. We have a suite of advanced wound care solutions that enable surgeons, clinicians, and wound care practitioners to address some of the challenges presented by chronic and advanced wounds. We have built this portfolio through our proprietary hydrogel technology platform, targeted acquisitions, and through licensing and distribution agreements with strategic partners that include sorbion GmbH &#38; Co. KG, an affiliate of BSN Medical, Inc., and Celgene Cellular Therapeutics, a subsidiary of Celgene Corporation. Our contract manufacturing business provides custom hydrogels to the OEM market.

&#160;

Products and Services 

&#160;

Our commercial wound care portfolio, operating within one segment, currently consists of five product categories: Wound Bed Preparation &#38; Stimulation; Human Biologics; Antimicrobial Protection; Exudate Management; and Contract Manufacturing.

&#160;

Wound Bed Preparation &#38; Stimulation 

&#160; 

On May 29, 2015, we completed our acquisition of Celleration, Inc. (&#8220;Celleration&#8221;), a medical device company focused on developing and commercializing the MIST Therapy&#174; (&#8220;MIST Therapy&#8221;) therapeutic ultrasound platform for the treatment of acute and chronic wounds. MIST Therapy is a painless, noncontact, low-frequency ultrasound delivered through a saline mist to the wound bed. The MIST Therapy System and UltraMIST&#174; (&#8220;UltraMIST&#8221;) consist of a small countertop generator and handheld transducer. Attached to the transducer is a single-use disposable applicator, which includes an inlet for sterile saline. As the device is activated, the saline is introduced to the head of the transducer where it is atomized. This saline mist is the medium through which the ultrasonic energy is transmitted to the wound site inducing a non-painful, cool sensation to the patient. The disposable applicator is designed for a single use only in order to avoid infection from patient to patient. Unlike most wound therapies that are limited to treating the wound surface, we believe the gentle wound sound waves of MIST Therapy stimulate the cells within and below the wound bed to accelerate the healing process and reduces bacteria and bioburden.

&#160;

Human Biologics 

&#160;

In November 2013 we entered into a license, marketing and development agreement with Anthrogenesis Corporation, d/b/a Celgene Cellular Therapeutics (&#8220;CCT&#8221;), an affiliate of Celgene Corporation, pursuant to which CCT granted us an exclusive, royalty-bearing license in its intellectual property related to certain placental based products, including the wound care products Extracellular Matrix (&#8220;ECM&#8221;), a suite of advanced wound management products made from extracellular matrix derived from the human placenta and Biovance&#174;, a decellularized and dehydrated allograft produced from human amniotic membrane for the management of non-infected partial- and full-thickness wounds.

&#160;

The license agreement permits us to commercialize ECM and Biovance in the United States. The development and application of the intellectual property covered under the license agreement and is managed by a joint steering committee, composed of members of our company and CCT. We pay CCT annual license fees, designated amounts when certain milestone events occur and royalties on all sales of licensed products, with such amounts being variable and contingent on various factors. On September 30, 2014, we and CCT amended the license agreement, pursuant to which we received the right to market Biovance for podiatric and orthopedic applications. On May 5, 2015, the license agreement was further amended, pursuant to which we received the additional right to develop and market CCT&#8217;s connective tissue matrix product (&#8220;CTM&#8221;). We expect to initiate sales and marketing efforts for CTM products in 2016. The product will be available in two forms of delivery and we believe will be able to treat deep wounds better than Biovance.

&#160;

In connection with the Biovance products contemplated by the license agreement, on November 14, 2013, we also entered into a supply agreement with CCT, as subsequently amended on each of April 10, 2014 and September 30, 2014, pursuant to which CCT agreed to supply us with our entire requirement of Biovance for distribution and sale in the United States. On April 10, 2014, we and CCT entered into a supply agreement for ECMs, on substantially the same terms as the supply agreement for Biovance. On April 23, 2014 we initiated our sales and marketing efforts for Biovance at the Spring 2014 Symposium on Advanced Wound Care.

&#160;

Biovance and CTM are derived from the placenta of normal, full-term pregnancies. After processing these human tissues contain collagen, fibronectin, and other proteins and biochemicals that support wound healing. Additionally, essentially no cells are contained in the finished product (Biovance and CTM are decellularized), which is different from other placenta-based wound care products, and this decellularization contributes to minimization of irritation and inflammation related to immune responses that can hamper wound healing. The extracellular matrix composition of Biovance and CTM form a natural scaffold that when placed in a wound bed, serves as a platform that allows the body&#8217;s own cells to migrate into and attach. Once attached, the cells release growth factors to signal other activities to progress wound healing. Biovance is intended to be used as a wound cover to support the wound through the healing process or, when implanted, maintains the tissue plains minimizing adhesions and CTM which is intended for use as a biological tissue graft for the repair or replacement of non-infected damaged or deficient soft tissue to treat voids or defects and augment during repair of dehisced or complicated surgical closures and repair of small surgical defects resulting from either medical or surgical conditions including those with exposed vital structures. Biovance is intended for application to open traumatic wounds, complex wounds such as burns, open surgical wounds, Mohs procedure (microscopically controlled surgery for skin cancer), and chronic wounds such as diabetic, venous, arterial, pressure and other ulcers. CTM is intended for augmentation of deficient/inadequate soft tissue and treatment of deep dermal wounds; surgical wounds; soft tissue voids as a result of tunneling wounds, fistula tracts, or dermal undermining. Biovance and CTM may also be used on exposed tendon, muscle, bone, nerve or other vital structures.

&#160;

4&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

We and CCT are still evaluating the development path for ECM based on continued consultation with the FDA. Any further development and commercialization is uncertain at this time.

&#160;

In January 2016, Human Longevity, Inc. (&#8220;HLI&#8221;), a genomics-based, technology-driven company, announced its planned purchase of LifebankUSA and other select assets from CCT. We will remain the exclusive commercial partner for the existing pipeline of human placental based products as noted above.

&#160;

Antimicrobial Protection 

&#160;

In July 2012, we began to market two proprietary products, SilverSeal, a hydrogel wound dressing with silver coated fibers, and Hydress, an over-the-counter hydrogel wound dressing. Our SilverSeal dressing is available in two sizes and our Hydress dressing is available in one size. Both types of dressing are used to provide and maintain a moist wound environment. The benefits of these products include reduced pain, maintenance of a moist wound environment that may speed healing. SilverSeal dressings also provide an antimicrobial barrier. Silver based wound dressings are becoming increasingly prevalent in wound care due to the recent increase of antibiotic-resistant bacteria such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, commonly known as MRSA.

&#160;

In July 2013, we announced the results from a post-marketing study to assess surgical wound outcomes in patients who have undergone foot and ankle surgery. In this study, those treated with our SilverSeal dressing had a lower incidence of post-operative wound complications, including infections and rupture of the incision lice (dehiscence). In addition, there was a reduction in scar length compared to standard petroleum-based dressing. In this study, patients who had undergone ankle and foot (including forefoot, midfoot or hindfoot) surgery were randomized to receive either SilverSeal or a standard petroleum-based dressing. Patients were monitored for three months following surgery to assess the degree of scarring and the incidence of post-operative wound complications such as superficial or deep infections or dehiscence. Of the nine wound complications observed, eight occurred in patients using the petroleum-based dressing and only one in those using SilverSeal (p=0.03). The p-value is the percentage chance that the results of a statistical nature are due to random error (a p-value less than 0.05 [5%] is considered to be significant). Scar length was also reduced to a greater extent in patients using SilverSeal compared to those with a standard petroleum-based dressing. Additional studies should be done to confirm these favorable results.

&#160;

In May 2014 we acquired Choice Therapeutics, Inc. (&#8220;Choice&#8221;), a provider of innovative wound care products using proprietary TheraBond 3D &#174; Antimicrobial Barrier Systems (&#8220;TheraBond&#8221;). The TheraBond product line includes contact dressings, island dressings and wraps. Based on a proprietary and patented manufacturing process, silver is bonded to the entire surface of the nylon fibers of the TheraBond dressing. When the TheraBond products are placed on the wound, bioactive ionic silver is released at a controlled rate. Used largely in burn care, we believe TheraBond promotes an optimal wound healing environment by creating an antimicrobial barrier that helps protect against infection. With its one-piece construction and unique struts between the contact and outer layers, TheraBond enables efficient transfer of fluid and exudate (excess wound fluid) away from the wound and into an absorptive outer dressing, while providing rapid, sustained antimicrobial protection.

&#160;

Exudate Management 

&#160;

In September 2013, we entered into a distributor agreement (the &#8220;Sorbion Agreement&#8221;) with Sorbion GmbH &#38; Co KG (&#8220;Sorbion&#8221;), pursuant to which we became the exclusive distributor of sorbion sachet S, sorbion sana and new products with hydrokinetic fibers as primary dressings in the United States, Canada and Latin America, subject to certain exceptions. The term of the agreement ends on December 31, 2018. Sorbion assigned its rights and obligations of the Sorbion Agreement to BSN Medical, Inc. (&#8220;BSN&#8221;), an affiliate of Sorbion, in June 2015.

&#160;

Intended for wound bed preparation (a comprehensive approach to removing barriers to healing and stimulating the healing process), sorbion sachet S is indicated as a primary dressing for moderately to highly exudating wounds such as some surgical wounds, venous leg ulcers and diabetic ulcers. It assists in the removal of slough (dead skin tissue) and toxins, and locks bacteria into the dressing. Sorbion sachet S&#8217;s hydration response technology combines mechanically modified cellulose fibers with gelling agents; the close interaction of the two components allows for active regulation of the wound climate.

&#160;

5&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Sorbion sana is indicated as a primary wound dressing and provides another form of wound treatment. It maintains a wound climate which supports healing, supports granulation (the formation of a new connective tissue and tiny blood vessels on the surface of a wound) by protecting tissue and offers a reduction in pain during dressing changes. Sorbion sana consists of an absorbent core with hydration response technology and a three-dimensional outer cover made of polyethylene. Selected materials and an optimized manufacturing process allow the avoidance of glues and adhesives, making the sorbion sana dressings less likely to cause an allergic reaction.

&#160;

Contract Manufacturing 

&#160;

In connection with our legacy contract manufacturing business, we develop, manufacture and market high water content, electron beam cross-linked, aqueous polymer hydrogels, or gels, used for wound care, medical diagnostics, transdermal drug delivery and cosmetics. We specialize in custom gels by capitalizing on proprietary manufacturing technologies. Our products are manufactured using proprietary and non-proprietary mixing, coating and cross-linking technologies. Together, these technologies enable us to produce gels that can satisfy rigid tolerance specifications with respect to a wide range of physical characteristics (e.g., thickness, water content, adherence, absorption, moisture vapor transmission rate (a measure of the passage of water vapor through a substance) and release rate) while maintaining product integrity. Additionally, we have the manufacturing ability to offer broad choices in selection of liners onto which the gels are coated. Consequently, our customers are able to determine tolerances in moisture vapor transmission rate and active ingredient release rates while personalizing color and texture.

&#160; 

Planned Products and Services 

&#160;

We intend to continue to expand our existing product offerings largely through licensing of products and acquisitions. We believe that our management team will be able to successfully integrate and leverage acquired products so we will have a more comprehensive suite of wound care products. We believe acquiring a product with established sales channels would also help us market our existing products. In evaluating potential acquisition targets, we are looking for technology platforms which enhance our current products, have revenue associated with the technology where possible, and have a strong value proposition in today&#8217;s health care climate. In addition to expanding our product offerings through licenses and acquisitions, we also intend to modify our existing products through the expansion of customer options (e.g. additional offerings in different sizes and shapes). As our products, with the exception of the ECM suite, are already cleared by the FDA, we believe that these types of modifications can be made with minor regulatory delay. We believe that these improvements and additional options will enhance our reputation and potentially attract new customers.

&#160;

&#160; Industry and Markets 

&#160; 

According to medical market research firm BioMedGPS, LLC SmartTRAK&#8482; data, the U.S. market for wound care management products, which had revenues of approximately $5.9 billion in 2015, is expected to grow to $7.4 billion by 2019, which is a compound annual growth rate of 5% for 2015 to 2019. Growth in the U.S. wound care market will likely come from new therapies that result in decreasing healing times and subsequent cost savings and a growing focus on special populations such as diabetics and the obese.

&#160;

We intend to target five specific markets within the wound care industry:

&#160;

&#9679; Diabetic Ulcers . According to the National Diabetes Clearinghouse (&#8220;National Diabetes Fact Sheet, 2014&#8221; available at www.cdc.gov), there are over 29 million diabetics in the U.S., or more than 9.3% of the U.S. population. Almost 11.2 million people over the age of 65 are diabetic, which equates to almost 26% of all people in this age group. Furthermore, more than 60% of nontraumatic lower-limb amputations occur in people with diabetes. A study published by Wild, et. al. ( Diabetes Care , May 2004) estimates that the worldwide number of diabetics is projected to be 366 million people by the year 2030. Boulton, et. al. (&#8220;Neuropathic Diabetic Foot Ulcers,&#8221; New England Journal of Medicine , July 2004) reported that diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) develop in approximately 15% of patients with diabetes and precede 84% of all diabetes-related lower leg amputations. We believe that our wound care products can aid in the healing of these diabetic foot ulcers, thereby lessening the need for amputation. &#160;

&#9679; Pressure Ulcers . Dorner, et. al. (&#8220;The Role of Nutrition in Pressure Ulcer Prevention and Treatment,&#8221; The National Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel , 2009) stated that according to The Joint Commission, more than 2.5 million patients in U.S. acute-care facilities suffer from pressure ulcers. Dorner, et. al. also stated that the prevalence of pressure ulcers in the U.S. is widespread in all settings, with estimates of 10% to 18% in acute care and 2.3% to 28% in long-term care. The study further noted that these pressure ulcers can reduce overall quality of life and may also contribute to premature mortality in some patients, therefore any intervention that may help to prevent or treat them once they occur is important to reduce the cost of pressure ulcer care and improve the quality of life for affected individuals. Park-Lee, et. al. (&#8220;Pressure Ulcers Among Nursing Home Residents: United States, 2004,&#8221; The National Center for Health Statistics Data Brief , No. 14, February 2009) reported that 35% of nursing home residents with stage 2 or higher pressure ulcers received special wound care by specially trained professionals. We believe that our wound care products can aid in the treatment of pressure sores and ulcers, thereby increasing quality of life and decreasing the amount of time spent in wound care facilities. &#160;

6&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#9679; Venous Stasis Ulcers . These wounds are believed to occur due to improper functioning of venous valves, usually of the legs. According to the University of Washington Medical Center (available at www.uwmedicine.org/health-library/Pages/venous-stasis-ulcers.aspx), the main risk of venous stasis ulcers is the spread of infection from a persistent wound. Failure to address the condition appropriately could ultimately result in limb loss. As these ulcers are typically small, they are often undertreated, which leads to larger ulcers which require more complex treatments. Brem, et. al. (&#8220;Protocol for the Successful Treatment of Venous Ulcers,&#8221; American Journal of Surgery , July 2004) reported in one study that up to 48% of venous ulcers had recurred by the fifth year after healing. These often chronic ulcers affect up to 2.5 million U.S. citizens annually. We believe that our wound care products can aid in the treatment of venous stasis ulcers and increase the quality of life for those affected. &#160;

&#9679; Post-Surgical Dressings . The study entitled &#8220;Number, Rate, and Standard Error of All Listed Surgical and Non-surgical Procedures for Discharges from Short-stay Hospitals, by Selected Procedure Categories: United States, 2009&#8221; (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) reported that in 2009, an estimated 29 million surgical procedures were performed in the U.S. The New York Times (Sack, &#8220;Hospital Infection Problem Persists,&#8221; The New York Times , April 13, 2010) cited a report from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality in 2010 that the problem of hospital-acquired infections (&#8220;HAIs&#8221;) contributes to an estimated 100,000 deaths annually and concluded that the problem merited &#8220;urgent attention&#8221;. We believe that our wound care products can aid in the prevention of HAIs. In July 2013, we announced the results from a post-marketing study to assess surgical wound outcomes in patients who have undergone foot and ankle surgery. In this study, our SilverSeal dressing was shown to have a lower level of incision complications, including infection, and a greater reduction in scar length compared to standard petroleum-based dressings. &#160;

&#9679; Burns . According to the American Burn Association (&#8220;Burn Incidence and Treatment in the United States: 2015 Fact Sheet,&#8221; available at www.ameriburn.org/resources_factsheet.php ), an estimated 486,000 people with burn injuries receive medical treatment on an annual basis. If the burn is second degree or worse, medical attention may be required to reduce the risk of infection, dehydration and other potentially serious consequences. If the burn does result in hospitalization, we believe that our wound care products will benefit the healing process for the patient. &#160;

Sales and Marketing 

&#160; 

We continue to focus on sales and marketing efforts in the U.S. As of December 31, 2015, we had 43 employees dedicated to sales, all of whom have experience in the wound care industry. Additionally, we have developed an independent network of agents to sell our wound care products through our extensive channel reach through a network of distributors. In addition, we have assembled a Medical Advisory Board to help us target improvements and new applications for our products and assist in our marketing efforts. We also market our advanced wound care products at conferences, trade shows and other educational events.

&#160; &#160; 

Customers 

&#160;

One customer accounted for approximately 10% and 23% of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. This customer is a medical device manufacturer and a consumer of our contract manufacturing products. The decrease in this concentration is due to an increase in product revenue, which is consistent with our strategy. We expect that as revenues from the sales of our portfolio of advanced wound care solutions increases, this concentration will continue to abate in 2016.

&#160;

Proprietary Hydrogel Technologies and Manufacturing 

&#160;

Our hydrogels are manufactured by introducing a hydrophilic polymer into water to create a feed mix. The hydrophilic polymer has a tendency to mix with or dissolve in water. The feed mix is then coated onto a liner and exposed to radiation. The polymers we use, when exposed to radiation, cross-link faster than they degrade, creating a matrix that gives the gels a solid form. Active ingredients such as prescription or over-the-counter medication, skin care or wound-healing ingredients or other materials can be added before or after cross-linking. Materials that do not survive the irradiation process, or are modified by such process, may be added after the cross-linking process is completed. Once the products have been mixed and cross-linked, they form sheets that can either be delivered directly to customers or first cut and shaped according to customer or our specifications, as appropriate. We believe that many of the processes described above are proprietary to us and provide us with competitive advantages, including our production of a high quality product and our increased ability to customize products for customers.

&#160;

Proprietary Mixing. We believe that we are able to manufacture hydrogel feed mixes with far greater homogeneity than those of our competitors. This manufacturing advantage is critical, especially as it relates to dosages of active ingredients. In addition, our proprietary mixing technology allows for the incorporation of sensitive materials that may degrade if subjected to other types of mixing.

&#160;

Proprietary Coating. Our proprietary coating technology enables us to properly coat the gels even though the gels are extremely thick and resistant to flow. We have achieved coating tolerances that have allowed us to coat materials as thin as 0.005 of an inch with a margin for error of typically less than 5%. Thickness controls are critical with respect to the performance of many of the end products utilizing our hydrogels, including medical electrodes, transdermal delivery patches and cosmetic patches. We have also developed a coating methodology that minimizes imperfections such as wrinkling in the end product by significantly reducing line tension. We believe that our proprietary know-how allows us to manufacture high quality, consistent products which meet the standards of our customers.

&#160;

7&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Proprietary Cross-Linking Technology. We cross-link our hydrogels using an electron beam accelerator. Such cross-linking is achieved by introducing a high energy field, created by accelerated electrons, which causes the release of hydrogen atoms and causes carbon molecule covalent bonding. The creation of longer chains of the polymer in the gel increases its molecular integrity, giving the gel characteristics that make it useful in a variety of products.

&#160;

Our electron-beam cross-linking process is one of three types of cross-linking, that we are aware of, used in the industry. The other types used are ultra-violent cross-linking and chemical cross-linking. We believe that the benefits of electron beam cross-linking include:

&#160;

&#9679; allowing for precise control of the amount of polymer cross-linking; &#160;

&#9679; obviating the need for chemical cross-linking agents which may complicate or interfere with other additives or active ingredients; and &#160;

&#9679; providing the ability to manufacture high quality hydrogels on a consistent basis. &#160;

The cross-linking of hydrogels can be further modified by varying the percent of polymer cross-linking and the way in which the high energy field is delivered. There are three variables in the use of an electron beam accelerator for cross-linking of hydrogels:

&#160;

&#9679; time of exposure of the target material to the electron stream; &#160;

&#9679; voltage (electrical potential); and &#160;

&#9679; amperage (strength of the electrical current). &#160;

We believe that our proprietary methods of managing these three variables make it possible to produce high quality gels that can match a wide range of customer specifications.

&#160;

We own and operate a Radiation Dynamics, Inc. Dynamitron IEA 1500-40 Industrial Electron Accelerator, or RDI Accelerator. The RDI Accelerator has been customized to handle the cross-linking of the type of materials we use, but can also be used for several other potential uses such as coloring gemstones and treating wire, cable and tubing. The replacement cost of the RDI Accelerator and processing equipment is substantial. The delivery and installation process is time-consuming, with replacement estimated to take 2.5 to 3 years. We estimate that our equipment has a useful life of approximately 20 years and provides annual production capacity in excess of 6,000 hours. We believe that its current utilization is significantly less than capacity. We are also subject to state regulation with respect to electron beam radiation services and facilities. The expansion of our business into the manufacturing and distribution of our products for consumer use will subject us to additional governmental regulation.

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

There are several established silver-based wound dressings and other products which are already in the marketplace that compete with SilverSeal and TheraBond. These include Acticoat (sold by Smith &#38; Nephew), Aquacel Ag (sold by ConvaTec), and Silvercel (sold by Acelity). We believe that our low cost of sales will enable us to capture market share from our competitors.

&#160;

Leading competitors in the tissue-based wound care area that will compete with our biologic products include companies such MiMedx Group, LLC, Osiris, Organogenesis, Derma Sciences, as well as a significant number of smaller companies.

&#160;

Leading competitors of our sorbion products include Optilock (sold by Medline), Xtrasorb (sold by Derma Sciences), Drawtex (sold by Stead Med) and Enluxtra (sold by Osnovative Systems).

&#160;

We believe that MIST Therapy has no direct competition in the advanced wound care market. As a result, we believe that MIST Therapy may compete favorably on the basis of broad application. Notwithstanding this, we expect that many physicians and allied professionals to continue to employ other treatment approaches and technologies separately and in combination in an attempt to treat chronic and hard-to heal wounds.

&#160;

Our ability to establish sales in a market with many larger manufacturers may be difficult. We continue to recruit veterans of the medical device industry to leverage our product offerings into the most beneficial distribution channels. Our competitors may still have greater resources to support their products and may not allow us to take any market share from them.

&#160;

8&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Sources and Availability of Raw Materials; Principal Suppliers 

&#160;

In general, raw materials essential to our businesses are readily available from multiple sources. For reasons of quality assurance, availability, or cost effectiveness, certain components and raw materials are available only from a sole supplier. Our policy is to maintain sufficient inventory of components so that our production will not be significantly disrupted even if a particular component or material is not available for a period of time.

&#160;

Carolina Silver is the principal manufacturer utilized in production of our TheraBond dressings. Carolina Silver utilizes a proprietary and patented manufacturing process. Although we have not experienced significant production delays attributable to supply changes, we believe that developing alternative sources of supply used to make TheraBond would be difficult over a short period of time.

&#160;

We purchase MIST Therapy applicators and the saline bottles/bags included with each applicator from single sources. We purchase the UltraMist System from two suppliers. We and our suppliers purchase many of the components and raw materials in manufacturing the MIST products from numerous suppliers in various countries. We have been able to obtain adequate supplies of such raw materials and components and work closely with suppliers to try to ensure continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability.

&#160;

Under our Sorbion Agreement with BSN and our supply agreements with CCT, we receive finished goods from these parties. 

&#160;

The Dow Chemical Company and the BASF Corporation are the principal manufacturers of the two polymers, polyethylene oxide and polyvinylpyrrolidone, respectively, that we primarily use in the manufacture of hydrogels.

&#160;

Because we have no direct control over these suppliers, interruptions or delays in the products and services provided by these parties may be difficult to remedy in a timely fashion. In addition, if such suppliers are unable or unwilling to deliver the necessary products or raw materials, we may be unable to redesign or adapt our technology to work without such raw materials or products or find alternative suppliers or manufacturers. In such events, we could experience interruptions, delays, increased costs or quality control problems, or be unable to sell the applicable products, all of which could have a significant adverse impact on our revenue.

&#160;

Other than as discussed above, we believe that, due to the size and scale of production of our suppliers, there should be adequate supply of raw materials from our manufacturers.

&#160;

Patents, Proprietary Rights and Trademarks 

&#160;

We own or license a number of trademarks covering our company and our products. Our policy is to file patent applications to protect technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development of our business. We also rely upon trade secrets and continuing technological innovations to develop and maintain our competitive position.

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015 we owned 17 issued U.S. patents and 17 issued foreign patents covering aspects of our MIST Therapy platform. Specifically, our issued patents cover both medical and device aspects of wound care using non-contact ultrasound, as well as other clinical applications of non-contact ultrasound.

&#160;

Pursuant to the Sorbion Agreement, in connection with our exclusive rights to sell Sorbion sachet S, Sorbion sana and new products with hydrokinetic fibers as primary wound dressings, we have the right to use trademarks related to the Sorbion products for sale of the products in the applicable territory. The initial term of the agreement expires on December 31, 2018, unless earlier terminated pursuant to the termination rights under the agreement.

&#160;

In July 2011, we obtained from Noble Fiber Technologies, LLC an exclusive, worldwide license to use silver-coated fibers marketed under the trademarks X-Static&#174; and SilverSeal&#174; in our manufacture, sale, use and distribution of Hydrogel Wound Dressing identified in 510(k) K040019 and Hydrocolloid Wound Dressing identified in 510(k) K033900. We have an exclusive license until July 2021 with an option to extend for consecutive renewal periods of two years after the initial term.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

In November 2013, we entered into a license, marketing and development agreement with CCT, as subsequently amended on each of September 30, 2014 and May 5, 2015, pursuant to which we hold an exclusive, royalty-bearing license in CCT&#8217;s intellectual property related to certain placental based products, including ECM, CTM and Biovance, to develop and commercialize these products in the United States. The development and application of the intellectual property covered under the license agreement is managed by a joint steering committee, composed of members of us and CCT. Following the commencement of commercial sales of each licensed product, the license agreement requires us to pay CCT certain annual license fees, royalty payments based on a percentage of net sales as well as financial and performance milestone payments, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the license agreement. The initial term of the license agreement expires on November 14, 2023, unless sooner terminated pursuant to the termination rights under the license agreement, and will automatically renew for additional two-year periods unless either party gives written notice within a specified period prior to the end of a term. The license agreement may be terminated (i) by CCT if we or any of our affiliates challenges the validity, enforceability or scope of certain enumerated CCT patents anywhere in the world; (ii) by either party if there is a final decree that a licensed product infringed on the intellectual property of a third party; (iii) by either party for breach and failure to cure such breach of the license agreement; or (iv) by either party if the other party is the subject of insolvency proceedings, either voluntary or involuntary. In addition, the license agreement is terminable on a product-by-product basis, and not with respect to the entire license agreement (i) by CCT if we fail to meet certain minimum sales thresholds for the second year of commercial sales, and by either CCT or us if we fail to meet certain minimum sales thresholds for the third or any subsequent year of commercial sales and (ii) by either party upon written notice if outside legal counsel recommends discontinuance of commercialization of a product because of significant safety, legal, or economic risk as a result of a claim, demand or action or as a result of a change in the interpretation of law by a governmental or regulatory authority.

&#160;

Government Regulation 

&#160;

Product Regulation. Under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, medical devices are classified by the FDA into one of three classes&#8212;Class I, Class II or Class III&#8212;depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of control needed to ensure safety and effectiveness. While some applications of hydrogels fall under the jurisdiction of the FDA, hydrogels are generally classified as Class I exempt devices and the majority of the hydrogel products that we manufacture are thereby exempt from the FDA filing of any regulatory submissions and/or pre-market notification requirements. To the extent that any FDA regulatory submissions are required, we will be required to file these submissions and maintain all appropriate documentation. With respect to registering the manufacturing facility with the FDA under the Code of Federal Regulations, 21 CFR 820.1, Scope: Part A, it is stated that the regulation does not apply to manufacturers of component parts of finished devices. Currently, hydrogels are sold as component parts to various medical device/cosmetic manufacturers.

&#160;

We believe that a number of products that our partners are developing will be classified in the US as either Class I or Class II medical devices or Human Cells, Tissues, and Cellular and Tissue-Based Products (HCT/Ps). Class I medical devices are subject to the FDA&#8217;s general controls, which include compliance with the applicable portions of the FDA&#8217;s Quality System Regulation, facility registration and product listing, reporting of adverse medical events, and appropriate, truthful and non-misleading labeling, advertising, and promotional materials. Class II devices are subject to the FDA&#8217;s general controls and may also be subject to other special controls as deemed necessary by the FDA to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device. Most Class II devices require pre-market clearance by the FDA through the 510(k) pre-market notification process. When a 510(k) is required, the manufacturer must submit to the FDA a pre-market notification demonstrating that the device is &#8220;substantially equivalent&#8221; to either a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976, the date upon which the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 were enacted, or to another commercially available, similar device which was subsequently cleared through the 510(k) process. By regulation, the FDA is required to clear a 510(k) within 90 days of submission of the application. As a practical matter, clearance often takes longer. HCT/Ps that are regulated under 21 Code of Federal Regulations Part 1271 and Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act (&#8220;361 HCT/Ps&#8221;) and do not require FDA approval or clearance prior to marketing. We are required to follow Good Tissue Practices (GTP) including registration as a storage/distribution facility as well as track the tissue products from receipt to final disposition.

&#160;

Biovance and CTM are products derived from human tissue. The FDA has specific regulations governing HCT/Ps. An HCT/P is a product containing or consisting of human cells or tissue intended for transplantation into humans. HCT/Ps that meet the criteria for regulation solely under Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act and 21 CFR 1271 (361 HCT/Ps) are not subject to pre-market clearance or approval requirements, but are subject to post-market regulatory requirements. To be a 361 HCT/P, a product must meet all four of the following criteria:

&#160;

&#168; It must be minimally manipulated; &#160;

&#168; It must be intended for homologous use; &#160;

&#168; It must not be combined with another article; and &#160;

&#168; It must not have a systemic effect and not be dependent upon the metabolic activity of living cells for its primary function. &#160;

We and CCT believe that Biovance and CTM qualify as a 361 HCT/P. The FDA is in the process of clarifying definitions of homologous use and minimal manipulation in their Guidance for Industry publications.

&#160;

The FDA has broad post-market regulatory and enforcement powers with respect to medical devices, similar to those for pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. medical device regulatory requirements could result in, among other things, warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees, civil penalties, repairs, replacements, refunds, recalls or seizures of products, total or partial suspension of production, the FDA&#8217;s refusal to grant future pre-market clearances or approvals, withdrawals or suspensions of current product applications, and criminal prosecution. Similarly, the FDA may audit any facility with a registered 361 HCT/P.

&#160;

10&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

If there are any modifications to an approved device such as our Hydrogel Wound Dressing identified in 510(k) K040019 and Hydrocolloid Wound Dressing identified in 510(k) K033900, including changes in indication, manufacturing process or labeling or a change in a manufacturing facility, an applicant must notify the FDA, and in many cases, approval for such changes must be submitted to the FDA. Additionally, the FDA regulates post-approval promotional labeling and advertising activities to assure that such activities are being conducted in conformity with statutory and regulatory requirements. These regulations include standards or restrictions for direct-to-consumer advertising, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, promotional activities and off-label promotion. Likewise, labeling and advertising of HCT/Ps may be monitored for indication language to be consistent with homologous use. While physicians may prescribe for off-label uses, manufacturers may only promote for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label (or homologous use). The FDA has very broad enforcement authority under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, and failure to abide by these regulations can result in enforcement action, including the issuance of warning letters directing entities to correct deviations from FDA regulations and civil and criminal investigations and prosecutions. These activities could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

&#160; &#160; 

Quality Assurance Requirements . The FDA enforces regulations to ensure that the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture, processing, packing and holding of drugs, medical devices and/or HCT/Ps conform with current good manufacturing (GMP) and/or tissue practices (GTP). The current GMP regulations the FDA enforces are comprehensive and cover all aspects of manufacturing operations, from receipt of raw materials to finished product distribution, insofar as they bear upon whether drugs meet all the identity, strength, quality and purity characteristics required of them. The current GMP regulations for devices, called the Quality System Regulation, are also comprehensive and cover all aspects of device manufacture, from pre-production design validation to installation and servicing, insofar as they bear upon the safe and effective use of the device and whether the device otherwise meets the requirements of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. GTPs are narrower in scope than GMPs. GTP requires a quality program to prevent, detect, and correct deficiencies that could increase communicable disease risk. To assure compliance requires a continuous commitment of time, money and effort in all operational areas.

&#160;

The FDA also conducts periodic inspections of drug, device and registered HCT/P facilities to assess their current GMP/GTP status. If the FDA were to find serious non-compliant manufacturing or processing practices during such an inspection, it could take regulatory actions that could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. With respect to domestic establishments, the FDA could initiate product seizures or in some instances require product recalls and seek to enjoin a product&#8217;s manufacture and distribution. In certain circumstances, violations could support civil penalties and criminal prosecutions. In addition, if the FDA concludes that a company is not in compliance with current good manufacturing practices requirements, sanctions may be imposed that include preventing that company from receiving the necessary licenses to export its products and classifying that company as an &#8220;unacceptable supplier&#8221;, thereby disqualifying that company from selling products to federal agencies.

&#160;

We believe that we and our suppliers and outside manufacturers are currently in compliance with current good manufacturing practices requirements. We are currently registered as a device manufacturer and human tissue distributor with the FDA and we intend to register as a drug facility with the FDA when we are required to do so.

&#160; 

Third-Party Reimbursement 

&#160;

In the United States as well as in foreign countries, sales of our products depends in significant part on the availability of reimbursement from third-party payers. In the U.S. third-party payers consist of government programs such as Medicare, private health insurance plans, managed care organizations and other similar programs. For any product, three factors are critical to reimbursement:

&#160;

&#183; coding, which ensures uniform description of procedures, diagnoses and medical products; &#160;

&#183; coverage, which is the payer&#8217;s policy describing the clinical circumstances under which it will pay for a given treatment; and &#160;

&#183; payment process and amounts. &#160;

We believe the availability, as of January 2014, of a Category I CPT code for MIST Therapy has encouraged and will continue to encourage, broader coverage and subsequent use of its MIST Therapy System in the United States. Previously, MIST Therapy was billed under a temporary Category III CPT code, which some payers generally refuse to cover. Each government and private payer, however, makes its own coverage decision.

&#160;

Access to MIST Therapy is available to Medicare beneficiaries in 46 states. Although private payers will often pay for MIST Therapy when medically necessary and pre-approved, we have not focused on securing private payer coverage decisions for MIST Therapy.

&#160;

For Medicare-covered patients who are commonly treated in a hospital outpatient department, the payment system is called the Outpatient Prospective Payment System. The facility payment for MIST Therapy is billed under the CPT Code and then categorized for payment under a single Ambulatory payment (&#8220;APC&#8221;). Each hospital has a specific APC payment based on the hospital&#8217;s wage index for their geographic location.

&#160;

11&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

If MIST Therapy is delivered by a physician, non-physician practitioner, or physical therapist, a professional payment may be based on the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule (&#8220;MPFS&#8221;). The MPFS includes both a facility, and, for treatment delivered in a physician&#8217;s office a non-facility rate. The actual amount will vary by location per the geographic practice cost index adjustment to the national rate. Therapy services are typically paid under the non-facility MPFS payment rate pursuant to Medicare guidelines.

&#160;

Biovance is currently marketed in hospitals where Diagnosis Related Group Procedures are performed, in the Veteran&#8217;s Affairs health system, and in hospital outpatient departments as well as Physician offices or other outpatient care centers. Providers of outpatient services will be reimbursed for Biovance by Medicare where there is a local coverage determination by the prevailing Medicare Administrative Contractor (&#8220;MAC&#8221;). On October 31, 2014, Biovance was assigned a new and unique, Level II Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System product reimbursement Q code (Q4154) by Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (&#8220;CMS&#8221;). The new reimbursement code took effect on January 1, 2015. We currently have reimbursement coverage for Biovance from three of the eight MACs, so customers get reimbursed for Biovance used to treat Medicare beneficiaries in outpatient settings in 25 states.

&#160;

We have the Healthcare Common Procedural Coding System, or HCPCS, codes, from the Pricing, Data, Analysis, and Coding contractor for CMS, for use when billing for our wound care dressings. HCPCS was established in 1978 to provide a standardized coding system for describing the specific items and services provided in the delivery of health care. HCPCS codes are used by Medicare and monitored by the CMS. They are based on the Current Procedural Technology codes developed by the American Medical Association. We believe that these codes will facilitate reimbursement for the use of our dressings in Medicare patients with applicable wounds.

&#160;

Environmental Regulation. We are subject to various laws and governmental regulations concerning environmental matters and employee safety and health in the U.S. and other countries. We have made, and continue to make, significant investments to comply with these laws and regulations. We cannot predict the future capital expenditures or operating costs required to comply with environmental laws and regulations. We believe that we are currently compliant with applicable environmental, health and safety requirements in all material respects. However, we cannot assure you that current or future regulatory, governmental, or private action will not have a material adverse effect on our performance, results or financial condition.

&#160;

In the future, if a loss contingency related to environmental matters, employee safety, health or conditional asset retirement obligations is recognized, we would record a liability for the obligation and it may result in a material impact on net income for the annual or interim period during which the liability is recorded. The investigation and remediation of environmental obligations generally occur over an extended period of time, and therefore we do not know if these events would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity, or cash flow, nor can we assure you that such liabilities would not have a material adverse effect on our performance, results or financial condition.

&#160;

Federal and State Anti-kickback, Self-referral, False Claims and Similar Laws. Our relationships with physicians, hospitals and the marketers of our products are subject to scrutiny under various federal anti-kickback, self-referral, false claims and similar laws, often referred to collectively as healthcare fraud and abuse laws. Healthcare fraud and abuse laws are complex, and even minor, inadvertent violations can give rise to claims that the relevant law has been violated. Certain states have similar fraud and abuse laws, imposing substantial penalties for violations. Any government investigation or a finding of a violation of these laws would likely result in a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock, as well as our business, financial condition and results of operations. We believe that we are currently compliant with applicable anti-kickback, self-referral, false claims in all material respects.

&#160;

Research and Development Costs 

&#160;

For the year ended December 31, 2015, we incurred research and development costs of approximately $715,000 related to a randomized controlled trial for our Biovance product in chronic diabetic foot wounds. For the year ended December 31, 2014, we incurred no research and development costs. We bear our own research and development costs and do not directly pass along our research and development costs to our customers.

&#160;

We intend to commit capital resources to research and development only as our cash resources allow. We have incurred all cost associated with the launch of our proprietary products and will only require research and development expenses for product enhancements and modifications, which we do not expect to be significant.

&#160;

Employees 

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015 we had 87 full-time employees. Of these employees, 66 are involved with finance, sales, marketing, and administration and 21 are involved with manufacturing, clinical and regulatory matters. Our employees are not represented by a labor union or other collective bargaining groups, and we consider relations with our employees to be good. We currently plan to retain and utilize the services of outside consultants for additional research, testing, regulatory, legal compliance and other services on an as needed basis.
