 ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS 

&#160; 

Overview 

&#160; 

DigiPath, Inc. was incorporated in Nevada on October 5, 2010. DigiPath, Inc. and its subsidiaries (&#8220;DigiPath,&#8221; the &#8220;Company,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;our&#8221; or &#8220;us&#8221;) supports the cannabis industry&#8217;s best practices for reliable testing, cannabis education and training, and brings unbiased cannabis news coverage to the cannabis industry. Our three business units as of September 30, 2015, which were all wholly-owned subsidiaries of DigiPath, Inc. as of such date, are described below. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#216; DigiPath Labs, Inc . plans to set the industry standard for testing all forms of cannabis-based products using FDA-compliant laboratory equipment and processes to report product safety and efficacy. In May of 2015, we opened our first testing lab in Nevada and have plans to open labs in other legal states. Our customers were not fully operational at the time of our lab opening. As a result, our lab revenues were minimal prior to September 30, 2015. &#160; &#216; The National Marijuana News Corp . provides a balanced and unbiased approach to cannabis news with a news/talk radio show and national marijuana news website focusing on the political, economic, medicinal, scientific, and cultural dimensions of the rapidly evolving&#8212;and profoundly controversial&#8212;medicinal and recreational marijuana industry. &#160; &#216; DigiPath Corp . develops digital pathology systems to create, store, manage, analyze and correlate data collected through virtual microscopy for plant and cell based industries. We divested two-thirds of this entity subsequent to year-end, and now own a minority interest of 33.34%. The historical income and loss of the deconsolidated entity have been presented as a discontinued business component in the financial statements herein. &#160; 

Recent Developments 

&#160; 

Divestiture of Wholly-Owned Subsidiary, DigiPath Corp. 

&#160; 

On October 1, 2015, DigiPath, Inc., entered into an Omnibus Agreement and Amendment (the &#8220;Agreement&#8221;) with DigiPath Corp., and our former Director, Steven D. Barbee. Pursuant to the Agreement, among other things: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; The exercise price of the warrant held by Mr. Barbee to purchase 3,000,000 shares of common stock of DigiPath Corp. (the &#8220;Barbee Warrant&#8221;) was reduced from $0.10 per share to $0.0333333 per share, and Mr. Barbee subsequently exercised the warrant. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Mr. Barbee resigned as a director of the Company. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; The Consulting, Confidentiality and Proprietary Rights Agreement, dated as of May 30, 2014, between the Company and Mr. Barbee, as amended, was terminated. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Indebtedness of approximately $18,000 owed by the Company to DigiPath Corp. was cancelled. &#160; 

&#160; &#160; &#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; DigiPath Corp. was provided with the right to require the Company to change its name so as not to include the name &#8220;DigiPath&#8221; in the event of the sale of all or substantially all of the assets or capital stock of DigiPath Corp., or a merger of DigiPath Corp. following which the Company ceases to be a shareholder of DigiPath Corp., in each case, that occurs within 12 months following the date of the Agreement. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; The Company, as a shareholder of DigiPath Corp, was provided with (i) rights of first-refusal and co-sale rights with respect to sales of common stock of DigiPath Corp by Barbee, and (ii) pre-emptive rights with respect to issuances of common stock by DigiPath Corp. &#160; 

Concurrently with the execution of the Agreement, DigiPath Corp. agreed to issue 3,000,000 shares of its common stock to a third party for an aggregate purchase price of $100,000, and an affiliate of such party agreed to surrender 60,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock of the Company for cancellation, and terminate a previously held warrant to purchase 3,000,000 shares of common stock of DigiPath Corp. As a result of such issuance of shares of DigiPath Corp. common stock, and after giving effect to the exercise of the Barbee Warrant, the Company continued to hold approximately 34% of the outstanding shares of common stock of DigiPath Corp. Following the execution of the Agreement, Mr. Barbee continued to serve as the President and sole director of DigiPath Corp. 

&#160; 

Business 

&#160; 

DigiPath Labs, Inc. - Cannabis Testing 

&#160; 

Our cannabis testing business is operated through our wholly owned subsidiary, DigiPath Labs, Inc., which performs all cannabis related testing using FDA-compliant laboratory equipment and processes. We opened our first testing lab in Las Vegas, Nevada in May of 2015 to serve the new State approved and licensed medical marijuana industry. We have plans to open labs in other legal states, assuming resources permit. 

&#160; 

We seek to be the nation&#8217;s highest standard, full-service testing lab for cannabis and ancillary cannabis infused products. We are a third party independent testing laboratory facility for cannabis, cannabis infused products and other botanical nutraceuticals to serve growers, dispensaries, caregivers and all end users of cannabis and botanical products. 

&#160; 

Our mission is to provide pharmaceutical-grade analysis and testing to the cannabis industry to ensure consumers and patients know exactly what is in the cannabis they ingest and to help maximize the quality of our client&#8217;s products through research, development and standardization. 

&#160; 

As a premier cannabis testing laboratory, we take a careful, strategic approach to all of our cannabis testing. A diverse array of tests combined with our lab equipment and analytical instrumentation enable us to accurately test cannabis for potency, the presence of pesticides, or microbial contamination. DigiPath Labs takes further caution by also testing for metals and heavy metals, which include, but are not limited to, substances like arsenic, cadmium, lead, or mercury. Not only is testing for potency and Cannabidiol (&#8220;CBD&#8221;) and tetrahydrocannabinol (&#8220;THC&#8221;) content important, we recognize that more profound testing is needed particularly as a true national standard is developed. DigiPath Labs is committed to follow Food and Drug Administration (&#8220;FDA&#8221;), Drug Enforcement Agency (&#8220;DEA&#8221;), Environmental Protection Agency (&#8220;EPA&#8221;), US Department of Agriculture (&#8220;USDA&#8221;) guidelines, standard operating procedures (&#8220;SOP&#8221;), and Good Lab Practices (&#8220;GLP&#8221;) that are in line with current Federal and State governing bodies. We utilize a variety of tests to safely and effectively share enhanced understanding of the cannabis plant with caregivers, dispensaries and patients. We are committed to the advancement of science by offering a method of standardization for cannabis that is more intricate and accurate than any other. This approach and investment in the highest quality testing machinery is of the utmost importance as many testing labs often return inconsistent results for the exact same test sample; a common concern of many end-users and clients alike. 

&#160; 

DigiPath Labs screens medicinal cannabis for potentially harmful contaminants, including: 

-- Solvents (for extracts) 

-- Pesticides 

-- Mold and Yeast 

-- Heavy metals, including mercury, arsenic, lead, and cadmium 

-- Biological toxins, such as aflatoxin, ricin, and botulinum toxins 

-- Microbial contaminants including E. coli, salmonella, Aspergillus and fungus 

&#160; 

DigiPath Labs also tests cannabis for its quality, potency, and cannabinoid and terpene profiles, which determine the suitability of specific cannabis strains for the treatment of specific ailments. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#160; &#160; 

&#160; 

We utilize our own Ultra-High Performance Liquid Chromatograph (&#8220;UPLC&#8221;), which accurately separates and measures the cannabinoid content of any sample of flower, edible, concentrate or other cannabis product. Our Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (&#8220;ICP-MS&#8221;) is utilized for heavy metals testing, and provides accurate readings for harmful metals ensuring that the Parts Per Million (&#8220;PPM&#8221;) are substantially below the regulated and accepted trace amounts. Our laboratory testing equipment is calibrated using third party reference standards to ensure precision measurements throughout the testing process. 

&#160; 

With accurate science becoming a major part of the cannabis industry, the major question is one of standards; we hold ourselves accountable and provide efficient and accurate research and results to our clients. Our test results are meant to help dispensaries, caregivers and patients know the concentration and quality of their cannabis without having to question the credibility of the data. 

&#160; 

Market Overview 

&#160; 

According to the Marijuana Business Daily, &#8220;U.S. retail cannabis sales will rise more than five-fold over the next five years, from an estimated $2.2-$2.6 billion in 2014 to $7.4-$8.2 billion in 2018. As the cannabis industry expands, we expect to see a parallel increase in state regulations related to the testing and disclosure of cannabis and cannabis related products. We believe that there will be a strong demand for qualified laboratories to perform such testing, both to assist producers of cannabis and cannabis products to meet expected state mandated requirements, and to provide assurance to consumers regarding the safety and composition of such products. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

The cannabis industry in the United States is highly fragmented, rapidly expanding and evolving. The industry is characterized by new and potentially disruptive or conflicting legislation promulgated on a state-by-state basis. Our competitors may be local or international enterprises and may have financial, technical, sales, marketing and other resources greater than ours. These companies may also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified personnel and consultants. 

&#160; 

Our competitive position will depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified scientists and other personnel, develop effective proprietary products and solutions, the personal relationships of our executive officers and directors, and our ability to secure adequate capital resources. We compete to attract and retain customers of our services. We expect to compete in this area on the basis of price, regulatory compliance, vendor relationships, usefulness, availability, excellent customer service and ease of use of our services. 

&#160; 

Government Regulation 

&#160; 

Marijuana is categorized as a Schedule I controlled substance by the Drug Enforcement Agency and the United States Department of Justice and is illegal to grow, possess and consume under Federal law. A Schedule I controlled substance is defined as a substance that has no currently accepted medical use in the United States, a lack of safety for use under medical supervision and a high potential for abuse. The Department of Justice defines Schedule 1 controlled substances as &#8220;the most dangerous drugs of all the drug schedules with potentially severe psychological or physical dependence.&#8221; However, since 1995, 23 states and the District of Columbia have passed state laws that permit doctors to recommend prescribing cannabis for medical-use and four states, Colorado, Oregon, Alaska and Washington, have enacted laws that legalize the adult-use of cannabis for any reason. This has created an unpredictable business-environment for dispensaries and collectives that legally operate under state-laws but in violation of Federal law. On August 29, 2013, United States Deputy Attorney General James Cole issued the Cole Memo to United States Attorneys guiding them to prioritize enforcement of Federal law away from the cannabis industry operating as permitted under state law, so long as: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; cannabis is not being distributed to minors and dispensaries are not located around schools and public buildings; &#160; &#9679; the proceeds from sales are not going to gangs, cartels or criminal enterprises; &#160; &#9679; cannabis grown in states where it is legal is not being diverted to other states; &#160; &#9679; cannabis-related businesses are not being used as a cover for sales of other illegal drugs or illegal activity; &#160; &#9679; there is not any violence or use of fire-arms in the cultivation and sale of marijuana; &#160; &#9679; there is strict enforcement of drugged-driving laws and adequate prevention of adverse health consequences; and &#160; &#9679; cannabis is not grown, used, or possessed on Federal properties. &#160; 

The Cole Memo is meant only as a guide for United States Attorneys and does not alter in any way the Department of Justice&#8217;s Federal authority to enforce Federal law, including Federal laws relating to cannabis, regardless of state law. We believe we are operating in compliance with the &#8220;Cole Memo&#8221;. However, we cannot provide assurance that our actions are in full compliance with the Cole Memo or any other laws or regulations. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#160; &#160; 

&#160; 

The current administration has effectively stated that it is not an efficient use of resources to direct federal law enforcement agencies to prosecute those lawfully abiding by state-designated laws allowing the use and distribution of medical marijuana. However, there is no guarantee that the administration will not change its stated policy regarding the low-priority enforcement of federal laws. Additionally, any new administration that follows could change this policy and decide to vigorously enforce the existing federal laws. Any such change in the federal government&#8217;s enforcement of current federal laws could cause significant financial damage to us. While we do not intend to harvest, distribute or sell cannabis, we would be irreparably harmed by a change in enforcement by the Federal or State governments. 

&#160; 

The National Marijuana News Corp. &#8211; Cannabis News 

&#160; 

In May 2014, we established an online radio program called The National Marijuana News (&#8220;TNMNews&#8221;). TNMNews seeks to educate the public regarding the political, economic, medicinal, scientific, and cultural dimensions of the rapidly evolving and controversial medicinal and recreational marijuana industry from diverse and dissenting perspectives. We intend to expand our already strong web presence as &#8220;THE&#8221; destination for unbiased news and information on everything marijuana. As we expand TNMNews, we hope to increase advertising revenue and continue to provide a platform for our products and services. 

&#160; 

TNMNews is a weekly one-hour Internet radio news and talk show featuring unbiased reporting of the burgeoning marijuana industry. Although leaning more towards a medicinal use platform, the show seeks to foster thought-provoking discussion of both the medicinal and recreational marijuana markets. 

&#160; 

We launched TNMNews&#8217; Internet radio program on Live 365 in 2014, and its popularity has continued to grow. Over the fiscal year, streaming of our program grew from 120,000 to over 190,000 streams per month. TNMNews is also available on terrestrial radio in six cities around the US. We also launched our App for both iOS and Google Play and relaunched our website which now receives over 400,000 page visits per month. Our Facebook page has also garnered over 124,000 page likes and TNMNews has become a leader in cannabis news, interviews and education. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

TNMNews faces competition from traditional news media as well as new publications and web sites devoted to cannabis use. However, most marijuana-themed internet radio shows are pro-cannabis and appeal to the recreational user. In contrast, we are pioneering a new path down the middle by presenting both sides of marijuana issues in a professional and unbiased format. Major media players are hopping on the marijuana bandwagon. Local publications like the Denver Post and the San Francisco Chronicle have dedicated space to cannabis coverage. The Huffington Post and many of the other major daily newspapers cover cannabis news. MSNBC, CNN, and truTV are developing series around cannabis. We believe that increasing public interest in this topic ensures we will have an audience and be able to attract paid advertisers. 

&#160; 

Government Regulation 

&#160; 

The following is a brief summary of certain statutes, regulations, policies and proposals affecting our media business. For example, radio broadcasting is subject to the jurisdiction of the FCC under the Communications Act. This does not comprehensively cover all current and proposed statutes, regulations and policies affecting our media and business. Reference should be made to the Communications Act and other relevant statutes, regulations, policies and proceedings for further information concerning the nature and extent of regulation of our media business. Finally, several of the following matters are now, or may become, the subject of court litigation, and we cannot predict the outcome of any such litigation or its impact on our media business. 

&#160; 

Federal law regulates the broadcast of obscene, indecent or profane material. Legislation enacted by Congress provides the FCC with authority to impose fines of up to $325,000 per utterance with a cap of $3.0 million for any violation arising from a single act. In June 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled on the appeals of several FCC indecency enforcement actions. While setting aside the particular FCC actions under review on narrow due process grounds, the Supreme Court declined to rule on the constitutionality of the FCC&#8217;s indecency policies, and the FCC has since solicited public comment on those policies. We may receive in the future, letters of inquiry and other notifications from the FCC concerning complaints that programming contains indecent or profane language. We cannot predict the outcome of our outstanding letters of inquiry and notifications from the FCC or the nature or extent of future FCC indecency enforcement actions. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#160; &#160; 

&#160; 

DigiPath Corp. &#8211; Digital Pathology 

&#160; 

On October 1, 2015, we entered into agreements that facilitated the divestiture of two-thirds of our ownership interest in DigiPath Corp., which enabled warrant holders, including our former Director, Steven D. Barbee, to acquire two-thirds ownership in DigiPath Corp. The reduction in ownership required that we deconsolidate the entity in our financial statements for all periods presented. As a result, the results of operations of this business have been removed from the results of continuing operations for all periods presented within our statements of operations, and DigiPath Corp. is now accounted for using the equity method of accounting. We believe that this divestiture will allow us to better focus our efforts on our cannabis-related businesses. 

&#160; 

DigiPath Corp. develops and sells digital pathology solutions for second opinion, consultation, tumor board, archiving, and educational purposes for improved workflow, analysis and data mining in support of pathology in academic medical centers, reference laboratories, biopharma organizations, and life science research institutions. 

&#160; 

DigiPath Corp. offers a suite of hardware, software and cloud-based solutions to create, share, store, manage, analyze and correlate data collected through virtual microscopy. Its products are marketed under the names PathScope&#8482;, PathLive&#8482;, PathPlant&#8482;, PathCloud&#8482;, PathReview&#8482;, PathConsult&#8482;, PathIA&#8482;, and PathStore&#8482;. 

&#160; 

Customers 

&#160; 

We provide cannabis lab testing services in Las Vegas to Nevada licensed Medical Marijuana Enterprises (&#8220;MMEs&#8221;). We sell our services to these enterprises on a fixed fee per test or panel of tests, and offer a discounted price for customers that agree to enter into exclusive long term contracts. On June 17, 2014, Clark County approved a total of 117 special use permits to cultivation and 87 production applicants. There may be some cross-over applicants in this total whereby an applicant was awarded both a cultivation and production permit, and some of these applicants will undoubtedly not be able to commence operations and will lose their permits, but this is generally our pool of customers, along with additional permit holders in the Cities of Las Vegas and North Las Vegas. As of January 1, 2016, there were a total of 16 MMEs in the cultivation or production business that are currently operating, and we have provided services to 10 of them. We anticipate a steady stream of new Nevada MMEs to become operational and licensed throughout 2016, which should result in additional customers for Digipath Labs. 

&#160; 

Research and Development 

&#160; 

We believe that our future success will be impacted by our ability to continue to enhance and broaden our services to meet the evolving needs of a relatively newly regulated cannabis services industry. Our research and development efforts are focused on developing new, complementary solutions to streamline our processes and provide optimal services to both our customers and for regulators. 

&#160; 

When developing our technical solutions to provide cannabis testing solutions, industry regulatory requirements also dictate that substantial documentation be created to demonstrate data integrity. Our standard operating procedures include streamlined methodologies for generating and maintaining testing services that can be tailored to the variations in other State jurisdictions, as necessary. 

&#160; 

We expect to continue to invest in our businesses and to invest further as we expand our lab business for cannabis testing to other jurisdictions. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#160; &#160; 

&#160; 

Marketing, Sales and Support 

&#160; 

We use a range of communication platforms to reach our target customers. The goal of the marketing strategy is to position us as the leading testing company in the botanical, nutraceutical, and cannabis industries in the country. Our marketing efforts include digital/online, industry conferences and affiliations, media outreach, our own TNMNews, direct response and public relations. We believe that these efforts have the ability to deliver our brand message in a powerful way to maximize audience reach. 

&#160; 

Seasonality 

&#160; 

Our businesses are not subject to seasonality. 

&#160; 

Insurance 

&#160; 

We do not currently maintain property, business interruption and casualty insurance. We intend to obtain such insurance in accordance with customary industry practices when we have sufficient financial resources. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

As of September 30, 2015, we had nine employees. None of our employees are members of a trade union. We believe that we maintain good relationships with our employees, and have not experienced any strikes or shutdowns and have not been involved in any labor disputes. 

&#160;
