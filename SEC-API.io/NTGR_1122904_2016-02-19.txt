 Item 1. Business 

General 

We are a global networking company that delivers innovative products to consumers, businesses and service providers. Our business is managed in three specific business units: retail, commercial, and service provider. The retail business unit consists of high performance, dependable and easy-to-use home networking, home video security, storage and digital media products. The commercial business unit consists of business networking, storage and security solutions that bring enterprise class functionality down to small and medium-sized businesses at an affordable price. The service provider business unit consists of made-to-order and retail-proven whole home networking hardware and software solutions as well as 4G LTE hotspots sold to service providers for sale to their subscribers. We are organized into the following three geographic territories: Americas; Europe, Middle-East and Africa ("EMEA") and Asia Pacific ("APAC"). For further detail, refer to Note 12, Segment Information, Operations by Geographic Area and Customer Concentration , in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

We were incorporated in Delaware on January 8, 1996. Our principal executive offices are located at 350 East Plumeria Drive, San Jose, California 95134, and our telephone number at that location is (408) 907-8000. Our website address is www.netgear.com. 

In the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 , we generated net revenue of $1.30 billion , $1.39 billion , and $1.37 billion , respectively. 

Markets 

Our mission is to be the innovative leader in connecting the world to the Internet. This includes our goal of being the leading provider of innovative networking products to the consumer, business, and service provider markets. A number of factors are driving today's demand for networking products within these markets. As the number of Internet connected devices, such as smart phones, laptops, tablets, and Smart Home and Internet-of-thing devices increase, networks - especially WiFi networks - are being deployed more broadly in order to share information and resources among users and devices. This information and resource sharing occurs internally, through a local area network, or externally, via the Internet. To take advantage of complex applications, advanced communication capabilities and rich multimedia content, users are upgrading their Internet connections by deploying high-speed broadband access technologies. Users also seek the convenience and flexibility of operating their laptops, smart phones, tablets and related computing devices while accessing their content in a more mobile, or wireless, manner. In addition, market demand for Smart Home and Internet connected products has increased significantly, where users seek to connect their televisions, game consoles, HD streaming players, security cameras, thermostats, smoke detectors, etc. to the Internet. As a result, the speed, coverage range, and reliability of the in home WiFi network has become a higher priority among households. 

Consumers, businesses and service providers demand a complete set of wired and wireless networking and broadband products that are tailored to their specific needs and budgets, while incorporating the latest networking technologies. These users require the continual introduction of new and refined products and often lack extensive IT resources and technical knowledge. Therefore, they demand 'plug-and-play' or easy-to-install and use products that require little or no maintenance, and customer service and support. We believe that these users also prefer the convenience of obtaining a networking solution from a single company with whom they are familiar; as these users expand their networks, they tend to be loyal purchasers of that brand. In addition, purchasing decisions of users in these markets are also driven by the affordability of networking products. To provide reliable, easy-to-use products at an attractive price, we believe a successful supplier must have a company-wide focus on the unique requirements of these markets, operational discipline and cost-efficient infrastructure and processes that allow for efficient product development, manufacturing and distribution. 

Sales Channels 

We sell our products through multiple sales channels worldwide, including traditional retailers, online retailers, wholesale distributors, direct market resellers ("DMRs"), value-added resellers ("VARs"), and broadband service providers. 

Wholesale Distribution. &#32;Our distribution channel supplies our products to retailers, e-commerce resellers, DMRs, VARs and broadband service providers. We sell directly to our distributors, the largest of which are Ingram Micro, Inc., D&#38;H Distributing Company and Tech Data Corporation. 

Retailers. Our retail channel primarily supplies products that are sold into the consumer market. We sell directly to, or enter into consignment arrangements with, a number of our traditional and online retailers. The remaining traditional retailers, as well as our online retailers, are fulfilled through wholesale distributors. We work directly with our retail channels on market development activities, such as co-advertising, on-line promotions and video demonstrations, instant rebate programs, event sponsorship and sales associate training. Our largest retailers include Best Buy Co., Inc., Amazon.com, Inc. and their affiliates. 

DMRs and VARs. We sell into the commercial business marketplace through an extensive network of DMRs and VARs. Our DMRs include companies such as CDW and Insight. VARs include our network of registered NETGEAR Solution Partners, and resellers that are not registered in our NETGEAR Solution Partner program. DMRs and VARs may receive sales incentives, marketing support and other program benefits from us. Our DMRs and VARs generally purchase our products through our wholesale distributors. 

Broadband Service Providers. We also supply our products directly to broadband service providers in the United States and internationally providing cable, DSL and 4G LTE broadband. Service providers supply our products to their business and home subscribers. Our largest broadband service providers include Virgin Media Limited and AT&#38;T. 

The largest portion of our net revenues was derived from Americas sales in the year ended December 31, 2015 . Americas sales as a percentage of net revenue increased from 55.3% &#32;in the year ended December 31, 2014 &#32;to 61.4% &#32;in the year ended December 31, 2015 . We have continuously committed resources to our international operations and sales channels. Accordingly, we are subject to a number of risks related to international operations such as macroeconomic and microeconomic conditions, geopolitical instability, preference for locally branded products, exchange rate fluctuations, increased difficulty in managing inventory, challenges of staffing and managing foreign operations, the effect of international sales on our tax structure, and changes in local tax laws. See Note 12, Segment Information, Operations by Geographic Area and Customer Concentration , in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for further discussion of net revenue by geographic region. 

Best Buy Co., Inc. and Affiliates accounted for 15% of our net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 . None of our customers accounted for 10% or more of our net revenue for the years ended December 31, 2014 &#32;and 2013 . See Note 12, Segment Information, Operations by Geographic Area and Customer Concentration , in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for further details on customer concentrations.

We design our products to meet the specific needs of the consumer, business and service provider markets, tailoring various elements of the software interface, the product design, including component specification, physical characteristics such as casing, design and coloration, and specific user interface features to meet the needs of these markets. We also leverage many of our technological developments, high volume manufacturing, technical support and engineering infrastructure across our markets to maximize business efficiencies. 

Our products that target the business market are generally designed with an industrial appearance, including metal cases and, for some product categories, the ability to mount the product within standard data networking racks. These products typically include higher port counts, higher data transfer rates and other performance characteristics designed to meet the needs of a commercial business user. For example, we offer data transfer rates up to ten gigabits per second for our business products to meet the higher capacity requirements of business users. Some of these products are also designed to support transmission modes such as fiber optic cabling, which is common in more sophisticated business environments. Security requirements within our products for commercial business broadband access include firewall, virtual private network and content threat management capabilities that allow for secure interactions between remote offices and business headquarter locations over the Internet. Our connectivity product offerings for the commercial business market include enhanced security and remote configurability often required in a 

business setting. Our ReadyNAS &#174; family of network attached storage products implements redundant array of independent disks data protection, enabling businesses to store and protect critical data easily, efficiently and intelligently. 

Our vision for the home network is about intelligently controlling and monitoring all devices connected to the home network at all times, thus creating a Smart Home. Our focus is to continue to introduce new products into growth areas that form the basis of Smart Homes, such as: the fastest WiFi standards with broadest coverage via latest technology (802.11ac) WiFi routers and repeaters; home network storage products with an easy to use user interface and remote cloud access, higher capacity and resilience; high speed DOCSIS 3.0, xDSL and fiber gateways with more integrated functions; 4G LTE gateways and AirCard hotspots; and home security cameras and automation devices such as our Arlo Smart Home security cameras. We continue to announce and introduce new products in these growth markets. 

Our vision for the commercial network is about increased effectiveness and efficiency of the hybrid cloud access network. We believe small and medium-sized enterprises will continue to move into cloud-based applications, such as: Salesforce.com, Ring Central, LifeSize video conferencing, SuccessFactors, Workday, and others. In addition, we believe these enterprises will move into utility-like on demand computing power supplied by third party data centers. Also, increasingly more enterprises are enabling the BYOD (bring your own device) environment allowing smart phones, tablets, and netbooks to be the business computing devices of choice. These trends will place a greater demand on commercial networks. To meet this demand we are introducing next generation commercial products in rapid pace, such as: Power over Ethernet (PoE) switches, 10 gigabit Ethernet switches, high capacity local and remote unified storage, small to medium capacity campus wireless LAN, and security appliances. 

Competition 

The consumer, business and service provider markets are intensely competitive and subject to rapid technological change. We expect competition to continue to intensify. Our principal competitors include: 

&#8226; 

within the consumer markets, companies such as Apple, ASUS, Belkin/Linksys, Devolo, D-Link, Google, Logitech, Nest Labs (owned by Google), Samsung, Swann, Synology, TP Link, and Western Digital; 

&#8226; 

within the business markets, companies such as Allied Telesys, Barracuda, Buffalo, Cisco Systems, Dell, D-Link, Fortinet, Hewlett-Packard, Huawei, QNAP Systems, Seagate Technology, Synology, Ubiquity, WatchGuard and Western Digital; and 

&#8226; 

within the service provider markets, companies such as Actiontec, Arcadyan, ARRIS, AVM, Compal Broadband, D-Link, Hitron, Huawei, Novatel Wireless, Sagem, Scientific Atlanta (a Cisco Systems company), Sercomm, SMC Networks, TechniColor, TP-Link, Ubee, ZTE and ZyXEL. 

Our potential competitors include other consumer electronics vendors, including LG Electronics, Microsoft, Panasonic, Sony, Toshiba and Vizio, who could integrate networking and streaming capabilities into their line of products, such as televisions, set top boxes and gaming consoles, and our channel customers who may decide to offer self-branded networking products. We also face competition from service providers who bundle a free networking device with their broadband service offering, which would reduce our sales if we are not the supplier of choice to those service providers. In the service provider space, we also face significant and increased competition from original design manufacturers ("ODMs") and contract manufacturers ("CMs") who are selling and attempting to sell their products directly to service providers around the world. 

Many of our existing and potential competitors have longer operating histories, greater name recognition and substantially greater financial, technical, sales, marketing and other resources. As a result, they may have more advanced technology, larger distribution channels, stronger brand names, better customer service and access to more customers than we do. For example, Hewlett-Packard has significant brand name recognition and has an advertising presence substantially greater than ours. Similarly, Cisco Systems is well recognized as a leader in providing networking products to businesses and has substantially greater financial resources than we do. Several of our competitors, such as TP-Link, offer a range of products that directly compete with most of our product offerings. Several of our other competitors primarily compete in a more limited manner. For example, Hewlett-Packard sells networking products primarily targeted at larger businesses or enterprises. However, the competitive environment in which we operate changes rapidly. Other companies with significant resources could also become direct competitors, either through acquiring a competitor or through internal efforts. 

We believe that the principal competitive factors in the consumer, business and service provider markets for networking products include product breadth, size and scope of the sales channel, brand name, timeliness of new product introductions, product availability, performance, features, functionality and reliability, price, ease-of-installation, maintenance and use, and customer service and support. We believe our products are competitive in these markets based on these factors. 

To remain competitive, we must invest significant resources in developing new products and enhancing our current products while continuing to expand our sales channels and maintaining customer satisfaction worldwide. 

Research and Development 

As of December 31, 2015 , we had 337 &#32;employees engaged in research and development. Our success depends on our ability to develop products that meet changing user needs and to anticipate and proactively respond to evolving technology in a timely and cost-effective manner. Accordingly, we have made investments in our research and development department in order to effectively evaluate new third-party technologies, develop new in-house technologies, and develop and test new products. Our research and development employees work closely with our technology and manufacturing partners to bring our products to market in a timely, high quality and cost-efficient manner. 

We identify, qualify or self-develop new technologies, and we work closely with our various technology suppliers and manufacturing partners to develop products using one or more of the development methodologies described below. 

ODM. Under the ODM methodology, we define the product concept and specification and recommend the technology selection. We then coordinate with our technology suppliers while they develop the product meeting our specification. On certain new products, one or more subsystems of the design can be done in-house and then integrated with the remaining design pieces from the ODM. Once prototypes are completed, we work with our partners to complete the debugging and systems integration and testing. After completion of the final tests, agency approvals and product documentation, the product is released for production. 

In-House Development. Under the in-house development model, one or more subsystems of the product are designed and developed utilizing the NETGEAR engineering team. Under this model, some of the primary technology is developed in-house. We then work closely with either an ODM, a CM or a Joint Development Manufacturer ("JDM") to complete the development of the entire design, perform the necessary testing, and obtain regulatory approvals before the product is released for production. 

OEM. &#32;Under the original equipment manufacturer ("OEM"), methodology, which we use for a limited number of products, we define the product specification and then purchase the product from OEM suppliers that have existing products fitting our design requirements. In some cases, once a technology supplier's product is selected, we work with the OEM supplier to complete the cosmetic changes to fit into our mechanical and packaging design, as well as our documentation and graphical user interface ("GUI") standard. The OEM supplier completes regulatory approvals on our behalf. When all design verification and regulatory testing is completed, the product is released for production. 

Our internal research and development efforts focus on developing and improving the usability, reliability, functionality, cost and performance of our products. 

Manufacturing 

Our primary manufacturers are Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., Ltd., (more commonly known as Foxconn Corporation), Delta Networks Incorporated, and Pegatron Corporation, all of which are headquartered in Taiwan. We also use Flex (also known as FLEXTRONICS) with headquarters in Singapore and the United States and Sky Light Industrial Ltd. which is headquartered in Hong Kong. The actual manufacturing of our products occurs primarily in mainland China and Vietnam, with pilot and low-volume manufacturing in Taiwan on a select basis. We distribute our manufacturing among these key suppliers to avoid excessive concentration with a single supplier. However there was an increase in supplier concentration in 2015. Because substantially all of our manufacturing occurs in mainland China and Vietnam, any disruptions from natural disasters, health epidemics and political, social and economic instability would affect the ability of our manufacturers to manufacture our products. In addition, our manufacturers in China have continued to increase our costs of production, particularly in the recent years. These increased costs have affected our margins and ability to lower prices for our products to stay competitive. If our manufacturers or warehousing facilities are disrupted or destroyed, we would have no other readily available alternatives for manufacturing our products and our business would be significantly impacted. In addition to their responsibility for the manufacturing of our products, our manufacturers purchase all necessary parts and materials to produce complete, finished goods. To maintain quality standards for our suppliers, we have established our own product quality organization based in Hong Kong and mainland China. They are responsible for auditing and inspecting process and product quality on the premises of our ODMs, CMs, OEMs and JDMs. 

We obtain several key components from limited or sole sources. For example, many of the semiconductors and metamaterials used in our products are designed for use in our products and are obtained from sole source suppliers on a purchase order basis. In addition, some components that are used in all our products are obtained from limited sources. These components include connector jacks, plastic casings and physical layer transceivers. We also obtain switching fabric semiconductors, which are used in our Ethernet switches and Internet gateway products, wireless local area network chipsets which are used in all of our wireless 

products and mobile network chipsets which are used in our wireless gateways and hotspots from a limited number of suppliers. Our third party manufacturers generally purchase these components on our behalf on a purchase order basis. If these sources fail to satisfy our supply requirements, our ability to meet scheduled product deliveries would be harmed and we may lose sales and experience increased component costs. 

We currently outsource warehousing and distribution logistics to four main third-party providers who are responsible for warehousing, distribution logistics and order fulfillment. In addition, these parties are also responsible for some configuration and re-packaging of our products including bundling components to form kits, inserting appropriate documentation, disk drive configuration, and adding power adapters. APL Logistics Americas, Ltd. in City of Industry, California serves the Americas region, Kerry Logistics Ltd. in Hong Kong serves the Asia Pacific region, DSV Solutions B.V. Netherlands serves the EMEA region, and Agility Logistics Pty Ltd. in Matraville, NSW, Australia serves Australia and New Zealand. 

Sales and Marketing 

As of December 31, 2015 , we had 339 &#32;employees engaged in sales, marketing, and technical support. We work directly with our customers on market development activities, such as co-advertising, online promotions and video demonstrations, event sponsorship and sales associate training. We also participate in major industry trade shows and marketing events. Our marketing department is comprised of our channel marketing, product marketing and corporate marketing groups. 

Our channel marketing team focuses on working with the sales teams to maximize our participation in channel partner marketing activities and merchandise our products both online and in store. 

Our product marketing group focuses on product strategy, product development roadmaps, the new product introduction process, product lifecycle management, demand assessment and competitive analysis. The group works closely with our sales and research and development groups to align our product development roadmap to meet customer technology demands from a strategic perspective. The group also ensures that product development activities, product launches, and ongoing demand and supply planning occur in a well-managed, timely basis in coordination with our development, manufacturing, and sales groups, as well as our ODM, OEM and sales channel partners. 

Our corporate marketing group is responsible for defining and building our corporate brand and supporting the business units with creative and marketing strategies and tactics. The group focuses on defining our brand promise and marketing messages on a worldwide basis. This group is also responsible for driving the social media and online marketing strategy, public relations and email marketing programs, events, and corporate websites worldwide, as well as creative production for all product categories. 

We conduct most of our international sales and marketing operations through wholly-owned subsidiaries, which operate via sales and marketing subsidiaries and branch offices worldwide. 

Customer Support 

We design our products with &#8220;plug-and-play&#8221; ease of use. We respond globally to customer questions through a variety of venues including phone, chat and email. Customers can also get self-help service through the comprehensive knowledgebase and the user forum on our website. Customer support is provided through a combination of a limited number of permanent employees and use of subcontracted, out-sourced resources. Our permanent employees design our technical support database and are responsible for training and managing our outsourced sub-contractors. They also handle escalations from the outsourced resources. We utilize the information gained from customers by our customer support organization to enhance our product offerings, including further simplifying the installation process. 

Intellectual Property 

We believe that our continued success will depend primarily on the technical expertise, speed of technology implementation, creative skills and management abilities of our officers and key employees, plus ownership of a limited but important set of copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and patents. We primarily rely on a combination of copyright, trademark and trade secret and patent laws, nondisclosure agreements with employees, consultants and suppliers and other contractual provisions to establish, maintain and protect our proprietary rights. We hold approximately 145 issued United States patents that expire between years 2016 and 2033 and 75 foreign patents that expire between 2016 and 2033. In addition, we currently have approximately 100 pending United States and foreign patent applications related to technology and products offered by us. We also rely on third-party licensors for patented hardware and software license rights in technology that are incorporated into and are necessary for the operation and functionality of our products. Our success will depend in part on our continued ability to have access to these technologies. 

We have trade secret rights for our products, consisting mainly of product design, technical product documentation and software. We also own, or have applied for registration of trademarks, in connection with our products in the United States and internationally, including NETGEAR, AirCard, AirCard Enabled, Aircard Watcher, Watcher, Watcher and Wireless Expert, Around Town, NETGEAR Green, the NETGEAR Green logo, Everybody&#8217;s Connecting, Arlo, Arlo Q, Arlo logo, The Next Wave of WiFi, Orbi, Skyler, Genie, Genie+, the Genie logo, ReadyShare, Neo TV, the Neo TV logo, NETGEAR Stora, the NETGEAR Stora logo, ProSafe, RangeMax, ReadyNAS, ReadyDrop, ReadyData, ReadyCloud, ReadyDLNA, ReadyRecover, Smart Wizard, ProSecure, the ProSecure logo, Push2TV, Streampro, Ultraline, Proline, Centria, My Media, Nighthawk, Nighthawk x4, Nighthawk x6, NETGEAR Trek, Overdrive, Overdrive 3G/4G Mobile Hotspot logo, Zing Mobile Hotspot, Mingle, Vue, VueZone, Ufast, and X-RAID. 

We have registered a number of Internet domain names that we use for electronic interaction with our customers including dissemination of product information, marketing programs, product registration, sales activities, and other commercial uses. 

Seasonal Business 

We have historically experienced increased net sales in our third and fourth fiscal quarters as compared to other quarters in our fiscal year due to seasonal demand of consumer markets related to the beginning of the school year and the holiday season. However, because of irregular and significant purchases from customers in other markets, such as the service provider market, this pattern has not been consistent. As such, any pattern should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future net sales or financial performance. 

Backlog 

We believe the actual amount of order backlog at any particular time is not a meaningful indication of our future business. Our backlog consists of products for which customer purchase orders have been received and that are scheduled or in the process of being scheduled for shipment. While we expect to fulfill the order backlog within the current year, most orders are subject to rescheduling or cancellation with little or no penalties. Because of the possibility of customer changes in product scheduling or order cancellation, our backlog as of any particular date may not be an indicator of net sales for any subsequent period. Accordingly, backlog should not be considered a reliable indicator of our ability to achieve any particular level of revenue or financial performance. 

Environmental Laws 

Our products and manufacturing process are subject to numerous governmental regulations, which cover both the use of various materials as well as environmental concerns. Environmental issues such as pollution and climate change have had significant legislative and regulatory efforts on a global basis, and there are expected to be additional changes to the regulations in these areas. These changes could directly increase the cost of energy, which may have an impact on the way we manufacture products or utilize energy to produce our products. In addition, any new regulations or laws in the environmental area might increase the cost of raw materials we use in our products and the cost of compliance. Other regulations in the environmental area may require us to continue to monitor and ensure proper disposal or recycling of our products. To the best of our knowledge, we maintain compliance with all current government regulations concerning our production processes for all locations in which we operate. Since we operate on a global basis, this is also a complex process that requires continual monitoring of regulations and an ongoing compliance process to ensure that we and our suppliers are in compliance with all existing regulations. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015 , we had 963 full-time employees, with 339 &#32;in sales, marketing and technical support, 337 &#32;in research and development, 132 &#32;in operations, and 155 &#32;in finance, information systems and administration. We also utilize a number of temporary staff to supplement our workforce. We have never had a work stoppage among our employees and no personnel are represented under collective bargaining agreements.
