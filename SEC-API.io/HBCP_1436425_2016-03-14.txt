 Item 1. Business. General. Home Bancorp, Inc. (the &#147;Company&#148;) is a Louisiana corporation and the holding company for Home Bank, N.A. (the &#147;Bank&#148;). The Bank, which is headquartered in Lafayette, Louisiana, and is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, currently conducts business through 30 banking offices in the Greater Lafayette, Baton Rouge, Greater New Orleans and Northshore (of Lake Pontchartrain) regions of south Louisiana and the Natchez and Vicksburg regions of west Mississippi. 

As of March 2, 2015, the Bank converted from a federal savings bank to a national bank with the title &#147;Home Bank, National Association.&#148; As a result of the Bank&#146;s conversion to a national bank, the Company is now subject to regulation as a bank holding company by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the &#147;FRB&#148; or the &#147;Federal Reserve&#148;). Prior to the Bank&#146;s charter conversion, the Company was regulated by the FRB as a savings and loan holding company. 

The Bank is primarily engaged in attracting deposits from the general public and using those funds to invest in loans and securities. Our principal sources of funds are customer deposits, repayments of loans, repayments of investments and funds borrowed from outside sources such as the Federal Home Loan Bank (&#147;FHLB&#148;) of Dallas. These funds are primarily used for the origination of loans, including one-to-four-family first mortgage loans, home equity loans and lines, commercial real estate loans, construction and land loans, multi-family residential loans, commercial and industrial loans and consumer loans. The Bank derives its income principally from interest earned on loans and investment securities and, to a lesser extent, from fees received in connection with the origination of loans, service charges on deposit accounts and for other services. The Bank&#146;s primary expenses are general operating expenses, especially compensation and benefits. 

&#160;

We are an active originator of residential home mortgage loans in our market areas. Historically, the Bank was a traditional thrift institution with an emphasis on fixed-rate long-term single-family residential first mortgage loans. Over the course of the last decade plus, we have shifted our emphasis in the loan products we offer and increased our efforts to originate commercial real estate loans and commercial and industrial loans. Commercial real estate loans and commercial and industrial loans are deemed attractive due to their generally higher yields and shorter anticipated lives compared to single-family residential mortgage loans. In addition, the Bank views commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans as attractive lending products because the Bank&#146;s commercial borrowers typically maintain deposit accounts at the Bank, increasing the Bank&#146;s core deposits. 

The Company&#146;s headquarters office is located at 503 Kaliste Saloom Road, Lafayette, Louisiana, and our telephone number is (337) 237-1960. We maintain a website at www.home24bank.com, and we provide our customers with online banking services. Information on our website should not be considered a part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Market Area and Competition 

The Bank has four primary market areas across south Louisiana: Greater Lafayette, Baton Rouge, Greater New Orleans and the Northshore (of Lake Pontchartrain) and two primary market areas in west Mississippi: Natchez and Vicksburg. In 2007, the Company expanded its operations into Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and currently operates three banking offices in Baton Rouge. In 2010, the Company expanded into the Northshore (of Lake Pontchartrain) through a Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (&#147;FDIC&#148;) assisted transaction of the former Statewide Bank (&#147;Statewide&#148;). The Bank currently operates six banking offices in the Northshore region. In 2011, the Company expanded into the Greater New Orleans area through its acquisition of GS Financial Corporation (&#147;GSFC&#148;) and its subsidiary, Guaranty Savings Bank (&#147;Guaranty&#148;). In September 2015, the Company increased its presence in Greater New Orleans through the acquisition of Louisiana Bancshares (&#147;LABC&#148;) and its subsidiary, Bank of New Orleans. The Bank currently operates seven banking offices in the Greater New Orleans area. In February 2014, the Company expanded into Natchez and Vicksburg, Mississippi through its acquisition of Britton &#38; Koontz Capital Corporation (&#147;Britton &#38; Koontz&#148;) and its subsidiary, Britton &#38; Koontz Bank, N.A. (&#147;Britton &#38; Koontz Bank&#148;). The Bank currently operates three banking offices in Natchez and two banking offices in Vicksburg. For additional information on our acquisition activity, see Part II, Item 7 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, &#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#150; Acquisition Activity.&#148; 

We face significant competition in originating loans and attracting deposits. This competition stems primarily from commercial banks, savings banks and savings associations, credit unions and mortgage-banking companies. Many of the financial service providers operating in our market areas are significantly larger and have greater financial resources than us. We face additional competition for deposits from short-term money market funds and other corporate and government securities funds, mutual funds and from other non-depository financial institutions such as brokerage firms and insurance companies. 

Supervision and Regulation 

Set forth below is a brief description of certain laws relating to the regulation of Home Bancorp, Inc. and Home Bank. This description does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to applicable laws and regulations. 

General.&#160; Home Bank, N.A. is subject to federal regulation and oversight by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (&#147;OCC&#148;). The Bank is also subject to regulation and examination by the FDIC, which insures the deposits of the Bank to the maximum extent permitted by law, and requirements established by the Federal Reserve. 

Federal law provides the federal banking regulators with substantial enforcement powers. The OCC&#146;s enforcement authority includes, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, to issue cease and desist or removal orders and to initiate injunctive actions. In general, these enforcement actions may be initiated 

&#160;

for violations of laws and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices. Other actions or inactions may provide the basis for enforcement action, including misleading or untimely reports filed with the OCC. The FRB has comparable enforcement authority over the Company. Any change in such regulations could have a material adverse impact on the Company and the Bank. 

2010 Regulatory Reform 

On July 21, 2010, the President signed into law the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the &#147;Dodd-Frank Act&#148;). This act imposes additional restrictions and an expanded framework of regulatory oversight for financial institutions, including depository institutions. Many of the regulations implementing these changes have not been promulgated, so we cannot determine the full impact on our business and operations at this time. 

The following aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act are related to the operations of the Bank: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; A new independent Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (&#147;CFPB&#148;) was established within the FRB, empowered to exercise broad regulatory, supervisory and enforcement authority with respect to both new and existing consumer financial protection laws. However, smaller financial institutions, like the Bank, continue to be subject to the supervision and enforcement of their primary federal banking regulator with respect to federal consumer financial protection laws. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Tier 1 capital treatment for &#147;hybrid&#148; capital items like trust preferred securities was eliminated subject to various grandfathering and transition rules. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; The prohibition on payment of interest on demand deposits was repealed. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Deposit insurance was permanently increased to $250,000. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; The deposit insurance assessment base calculation now equals the depository institution&#146;s total assets minus the sum of its average tangible equity during the assessment period. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; The minimum reserve ratio of the Deposit Insurance Fund increased to 1.35% of estimated annual insured deposits or assessment base; however, the FDIC is directed to &#147;offset the effect&#148; of the increased reserve ratio for insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion. The following aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act are related to the operations of the Company: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; The Federal Deposit Insurance Act was amended to direct federal regulators to require depository institution holding companies to serve as a source of strength for their depository institution subsidiaries. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Public companies are now required to provide their shareholders with a non-binding vote: (i) at least once every three years on the compensation paid to executive officers, and (ii) at least once every six years on whether they should have a &#147;say on pay&#148; vote every one, two or three years. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; A separate, non-binding shareholder vote is now required regarding golden parachutes for named executive officers when a shareholder vote takes place on mergers, acquisitions, dispositions or other transactions that would trigger the parachute payments. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Securities exchanges are required to prohibit brokers from using their own discretion to vote shares not beneficially owned by them for certain &#147;significant&#148; matters, which include votes on the election of directors, executive compensation matters, and any other matter determined to be significant. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Stock exchanges, which include the Nasdaq, are prohibited from listing the securities of any issuer that does not have a policy providing for (i) disclosure of its policy on incentive compensation payable on the basis of financial information reportable under the securities laws, and (ii) the recovery from current or former executive officers, following an accounting restatement triggered by material noncompliance with securities law reporting requirements, of any incentive compensation paid erroneously during the three-year period preceding the date on which the restatement was required that exceeds the amount that would have been paid on the basis of the restated financial information. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Disclosure in annual proxy materials is required concerning the relationship between the executive compensation paid and the financial performance of the issuer. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Item 402 of Regulation S-K will be amended to require companies to disclose the ratio of the Chief Executive Officer&#146;s annual total compensation to the median annual total compensation of all other employees. &#160;

Volcker Rule Regulations. Regulations were recently adopted by the federal banking agencies to implement the provisions of the Dodd Frank Act commonly referred to as the Volcker Rule. The regulations contain prohibitions and restrictions on the ability of financial institution holding companies and their affiliates to engage in proprietary trading and to hold certain interests in, or to have certain relationships with, various types of investment funds, including hedge funds and private equity funds. The regulations were phased in over a period ending on July 21, 2015. The Company&#146;s investment portfolio is in compliance with the various provisions of the Volcker Rule regulations as of December 31, 2015. 

Regulation of Home Bancorp, Inc. 

The Company was a savings and loan holding company until March 2, 2015, and it is now a bank holding company, subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve has enforcement authority with respect to the Company similar to that of the OCC over the Bank. Applicable federal law and regulations limit the activities of the Company and require the approval of the Federal Reserve for any acquisition of a subsidiary, including another financial institution or holding company thereof, or a merger or acquisition of the Company. The Company must serve as a source of strength for the Bank, maintaining the ability to provide financial assistance if the Bank suffers financial distress. These and other Federal Reserve policies may restrict the Company&#146;s ability to pay dividends. In addition, dividends from the Company may depend, in part, upon its receipt of dividends from the Bank. As noted below, beginning in 2016, if the Company does not have the required capital conservation buffer or otherwise meet its new capital requirements, its ability to pay dividends to its stockholders will be limited. 

A bank holding company is required to give the Federal Reserve prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of its outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption, when combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemption during the preceding 12 months, is equal to 10% or more of the company&#146;s consolidated net worth. The Federal Reserve may disapprove such a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice or would violate any law, regulation, Federal Reserve order, or any condition imposed by, or written agreement with the Federal Reserve. This notification requirement does not apply to any company that meets the well-capitalized standard for bank holding companies, is well-managed, and is not subject to any unresolved supervisory issues. 

Permissible Activities . The business activities of the Company are generally limited to those activities permissible for bank holding companies under Section 4(c)(8) of the Bank Holding Company Act and certain additional activities authorized by the Federal Reserve regulations. The Bank Holding Company Act generally prohibits a bank holding company from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any company which is not a bank or bank holding company. A bank holding company must obtain Federal Reserve Board approval before acquiring directly or indirectly, ownership or control of any voting shares of another bank or bank holding company if, after such acquisition, it would own or control more than 5% of such shares (unless it already owns or controls the majority of such shares). 

Capital Requirements . Prior to January 1, 2015, there were no Federal Reserve regulations establishing minimum regulatory capital requirements for savings and loan holding companies. On January 1, 2015, new capital requirements generally applicable to both bank holding companies and savings and loan holding companies became effective. The new regulatory capital requirements applicable to the Company are the same as the new capital requirements for the Bank. For a description of these capital requirements, see &#147;Regulation of Home Bank - New Capital Rules.&#148; 

Federal Securities Laws. We have registered our common stock with the Securities and Exchange Commission (&#147;SEC&#148;) under Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Accordingly, the Company is subject to the proxy and tender offer rules, insider trading reporting requirements and restrictions and certain other requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act . As a public company, the Company is subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 which addresses, among other issues, corporate governance, auditing and accounting, executive compensation, and enhanced and timely disclosure of corporate information. As directed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, our 

&#160;

principal executive officer and principal financial officer are required to certify that our quarterly and annual reports do not contain any untrue statement of a material fact. The rules adopted by the SEC under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act have several requirements, including having these officers certify that: they are responsible for establishing, maintaining and regularly evaluating the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting; they have made certain disclosures to our independent auditors and the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors about our internal control over financial reporting; and they have included information in our quarterly and annual reports about their evaluation and whether there have been changes in our internal control over financial reporting or in other factors that could materially affect internal control over financial reporting. 

Regulation of Home Bank, N.A. 

General . The Bank is subject to regulation and oversight by the OCC extending to all aspects of its operations. As part of this authority, Home Bank, N.A. is required to file periodic reports with the OCC and is subject to periodic examinations by the OCC and the FDIC. The investment and lending authorities of national banks are prescribed by federal laws and regulations, and such institutions are prohibited from engaging in any activities not permitted by such laws and regulations. Such regulation and supervision is primarily intended for the protection of depositors and the Deposit Insurance Fund. 

The OCC&#146;s enforcement authority over national banks includes, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, to issue cease and desist or removal orders and to initiate injunctive actions. In general, these enforcement actions may be initiated for violations of laws and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices. Other actions or inactions may provide the basis for enforcement action, including misleading or untimely reports filed with the OCC. 

Insurance of Accounts . The deposits of Home Bank, N.A. are insured to the maximum extent permitted by the Deposit Insurance Fund and are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. The Dodd-Frank Act permanently increased deposit insurance on most accounts to $250,000. As insurer, the FDIC is authorized to conduct examinations of, and to require reporting by, insured institutions. It also may prohibit any insured institution from engaging in any activity determined by regulation or order to pose a serious threat to the FDIC. The FDIC also has the authority to initiate enforcement actions against insured institutions. 

The FDIC&#146;s risk-based premium system provides for quarterly assessments. Each insured institution is placed in one of four risk categories depending on supervisory and capital considerations. Within its risk category, an institution is assigned to an initial base assessment rate which is then adjusted to determine its final assessment rate based on its brokered deposits, secured liabilities and unsecured debt. Following the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC amended its deposit insurance regulations (1) to change the assessment base for insurance from domestic deposits to average assets minus average tangible equity and (2) to lower overall assessment rates. The revised assessment rates are between 2.5 to 9 basis points for banks in the lowest risk category and between 30 to 45 basis points for banks in the highest risk category. 

In addition, all institutions with deposits insured by the FDIC are required to pay assessments to fund interest payments on bonds issued by the Financing Corporation, a mixed-ownership government corporation established to recapitalize the predecessor to the Deposit Insurance Fund. The annual assessment rate set for the fourth quarter of 2015 was 0.00150% of insured deposits and is adjusted quarterly. These assessments will continue until the Financing Corporation bonds mature in 2019. 

The FDIC may terminate the deposit insurance of any insured depository institution if it determines after a hearing that the institution has engaged or is engaging in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, order or any condition imposed by an agreement with the FDIC. It also may suspend deposit insurance temporarily during the hearing process for the permanent termination of insurance, if the institution has no tangible capital. If insurance of accounts is terminated, the accounts at the institution at the time of the termination, less subsequent withdrawals, shall continue to be insured for a period of six months to two years, as determined by the FDIC. Management is aware of no existing circumstances which would result in termination of the Bank&#146;s deposit insurance. 

&#160;

Recent Regulatory Capital Regulations . In July of 2013 the respective U.S. federal banking agencies issued final rules implementing Basel III and the Dodd-Frank Act capital requirements to be fully-phased in on a global basis on January 1, 2019. The new regulations establish a new tangible common equity capital requirement, increase the minimum requirement for the current Tier 1 risk-weighted asset (&#147;RWA&#148;) ratio, phase out certain kinds of intangibles treated as capital and certain types of instruments and change the risk weightings of certain assets used to determine required capital ratios. The new common equity Tier 1 capital component requires capital of the highest quality &#150; predominantly composed of retained earnings and common stock instruments. For community banks, such as Home Bank, a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5% became effective on January 1, 2015. The new capital rules also increased the current minimum Tier 1 capital ratio from 4.0% to 6.0% beginning on January 1, 2015. In addition, in order to make capital distributions and pay discretionary bonuses to executive officers without restriction, an institution must also maintain greater than 2.5% in common equity attributable to a capital conservation buffer to be phased in from January 1, 2016 until January 1, 2019. The new rules also increase the risk weights for several categories of assets, including an increase from 100% to 150% for certain acquisition, development and construction loans and more than 90-day past due exposures. The new capital rules maintain the general structure of the prompt corrective action rules (described below), but incorporate the new common equity Tier 1 capital requirement and the increased Tier 1 RWA requirement into the prompt corrective action framework. 

Regulatory Capital Requirements . National banks are required to maintain minimum levels of regulatory capital. Current OCC capital standards require these institutions to satisfy a common equity Tier 1 capital requirement, a leverage capital requirement and a risk-based capital requirement. The common equity Tier 1 capital component generally consists of retained earnings and common stock instruments and must equal at least 4.5% of risk-weighted assets. Leverage capital, also known as &#147;core&#148; capital, must equal at least 3.0% of adjusted total assets for the most highly rated national banks. Core capital generally consists of common stockholders&#146; equity (including retained earnings). An additional cushion of at least 100 basis points is required for all other institutions, which effectively increases their minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio to 4.0% or more. Under the OCC&#146;s regulations, the most highly-rated national banks are those that the OCC determines are strong banking organization and are rated composite 1 under the Uniform Financial Institutions Rating System. Under the risk-based capital requested, &#147;total&#148; capital (a combination of core and &#147;supplementary&#148; capital) must equal at least 8.0% of &#147;risk-weighted&#148; assets. The OCC also is authorized to impose capital requirements in excess of these standards on individual institutions on a case-by-case basis. 

In determining compliance with the risk-based capital requirement, a national bank is allowed to include both core capital and supplementary capital in its total capital, provided that the amount of supplementary capital included does not exceed the national bank&#146;s core capital. Supplementary capital generally consists of general allowances for loan losses up to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets, together with certain other items. In determining the required amount of risk-based capital, total assets, including certain off-balance sheet items, are multiplied by a risk weight based on the risks inherent in the type of assets. The risk weights range from 0% for cash and securities issued by the U.S. Government or unconditionally backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government to 100% for loans (other than qualifying residential loans weighted at 80%) and repossessed assets. 

National banks must value securities available for sale at amortized cost for regulatory capital purposes. This means that in computing regulatory capital, national banks should add back any unrealized losses and deduct any unrealized gains, net of income taxes, on debt securities reported as a separate component of capital, as defined by generally accepted accounting principles. 

At December 31, 2015, Home Bank exceeded all of its regulatory capital requirements, with Tier 1, Tier 1 common equity, Tier 1 common equity (to risk-weighted assets) and total risk-based capital ratios of 8.74%, 11.61%, 11.61% and 12.43%, respectively. 

Any national bank that fails any of the capital requirements is subject to possible enforcement action by the OCC or the FDIC. Such action could include a capital directive, a cease and desist order, civil money penalties, the establishment of restrictions on the institution&#146;s operations, termination of federal deposit insurance and the appointment of a conservator or receiver. The OCC&#146;s capital regulations provide that such actions, through enforcement proceedings or otherwise, could require one or more of a variety of corrective actions. 

&#160;

Prompt Corrective Action . The following table shows the amount of capital associated with the different capital categories set forth in the prompt corrective action regulations. 

&#160;

Capital Category 

&#160; Total Risk-Based Capital &#160; Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital &#160; Tier 1 Common Equity Capital &#160; Tier 1 Leverage Capital Well capitalized &#160; 10% or more &#160; 8% or more &#160; 6.5% or more &#160; 5% or more Adequately capitalized &#160; 8% or more &#160; 6% or more &#160; 4.5% or more &#160; 4% or more Undercapitalized &#160; Less than 8% &#160; Less than 6% &#160; Less than 4.5% &#160; Less than 4% Significantly undercapitalized &#160; Less than 6% &#160; Less than 4% &#160; Less than 3% &#160; Less than 3% In addition, an institution is &#147;critically undercapitalized&#148; if it has a ratio of tangible equity to total assets that is equal to or less than 2.0%. Under specified circumstances, a federal banking agency may reclassify a well capitalized institution as adequately capitalized and may require an adequately capitalized institution or an undercapitalized institution to comply with supervisory actions as if it were in the next lower category (except that the FDIC may not reclassify a significantly undercapitalized institution as critically undercapitalized). 

An institution generally must file a written capital restoration plan which meets specified requirements within 45 days of the date that the institution receives notice or is deemed to have notice that it is undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized. A federal banking agency must provide the institution with written notice of approval or disapproval within 60 days after receiving a capital restoration plan, subject to extensions by the agency. An institution which is required to submit a capital restoration plan must concurrently submit a performance guaranty by each company that controls the institution. In addition, undercapitalized institutions are subject to various regulatory restrictions, and the appropriate federal banking agency also may take any number of discretionary supervisory actions. 

As of December 31, 2015, Home Bank was deemed a well capitalized institution for purposes of the above regulations and as such is not subject to the above mentioned restrictions. 

Limitations on Dividends . OCC regulations impose various restrictions on the ability of Home Bank to pay dividends. Home Bank generally may pay dividends during any calendar year in an amount up to 100% of net income for the year-to-date plus retained net income for the two preceding years, so long as it is well-capitalized after the distribution. If Home Bank proposes to pay a dividend when it does not meet its capital requirements or that will exceed these limitations, it must obtain the OCC&#146;s prior approval. The OCC may object to a proposed dividend based on safety and soundness concerns. No insured depository institution may pay a dividend if, after paying the dividend, the institution would be undercapitalized. In addition, as noted above, beginning in 2016, if Home Bank does not have the required capital conservation buffer, its ability to pay dividends to the Company will be limited. 

Limitations on Transactions with Affiliates. Transactions between a national bank and any affiliate are governed by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act. An affiliate of a national bank includes any company or entity which controls the national bank or that is controlled by a company that controls the national bank. In a holding company context, the holding company of a national bank (such as the Company) and any companies which are controlled by such holding company are affiliates of the national bank. Generally, Section 23A limits the extent to which the national bank or its subsidiaries may engage in &#147;covered transactions&#148; with any one affiliate to an amount equal to 10% of such bank&#146;s capital stock and surplus, and contain an aggregate limit on all such transactions with all affiliates to an amount equal to 20% of such capital stock and surplus. Section 23B applies to &#147;covered transactions&#148; as well as certain other transactions and requires that all transactions be on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable, to the national bank as those provided to a non-affiliate. The term &#147;covered transaction&#148; includes the making of loans to, purchase of assets from and issuance of a guarantee to an affiliate and similar transactions. Section 23B transactions also include the provision of services and the sale of assets by a national bank to an affiliate. 

&#160;

In addition, Sections 22(g) and (h) of the Federal Reserve Act, place restrictions on loans to executive officers, directors and principal shareholders of a national bank and its affiliates. Under Section 22(h), loans to a director, an executive officer and to a greater than 10% shareholder of a national bank, and certain affiliated interests of either, may not exceed, together with all other outstanding loans to such person and affiliated interests, a national bank&#146;s loans to one borrower limit (generally equal to 15% of the bank&#146;s unimpaired capital and surplus). Section 22(h) also requires that loans to directors, executive officers and principal shareholders be made on terms substantially the same as offered in comparable transactions to other persons unless the loans are made pursuant to a benefit or compensation program that (i) is widely available to employees of the bank and (ii) does not give preference to any director, executive officer or principal shareholder, or certain affiliated interests of either, over other employees of the national bank. Section 22(h) also requires prior board approval for certain loans. In addition, the aggregate amount of extensions of credit by a national bank to all insiders cannot exceed the bank&#146;s unimpaired capital and surplus. Furthermore, Section 22(g) places additional restrictions on loans to executive officers. Home Bank currently is subject to Sections 22(g) and (h) of the Federal Reserve Act, and as of December 31, 2015 was in compliance with the above restrictions. 

Anti-money Laundering . All financial institutions, including national banks, are subject to federal laws that are designed to prevent the use of the U.S. financial system to fund terrorist activities. Financial institutions operating in the United States must develop anti-money laundering compliance programs, due diligence policies and controls to ensure the detection and reporting of money laundering. Such compliance programs are intended to supplement compliance requirements, also applicable to financial institutions, under the Bank Secrecy Act and the Office of Foreign Assets Control Regulations. Home Bank has established policies and procedures to ensure compliance with these provisions. 

Federal Home Loan Bank System . Home Bank is a member of the FHLB of Dallas, which is one of 11 regional FHLBs that administer the home financing credit function of various financial institutions. Each FHLB serves as a reserve or central bank for its members within its assigned region. It is funded primarily from proceeds derived from the sale of consolidated obligations of the FHLB System. It makes loans to members (i.e., advances) in accordance with policies and procedures established by the board of directors of the FHLB. As of December 31, 2015, Home Bank had $125.2 million of FHLB advances and $480.7 million available on its line of credit with the FHLB. 

As a member, Home Bank is required to purchase and maintain stock in the FHLB of Dallas in an amount equal to at least 1.0% of its aggregate unpaid residential mortgage loans or similar obligations at the beginning of each year. As of December 31, 2015, Home Bank had $8.2 million in FHLB stock, which was in compliance with this requirement. 

The FHLBs are required to provide funds for the resolution of troubled savings institutions and to contribute to affordable housing programs through direct loans or interest subsidies on advances targeted for community investment and low- and moderate-income housing projects. These contributions have adversely affected the level of FHLB dividends paid in the past and could do so in the future. These contributions also could have an adverse effect on the value of FHLB stock in the future. 

Federal Reserve System . The FRB requires all depository institutions to maintain reserves against their transaction accounts and non-personal time deposits. The required reserves must be maintained in the form of vault cash or an account at the FRB. As of December 31, 2015, Home Bank had met its reserve requirement. 

Privacy.&#160; Financial institutions are required to disclose their policies for collecting and protecting confidential information. Customers generally may prevent financial institutions from sharing personal financial information with nonaffiliated third parties except for third parties that market the institutions&#146; own products and services. 

Additionally, financial institutions generally may not disclose consumer account numbers to any nonaffiliated third party for use in telemarketing, direct mail marketing or other marketing through electronic mail to consumers. The Bank has established policies and procedures designed to safeguard its customers&#146; personal financial information and to ensure compliance with applicable privacy laws. 

&#160;

Federal Taxation 

General. Home Bancorp, Inc. and Home Bank are subject to federal income taxation in the same general manner as other corporations with some exceptions listed below. The following discussion of federal, state and local income taxation is only intended to summarize certain pertinent income tax matters and is not a comprehensive description of the applicable tax rules. The Company&#146;s federal and state income tax returns for taxable years through December 31, 2009 have been closed for purposes of examination by the Internal Revenue Service. 

The Company will file a consolidated federal income tax return with the Bank. Accordingly, it is anticipated that any cash distributions made by Home Bancorp to its shareholders would be treated as cash dividends and not as a non-taxable return of capital to shareholders for federal and state tax purposes. 

Method of Accounting.&#160; For federal income tax purposes, we report income and expenses on the accrual method of accounting and file our federal income tax return on a fiscal year basis. 

Bad Debt Reserves.&#160; The Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996 eliminated the use of the reserve method of accounting for bad debt reserves by savings institutions, effective for taxable years beginning after 1995. Prior to that time, Home Bank was permitted to establish a reserve for bad debts and to make additions to the reserve. These additions could, within specified formula limits, be deducted in arriving at taxable income. As a result of the Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996, savings associations must use the specific charge-off method in computing their bad debt deduction beginning with their 1996 federal tax return. In addition, federal legislation required the recapture over a six year period of the excess of tax bad debt reserves as of December 31, 1995 over those established as of December 31, 1987. 

Taxable Distributions and Recapture.&#160; Prior to the Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996, bad debt reserves created prior to January 1, 1988 were subject to recapture into taxable income if Home Bank failed to meet certain thrift asset and definitional tests. Federal legislation eliminated these savings association related recapture rules. However, under current law, pre-1988 reserves remain subject to recapture should Home Bank make certain non-dividend distributions or cease to maintain a bank charter. 

As of December 31, 2015, the total federal pre-1988 reserve was approximately $1.2 million. The reserve reflects the cumulative effect of federal tax deductions by Home Bank for which no federal income tax provisions have been made. 

Alternative Minimum Tax . The Internal Revenue Code imposes an alternative minimum tax at a rate of 20% on a base of regular taxable income plus certain tax preferences. The alternative minimum tax is payable to the extent that the tax computed on such alternative minimum taxable income is in excess of the regular income tax. Net operating losses, of which the Company has none, can offset no more than 90% of alternative minimum taxable income. Certain payments of alternative minimum tax may be used as credits against regular tax liabilities in future years. The Company has not been subject to the alternative minimum tax or any such amounts available as credits for carryover. 

Net Operating Loss Carryovers. For net operating losses in tax years beginning before August 6, 1997, the Company may carry back net operating losses to the three years preceding the loss year and then forward to fifteen years following the loss years. For net operating losses in years beginning after August 5, 1997, net operating losses can be carried back to the two years preceding the loss year and forward to the 20 years following the loss year. As of December 31, 2015, the Company had $498,000 in net operating loss carry forwards for federal income tax purposes from the acquisition of Britton &#38; Koontz. 

Corporate Dividends-Received Deduction . The Company may exclude from its income 100% of dividends received from the Bank as a member of the same affiliated group of corporations. The corporate dividends received deduction is 80% in the case of dividends received from corporations which a corporate recipient owns less than 80%, but at least 20% of the distribution corporation. Corporations which own less than 20% of the stock of a corporation distributing a dividend may deduct only 70% of dividends received.
