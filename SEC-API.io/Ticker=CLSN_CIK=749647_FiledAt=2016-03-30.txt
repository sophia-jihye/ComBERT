&#160; 

OVERVIEW 

&#160; 

Celsion Corporation is a fully-integrated oncology drug development company focused on developing a portfolio of innovative cancer treatments, including directed chemotherapies, DNA-mediated immunotherapy and RNA- based therapies. Our lead product candidate is ThermoDox &#174; , a proprietary heat-activated liposomal encapsulation of doxorubicin, currently in a Phase III clinical trial for the treatment of primary liver cancer (the OPTIMA Study) and a Phase II clinical trial for the treatment of recurrent chest wall breast cancer (the DIGNITY Study). Second in our pipeline is GEN-1 (formerly known as EGEN-001), a DNA mediated immunotherapy for the localized treatment of ovarian and brain cancers. 

&#160; 

We have three platform technologies providing the basis for the future development of a range of therapeutics for difficult-to-treat forms of cancer including: Lysolipid Thermally Sensitive Liposomes, a heat sensitive liposomal based dosage form that targets disease with known therapeutics in the presence of mild heat, TheraPlas, a novel nucleic acid-based treatment for local transfection of therapeutic plasmids, and TheraSilence, a systemic dosage form for lung directed anti-cancer RNA With these technologies we are working to develop and commercialize more efficient, effective and targeted oncology therapies that maximize efficacy while minimizing side-effects common to cancer treatments. 

&#160; 

ThermoDox . ThermoDox &#174; , is being evaluated in a Phase III clinical trial for primary liver cancer (the OPTIMA study) which was initiated in 2014 and a Phase II clinical trial for recurrent chest wall breast cancer (the DIGNITY Study). ThermoDox&#174; is a liposomal encapsulation of doxorubicin, an approved and frequently used oncology drug for the treatment of a wide range of cancers. Localized heat at hyperthermia temperatures (greater than 40&#176; Celsius) releases the encapsulated doxorubicin from the liposome enabling high concentrations of doxorubicin to be deposited preferentially in and around the targeted tumor while minimizing systemic side effects common with chemotherapy treatments like doxorubicin. 

&#160; 

The HEAT Study. On January 31, 2013, we announced that ThermoDox&#174; in combination with radio frequency ablation (RFA) did not meet the primary endpoint of progression free survival (PFS) for the 701 patient clinical trial in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), also known as primary liver cancer (the HEAT Study). We determined, after conferring with the HEAT Study&#8217;s independent Data Monitoring Committee (iDMC), that the HEAT Study did not meet the goal of demonstrating persuasive evidence of clinical effectiveness, that being a clinically meaningful improvement in progression free survival (PFS), that could form the basis for regulatory approval. In the trial, ThermoDox &#174; was well-tolerated with no unexpected serious adverse events. Following the announcement of the HEAT Study results, we have continued to follow patients for Overall Survival (OS), the secondary endpoint of the HEAT Study. We have conducted a comprehensive analysis of the data from the HEAT Study to assess the future strategic value and development strategy for ThermoDox &#174; . 

&#160; 

Findings from the HEAT Study post-hoc data analysis suggest that ThermoDox &#174; may substantially improve Overall Survival, when compared to the control group, in patients if their lesions undergo a 45 minute RFA procedure standardized for a lesion greater than 3 cm in diameter. Data from eight OS sweeps have been conducted since the top line PFS data from the HEAT Study were announced in January 2013, with each data set showing progressive improvement in statistical significance. The most recent post-hoc OS analysis from the HEAT Study as of July 15, 2015 showed that in a large, well bounded, subgroup of patients (n=285, 41% of the study patients), the combination of ThermoDox &#174; and optimized RFA provided a 58% improvement in OS compared to optimized RFA alone. The Hazard Ratio at this latest OS analysis is 0.63 (95% CI 0.43 - 0.93) with a p-value of 0.0198. Median overall survival has been reached in this 285 patient subgroup which translates into a 25.4 month (2.1 year) survival benefit for the ThermoDox&#174; group over the optimized RFA only group (79 months for the ThermoDox&#174; plus optimized RFA group versus 53.6 months for the optimized RFA only group). These data continue to support the protocol for our Phase III OPTIMA Study as described below. 

&#160; 

Findings from the HEAT Study post-hoc data have shown to be well balanced and not diminished in anyway by other factors. Supplementary computational modeling and prospective preclinical animal studies have shown additional support the relationship between heating duration and clinical outcomes. These data analysis have been presented, without objection, at multiple scientific and medical conferences in 2013, 2014 and 2015 by key HEAT Study investigators and leading liver cancer experts. The presentations include:

&#160; 

The O PTIMA Study. On February 24, 2014, we announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), after its customary 30 day review period, accepted without comment, subject to compliance with regulatory standards, our pivotal, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III trial of ThermoDox&#174; in combination with RFA in primary liver cancer, also known as HCC (the OPTIMA Study). The OPTIMA Study trial design is based on the comprehensive analysis of data from the HEAT study, which, as described previously, showed that treatment with ThermoDox&#174; resulted in a 58% improvement in overall survival in a large number of HCC patients that received an optimized RFA treatment for longer than 45 minutes. Designed with extensive input from globally recognized HCC researchers and clinicians and, after formal written consultation with the FDA, the OPTIMA Study was launched in the first half of 2014. The OPTIMA Study is expected to enroll up to 550 patients globally at up to 75 sites in the United States, Canada, Europe, China and elsewhere in the Asia Pacific region, and will evaluate ThermoDox&#174; in combination with standardized RFA, which will require a minimum of 45 minutes across all investigators and clinical sites for treating lesions 3 to 7 centimeters, versus standardized RFA alone. The primary endpoint for the trial is Overall Survival, and the secondary endpoints for the trial are PFS and safety. The statistical plan calls for two interim efficacy analyses by an independent DMC. 

&#160; 

On December 16, 2015, we announced that we received the clinical trial application approval from the China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) to conduct the OPTIMA Study in China. The approval will allow Celsion to enroll patients at up to 20 clinical sites in China. With the addition of these Chinese clinical sites, the Company expects to complete enrollment in the OPTIMA Study during the first quarter of 2018. Results from the OPTIMA Study, if successful, will provide the basis for a global registration filing and marketing approval. 

&#160; 

EGEN Acquisition. On June 20, 2014, we completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of EGEN, Inc., an Alabama corporation (EGEN), pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement. CLSN Laboratories, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Celsion (CLSN Laboratories), acquired all of EGEN&#8217;s right, title and interest in and to substantially all of the assets of EGEN, including cash and cash equivalents, patents, trademarks and other intellectual property rights, clinical data, certain contracts, licenses and permits, equipment, furniture, office equipment, furnishings, supplies and other tangible personal property. In addition, CLSN Laboratories assumed certain specified liabilities of EGEN, including the liabilities arising out of the acquired contracts and other assets relating to periods after the closing date. The consideration for the acquisition includes an initial payment of approximately $3.0 million in cash plus 2.7 million shares of Celsion&#8217;s common stock. Additional consideration included contingent value rights totaling $30.4 million, payable in cash, shares of Celsion common stock or a combination thereof, at Celsion&#8217;s option, upon achievement of three major milestone events as follows: 

&#160; 

&#160; 

a) 

$12.4 million will become payable upon achieving certain specified development milestones relating to an ovarian cancer study of GEN-1 to be conducted by the Company or its subsidiary; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

b) 

$12.0 million will become payable upon achieving certain specified development milestones relating to a glioblastoma multiforme brain cancer study of GEN-1 to be conducted by the Company or its subsidiary; and 

&#160; 

&#160; 

c) 

Up to $6.0 million will become payable upon achieving certain specified milestones relating to the TheraSilence&#8482; technology. 

&#160; 

With the acquisition, we acquired GEN-1 (formerly known as EGEN-001), a DNA-based immunotherapy for the localized treatment of ovarian and brain cancers, and three platform technologies for the development of treatments for those suffering with difficult-to-treat forms of cancer, novel nucleic acid-based immunotherapies and other anti-cancer DNA or RNA therapies, including TheraPlas&#8482; and TheraSilence&#8482;. 

&#160; 

GEN-1, designed using the TheraPlas &#8482; platform technology, is an Interleukin-12 (IL-12) DNA plasmid vector encased in a nanoparticle delivery system which enables cell transfection followed by persistent, local secretion of the IL-12 protein. IL-12 is one of the most active cytokines for the induction of potent anti-cancer immunity acting through the induction of T-lymphocyte and natural killer cell proliferation . 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

GEN-1 OVATION Study. In February 2015, we announced that the FDA accepted, without objection, the Phase I dose-escalation clinical trial of GEN-1 in combination with the standard of care in neo-adjuvant ovarian cancer (the OVATION Study). On September 30, 2015, we announced enrollment of the first patient in this study. The OVATION Study will seek to identify a safe, tolerable and potentially therapeutically active dose of GEN-1 by recruiting and maximizing an immune response. The OVATION Study is designed to enroll three to six patients per dose cohort and will evaluate safety and efficacy and attempt to define an optimal dose for a follow-on Phase I/II study combining GEN-1 with Avastin&#174; and Doxil&#174;. In addition, the OVATION Study establishes a unique opportunity to assess how cytokine-based compounds such as GEN-1, directly affect ovarian cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment in newly diagnosed patients. The study is designed to characterize the nature of the immune response triggered by GEN-1 at various levels of the patients&#39; immune system, including: 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

infiltration of cancer fighting T-cell lymphocytes into primary tumor and tumor microenvironment including peritoneal cavity, which is the primary site of metastasis of ovarian cancer; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

changes in local and systemic levels of immuno-stimulatory and immune-suppressive cytokines associated with tumor suppression and growth, respectively; and 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

expression profile of a comprehensive panel of immune related genes in pre-treatment and GEN-1-treated tumor tissue. 

&#160; 

We have initiated the study at four clinical sites at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, Oklahoma University Medical Center, Washington University in St. Louis and the Medical College of Wisconsin. In February 2016, we announced the completion of enrollment of the first cohort of three patients in the OVATION Study. The OVATION Study will continue into 2016 at higher doses of GEN-1 with the goal to identify a safe, tolerable and therapeutically active dose of GEN-1 by recruiting and maximizing an immune response. 

&#160; 

GEN-1 Plus Avastin&#174; and Doxil&#174; Trial. On April 29, 2015, we announced the expansion of our ovarian cancer development program to include a Phase I dose escalating trial to evaluate GEN-1 in combination with Avastin&#174; and Doxil&#174; in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer patients. We expect to enroll patients beginning in the second half of 2016. This new combination study in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer is supported by three preclinical studies indicating that the combination of GEN-1 with Avastin&#174; may result in significant clinical benefit with a favorable safety profile. Specifically: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; In two preclinical studies using an animal model of disseminated ovarian cancer, GEN-1 in combination with Avastin&#174; led to a significant reduction in tumor burden and disease progression. The effectiveness of the combined treatment was seen when GEN-1 was combined with various dose levels of Avastin&#174; (low-medium-high). Additionally, it was shown that GEN-1 treatment alone resulted in anti-tumor activity that was as good as or better than Avastin&#174; treatment alone. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; 

The preclinical studies indicated that no obvious overt toxicities were associated with the combined treatments. The preclinical data are also consistent with the mechanism of action for GEN-1, which exhibits certain anti-angiogenic properties and suggests that combining GEN-1 with lower doses of Avastin&#174; may enhance efficacy and help reduce the known toxicities associated with this anti-VEGF drug. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

The distinct biological activities of GEN-1 (immune stimulation) and Avastin&#174; (inhibition of tumor blood vessel formation) makes a sound scientific rationale for this combination approach. Additionally, the anti-angiogenic activity of GEN-1 mediated through up regulation of the interferon gamma (IFN-g) pathway may help to explain the remarkable synergy between GEN-1 and Avastin&#174; and potentially addresses the VEGF escape mechanisms associated with resistance to Avastin&#174; therapy. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Early Access Program. On January 13, 2015, we entered into an Early Access Agreement with Impatients N.V., a Netherlands company (Impatients), pursuant to which Impatients will develop and execute through its brand myTomorrows an early access program for ThermoDox&#174; in all countries of the European Union territory, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland for the treatment of patients with RCW breast cancer. Under the early access program, Impatients will engage in activities to secure authorization, exemption or waiver from regulatory authorities for patient use of ThermoDox&#174; that may otherwise be subject to approvals from such regulatory authorities before the sale and distribution of ThermoDox&#174; in the relevant territories. We will be responsible for the manufacture and supply of quantities of ThermoDox&#174; to Impatients for use in the early access program and Impatients will distribute and sell ThermoDox&#174; pursuant to such authorization, exemptions or waivers. On August 10, 2015, we expanded the Early Access Program with Impatients to include patients with primary liver cancer, also known as hepatocellular carcinoma, and liver cancer metastases, in all countries of the European Union territory, Switzerland, Turkey and Israel. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Thermo D ox &#174; Manufacturing and Supply Developments. 

&#160; 

On May 6, 2012, we entered into a long-term commercial supply agreement with Zhejiang Hisun Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. (Hisun) for the production of ThermoDox &#174; in mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau (the China territory). Hisun will be responsible for providing all of the technical and regulatory support services for the manufacture of ThermoDox &#174; in the China territory. In March 2015, the results of stability tests performed by Hisun demonstrated it successfully manufactured three registration batches of ThermoDox &#174; all of which show chemical equivalence with investigational product produced by the Company&#8217;s current contract manufacturer in the U.S. and we reimbursed Hisun for direct development costs and fees totaling $1.2 million as a result of their successful completion of these three registration batches of ThermoDox &#174; . We plan to qualify and seek regulatory approval for Hisun to serve as an approved global manufacturer of ThermoDox&#174;. 

&#160; 

On January 18, 2013, we broadened our relationship with Hisun by entering into a technology development contract, pursuant to which Hisun paid us a non-refundable research and development fee of $5.0 million to support our development of ThermoDox &#174;. Following our announcement of the HEAT Study results on January 31, 2013, we and Hisun agreed that the technology development contract entered into on January 18, 2013 will remain in effect while the parties continue to collaborate the next steps in relation to ThermoDox &#174; , which include the continued subgroup analysis of the Chinese cohort of patients in the HEAT Study for primary liver cancer and other activities to further the development of ThermoDox &#174; for the China territory. 

&#160; 

On July 19, 2013, we and Hisun entered into a Memorandum of Understanding to pursue ongoing collaborations for the continued clinical development of ThermoDox &#174; and the technology transfer relating to the commercial manufacture of ThermoDox &#174; for the China territory. This expanded collaboration includes development of the next generation liposomal formulation with the goal of creating safer, more efficacious versions of marketed cancer chemotherapeutics. 

&#160;

Our current efforts and resources are applied on the development and commercialization of cancer drugs including tumor-targeting chemotherapy treatments using focused heat energy in combination with heat-activated drug delivery systems, immunotherapies and RNA-based therapies. To support our research and development, we raised gross proceeds of approximately $125 million in equity financings and warrant and option exercises in the years 2009 through 2014. During 2015, we raised gross proceeds of $8.0 million through a registered direct equity financing with two institutional investors and raised an additional $0.6 million through the utilization of our at-the-market equity facility. We had cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and interest receivable totaling $20.1 million at December 31, 2015. We have one credit facility for a total principle amount of up to $20 million and have drawn down $10 million under this credit facility. 

&#160;

As a result of the risks and uncertainties discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, among others, we are unable to estimate the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects or when, if ever, and to what extent we will receive cash inflows from the commercialization and sale of a product. Our inability to complete any of our research and development activities, preclinical studies or clinical trials in a timely manner or our failure to enter into collaborative agreements when appropriate could significantly increase our capital requirements and could adversely impact our liquidity. While our estimated future capital requirements are uncertain and could increase or decrease as a result of many factors, including the extent to which we choose to advance our research, development activities, preclinical studies and clinical trials, or if we are in a position to pursue manufacturing or commercialization activities, we will need significant additional capital to develop our product candidates through development and clinical trials, obtain regulatory approvals and manufacture and commercialize approved products, if any. We do not know whether we will be able to access additional capital when needed or on terms favorable to us or our stockholders. Our inability to raise additional capital, or to do so on terms reasonably acceptable to us, would jeopardize the future success of our business. 

&#160; 

As a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company, our business and our ability to execute our strategy to achieve our corporate goals are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. Material risks and uncertainties relating to our business and our industry are described in " Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors " in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

&#160; 

THERMODOX &#174; (DOXORUBICIN ENCAPSULATED IN HEAT-ACTIVATED LIPOSOME) 

&#160; 

Liposomes are manufactured submicroscopic vesicles consisting of a discrete aqueous central compartment surrounded by a membrane bilayer composed of naturally occurring lipids. Conventional liposomes have been designed and manufactured to carry drugs and increase residence time, thus allowing the drugs to remain in the bloodstream for extended periods of time before they are removed from the body. However, the current existing liposomal formulations of cancer drugs and liposomal cancer drugs under development do not provide for the immediate release of the drug and the direct targeting of organ specific tumors, two important characteristics that are required for improving the efficacy of cancer drugs such as doxorubicin. A team of research scientists at Duke University developed a heat-sensitive liposome that rapidly changes its structure when heated to a threshold minimum temperature of 39.5&#186; to 42&#186; Celsius. Heating creates channels in the liposome bilayer that allow an encapsulated drug to rapidly disperse into the surrounding tissue. Through a perpetual, world-wide, exclusive development and commercialization license from Duke University, Celsion has licensed this novel, heat-activated liposomal technology that is differentiated from other liposomes through its unique low heat-activated release of encapsulated chemotherapeutic agents. 

&#160; 

We are using several available focused-heat technologies, such as radio frequency ablation (RFA), microwave energy and high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU), to activate the release of drugs from our novel heat sensitive liposomes. 

&#160; 

THERMODOX&#174; IN RELATION TO PRIMARY LIVER CANCER 

&#160; 

Liver Cancer Overview 

Primary liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma or HCC) is one of the most common and deadliest forms of cancer worldwide. It ranks as the fifth most common solid tumor cancer. It is estimated that up to 90% of liver cancer patients will die within five years of diagnosis. The incidence of primary liver cancer is approximately 30,000 cases per year in the United States, approximately 40,000 cases per year in Europe and is rapidly growing worldwide at approximately 800,000 cases per year. HCC has the fastest rate of growth of all cancers and is projected to be the most prevalent form of cancer by 2020. HCC is commonly diagnosed in patients with longstanding hepatic disease and cirrhosis (primarily due to hepatitis C in the U.S. and Europe and hepatitis B in Asia). 

&#160; 

At an early stage, the standard first line treatment for liver cancer is surgical resection of the tumor. Up to 80% of patients are ineligible for surgery or transplantation at time of diagnosis because early stage liver cancer generally has few symptoms and when finally detected the tumor frequently is too large for surgical resection. There are few alternative treatments, since radiation therapy and chemotherapy are largely ineffective in treating liver cancer. For tumors generally up to 5 centimeters in diameter, RFA has emerged as the standard of care treatment which directly destroys the tumor tissue through the application of high temperatures administered by a probe inserted into the core of the tumor. Local recurrence rates after RFA directly correlate to the size of the tumor. For tumors 3 cm or smaller in diameter the recurrence rate has been reported to be 10 &#8211; 20%; however, for tumors greater than 3 cm, local recurrence rates of 40% or higher have been observed. 

&#160; 

Celsion&#8217;s Approach 

While RFA uses extremely high temperatures (greater than 80&#176; Celsius) to ablate the tumor, it may fail to treat micro-metastases in the outer margins of the ablation zone because temperatures in the periphery may not be high enough to destroy cancer cells. Celsion&#8217;s ThermoDox &#174; treatment approach is designed to utilize the ability of RFA devices to ablate the center of the tumor while simultaneously thermally activating our ThermoDox &#174; liposome to release its encapsulated doxorubicin to kill remaining viable cancer cells throughout the heated region, including the tumor ablation margins. This novel treatment approach is intended to deliver the drug directly to those cancer cells that survive RFA. This approach will also increase the delivery of the doxorubicin at the desired tumor site while potentially reducing drug exposure distant to the tumor site. 

&#160; 

Phase I Clinical Trial - Primary Liver Cancer 

In the second quarter of 2007, we completed our first Phase I single dose escalation clinical trial that investigated ThermoDox &#174; in combination with RFA for the treatment of primary and metastatic liver cancer. The study was carried out at the National Cancer Institute (NCI), which is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and Queen Mary Hospital in Hong Kong. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

In 2007 we initiated a second Phase I dose escalation study designed to investigate simplification of the current RFA/ThermoDox &#174; treatment regimen including a single vial formulation of ThermoDox &#174; designed for commercial distribution. The study also permitted multiple dosing in liver cancer patients. This clinical trial was completed in 2008. 

&#160; 

701 Patient Phase III Global Clinical Trial - Primary Liver Cancer (The HEAT Study) 

The HEAT Study for ThermoDox &#174; , in combination with RFA, was conducted in patients with primary liver cancer under a Special Protocol Assessment agreed to with the FDA. The Special Protocol Assessment (SPA) agreed to with the FDA specified PFS as the HEAT Study&#8217;s primary endpoint. We scheduled a meeting with the HEAT Study independent DMC on January 30, 2013 in order to conduct an analysis of the HEAT Study&#8217;s PFS endpoint. Following review by the DMC, on January 31, 2013, we announced that ThermoDox &#174; in combination with RFA did not meet the HEAT Study&#8217;s primary endpoint of PFS. Specifically, we determined, after conferring with the DMC, that the HEAT Study did not meet the goal of demonstrating persuasive evidence of clinical effectiveness that could form the basis for regulatory approval in the population chosen for the HEAT Study. The HEAT Study was designed to show a 33 percent improvement in PFS with 80 percent power and a p-value = 0.05. In the trial, ThermoDox &#174; was well-tolerated with no unexpected serious adverse events. 

&#160; 

As provided for in the SPA, we continue to follow the patients enrolled in the HEAT Study to the secondary endpoint of overall survival. We have evaluated data from eight sweeps of Overall Survival since the announcement of the HEAT Study&#8217;s primary endpoint result, with each showing progressive improvement in statistical significance. The most recent post-hoc OS analysis from the HEAT Study (as of July 15, 2015 and announced on August 6, 2015) demonstrated that in a large, well bounded subgroup of patients (n=285, 41% of the study patients), the combination of ThermoDox&#174; and optimized RFA provided a 58% improvement in OS compared to optimized RFA alone. The Hazard Ratio at this latest OS analysis is 0.63 (95% CI 0.43 - 0.93) with a p-value of 0.0198. Median overall survival for the ThermoDox&#174; group has been reached in this subgroup which translates into a 25.4 month (2.1 year) survival benefit over the optimized RFA only group (79 months for the ThermoDox&#174; plus optimized RFA group versus 53.6 months for the optimized RFA only group). These data continue to strongly suggest that ThermoDox &#174; may significantly improve Overall Survival compared to a RFA control in patients whose lesions undergo optimized RFA treatment for 45 minutes or more as well as support the protocol for our Phase III OPTIMA Study as described below. 

&#160; 

We also completed computational modeling with supplementary prospective preclinical animal studies which support the relationship between heating duration and clinical outcomes. 

&#160; 

550 Patient Phase III Global Clinical Trial - Primary Liver Cancer (The OPTIMA Study) 

Based on the Overall Survival data from the post-hoc analysis of results from the HEAT Study, we submitted our proposed pivotal Phase III clinical protocol for FDA review in the fourth quarter of 2013. On February 24, 2014, we announced that the FDA, after its customary 30 day review period, accepted without comment, subject to compliance with regulatory standards, clearance for the OPTIMA Study, our pivotal, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III trial of ThermoDox &#174; in combination with standardized RFA in primary liver cancer. The OPTIMA Study trial design is based on a comprehensive analysis of data from the HEAT Study. 

&#160; 

Designed with extensive input from globally recognized HCC researchers and clinicians and after formal written consultation with the FDA, the OPTIMA Study was launched in the first half of 2014. The OPTIMA Study is expected to enroll up to 550 patients globally at up to 75 sites in the United States, Canada, Europe, China and elsewhere in the Asia Pacific region, and will evaluate ThermoDox &#174; in combination with standardized RFA, which will require a minimum of 45 minutes across all investigators and clinical sites for treating lesions 3 to 7 centimeters, versus standardized RFA alone. The primary endpoint for the trial is Overall Survival, and the secondary endpoints for the trial are PFS and safety. The OPTIMA Study is 80% powered to show a 33% improvement in OS. The statistical plan calls for two interim efficacy analyses by an independent DMC. 

&#160; 

On December 16, 2015, we announced that we received approval from the CFDA to conduct the OPTIMA Study in China. This clinical trial application approval will allow Celsion to enroll patients at up to 20 clinical sites in China. With the addition of these Chinese clinical sites, the Company expects to complete enrollment in the OPTIMA Study around the end of 2017. Results from the OPTIMA Study, if successful, will provide the basis for a global registration filing and marketing approval. 

&#160; 

We will continue with partnerships, such as our arrangement with Hisun and Yakult Pharmaceuticals to the extent feasible. In addition, we have assessed our product pipeline and research and development priorities. As we evaluate strategic alternatives, we will need to consider a number of factors, including investment in, or acquisition of, complementary businesses, technologies or products, possible capital raising transactions, partnering opportunities and working capital requirements. We expect that the strength of our balance sheet will afford us the opportunity to evaluate our future development plans. However, as demonstrated by the HEAT Study results announced on January 31, 2013, drug research and development is an inherently uncertain process and there is a high risk of failure at every stage prior to approval. The timing and the outcome of clinical results is extremely difficult to predict. Clinical development successes and failures can have a disproportionate positive or negative impact on our scientific and medical prospects, financial prospects, financial condition and market value.

THERMODOX&#174; IN RELATION TO CANCERS OTHER THAN PRIMARY LIVER CANCER 

&#160; 

Recurrent Chest Wall (RCW) Breast Cancer Overview &#160; 

Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in women in both the United States and the world. Despite a variety of therapeutic approaches, up to 40% of the estimated 95,000 patients in the United States undergoing a mastectomy as their primary treatment will develop locally recurrent RCW breast cancer. There is currently no effective chemotherapeutic standard of care for RCW breast cancer and as a result, many of these patients will die within two years of the recurrence. Patients with RCW breast cancer suffer from disfiguring tumors and other symptoms including pain, foul-smelling wounds, and a very visual reminder of tumor progression. 

&#160; 

Celsion&#8217;s Approach &#160; 

We have been actively seeking a targeted localized treatment for breast cancer using ThermoDox&#174; in conjunction with localized microwave hyperthermia to treat RCW breast cancer. Studies at Duke University and other centers have indicated that heat may improve the therapeutic action of non-temperature sensitive liposomal doxorubicin formulations in advanced loco-regional breast cancer. Our liposomal encapsulated doxorubicin is released by heat generated from an external microwave tissue hyperthermia device that is placed on a woman&#8217;s chest. The microwave hyperthermia heats the target to a temperature adequate to activate ThermoDox&#174; but not to ablate the tissue like RFA. Upon heating to 39.5&#186; to 42&#186; C, a significant concentration of doxorubicin is released directly to the tumor. As in our liver cancer program, we use a commercially available thermotherapy device to heat the target tissue and activate ThermoDox&#174; at the desired target site. 

&#160; 

Microwave hyperthermia as a separate standalone treatment has been found to have the ability to kill breast cancer cells. Because breast cancer cells have higher water content than surrounding normal cells, the tumor is heated to a greater extent than normal breast tissue and is selectively destroyed. Therefore, heating cancer cells with a microwave device for sixty minutes at 43&#176;C has been found to be tumoricidal. We expect that the combination of microwave hyperthermia and ThermoDox&#174; will be more efficacious than microwave hyperthermia alone or treatment with existing non-heat activated liposomal formulations. 

&#160; 

Breast Cancer Phase I/II Clinical Trial - The DIGNITY Study 

In 2009, the Company commenced an open label, dose-escalating ThermoDox &#174; Phase I/Phase II clinical trial for patients with RCW breast cancer &#8211; (the DIGNITY Study). The DIGNITY Study is designed to establish a safe therapeutic dose in Phase I, and in Phase II to demonstrate local control, including complete and partial responses, and stable disease as its primary endpoint. The DIGNITY Study is also planned to evaluate kinetics in ThermoDox&#174; produced from more than one manufacturing site. 

&#160; 

The Company completed enrollment of the Phase I portion of the study in 2010. The enrollment of the DIGNITY Study commenced in the first quarter of 2013 and completed in mid-2015. The trial evaluated ThermoDox&#174; in combination with mild hyperthermia and enrolled 28 patients at five clinical sites in the United States in both phases of the study. On December 14, 2015, we announced final data from the DIGNITY Study of ThermoDox &#174; in RCW Breast Cancer at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium. Of the 28 patients enrolled and treated, 21 patients were eligible for evaluation of efficacy. Thirteen patients, representing approximately 62% of the evaluable patients, experienced a local response, including six complete responses and seven partial responses. These data are consistent with the combined clinical data from the two previous Phase I trials discussed below. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Duke University conducted a Phase I dose escalating ThermoDox&#174; study in patients with RCW breast cancer and has presented preliminary results from the 16 enrolled patients that characterize the safety of the drug in RCW patients and the feasibility of ThermoDox&#174; administration in these patients. In December 2013, we announced combined clinical data from our DIGNITY study and the Duke University sponsored Phase I trial of ThermoDox&#174; plus hyperthermia in RCW breast cancer. The two similarly designed Phase I studies enrolled patients with highly resistant tumors found on the chest wall and who had progressed on previous therapy including chemotherapy, radiation therapy and hormone therapy. ThermoDox&#174; in combination with mild hyperthermia was evaluated in these patients in up to six cycles. Both studies employed an open label 3+3 dose escalation study design to determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose, evaluate safety and determine early effects of ThermoDox&#174; in combination with mild hyperthermia. There were 29 patients treated in the two trials, including 11 patients in the DIGNITY Study and 18 patients in the Duke study. Of the 29 patients, 23 were eligible for evaluation of efficacy. A local response rate of over 60 percent was reported in 14 of the 23 evaluable patients with five complete responses and nine partial responses. 

&#160; 

Breast Cancer Phase II Clinical Trial - The Euro-DIGNITY Study 

The Company anticipates that a Phase II study of RadioTherapy, HyperThermia and ThermoDox &#174; to treat patients with local-regional recurrent chest wall breast cancer will be initiated by six to eight clinical sites located in Italy, Israel, the Netherlands, Poland and the Czech Republic (the Euro-DIGNITY Study). The Euro-DIGNITY Study is expected to commence in the second half of 2016 and should enroll up to 70 patients affected by recurrent breast adenocarcinoma on the chest wall with/without nodes over a period of two years. 

&#160; 

The primary objectives of the Euro-DIGNITY Study will be (i) to evaluate efficacy in patients after 3 cycles of ThermoDox &#174; plus Hyperthermia measuring tumor diameter as a response to therapy and (ii) to evaluate loco-regional breast tumor control in patients who undergo ThermoDox &#174; /hyperthermia/radiotherapy as measured by target lesion clinical response rate combining a RECIST criteria with digital photography to gauge response. 

&#160; 

Secondary objectives of the Euro-DIGNITY Study will be (i) to evaluate the safety of the combination of ThermoDox/Hyperthermia/Radiotherapy among patients with local-regional recurrence (LRR) breast cancer, (ii) to evaluate the duration of local control complete response, partial response and stable disease following treatment with ThermoDox/Hyperthermia/Radiotherapy up to 24 months among patients with LRR breast cancer and (iii) to assess Patient Reported Quality of Life using the FACT-B and Brief Pain Inventory following treatment with ThermoDox/Hyperthermia/Radiotherapy among patients with LRR breast cancer. 

&#160; 

GEN-1 (IL-12 DNA PLASMID VECTOR ENCASED IN A NANOPARTICLE DELIVERY SYSTEM) and Other RNA and DNA Therapies 

&#160; 

On June 20, 2014, we completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of EGEN, Inc. (EGEN) pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement (EGEN Asset Purchase Agreement). CLSN Laboratories acquired all of EGEN&#8217;s right, title and interest in and to substantially all of the assets of EGEN, including cash and cash equivalents, patents, trademarks and other intellectual property rights, clinical data, certain contracts, licenses and permits, equipment, furniture, office equipment, furnishings, supplies and other tangible personal property. In addition, CLSN Laboratories assumed certain specified liabilities of EGEN, including the liabilities arising out of the acquired contracts and other assets relating to periods after the closing date. The EGEN Purchase Agreement contains customary representations and warranties regarding EGEN and Celsion, covenants regarding the conduct of EGEN&#8217;s business prior to the consummation of the Acquisition, indemnification provisions, termination and other provisions customary for transactions of this nature. 

&#160; 

In the acquisition, we acquired GEN-1, an IL-12 DNA plasmid vector encased in a nanoparticle delivery system which enables cell transfection followed by persistent, local secretion of the IL-12 protein, and three platform technologies for the development of treatments for those suffering with difficult-to-treat forms of cancer, novel nucleic acid-based immunotherapies and other anti-cancer DNA or RNA therapies, including TheraPlas&#8482; and TheraSilence&#8482;. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Ovarian Cancer Overview 

Ovarian cancer is the most lethal of gynecological malignancies among women with an overall five year survival rate of 45%. This poor outcome is due in part to the lack of effective prevention and early detection strategies. There were approximately 22,000 new cases of ovarian cancer in the U.S. in 2014 with an estimated 14,000 deaths. Mortality rates for ovarian cancer declined very little in the last forty years due to the unavailability of detection tests and improved treatments. Most women with ovarian cancer are not diagnosed until Stages III or IV, when the disease has spread outside the pelvis to the abdomen and areas beyond causing swelling and pain, where the five-year survival rates are 25 to 41 percent and 11 percent, respectively. First-line chemotherapy regimens are typically platinum-based combination therapies. Although this first line of treatment has an approximate 80 percent response rate, 55 to 75 percent of women will develop recurrent ovarian cancer within two years and ultimately will not respond to platinum therapy. Patients whose cancer recurs or progresses after initially responding to surgery and first-line chemotherapy have been divided into one of the two groups based on the time from completion of platinum therapy to disease recurrence or progression. This time period is referred to as platinum-free interval. The platinum-sensitive group has a platinum-free interval of longer than six months. This group generally responds to additional treatment with platinum-based therapies. The platinum-resistant group has a platinum-free interval of shorter than six months and is resistant to additional platinum-based treatments. Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, topotecan, and Avastin are the only approved second-line therapies for platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. The overall response rate for these therapies is 10 to 20 percent with median overall survival of eleven to twelve months. Immunotherapy is an attractive novel approach for the treatment of ovarian cancer particularly since ovarian cancers are considered immunogenic tumors. IL-12 is one of the most active cytokines for the induction of potent anti-cancer immunity acting through the induction of T-lymphocyte and natural killer cell proliferation. The precedence for a therapeutic role of IL-12 in ovarian cancer is based on epidemiologic and preclinical data. 

&#160; 

Celsion&#8217;s Approach 

Celsion&#8217;s GEN-1 approach for IL-12 delivery is designed to achieve local concentrations of IL-12 at the tumor site with minimal increases in systemic circulation. This DNA-based approach involves intraperitoneal administration of an IL-12 plasmid formulated with a proprietary lipopolymer delivery system PEG-PEI-Cholesterol. In this approach, our GEN-1 immunotherapy is combined with standard chemotherapy drugs to achieve better clinical outcome than with chemotherapy alone. Increases in IL-12 concentrations at the tumor site for several days (up to one week) after a single administration will create a potent immune environment against the tumor and a direct killing of the tumor with concomitant use of cytotoxic chemotherapy together will result in more robust and durable antitumor response than chemotherapy alone. The activation of the body&#8217;s immune system will potentially eliminate the chemotherapy resistant cells and lower the risk of recurrence. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

GEN-1 OVATION Study 

We have initiated a Phase I dose-escalation clinical trial of GEN-1 in combination with the standard of care in neo-adjuvant ovarian cancer (the OVATION Study) at four clinical sites, including the University of Alabama at Birmingham, Oklahoma University Medical Center, Washington University in St. Louis and the Medical College of Wisconsin. The OVATION Study will seek to identify a safe, tolerable and therapeutically active dose of GEN-1 in newly diagnosed ovarian cancer patients who will be undergoing neo-adjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgical resection of their tumors. The trial is expected to enroll three to six patients per dose level and will evaluate safety and efficacy and attempt to define an optimal dose for a follow-on Phase I/II study combining GEN-1 with Avastin&#174; and Doxil&#174;. In addition, the OVATION Study establishes a unique opportunity to assess how cytokine-based compounds such as GEN-1, directly affects ovarian cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment in newly diagnosed patients. The study is designed to characterize the nature of the immune response triggered by GEN-1 at various levels of the patients&#39; immune system, including: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

infiltration of cancer fighting T-cell lymphocytes into primary tumor and tumor microenvironment including peritoneal cavity, which is the primary site of metastasis of ovarian cancer; 

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; changes in local and systemic levels of immuno-stimulatory and immunosuppressive cytokines associated with tumor suppression and growth, respectively; and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; expression profile of a comprehensive panel of immune related genes in pre-treatment and GEN-1-treated tumor tissue. &#160;

These extensive mechanistic studies will assist in the design of novel combination approaches with immunotherapies and other anti-cancer agents driven by potential synergistic action mechanisms, and define an enhanced patient population based on molecular characteristics inherent to tumor tissue or the immune system. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

On February 12, 2016, we announced the completion of enrollment of the first cohort of patients in the OVATION Study combining GEN-1, the Company&#39;s DNA-based immunotherapy, with the standard of care for the treatment of newly-diagnosed ovarian cancer patients who will undergo neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgical resection of their tumor. The first two patients in the OVATION Study who completed treatment have shown promising results. Both patients reported stable disease with a drop in their cancer antigen 125 (CA-125) protein levels of 89% and 98% respectively. CA-125 is used to monitor certain cancers during and after treatment and is present in greater concentrations in ovarian cancer cells than in other cells. A 50% reduction in CA-125 levels is considered meaningful. Both patients&#8217; CA-125 levels were below the normal healthy level of 35 U/mL. In addition, both patients experienced successful surgical resections of their tumors with one patient reporting a R0 resection which indicates a microscopically margin-negative resection in which no gross or microscopic tumor remains in the tumor bed. 

&#160; 

The OVATION Study will continue into 2016 at higher doses of GEN-1 with the goal to identify a safe, tolerable and therapeutically active dose of GEN-1 by recruiting and maximizing an immune response. 

&#160; 

GEN-1 + Avastin&#174; + Doxil Combination Study in Platinum Resistant Ovarian Cancer 

In April 2015, we announced plans to expand our ovarian cancer development program to include a Phase 1 dose escalating trial evaluating GEN-1 in combination with Avastin&#174; and Doxil&#174; in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer patients. 

&#160; 

This new combination study in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer is supported by three preclinical studies indicating that the combination of GEN-1 with Avastin&#174; may result in clinical benefit with a favorable safety profile, as well as the prior Phase 1b trial of GEN-1 plus Doxil&#174; in platinum resistant ovarian cancer patients. Specifically: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

In two preclinical studies using an animal model of disseminated ovarian cancer, GEN-1 in combination with Avastin&#174; led to a significant reduction in tumor burden and disease progression. The effectiveness of the combined treatment was seen when GEN-1 was combined with various dose levels of Avastin&#174; (low-medium-high). Additionally, it was shown that GEN-1 treatment alone resulted in anti-tumor activity that was as good as or better than Avastin&#174; treatment alone. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

The preclinical studies indicated that no obvious overt toxicities were associated with the combined treatments. The preclinical data are also consistent with the mechanism of action for GEN-1, which exhibits certain anti-angiogenic properties and suggests that combining GEN-1 with lower doses of Avastin&#174; may enhance efficacy and help reduce the known toxicities associated with this anti-VEGF drug. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

The distinct biological activities of GEN-1 (immune stimulation) and Avastin&#174; (inhibition of tumor blood vessel formation) makes a sound scientific rationale for this combination approach. Additionally, the anti-angiogenic activity of GEN-1 mediated through up regulation of the interferon gamma (IFN-g) pathway may help to explain the remarkable synergy between GEN-1 and Avastin&#174; and potentially addresses the VEGF escape mechanisms associated with resistance to Avastin&#174; therapy. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

In a 16-patient Phase 1b study of GEN-1 in combination study in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, there were no overlapping toxicities between GEN-1 and pegylated doxorubicin (Doxil&#174;). Biological activity and clinical efficacy results, including disease control rates, translational data and survival rates, have been submitted for presentation at the American Society of Clinical Oncologist (ASCO) Annual Meeting. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

On October 12, 2015, we announced the results of an additional preclinical study to support an Investigational New Drug filing with the FDA for the planned Phase I/II combination study. The study will be designed to optimize the dosing regimen for GEN-1 in combination with Avastin&#174; + Doxil&#174; and is expected to enroll approximately 12 to 18 patients. Results from the comprehensive preclinical studies showed that GEN-1 when combined with Avastin&#174; and Doxil&#174;, standard of care for platinum resistant patients, indicated a greater than 98% reduction in tumor burden when compared to the untreated control group. The findings represent a reduction in tumor burden and disease progression when compared to the combination of Avastin&#174; and Doxil&#174; in a SKOV3 human cell line implanted into immunocompromised (nude) mice. The study was designed to evaluate in a mouse model of disseminated ovarian cancer, the efficacy of a combined treatment regimen that consisted of weekly administrations of GEN-1 with therapeutically relevant doses of Doxil&#174; and Avastin&#174;. In the study, the combination of GEN-1 with Avastin&#174; and Doxil&#174; showed a robust anti-tumor advantage compared to untreated animals as well as a statistically significant improvement over the combination of Avastin&#174; and Doxil&#174; as summarized below: 

&#160;

&#160; &#160; &#160; 

Analysis of serum chemistry and hematology suggested no overt toxicities associated with the combined treatments. The preclinical data are consistent with the mechanism of action for GEN-1, which exhibits certain anti-angiogenic properties in addition to its well-characterized immunomodulatory activities. 

&#160; 

THERAPLAS &#8482; TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM &#160; 

TheraPlas&#8482; is a technology platform for the delivery of DNA and messenger RNA (mRNA) therapeutics via synthetic non-viral carriers and is capable of providing cell transfection for double-stranded DNA plasmids and large therapeutic RNA segments such as mRNA. There are two components of the TheraPlas&#8482; system, a plasmid DNA or mRNA payload encoding a therapeutic protein, and a delivery system. The delivery system is designed to protect the DNA/RNA from degradation and promote trafficking into cells and through intracellular compartments. We designed the delivery system of TheraPlas&#8482; by chemically modifying the low molecular weight polymer to improve its gene transfer activity without increasing toxicity. We believe that TheraPlas&#8482; is a viable alternative to current approaches to gene delivery due to several distinguishing characteristics, including enhanced molecular versatility that allows for complex modifications to improve activity and safety. 

&#160; 

The design of TheraPlas&#8482; delivery systems is based on molecular functionalization of polyethyleneimine (PEI), a cationic delivery polymer with a distinct ability to escape from the endosomes due to heavy protonation. The transfection activity and toxicity of PEI is tightly coupled to its molecular weight therefore the clinical application of PEI is limited. We have used molecular functionalization strategies to improve the activity of low molecular weight PEIs without augmenting their cytotoxicity. In one instance, chemical conjugation of a low molecular weight branched BPEI1800 with cholesterol and polyethylene glycol (PEG) to form PEG-PEI-Cholesterol (PPC) dramatically improved the transfection activity of BPEI1800 following in vivo delivery. Together, the cholesterol and PEG modifications produced approximately 20-fold enhancement in transfection activity. Biodistribution studies following intraperitoneal or subcutaneous administration of DNA/PPC nanocomplexes showed DNA delivery localized primarily at the injection site with only small amount escaped into systemic circulation. PPC is the delivery component of our lead TheraPlas product, GEN-1, which is in clinical development for the treatment ovarian cancer and in preclinical development for the treatment of glioblastoma. The PPC manufacturing process has been scaled up from bench scale (1-2 g) to 0.6Kg, and several cGMP lots have been produced with reproducible quality. 

&#160; 

Another approach to improve PEI activity involved crosslinking low-molecular-weight PEIs through degradable linkages to create larger and degradable structures. Two cross-linked polymers have been synthesized with this approach and optimized for transfection activity. Both cross-linked polymers expressed several fold higher transfection activity than their respective monomers and lower cyotoxicity than a commercially available 25 kDa polymer. One embodiment of the polymer is being developed for in vivo delivery of plasmid DNA and mRNA. Intravenous administration of the nanoparticles carrying DNA or mRNA payload in mice has produced expression with high degree of lung specificity. The lung specificity and safety for mRNA delivery following intravenous administration in mice has been confirmed in non-human primates. These results demonstrate potential clinical utility for delivery of therapeutic DNA and RNA for lung diseases and pulmonary disorders. 

&#160; 

TheraPlas&#8482; has emerged as a viable alternative to current approaches due to several distinguishing characteristics such as excellent molecular versatility that allows for complex modifications to improve activity and safety with little difficulty. The biocompatibility of these polymers reduces the risk of adverse immune response, thus allowing for repeated administration. Compared to naked DNA or cationic lipids, TheraPlas&#8482; is generally safer, more efficient, and cost effective. We believe that these advantages place Celsion in an excellent position to capitalize on the technology. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

THERASILENCE &#8482; TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM 

TheraSilence&#8482; is a technology platform for the delivery of synthetically-generated inhibitory RNA (RNAi) such as small inhibitory RNAs (siRNAs), microRNAs, anti-microRNAs, microRNA mimics, and related molecules that can regulate protein expression at the transcript level by exploiting endogenous cell mechanisms. Inhibitory RNA-based therapies have tremendous potential for targeting virtually any disease related gene with a high degree of specificity and thus eliminating so called &#8220;non-drugable&#8221; target classes. The TheraSilence technology addresses the primary obstacle to nucleic acid-based therapeutics which is the efficient delivery to target cells. Specifically, a delivery system needs to be able to protect the RNAi from nuclease degradation, transfer the molecule across the cellular membranes and release the material so that it can be available to the endogenous RNA silencing machinery. We have developed proprietary, novel structures that are able to interact with the RNAi molecules forming protective nanoparticles that can be readily taken up into cells. In addition, these systems are chemically flexible and amenable to attachment of tissue-targeted ligands, in vivo stabilizing agents and other functional moieties which can tailor a formulation for a particular application and delivery modality. We believe that these features can provide high specificity for RNAi delivery to select tissue, enhance stability and reduce in vivo toxicity. In-vivo proof-of-concept studies of our most advanced system have shown the ability to deliver RNAi molecules specifically to the pulmonary vascular following intravenous administration. Using this delivery system we have been able to show in mice that delivery of a siRNA molecule that targets anti-vascular endothelial receptor 2 (VEGF2), a protein that is critical for the growth of new blood vessels in tumors, can significantly inhibit lung tumor growth. Additionally, delivery of an anti-micro RNA molecule into rats with experimentally induced pulmonary arterial hypertension was able to normalize vascular remodeling that occurs in the lung and restore cardiac function that is compromised as a result of the disease. This suggests that this delivery system can effective deliver numerous potentially therapeutic molecular targets and may have application for the treatment of numerous lung diseases. 

&#160; 

BUSINESS STRATEGY 

An element of our business strategy has been to pursue, as resources permit, the research and development of a range of product candidates for a variety of indications. We may also evaluate licensing cancer products from third parties for cancer treatments to expand our current product pipeline. This is intended to allow us to diversify the risks associated with our research and development expenditures. To the extent we are unable to maintain a broad range of product candidates, our dependence on the success of one or a few product candidates would increase and results such as those announced in relation to the HEAT study on January 31, 2013 will have a more significant impact on our financial prospects, financial condition and market value. We may also consider and evaluate strategic alternatives, including investment in, or acquisition of, complementary businesses, technologies or products. As demonstrated by the HEAT Study results, drug research and development is an inherently uncertain process and there is a high risk of failure at every stage prior to approval. The timing and the outcome of clinical results are extremely difficult to predict. The success or failure of any preclinical development and clinical trial can have a disproportionately positive or negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition, prospects and market value. 

&#160; 

As a result of the risks and uncertainties discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, among others, we are unable to estimate the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects or when, if ever, and to what extent we will receive cash inflows from the commercialization and sale of a product if one of our product candidates receives regulatory approval for marketing, if at all. Our inability to complete any of our research and development activities, preclinical studies or clinical trials in a timely manner or our failure to enter into collaborative agreements when appropriate could significantly increase our capital requirements and could adversely impact our liquidity. While our estimated future capital requirements are uncertain and could increase or decrease as a result of many factors, including the extent to which we choose to advance our research and development activities, preclinical studies and clinical trials, or whether we are in a position to pursue manufacturing or commercialization activities, we will need significant additional capital to develop our product candidates through development and clinical trials, obtain regulatory approvals and manufacture and commercialize approved products, if any. We do not know whether we will be able to access additional capital when needed or on terms favorable to us or our stockholders. Our inability to raise additional capital, or to do so on terms reasonably acceptable to us, would jeopardize the future success of our business. 

&#160; 

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURES 

We are engaged in a limited amount of research and development in our own facilities and have sponsored research programs in partnership with various research institutions, including the National Cancer Institute and Duke University. We are currently, with minimal cash expenditures, sponsoring clinical and pre-clinical research at the University of Oxford, University of Utrecht, Brigham and Women&#8217;s Hospital and the University of Washington. The majority of the spending in research and development is for the funding of ThermoDox&#174; clinical trials. Research and development expenses were approximately $14.7 million, $15.0 million and $9.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. See Item 7 &#8211; Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation s for additional information regarding expenditures related to our research and development programs.

&#160; 

GOVERNMENT REGULATION 

Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, quality control, approval, manufacturing, labeling, post-approval monitoring and reporting, recordkeeping, packaging, promotion, storage, advertising, distribution, marketing and export and import of pharmaceutical products such as those we are developing. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources 

&#160; 

Regulation in the United States 

In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) and implementing regulations. Failure to comply with the applicable FDA requirements at any time pre- or post-approval may result in a delay of approval or administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDA&#39;s imposition of a clinical hold on trials, refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, issuance of warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. 

&#160; 

Research and Development 

The vehicle by which FDA approves a new pharmaceutical product for sale and marketing in the United States is a New Drug Application (NDA). The steps ordinarily required before a new drug can be marketed in the U.S. include (a) completion of pre-clinical and clinical studies; (b) submission and FDA acceptance of an Investigational New Drug application (IND), which must become effective before human clinical trials may commence; (c) completion of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product to support each of its proposed indications; (d) submission and FDA acceptance of a NDA; and (e) FDA review and approval of the NDA. 

&#160; 

Pre-clinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity, formulation and stability, as well as animal studies, to assess the potential safety and efficacy of the product. Pre-clinical safety tests must be conducted by laboratories that comply with FDA regulations regarding good laboratory practice. The results of pre-clinical tests are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND and are reviewed by the FDA before the commencement of human clinical trials. Submission of an IND will not necessarily result in FDA authorization to commence clinical trials, and the absence of FDA objection to an IND does not necessarily mean that the FDA will ultimately approve an NDA or that a product candidate otherwise will come to market. 

&#160; 

Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of a qualified principal investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with good clinical practices under protocols submitted to the FDA as part of an IND and with patient informed consent. Also, each clinical trial must be approved by an Institutional Review Board (IRB), and is subject to ongoing IRB monitoring. 

&#160; 

Clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap or be combined. Phase I clinical trials may be conducted in patients or healthy volunteers to evaluate the product&#39;s safety, dosage tolerance and pharmacokinetics and, if possible, seek to gain an early indication of its effectiveness. Phase II clinical trials usually involve controlled trials in a larger but still relatively small number of subjects from the relevant patient population to evaluate dosage tolerance and appropriate dosage; identify possible short-term adverse effects and safety risks; and provide a preliminary evaluation of the efficacy of the drug for specific indications. Phase III clinical trials are typically conducted in a significantly larger patient population and are intended to further evaluate safety and efficacy, establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product, and provide an adequate basis for physician labeling. 

&#160; 

There can be no assurance that any of our clinical trials will be completed successfully within any specified time period or at all. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Either the FDA or we may suspend clinical trials at any time on various grounds, including among other things, if we, the FDA, or our independent DMC conclude that clinical subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. The FDA inspects and reviews clinical trial sites, informed consent forms, data from the clinical trial sites (including case report forms and record keeping procedures) and the performance of the protocols by clinical trial personnel to determine compliance with good clinical practices. The conduct of clinical trials is complex and difficult, and there can be no assurance that the design or the performance of the pivotal clinical trial protocols of any of our current or future product candidates will be successful. 

&#160; 

The results of pre-clinical studies and clinical trials, if successful, are submitted to FDA in the form of an NDA. The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort, and financial resources, and there can be no assurance that any approval will be granted for any product at any time, according to any schedule, or at all. The FDA may refuse to accept or approve an application if it determines that applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied. The FDA may also require additional testing for safety and efficacy. Even, if regulatory approval is granted, the approval will be limited to specific indications. There can be no assurance that any of our current product candidates will receive regulatory approvals for marketing or, if approved, that approval will be for any or all of the indications that we request. 

&#160; 

Orphan Drug Designation 

In 2009, the FDA granted orphan drug designation for ThermoDox &#174; for the treatment of HCC. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. However, if a product which has an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the indication for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means the FDA may not approve any other application to market the same drug for the same indication for a period of seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity. Orphan drug designation can also provide opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages and FDA user-fee benefits. 

&#160; 

Hatch-Waxman Exclusivity 

The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent data exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety. During the exclusivity period, the FDA generally may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company that references the previously approved drug. However, an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA referencing the new chemical entity may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. 

&#160; 

Post-Approval Requirements &#160; 

After FDA approval of a product is obtained, we and our contract manufacturers are required to comply with various post-approval requirements, including establishment registration and product listing, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse reactions and production problems to the FDA, providing updated safety and efficacy information, and complying with requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling. As a condition of approval of an NDA, the FDA may require the applicant to conduct additional clinical trials or other post market testing and surveillance to further monitor and assess the drug&#39;s safety and efficacy. The FDA can also impose other post-marketing controls on us as well as our products including, but not limited to, restrictions on sale and use, through the approval process, regulations and otherwise. The FDA also has the authority to require the recall of our products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in manufacture. A governmentally mandated recall, or a voluntary recall by us, could result from a number of events or factors, including component failures, manufacturing errors, instability of product or defects in labeling. 

&#160; 

In addition, manufacturing establishments in the U.S. and abroad are subject to periodic inspections by the FDA and must comply with current good manufacturing practices (cGMP). To maintain compliance with cGMP, manufacturers must expend funds, time and effort in the areas of production and quality control. 

&#160; 

Regulation Outside of the U.S. 

In addition to regulations in the U.S., we will be subject to regulations of other countries governing any clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our product candidates. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval by the comparable regulatory authorities of countries outside of the U.S. before we can commence clinical trials in such countries and approval of the regulators of such countries or economic areas, such as the European Union and China, before we may market products in those countries or areas. The approval process and requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from place to place, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Under European Union regulatory systems, a company may submit marketing authorization applications either under a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure, which is compulsory for medicines produced by biotechnology or those medicines intended to treat AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders or diabetes and is optional for those medicines that are highly innovative, provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all European Union member states. The decentralized procedure provides for mutual recognition of national approval decisions. Under this procedure, the holder of a national marketing authorization may submit an application to the remaining member states. Within 90 days of receiving the applications and assessments report, each member state must decide whether to recognize approval. If a member state does not recognize the marketing authorization, the disputed points are eventually referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all member states. 

&#160; 

In 2014, we filed a request for a Voluntary Harmonization Procedure (VHP) in Europe for the OPTIMA Study, which provides for the assessment of multinational clinical trial applications across several European countries, including Germany, Italy and Spain. Our request for a VHP in Europe for the OPTIMA Study was approved on October 23, 2014. 

&#160; 

In 2011, the European Commission granted orphan drug designation for ThermoDox &#174; for the treatment of HCC in Europe. As established by the EMA, orphan drug designation provides for scientific advice and regulatory assistance from the EMA, direct access to centralized marketing authorization and certain financial incentives, such as reduction of fees associated with pre-authorization inspections and marketing authorization application fees. The orphan drug designation in Europe also provides 10 years of market exclusivity subsequent to product approval. 

&#160; 

MANUFACTURING AND SUPPLY 

&#160; 

We do not currently own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of preclinical, clinical or commercial quantities of any of our product candidates. We currently contract with third party contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs) for our preclinical and clinical trial supplies, and we expect to continue to do so to meet the preclinical and any clinical requirements of our product candidates. We have agreements for the supply of such drug materials with manufacturers or suppliers that we believe have sufficient capacity to meet our demands. In addition, we believe that adequate alternative sources for such supplies exist. However, there is a risk that, if supplies are interrupted, it would materially harm our business. We typically order raw materials and services on a purchase order basis and do not enter into long-term dedicated capacity or minimum supply arrangements. 

&#160; 

Manufacturing is subject to extensive regulations that impose various procedural and documentation requirements, which govern record keeping, manufacturing processes and controls, personnel, quality control and quality assurance, among others. Our CMOs manufacture our product candidates under current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) conditions. cGMP is a regulatory standard for the production of pharmaceuticals that will be used in humans. 

&#160; 

SALES AND MARKETING 

&#160; 

Our current focus is on the development of our existing portfolio, the completion of clinical trials and, if and where appropriate, the registration of our product candidates. We currently do not have marketing, sales and distribution capabilities. If we receive marketing and commercialization approval for any of our product candidates, we intend to market the product either directly or through strategic alliances and distribution agreements with third parties. The ultimate implementation of our strategy for realizing the financial value of our product candidates is dependent on the results of clinical trials for our product candidates, the availability of regulatory approvals and the ability to negotiate acceptable commercial terms with third parties. 

&#160; 

PRODUCT LIABILITY AND INSURANCE 

&#160; 

Our business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the testing, manufacturing and marketing of human therapeutic products. We presently have product liability insurance limited to $10 million per incident, and if we were to be subject to a claim in excess of this coverage or to a claim not covered by our insurance and the claim succeeded, we would be required to pay the claim out of our own limited resources. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

COMPETITION 

&#160; 

Competition in the discovery and development of new methods for treating and preventing disease is intense. We face, and will continue to face, intense competition from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as academic and research institutions and government agencies both in the U.S. and abroad. We face significant competition from organizations pursuing the same or similar technologies used by us in our drug discovery efforts and from organizations developing pharmaceuticals that are competitive with our product candidates. 

&#160; 

Most of our competitors, either alone or together with their collaborative partners, have substantially greater financial resources and larger research and development staffs than we do. In addition, most of these organizations, either alone or together with their collaborators, have significantly greater experience than we do in developing products, undertaking preclinical testing and clinical trials, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of products, and manufacturing and marketing products. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical industry may result in even more resources being concentrated among our competitors. These companies, as well as academic institutions, governmental agencies, and private research organizations, also compete with us in recruiting and retaining highly qualified scientific personnel and consultants. Our ability to compete successfully with other companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology field also depends on the status of our collaborations and on the continuing availability of capital to us. 

&#160; 

ThermoDox&#174; &#160; 

Although there are many drugs and devices marketed and under development for the treatment of cancer, the Company is not aware of any other heat activated drug delivery product either being marketed or in human clinical development. In addition, the Company is not aware of any other Phase III clinical trial for the treatment of HCC or primary liver cancer. 

&#160; 

GEN-1 &#160; 

Studied indications for GEN-1 include ovarian cancer and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) brain cancer. In evaluating the competitive landscape for both indications, early stage indications are treated with chemotherapy (temozolomide, BCNU, CCNU for brain cancer; docetaxel, doxil and cisplatinum for ovarian cancer), while later stage ovarian and GBM cancer are treated with Bevacizumab - Avastin &#174; , an anti-angiogenesis inhibitor. Avastin &#174; is currently also being evaluated for early stage disease. 

&#160; 

In product positioning for both indications, there currently is no direct immunotherapy competitor for GEN-1, which will be studied as an adjuvant to both chemotherapy standard of care regimens, as well as anti-angiogenesis compounds. To support these cases, we have conducted clinical studies in combination with chemotherapy for ovarian cancer, and preclinical studies in combination with both temozolomide and Bevacizumab-Avastin &#174; . We plan to initiate a clinical study in platinum resistant ovarian cancer in the second half of 2016. 

&#160; 

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 

&#160; 

Licenses 

&#160; 

Duke University License Agreement 

In 1999, we entered into a license agreement with Duke University under which we received exclusive rights, subject to certain exceptions, to commercialize and use Duke&#8217;s thermo-liposome technology. In relation to these liposome patents licensed from Duke University, we have filed two additional patents related to the formulation and use of liposomes. We have also licensed from Valentis, CA certain global rights covering the use of pegylation for temperature sensitive liposomes. 

&#160; 

In 2003, our obligations under the license agreement with Duke University with respect to the testing and regulatory milestones and other licensed technology performance deadlines were eliminated in exchange for a payment of shares of our common stock. The license agreement continues to be subject to agreements to pay a royalty based upon future sales. In conjunction with the patent holder, we have filed international applications for a certain number of the United States patents. 

&#160; 

Our rights under the license agreement with Duke University extend for the longer of 20 years or the end of any term for which any relevant patents are issued by the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Currently we have rights to Duke&#8217;s patent for its thermo-liposome technology in the United States, which expires in 2018, and to future patents received by Duke in Canada, Europe, Japan and Australia, where it has patent applications have been granted. The European grant provides coverage in the European Community. For this technology, our license rights are worldwide, including the United States, Canada, certain European countries, Australia, Hong Kong, and Japan. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Patents and Proprietary Rights &#160; 

Celsion holds an exclusive license agreement with Duke University for its temperature-sensitive liposome technology that covers the ThermoDox&#174; formulation. Celsion&#39;s newly issued patents pertain specifically to methods of storing stabilized, temperature-sensitive liposomal formulations and will assist in the protection of global rights. These patents will extend the overall term of the ThermoDox&#174; patent portfolio to 2026. The patents in these three countries are the first in this family, which includes pending applications in the U.S., Europe and additional key commercial geographies in Asia. This extended patent runway to 2026 allows for the evaluation of future development activities for ThermoDox&#174; and Celsion&#39;s heat-sensitive liposome technology platform. 

&#160; 

For the ThermoDox&#174; technology, we either exclusively license or own US and international patents with claims and methods and compositions of matters that cover various aspects of lysolipid thermally-sensitive liposomes technology, with expiration dates ranging from 2019 to 2026. 

&#160; 

For the TheraPlas&#8482; technology, we own three US and international patent families and related applications with claims and methods and compositions of matters that cover various aspects of TheraPlas&#8482; and GEN-1 technologies, with expiration dates ranging from 2020 to 2028. 

&#160; 

For the TheraSilence&#8482; technology, we own multiple US and international patent families and related applications with claims and methods and compositions of matters that cover various aspects of TheraSilence&#8482; technology, with expiration dates to 2031. 

&#160; 

There can be no assurance that an issued patent will remain valid and enforceable in a court of law through the entire patent term. Should the validity of a patent be challenged, the legal process associated with defending the patent can be costly and time consuming. Issued patents can be subject to oppositions, interferences and other third party challenges that can result in the revocation of the patent or maintenance of the patent in amended form (and potentially in a form that renders the patent without commercially relevant or broad coverage). Competitors may be able to circumvent our patents. Development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products can be subject to substantial delays and it is possible that at the time of commercialization any patent covering the product has expired or will be in force for only a short period of time following commercialization. We cannot predict with any certainty if any third party U.S. or foreign patent rights, other proprietary rights, will be deemed infringed by the use of our technology. Nor can we predict with certainty which, if any, of these rights will or may be asserted against us by third parties. Should we need to defend ourselves and our partners against any such claims, substantial costs may be incurred. Furthermore, parties making such claims may be able to obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, which could effectively block our ability to develop or commercialize some or all of our products in the U.S. and abroad, and could result in the award of substantial damages. In the event of a claim of infringement, we or our partners may be required to obtain one or more licenses from a third party. There can be no assurance that we can obtain a license on a reasonable basis should we deem it necessary to obtain rights to an alternative technology that meets our needs. The failure to obtain a license may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 

&#160; 

In addition to the rights available to us under completed or pending license agreements, we rely on our proprietary know-how and experience in the development and use of heat for medical therapies, which we seek to protect, in part, through proprietary information agreements with employees, consultants and others. There can be no assurance that these proprietary information agreements will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach, or that these agreements, even if fully enforced, will be adequate to prevent third-party use of the Company&#8217;s proprietary technology. Please refer to &#8220;Item 1A, Risk Factors,&#8221; including, but not limited to, &#8220;We rely on trade secret protection and other unpatented proprietary rights for important proprietary technologies, and any loss of such rights could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.&#8221; Similarly, we cannot guarantee that technology rights licensed to us by others will not be successfully challenged or circumvented by third parties, or that the rights granted will provide us with adequate protection. Please refer to &#8220;Item 1A, Risk Factors,&#8221; including, but not limited to, &#8220;Our business depends on licensing agreements with third parties to permit us to use patented technologies. The loss of any of our rights under these agreements could impair our ability to develop and market our products.&#8221;

&#160; 

EMPLOYEES 

&#160; 

As of March 29, 2016, we employed 25 full-time employees. We also maintain active independent contractor relationships with various individuals, most of whom have month-to-month or annual consulting agreements. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

&#160; 

During 2015 and 2014, we issued a total of 6.9 million shares of common stock in the following equity transactions for an aggregate $23.6 million in gross proceeds. On October 28, 2013, we effected a 4.5-to-1 reverse stock split of our common stock. Unless otherwise expressly stated, the share and per share data in this section and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K have been adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

On January 15, 2014, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with certain institutional investors, pursuant to which the Company sold, in a registered offering, an aggregate of 3,603,604 shares of its common stock and warrants to purchase up to 1,801,802 shares of common stock, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $15.0 million. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

On May 27, 2015, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with certain institutional investors, pursuant to which the Company sold, in a registered direct offering, an aggregate of 3,000,000 shares of common stock, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $8.0 million. In a concurrent private placement, the Company issued to the same investors warrants to purchase up to 1,950,000 shares of common stock. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

We are a party to a Controlled Equity Offering SM Sales Agreement (ATM) dated as of February 1, 2013 with Cantor Fitzgerald &#38; Co., pursuant to which we may sell additional shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $25 million through &#8220;at-the-market&#8221; equity offerings from time to time. From February 1, 2013 through February 25, 2013, the Company sold and issued an aggregate of 1,195,927 shares of common stock under the ATM, receiving approximately $6.8 million in net proceeds. The Company did not have any sales under the ATM from February 25, 2013 through September 30, 2015. On October 2, 2015, the Company filed a prospectus supplement whereby it registered $7.5 million of the remaining availability under the ATM. During the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company sold an aggregate of 283,608 shares for gross proceeds of $0.6 million. 

&#160; 

On June 20, 2014, we completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of EGEN, Inc. At the closing, we paid approximately $3.0 million in cash and issued 2,712,188 shares of its common stock to EGEN. In addition, 670,070 shares of common stock are issuable to EGEN on or after August 2, 2016 pending satisfactory resolution of any post-closing adjustments of expenses and EGEN&#8217;s indemnification obligations under the EGEN Purchase Agreement 

&#160; 

In addition, we entered into a loan agreement on November 25, 2013 with Hercules Technology Growth Capital, Inc. (Hercules), pursuant to which we may borrow a secured term loan of up to $20 million in multiple tranches (the Hercules Credit Agreement). The loan bears interest at a floating per annum rate equal to the greater of (i) 11.25 percent and (ii) the sum of 11.25 percent plus the prime rate minus 3.25 percent. Payments under the loan agreement are interest only for the first twelve months after loan closing, followed by a 30-month amortization period of principal and interest through the scheduled maturity date. We drew the first tranche of $5 million on November 25, 2013 and may request, subject to Hercules&#8217; consent in its sole discretion, an additional $15 million in up to three advances with each advance in a minimum amount of $5 million before June 30, 2014 unless extended upon Hercules&#8217; consent. We used approximately $4 million of the first tranche to repay the outstanding obligations under a loan agreement with Oxford Finance LLC and Horizon Technology Finance Corporation. On June 9, 2014, we borrowed an additional $5 million and used the loan proceeds to pay the upfront cash payment to EGEN at closing and certain transaction related costs incurred in connection with the acquisition. 

&#160; 

We believe that our cash and investment resources of $20.1 million on hand at December 31, 2015, coupled with the remaining availability of $17.4 million under the ATM, are sufficient to fund operations into the second quarter of 2017. However, our future capital requirements will depend upon numerous unpredictable factors, including, without limitation, the cost, timing, progress and outcomes of clinical studies and regulatory reviews of our proprietary drug candidates, our efforts to implement new collaborations, licenses and strategic transactions, general and administrative expenses, capital expenditures and other unforeseen uses of cash. To complete the development and commercialization of our products, we will need to raise substantial amounts of additional capital to fund our operations. We do not have any committed sources of financing and cannot give assurance that alternate funding will be available in a timely manner, on acceptable terms or at all. We may need to pursue dilutive equity financings, such as the issuance of shares of common stock, preferred stock, convertible debt or other convertible or exercisable securities, which financings could dilute the percentage ownership of our current common stockholders and could significantly lower the market value of our common stock.

&#160; 

RECENT EVENTS 

&#160; 

On January 7, 2016, we reported translational research data from our Phase Ib study of GEN-1 immunotherapy in recurrent ovarian cancer. The translational research data indicate that intraperitoneally-administered GEN-1 produces an immunologically distinct IL-12 protein that is localized at the tumor site and lasts for up to one week after a single treatment. Furthermore, concomitant increases in IFN-&#227; and TNF- &#225; indicate that t he IL-12 produced following treatment with GEN-1 treatment is immunologically active. The translational research data is highlighted below: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Intraperitoneal administration of GEN-1 in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer patients resulted in a significant increase in IL-12 levels in peritoneal fluid samples. IL-12 levels were quantifiable in 91% of evaluable fluid samples collected post GEN-1 treatment. None of the evaluable pre-treatment peritoneal fluid samples had any detectable IL-12 levels; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

The IL-12 levels were detectable for at least seven days after GEN-1 treatment; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

In comparison to peritoneal fluid, the IL-12 levels in plasma samples (systemic exposure) following GEN-1 treatment were not detectable or were very low in quantity; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Significant increases in levels of IFN-&#227;, a key downstream mediator of IL-12 action, were observed in peritoneal fluid but not in plasma samples. At least a 5-fold increase above pre-treatment level in IFN- &#227; was observed in most samples, with the highest increase observed at 120-fold. Similar results were observed with TNF-&#225; levels, with the highest increase observed at 77-fold over pre-treatment control ; and 

&#160;
