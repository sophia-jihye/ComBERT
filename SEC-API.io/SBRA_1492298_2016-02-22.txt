 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

Overview 

&#32;We operate as a self-administered, self-managed REIT that, through our subsidiaries, owns and invests in real estate serving the healthcare industry. Our primary business consists of acquiring, financing and owning real estate property to be leased to third party tenants in the healthcare sector. We primarily generate revenues by leasing properties to tenants and operators throughout the United States and Canada. 

As of December 31, 2015 , our investment portfolio consisted of 180 &#32;real estate properties held for investment (consisting of (i) 103 &#32;skilled nursing/transitional care facilities, (ii) 75 &#32;senior housing facilities, and (iii) two &#32;acute care hospitals), 17 &#32;investments in loans receivable (consisting of (i) eight &#32;mortgage loans, (ii) three &#32;construction loans, (iii) two &#32;mezzanine loans, (iv) three &#32;pre-development loans and (v) one &#32;debtor-in-possession loan) and 10 &#32;preferred equity investments. Included in the 180 &#32;real estate properties held for investment are two 100% owned senior housing facilities leased through RIDEA-compliant structures. As of December 31, 2015 , our real estate properties held for investment had a total of 18,349 &#32;beds/units, spread across the United States and Canada. As of December 31, 2015 , all of our real estate properties were leased under triple-net operating leases with expirations ranging from one to 17 &#32;years. 

We expect to continue to grow our portfolio primarily through the acquisition of assisted living, independent living and memory care facilities and with a secondary focus on acquiring skilled nursing and transitional care facilities. We have and will continue to opportunistically acquire other types of healthcare real estate, originate financing secured directly or indirectly by healthcare facilities and invest in the development of senior housing and skilled nursing/transitional care facilities. We also expect to expand our portfolio through the development of purpose-built healthcare facilities through pipeline agreements and other arrangements with select developers. We further expect to work with existing operators to identify strategic development opportunities. These opportunities may involve replacing or renovating facilities in our portfolio that may have become less competitive and new development opportunities that present attractive risk-adjusted returns. In addition to pursuing acquisitions with triple-net leases, we expect to continue to pursue other forms of investment, including investments in senior housing through RIDEA-compliant structures, mezzanine and secured debt investments, and joint ventures for senior housing and skilled nursing/transitional care facilities. 

With respect to our debt and preferred equity investments, in general, we originate loans and make preferred equity investments when an attractive investment opportunity is presented and either (a) the property is in or near the development phase or (b) the development of the property is completed but the operations of the facility are not yet stabilized. A key component of our strategy related to loan originations and preferred equity investments is our having the option to purchase the underlying real estate that is owned by our borrowers (and that directly or indirectly secures our loan investments) or by the joint venture in which we have an investment. These options become exercisable upon the occurrence of various criteria, such as the passage of time or the achievement of certain operating goals, and the purchase price is set in advance based on the same valuation methods we use to value our investments in healthcare real estate. This strategy allows us to diversify our revenue streams and build relationships with operators and developers, and provides us with the option to add new properties to our existing real estate portfolio if we determine that those properties enhance our investment portfolio and stockholder value at the time the options are exercisable. 

As we acquire additional properties and expand our portfolio, we expect to further diversify by tenant, asset class and geography within the healthcare sector. We employ a disciplined, opportunistic approach in our healthcare real estate investment strategy by investing in assets that provide attractive opportunities for dividend growth and appreciation of asset values, while maintaining balance sheet strength and liquidity, thereby creating long-term stockholder value. 

We were incorporated on May 10, 2010 as a wholly owned subsidiary of Sun Healthcare Group, Inc. and we commenced operations on November 15, 2010 following the Company&#8217;s separation from Sun Healthcare Group, Inc. (the &#8220;Separation Date&#8221;). We elected to be treated as a REIT with the filing of our U.S. federal income tax return for the taxable year beginning January 1, 2011. We believe that we have been organized and have operated, and we intend to continue to operate, in a manner to qualify as a REIT. 

Our principal executive offices are located at 18500 Von Karman Avenue, Suite 550, Irvine, CA 92612, and our telephone number is (888) 393-8248. We maintain a website at www.sabrahealth.com . Sabra Health Care REIT, Inc. files reports with the SEC, including annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the 

&#32;4 

&#160; 

&#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;). We will make such filings available free of charge on our website as soon as reasonably practicable after such information has been filed or furnished with the SEC. 

Our Industry 

We operate as a REIT that holds investments in income-producing healthcare facilities located in the United States and Canada. We invest primarily in the United States and Canadian senior housing industry, which includes assisted living, independent living and memory care facilities, with a secondary focus on the nursing home industry, including skilled nursing and transitional care facilities. The primary growth drivers of these industries &#8211; an aging population and longer life expectancies &#8211; present attractive investment opportunities for us. According to the United States Census Bureau, Americans over the age of 75 is projected to be the fastest growing segment of the population, growing at a compounded annual growth rate of 2.9% over the next five years and 3.6% over the next ten years. Additionally, according to the United States Census Bureau, life expectancy is expected to increase to 81.7 years in 2030 from 79.4 years in 2015. Furthermore, the National Investment Center for Seniors Housing and Care, a leading industry data provider, estimates that as of the fourth quarter of 2013, only 14.9% of senior housing and nursing case properties were owned by publicly traded REITs. The highly-fragmented nature of the senior housing and nursing home industries presents additional investment opportunities. 

Demand for senior housing is expected to increase as a result of an aging population and an increase in acuity across the post-acute landscape. Cost containment measures adopted by the federal government have encouraged patient treatment in more cost-effective settings, such as skilled nursing facilities. As a result, high acuity patients that previously would have been treated in long-term acute care hospitals and inpatient rehabilitation facilities are increasingly being treated in skilled nursing facilities. According to the Centers for Medicare &#38; Medicaid Services, nursing home expenditures are projected to grow from approximately $160 billion in 2014 to approximately $274 billion in 2024, representing a compounded annual growth rate of 5.5%. This focus on high acuity patients in skilled nursing facilities has resulted in the typical senior housing resident requiring more assistance with activities for daily living, such as assistance with bathing, grooming, dressing, eating, and medication management; however, many older senior housing facilities were not built to accommodate a resident who has more needs as well as increased mobility and cognitive issues than in the past. 

We believe that these trends will create an emphasis on operators who can effectively adapt their operating model to accommodate the changing nursing home patient and senior housing resident and will result in increased demand for purpose-built properties that are complementary to this new system of health care delivery. 

Portfolio of Healthcare Investments 

We have a geographically diverse portfolio of healthcare investments across the United States and Canada that offer a range of services including skilled nursing/transitional care, assisted and independent living, mental health and acute care. As of December 31, 2015 , our investment portfolio consisted of 180 &#32;real estate properties held for investment, 17 &#32;investments in loans receivable and 10 &#32;preferred equity investments. Of our 180 &#32;properties held for investment as of December 31, 2015 , we owned fee title to 174 properties and title under long-term ground leases for six properties. 

Our portfolio consisted of the following types of healthcare facilities as of December 31, 2015 : 

&#8226; 

Skilled Nursing/Transitional Care Facilities &#32; 

&#8226; Skilled nursing facilities. &#32;Skilled nursing facilities provide services that include daily nursing, therapeutic rehabilitation, social services, housekeeping, nutrition and administrative services for individuals requiring certain assistance for activities in daily living. A typical skilled nursing facility includes mostly one and two bed units, each equipped with a private or shared bathroom and community dining facilities. 

&#8226; Mental health facilities. &#32;Mental health facilities provide a range of inpatient and outpatient behavioral health services for adults and children through specialized treatment programs. 

&#8226; Transitional care facilities/units. &#32;Transitional care facilities/units are licensed nursing facilities or distinct units within a licensed nursing facility that provide short term, intensive, high acuity nursing and medical services. These facilities tend to focus on delivering specialized treatment to patients with cardiac, neurological, pulmonary, orthopedic, and renal conditions. Length of service is typically 30 days or less with the majority of patients returning to prior living arrangements and functional abilities. Generally, transitional care facilities/units provide services to Medicare, managed care and commercial insurance patients. 

&#8226; 

Senior Housing &#32; 

&#160; 

&#8226; Independent living facilities. &#32;Independent living facilities are age-restricted multi-family properties with central dining facilities that provide services that include security, housekeeping, nutrition and limited 

&#32;5 

&#160; 

laundry services. Our independent living facilities are designed specifically for independent seniors who are able to live on their own, but desire the security and conveniences of community living. Independent living facilities typically offer several services covered under a regular monthly fee. 

&#8226; Assisted living facilities. &#32;Assisted living facilities provide services that include minimal assistance for activities in daily living and permit residents to maintain some of their privacy and independence as they do not require constant supervision and assistance. Services bundled within one regular monthly fee usually include three meals per day in a central dining room, daily housekeeping, laundry, medical reminders and 24-hour availability of assistance with the activities of daily living, such as eating, dressing and bathing. Professional nursing and healthcare services are usually available at the facility on call or at regularly scheduled times. Assisted living facilities typically are comprised of one and two bedroom suites equipped with private bathrooms and efficiency kitchens. 

&#8226; Memory care facilities. &#32;Memory care facilities offer specialized options for seniors with Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia. Purpose built, free-standing memory care facilities offer an attractive alternative for private-pay residents affected by memory loss in comparison to other accommodations that typically have been provided within a secured unit of an assisted living or skilled nursing facility. These facilities offer dedicated care and specialized programming for various conditions relating to memory loss in a secured environment that is typically smaller in scale and more residential in nature than traditional assisted living facilities. Residents require a higher level of care and more assistance with activities of daily living than in assisted living facilities. Therefore, these facilities have staff available 24 hours a day to respond to the unique needs of their residents. 

&#8226; Continuing care retirement community. &#32;Continuing care retirement communities, or CCRCs, provide, as a continuum of care, the services described above for independent living facilities, assisted living facilities and skilled nursing facilities in an integrated campus, under long-term contracts with the residents. 

&#8226; 

Acute Care Hospital 

&#8226; Acute care hospitals provide inpatient and outpatient medical care and other related services for surgery, acute medical conditions or injuries (usually for a short-term illness or condition).

Investment and Financing Strategy 

We intend to invest in additional healthcare properties as suitable opportunities arise and adequate sources of financing are available. We expect that future investments in properties, including any improvements or renovations of current or newly-acquired properties, will depend on and will be financed, in whole or in part, by our existing cash, borrowings available to us under our Revolving Credit Facility (as defined below), future borrowings or the proceeds from issuances of common stock (including through our 2014 ATM Program (as defined below)), preferred stock, debt or other securities. In addition, we may seek financing from U.S. government agencies, including through Fannie Mae and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (&#8220;HUD&#8221;), in appropriate circumstances in connection with acquisitions. We also use derivative instruments in the normal course of business to mitigate interest rate and foreign currency risk. 

&#32;8 

&#160; 

Competitive Strengths 

We believe the following competitive strengths contribute significantly to our success: 

Geographically Diverse and Stable Property Portfolio 

Our portfolio of 180 &#32;properties held for investment as of December 31, 2015 , comprising 18,349 &#32;beds/units, is broadly diversified by location across the United States and Canada. Our properties in any one state or province did not account for more than 10% &#32;of our total beds/units as of December 31, 2015 . Our geographic diversification will limit the effect of a decline in any one regional market on our overall performance. The annual occupancy percentages of our properties remained stable over the last three fiscal years at between 87.6% &#32;and 88.2% &#32;for our skilled nursing/transitional care facilities and between 90.8% &#32;and 87.9% &#32;for our senior housing facilities. We have also been able to diversify through acquisitions the extent to which our revenues are dependent on our tenants&#8217; and borrowers&#8217; revenue from federal, state and local government reimbursement programs. Based on the information provided to us by our tenants and borrowers, which information is provided quarterly in arrears, on an annualized basis as of December 31, 2015, 49.7% of our tenants&#8217; and borrowers&#8217; revenue was from federal, state and local government reimbursement programs. 

Long-Term, Triple-Net Lease Structure 

All of our real estate properties are leased under triple-net operating leases with expirations ranging from one to 17 &#32;years, pursuant to which the tenants are responsible for all facility maintenance, insurance required in connection with the leased properties and the business conducted on the leased properties, taxes levied on or with respect to the leased properties and all utilities and other services necessary or appropriate for the leased properties and the business conducted on the leased properties. As of December 31, 2015 , the leases had a weighted-average remaining term of 10 &#32;years. We retain substantially all of the risks and benefits of ownership of the real estate assets leased to tenants. In addition, we may receive additional security under these operating leases in the form of letters of credit and security deposits from the lessee or guarantees from the parent of the lessee or other parties related to the lessee. Security deposits received in cash related to tenant leases are included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and totaled $1.3 million and $0.4 million as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively. 

Strong Relationships with Operators 

The members of our management team have developed an extensive network of relationships with qualified local, regional and national operators of skilled nursing and senior housing facilities across the United States and Canada. This extensive network has been built by our management team through over 25 years of operating experience, involvement in industry trade organizations and the development of banking relationships and investor relations within the skilled nursing and senior housing industries. We work collaboratively with our operators to help them achieve their growth and business objectives. We believe these strong relationships with operators help us to source investment opportunities. 

Our relationships with operators include pipeline agreements that we have entered into with certain operators that provide for the acquisition of, and interim capital commitments for, various health care facilities. These pipeline agreements, together with repeat transactions with other operators, help support our future growth potential by providing additional investment opportunities with lower acquisition pursuit costs than would be required for investments with new operators. 

Ability to Identify Talented Operators 

As a result of our management team&#8217;s operating experience, network of relationships and industry insight, we have been able and expect to continue to be able to identify qualified local, regional and national operators. We seek operators who possess local market knowledge, demonstrate hands-on management, have proven track records and emphasize patient care. These operators are often located in secondary markets, which generally have lower costs to build and favorable demographics as demonstrated by the fact that the percentage of the population over the age of 65 is greater in the markets where we have invested than in the U.S. as a whole. We believe our management team&#8217;s experience gives us a key competitive advantage in objectively evaluating an operator&#8217;s financial position, emphasis on care and operating efficiency. 

Significant Experience in Proactive Asset Management 

The members of our management team have significant experience developing systems to collect and evaluate data relating to the underlying operational and financial success of healthcare companies and healthcare-related real estate assets. We are able to utilize this experience and expertise to provide our operators, when requested, with significant assistance in the areas of marketing, development, facility expansion and strategic planning. We actively monitor the operating results of our tenants and, when requested, will work closely with our operators to identify and capitalize on opportunities to improve the operations of our facilities and the overall financial and operating strength of our operators. 

&#32;9 

&#160; 

Experienced Management Team 

Our management team has extensive healthcare and real estate experience. Richard K. Matros, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Sabra, has more than 25 years of experience in the acquisition, development and disposition of healthcare assets, including nine years at Sun Healthcare Group, Inc. Harold W. Andrews, Jr., Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Secretary of Sabra, is a finance professional with more than 15 years of experience in both the provision of healthcare services and healthcare real estate. Talya Nevo-Hacohen, Executive Vice President, Chief Investment Officer and Treasurer of Sabra, is a real estate finance executive with more than 20 years of experience in real estate finance, acquisition and development, including three years of experience managing and implementing the capital markets strategy of an S&#38;P 500 healthcare REIT. Through years of public company experience, our management team also has extensive experience accessing both debt and equity capital markets to fund growth and maintain a flexible capital structure. 

Flexible UPREIT Structure 

We operate through an umbrella partnership, commonly referred to as an UPREIT structure, in which substantially all of our properties and assets are held by the Operating Partnership, in which we are the sole general partner and our wholly owned subsidiaries are currently the only limited partners, or by subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership. Conducting business through the Operating Partnership allows us flexibility in the manner in which we acquire properties. In particular, an UPREIT structure enables us to acquire additional properties from sellers in exchange for limited partnership units, which may provide property owners the opportunity to defer the tax consequences that would otherwise arise from a sale of their real properties and other assets to us. As a result, this structure allows us to acquire assets more efficiently and may allow us to acquire assets that the owner would otherwise be unwilling to sell because of tax considerations. 

Business Strategies 

We pursue business strategies focused on opportunistic acquisitions and property diversification where such acquisitions meet our investing and financing strategy. We also intend to further develop our relationships with tenants and healthcare providers with a goal to progressively expand the mixture of tenants managing and operating our properties. 

The key components of our business strategies include: 

Diversify Asset Portfolio 

We expect to continue to grow our portfolio primarily through the acquisition of assisted living, independent living and memory care facilities in the U.S. and Canada and with a secondary focus on acquiring skilled nursing and transitional care facilities in the U.S. We have and will continue to opportunistically acquire other types of healthcare real estate, originate financing secured directly or indirectly by healthcare facilities and invest in the development of senior housing and skilled nursing/transitional care facilities. 

Maintain Balance Sheet Strength and Liquidity 

We seek to maintain a capital structure that provides the resources and flexibility to support the growth of our business. As of December 31, 2015 , we had approximately $202.4 million &#32;in liquidity, consisting of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $7.4 million &#32;(excluding cash and cash equivalents associated with our RIDEA-compliant joint venture), and available borrowings under our Prior Revolving Credit Facility (as defined below) of $195.0 million . On January 14, 2016, we entered into a third amended and restated unsecured credit facility which, among other things, increased our borrowing capacity from $450.0 million to $500.0 million. As of December 31, 2015 , on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the third amended and restated Credit Facility as if it had been entered into on December 31, 2015, we had approximately $313.4 million &#32;in liquidity, consisting of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $7.4 million &#160;(excluding cash and cash equivalents associated with our RIDEA-compliant joint venture), and available borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility of $306.0 million . 

We intend to maintain a mix of credit facility debt, term loan debt, mortgage debt and unsecured term debt which, together with our anticipated ability to complete future equity financings (including through our at-the-market common stock offering program (&#8220;2014 ATM Program&#8221;)), we expect will fund the growth of our operations. As of December 31, 2015 , we had $76.5 million &#32;available under our 2014 ATM Program. Further, we may opportunistically seek access to U.S. government agency financing, including through Fannie Mae and HUD, in appropriate circumstances in connection with acquisitions. In November 2015, we suspended the 2014 ATM Program. We may resume the 2014 ATM Program at any time during the term of the program in our discretion. 

&#32;10 

&#160; 

Develop New Investment Relationships 

We seek to cultivate our relationships with tenants and healthcare providers in order to expand the mix of tenants operating our properties and, in doing so, to reduce our dependence on any single tenant or operator. We have grown our investment relationships from one in 2010 to 35 as of December 31, 2015 . We expect to continue to develop new investment relationships as part of our overall strategy to acquire new properties and further diversify our overall portfolio of healthcare properties. 

Capital Source to Underserved Operators 

We believe that there is a significant opportunity to be a capital source to healthcare operators through the acquisition and leasing of healthcare properties that are consistent with our investment and financing strategy, but that, due to size and other considerations, are not a focus for larger healthcare REITs. We utilize our management team&#8217;s operating experience, network of relationships and industry insight to identify financially strong and growing operators in need of capital funding for future growth. In appropriate circumstances, we may negotiate with operators to acquire individual healthcare properties from those operators and then lease those properties back to the operators pursuant to long-term triple-net leases or refinance new projects. 

Strategic Capital Improvements 

We intend to continue to support operators by providing capital to them for a variety of purposes, including for capital expenditures and facility modernization. We expect to structure these investments as either lease amendments that produce additional rents or as loans that are repaid by operators during the applicable lease term. 

Pursue Strategic Development Opportunities 

We intend to work with our operators to identify strategic development opportunities. These opportunities may involve replacing or renovating facilities in our portfolio that may have become less competitive and new development opportunities that present attractive risk-adjusted returns. In addition to pursuing acquisitions with triple-net leases, we expect to continue to pursue other forms of investment, including investments in senior housing through RIDEA-compliant structures, mezzanine and secured debt investments, and joint ventures for senior housing and skilled nursing/transitional care facilities. 

&#160; Our Employees 

As of December 31, 2015 , we employed 12 full-time employees (including our executive officers) and one part-time employee, none of whom is subject to a collective bargaining agreement. 

Competition 

We compete for real property investments with other REITs, investment companies, private equity and hedge fund investors, sovereign funds, healthcare operators, lenders and other investors. Some of our competitors are significantly larger and have greater financial resources and lower costs of capital than we do. Increased competition will make it more challenging to identify and successfully capitalize on acquisition opportunities that meet our investment objectives. Our ability to compete is also impacted by national and local economic trends, availability of investment alternatives, availability and cost of capital, construction and renovation costs, existing laws and regulations, new legislation and population trends. 

In addition, revenues from our properties are dependent on the ability of our tenants and operators to compete with other healthcare operators. These operators compete on a local and regional basis for residents and patients, and the operators&#8217; ability to successfully attract and retain residents and patients depends on key factors such as the number of facilities in the local market, the types of services available, the quality of care, reputation, age and appearance of each facility and the cost of care in each locality. Private, federal and state payment programs and the effect of other laws and regulations may also have a significant impact on the ability of our tenants and operators to compete successfully for residents and patients at the properties. 

Government Regulation 

Our tenants are subject to extensive and complex federal, state and local healthcare laws and regulations, including anti-kickback, anti-fraud and abuse provisions codified under the Social Security Act. These provisions prohibit certain business practices and relationships that might affect the provision and cost of healthcare services reimbursable under Medicare and Medicaid. Sanctions for violating these anti-kickback, anti-fraud and abuse provisions include criminal penalties, civil sanctions, fines and possible exclusion from government programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. If a center is decertified as a Medicare or Medicaid provider by the Centers for Medicare &#38; Medicaid Services (&#8220;CMS&#8221;) or a state, the center will not thereafter be reimbursed for caring for residents that are covered by Medicare and Medicaid, and the center would be forced to care for such residents without being reimbursed or to transfer such residents. 

&#32;11 

&#160; 

Most of our tenants&#8217; skilled nursing/transitional care centers and mental health centers are licensed under applicable state law, and are certified or approved as providers under the Medicare and Medicaid programs. State and local agencies survey all skilled nursing centers on a regular basis to determine whether such centers are in compliance with governmental operating and health standards and conditions for participation in government sponsored third party payor programs. Under certain circumstances, the federal and state agencies have the authority to take adverse actions against a center or service provider, including the imposition of a monitor, the imposition of monetary penalties and the decertification of a center or provider from participation in the Medicare and/or Medicaid programs or licensure revocation. Challenging and appealing notices or allegations of noncompliance can require significant legal expenses and management attention. 

Various states in which our tenants operate our centers have established minimum staffing requirements or may establish minimum staffing requirements in the future. Failure to comply with such minimum staffing requirements may result in the imposition of fines or other sanctions. Most states in which our tenants operate have statutes requiring that prior to the addition or construction of new nursing home beds, to the addition of new services or to certain capital expenditures in excess of defined levels, the tenant first must obtain a certificate of need, which certifies that the state has made a determination that a need exists for such new or additional beds, new services or capital expenditures. The certification process is intended to promote quality healthcare at the lowest possible cost and to avoid the unnecessary duplication of services, equipment and centers. This certification process can restrict or prohibit the undertaking of a project or lengthen the period of time required to enlarge or renovate a facility or replace a tenant. 

In addition to the above, those of our tenants who provide services that are paid for by Medicare and Medicaid are subject to federal and state budgetary cuts and constraints that limit the reimbursement levels available from these government programs. 

As of December 31, 2015 , our subsidiaries owned 18 &#32;healthcare facilities (15 skilled nursing/transitional care facilities and 3 senior housing facilities) with mortgage loans that are guaranteed by HUD. Those facilities are subject to the rules and regulations of HUD, including periodic inspections by HUD, although the tenants of those facilities have the primary responsibility for maintaining the facilities in compliance with HUD&#8217;s rules and regulations. The regulatory agreements entered into by each owner and each operator of the property restrict, among other things, any sale or other transfer of the property, modification of the lease between the owner and the operator, use of surplus cash from the property except upon certain conditions, renovations of the property and use of the property other than for a skilled nursing facility, all without prior HUD approval. 

In addition, as an owner of real property, we are subject to various federal, state and local environmental and health and safety laws and regulations. These laws and regulations address various matters, including asbestos, fuel oil management, wastewater discharges, air emissions, medical wastes and hazardous wastes. The costs of complying with these laws and regulations and the penalties for non-compliance can be substantial. For example, although we do not operate or manage our properties, we may be held primarily or jointly and severally liable for costs relating to the investigation and clean up of any property from which there has been a release or threatened release of a regulated material as well as other affected properties, regardless of whether we knew of or caused the release. In addition to these costs, which are typically not limited by law or regulation and could exceed the property&#8217;s value, we could be liable for certain other costs, including governmental fines and injuries to persons, property or natural resources. See &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Risks Relating to Our Business&#8212;Environmental compliance costs and liabilities associated with real estate properties owned by us may materially impair the value of those investments.&#8221; 

Updates to REIT Rules 

The Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 (the &#8220;PATH Act&#8221;) was enacted on December 18, 2015 and contains several provisions pertaining to REIT qualification and taxation, which are briefly summarized below: 

&#8226; 

For taxable years beginning before January 1, 2018, no more than 25% of the value of a REIT's assets may consist of stock or securities of one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries (&#8220;TRSs&#8221;). For taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, the PATH Act reduces this limit to 20%. 

&#8226; 

For purposes of the REIT asset tests, the PATH Act provides that debt instruments issued by publicly offered REITs will constitute &#8220;real estate assets.&#8221; However, unless such a debt instrument is secured by a mortgage or otherwise would have qualified as a real estate asset under prior law, (i) interest income and gain from such a debt instrument is not qualifying income for purposes of the 75% gross income test and (ii) all such debt instruments may represent no more than 25% of the value of a REIT's total assets. 

&#8226; 

For taxable years beginning after December 31, 2015, certain obligations secured by a mortgage on both real property and personal property will be treated as a qualifying real estate asset and give rise to qualifying income for purposes of 

&#32;12 

&#160; 

the 75% gross income test if the fair market value of such personal property does not exceed 15% of the total fair market value of all such property. 

&#8226; 

A 100% excise tax is imposed on &#8220;redetermined TRS service income,&#8221; which is income of a TRS attributable to services provided to, or on behalf of, its associated REIT and which would otherwise be increased on distribution, apportionment, or allocation under Section 482 of the Code. 

&#8226; 

For distributions made in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2014, the preferential dividend rules no longer apply. 

&#8226; 

Additional exceptions to the rules under the Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act (&#8220;FIRPTA&#8221;) were introduced for non-U.S. persons that constitute &#8220;qualified shareholders&#8221; (within the meaning of Section 897(k)(3) of the Code) or &#8220;qualified foreign pension funds&#8221; (within the meaning of Section 897(l)(2) of the Code). 

&#8226; 

After February 16, 2016, the FIRPTA withholding rate under Section 1445 of the Code for dispositions of U.S. real property interests is increased from 10% to 15%. 

&#8226; 

The PATH Act increases from 5% to 10% the maximum stock ownership of the REIT that a non-U.S. shareholder may have held to avail itself of the FIRPTA exception for shares regularly traded on an established securities market. 

In addition, the IRS recently issued guidance delaying the imposition of withholding under the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act to the gross proceeds from a disposition of property that can produce U.S. source interest or dividends. Such withholding will apply only to dispositions occurring after December 31, 2018.
