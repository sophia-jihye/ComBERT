Additional information regarding our business, results of operations and financial condition, including information pertaining to our reporting segments, can be found in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 hereof and in Note 2 in the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" in Item 8 hereof. 

We operate retail department stores in 29 states, primarily in the southwest, southeast and midwest regions of the United States. Most of our stores are located in suburban shopping malls and open-air centers. Customers may also purchase our merchandise on-line at our website, www.dillards.com, which features on-line gift registries and a variety of other services. 

Our retail merchandise business is conducted under highly competitive conditions. Although we are a large regional department store, we have numerous competitors at the national and local level that compete with our individual stores, including specialty, off-price, discount and Internet retailers. Competition is characterized by many factors including location, reputation, merchandise assortment, advertising, price, quality, operating efficiency, service and credit availability. We believe that our stores are in a strong competitive position with regard to each of these factors. Other retailers may compete for customers on some or all of these factors, or on other factors, and may be perceived by some potential customers as being better aligned with their particular preferences. 

Our merchandise selections include, but are not limited to, our lines of exclusive brand merchandise such as Antonio Melani, Gianni Bini, GB, Roundtree &#38; Yorke and Daniel Cremieux. Our exclusive brands/private label merchandise program provides benefits for Dillard's and our customers. Our customers receive fashionable, higher quality product often at a savings compared to national brands. Our private label merchandise program allows us to ensure the Company's high standards are achieved, while minimizing costs and differentiating our merchandise offerings from other retailers. 

We have made a significant investment in our trademark and license portfolio, in terms of design function, advertising, quality control and quick response to market trends in a quality manufacturing environment. Dillard's trademark registrations are maintained for as long as Dillard's holds the exclusive right to use the trademarks on the listed products. 

Our merchandising, sales promotion and store operating support functions are conducted primarily at our corporate headquarters. Our back office sales support functions, such as accounting, product development, store planning and information technology, are also centralized. 

We have developed a knowledge of each of our trade areas and customer bases for our stores. This knowledge is enhanced through regular store visits by senior management and merchandising personnel and through the use of on-line merchandise information and is supported by our regional merchandising offices. We will continue to use existing technology and research to edit merchandise assortments by store to meet the specific preference, taste and size requirements of each local operating area. 

Certain departments in our stores are licensed to independent companies in order to provide high quality service and merchandise where specialization, focus and expertise are critical. The licensed departments vary by store to complement our own merchandising departments. The principal licensed department is an upscale women's apparel vendor in certain stores. The terms of the license agreements typically range between three and five years with one year renewals and require the licensee to pay for fixtures and to provide their own employees. We regularly evaluate the performance of the licensed departments and require compliance with established customer service guidelines. 

Synchrony Financial ("Synchrony"; formerly GE Consumer Finance) owned and managed Dillard's private label credit cards, including credit cards co-branded with American Express (collectively "private label cards"), under a long-term marketing and servicing alliance ("Synchrony Alliance") that expired in November 2014. Following this scheduled expiration, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. ("Wells Fargo") purchased the Dillard's private label card portfolio from Synchrony and began managing Dillard's private label cards under a new 10-year agreement ("Wells Fargo Alliance"). Under the Wells Fargo Alliance, Wells Fargo establishes and owns private label card accounts for our customers, retains the benefits and risks associated with the ownership of the accounts, provides key customer service functions, including new account openings, transaction authorization, billing adjustments and customer inquiries, receives the finance charge income and incurs the bad debts associated with those accounts. Pursuant to the Wells Fargo Alliance, we receive on-going cash compensation from Wells Fargo based upon the portfolio's earnings. The compensation earned on the portfolio is determined monthly and has no recourse provisions. We participate in the marketing of the private label cards and accept payments on the private label cards in our stores as a convenience to customers who prefer to pay in person rather than by paying online or mailing their payments to Wells Fargo. The Wells Fargo Alliance expires in fiscal 2024. 

We seek to expand the number and use of the private label cards by, among other things, providing incentives to sales associates to open new credit accounts, which generally can be opened while a customer is visiting one of our stores. Customers who open accounts are rewarded with discounts on future purchases. Private label card customers are sometimes offered private shopping nights, direct mail catalogs, special discounts and advance notice of sale events. Wells Fargo maintains the loyalty program that rewards customers for private label card usage. 

Our earnings depend to a significant extent on the results of operations for the last quarter of our fiscal year. Due to holiday buying patterns, sales for that period average approximately one-third of annual sales. 

As of January 30, 2016 , we employed approximately 40,000 full-time and part-time associates, of which approximately 47% were part-time. The number of associates varies during the year, especially during peak seasonal selling periods. 

We purchase merchandise from many sources and do not believe that we are dependent on any one supplier. We have no long-term purchase commitments or arrangements with any of our suppliers, but we consider our relationships to be strong and mutually beneficial. 

Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest January 31 of each year. Fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013 ended January 30, 2016, January 31, 2015 and February 1, 2014, respectively, and each contained 52 weeks.
