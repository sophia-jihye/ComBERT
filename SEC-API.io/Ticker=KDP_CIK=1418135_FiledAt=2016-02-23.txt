History of Our Business 

We have built our business over the last three decades through a series of strategic acquisitions. In the 1980s through the mid-1990s, we began building on our then-existing Schweppes business by adding brands such as Mott's, Canada Dry and A&#38;W and a license for Sunkist soda. We also acquired the Pe&#241;afiel business in Mexico. In 1995, we acquired Dr Pepper/Seven Up, Inc., having previously made minority investments in the company. In 1999, we acquired a 40% interest in Dr Pepper/Seven Up Bottling Group, Inc. ("DPSUBG"), which was then our largest independent bottler, and increased our interest to 45% in 2005. In 2000, we acquired Snapple and other brands, significantly increasing our share of the U.S. NCB market segment. During 2006 and 2007, we acquired the remaining 55% of DPSUBG and several smaller bottlers and integrated them into our Packaged Beverages segment, thereby expanding our geographic coverage. 

We were incorporated in Delaware on October 24, 2007. In 2008, Cadbury Schweppes plc ("Cadbury") separated its beverage business in the U.S., Canada, Mexico and the Caribbean (the "Americas Beverages business") from its global confectionery business by contributing the subsidiaries that operated its Americas Beverages business to us. 

&#32;

&#32; 

In the CSD market in the U.S. and Canada, we participate primarily in the flavored CSD category. Our key brands are Dr Pepper, Canada Dry, 7UP, A&#38;W, Crush, Sunkist soda, Schweppes, Squirt and RC Cola, and we also sell regional and smaller niche brands. In the CSD market, we distribute finished beverages and manufacture beverage concentrates and fountain syrups. Beverage concentrates are highly concentrated proprietary flavors used to make syrup or finished beverages. We manufacture beverage concentrates that are used by our own Packaged Beverages and Latin America Beverages segments, as well as sold to third party bottling companies. According to Nielsen, we ha d a 20.8% &#32;s hare of the U.S. CSD market in &#32; 2015 &#32; (measured by retail sales), whic h increased &#32; 0.3% &#32; compared to &#32; 2014 . We also manufacture fountain syrup that we sell to the foodservice industry directly, through bottlers or through third parties. 

In the NCB market segment in the U.S., we participate primarily in the ready-to-drink tea, juice, juice drinks, water and mixer categories. Our key NCB brands are Hawaiian Punch, Snapple, Mott's and Clamato, and we also sell regional and smaller niche brands. We manufacture most of our NCBs as ready-to-drink beverages and distribute them through our own distribution network and through third parties or direct to our customers' warehouses. In addition to NCB beverages, we also manufacture Mott's apple sauce as a finished product. 

In Mexico and the Caribbean, we participate primarily in the carbonated mineral water, flavored CSDs, bottled water and vegetable juice categories. Our key brands in Mexico include Pe&#241;afiel, Squirt, Aguafiel, Clamato and Crush. In Mexico, we manufacture and sell our brands through both our own manufacturing and distribution operations as well as third party bottlers. In the Caribbean, we distribute our products solely through third party distributors and bottlers. We have also begun to distribute certain products in other international jurisdictions through various third party bottlers and distributors. 

In 2015 , we manufactured and/or distributed approximately 52% &#32;of our total products sold in the U.S. (as measured by volume). In addition, our businesses manufacture and/or distribute a variety of brands owned by third parties in specified licensed geographic territories. 

OUR STRENGTHS 

&#160; The key strengths of our business are: 

Strong portfolio of leading, consumer-preferred brands. &#160; We own a diverse portfolio of well-known CSD and NCB brands. Many of our brands enjoy high levels of consumer awareness, preference and loyalty rooted in their rich heritage, which drive their market positions. Our diverse portfolio provides our bottlers, distributors and retailers with a wide variety of products and provides us with a platform for growth and profitability. According to Nielsen retail sales, we are th e # 1 &#32;fla vored CSD company in the U.S. Our largest brand, Dr Pepper, is the &#160;#2 f lavored CSD in the U.S. and our Snapple brand is a leading ready-to-drink t ea. Overall, in 2015 , approximately 84 % of our volume was generated by brands that hold either the #1 or #2 position in their category. The strength of our significant brands has allowed us to launch innovations, brand extensions or limited time offers, such as our Snapple Straight Up Tea and seasonal limited time offerings, Hawaiian Punch single-serve pouches, Pe&#241;afiel Strawberryade, Mott&#8217;s Tropical BA-NA-NA applesauce and juice drink lines in &#32; 2015 . 

Integrated business model. &#160; Our integrated business model provides opportunities for net sales and profit growth through the alignment of the economic interests of our brand ownership and our manufacturing and distribution businesses. For example, we can focus on maximizing profitability for our company as a whole rather than focusing on profitability generated from either the sale of beverage concentrates or the bottling and distribution of our products. Additionally, our integrated business model enables us to be more flexible and responsive to the changing needs of our large retail customers by coordinating sales, service, distribution, promotions and product launches and allows us to more fully leverage our scale and reduce costs by creating greater geographic manufacturing and distribution coverage. Our manufacturing and distribution system in the U.S. also enables us to improve focus on our brands, especially certain brands such as 7UP, A&#38;W, Sunkist soda, Squirt, RC Cola, Hawaiian Punch and Snapple, which do not have a large presence in the bottler systems affiliated with The Coca-Cola Company ("Coca-Cola") or PepsiCo, Inc. ("PepsiCo"). 

Strong customer relationships. &#160; Our brands have enjoyed long-standing relationships with many of our top customers. We sell our products to a wide range of customers, from bottlers and distributors to national retailers, large food service and convenience store customers. We have strong relationships with some of the largest bottlers and distributors, including those affiliated with Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, some of the largest and most important retailers, including Wal-Mart Store s, Inc. ("Walmart"), The Kroger Co., Safeway, Inc., Target Corporation and Publix Super Markets, Inc., some of the largest food service customers, including McDonald's Corporation, Yum! Brands, Inc., Burger King Corp., Sonic Corp., The Wendy's Company, Chick-fil-A, Inc., Jack in the Box, Inc., Subway Restaurants, Arby's Group, Inc. and Whataburger Restaurants LLC, and conve nience store customers, including 7-Eleven, Inc., Circle K Enterprises, Inc. and OXXO. Our portfolio of strong brands, operational scale and experience across beverage segments has enabled us to maintain strong relationships with our customers. 

&#32; 

Attractive positioning within a large and profitable market. &#160; We hold the #1 &#32; position in the U.S. flavored CSD beverage markets by sales volume according to Nielsen. We are also a leader in the Canada and Mexico beverage markets. Our portfolio of products is biased toward flavored CSDs, which continue to gain market share versus cola CSDs, but also focuses on growing categories such as teas and juices. &#32; We believe marketing and product innovations that target fast growing population segments, such as the Hispanic community in the U.S., could drive market growth. 

Broad geographic manufacturing and distribution coverage. &#160; As of &#32; December 31, 2015 , we had &#32; 19 &#32;manufacturing facilities and 101 &#32;principal distribution centers and warehouse facilities in the U.S., as well as three &#32;manufacturing facilities and 12 &#32;principal distribution centers and warehouse facilities in Mexico. In December 2015, we began construction on a new manufacturing facility in Mexico which is not reflected in the numbers above. We have strategically located manufacturing and distribution capabilities, enabling us to better align our operations with our customers, reduce transportation costs and have greater control over the timing and coordination of new product launches. In addition, our warehouses are generally located at or near bottling plants and geographically dispersed to ensure our products are available to meet consumer demand. We actively manage transportation of our products using our fleet (owned and leased) of approximately &#32; 7,000 &#32; and &#32; 1,500 &#32; vehicles in the U.S. and Mexico, respectively, and third party logistics providers on a selected basis. As a result of our distribution capabilities, we believe brand owners view us as a partner with a strong route-to-market in order to grow their allied brand in our Packaged Beverages segment. 

Strong operating margins and stable cash flows. &#160; The breadth of our brand portfolio has enabled us to generate strong operating margins which have delivered stable cash flows. These cash flows enable us to consider a variety of alternatives, such as investing in our business, repurchasing shares of our common stock, paying dividends to our stockholders and reducing our debt. &#32; As a result of our stable cash flows and the reduction of our capital expenditures, we have been able to increase our dividends each year since 2010 in order to return more cash to our stockholders. 

Experienced executive management team. &#160; Our executive management team has over &#32; 200 years of collective experience in the food and beverage industry. The team has broad experience in brand ownership, manufacturing and distribution, and enjoys strong relationships both within the industry and with major customers. In addition, our management team has diverse skills that support our operating strategies, including driving organic growth through targeted and efficient marketing, improving productivity of our operations, aligning manufacturing and distribution interests and executing strategic acquisitions. 

OUR STRATEGY 

&#160; The key elements of our business strategy are to: 

Build our brands. &#160; We have a well-defined portfolio strategy to allocate our marketing and sales resources. We use an on-going process of market and consumer analysis to identify key brands that we believe have the greatest potential for profitable sales growth. We continue to invest most heavily in our key brands to drive profitable and sustainable growth by strengthening consumer awareness, innovating against our brands to take advantage of evolving consumer trends, improving distribution and increasing promotional effectiveness. We also focus on new distribution agreements for emerging, high-growth third party brands in new categories that can use our manufacturing and distribution network. We provide these new brands with distribution capability and resources to grow, and they provide us with exposure to growing segments of the market with relatively low risk and capital investment. 

Execute with excellence. We are focused on improving our product presence in high margin brands, products and channels, such as convenience stores, vending machines and small independent retail outlets, through increased selling activity. We also intend to increase demand for high margin products like single-serve packages for many of our key brands through increased in-store activity. 

We believe our integrated brand ownership, manufacturing and distribution business model provides us opportunities for net sales and profit growth through the alignment of the economic interests of our brand ownership and our manufacturing and distribution businesses. We intend to continue leveraging our integrated business model to reduce costs by optimizing geographic manufacturing and distribution coverage and to be more flexible and responsive to the changing needs of our large retail customers by coordinating sales, service, distribution, promotions and product launches. 

Strengthening our route-to-market will ensure the ongoing health of our brands. We continue to invest in information technology ("IT") to improve route productivity and data integrity and standards. With third party bottlers, we continue to deliver programs that maintain priority for our brands in their systems. 

&#32; 

Rapid Continuous Improvement. &#160; We have been able to create multi-product manufacturing facilities which provide a region with a wide variety of our products at reduced transportation and co-packing costs. In 2011, we adopted our Rapid Continuous Improvement ("RCI"), which uses Lean and Six Sigma methods to deliver customer value and improve productivity. We believe RCI is a means to achieve revenue and net income growth and increase the amount of cash returned to our stockholders. 

OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS 

&#160; As of &#32; December 31, 2015 , our operating structure consists of three business segments: Beverage Concentrates, Packaged Beverages and Latin America Beverages. Segment financial data for &#32; 2015 , &#32; 2014 &#32; and &#32; 2013 , including financial information about foreign and domestic operations, is included in &#32; Note 22 of the Notes to our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements . 

Beverage Concentrates 

Our Beverage Concentrates segment is principally a brand ownership business. In this segment we manufacture and sell beverage concentrates in the U.S. and Canada. Most of the brands in this segment are CSD brands. In 2015 , our Beverage Concentrates segment had net sales of approximately $1,241 million . Key brands include Dr Pepper, Canada Dry, Crush, Schweppes, Sunkist soda, 7UP, A&#38;W, Sun Drop, RC Cola, Squirt, Diet Rite, Vernors and the concentrate form of Hawaiian Punch. 

&#160; We are the industry leader in flavored CSDs with a &#32; 38.8% &#32; market share in the U.S. for &#32; 2015 &#32; (as measured by retail sales) according to Nielsen. We are also the third largest CSD brand owner as measured by &#32; 2015 &#32; retail sales in the U.S. and Canada and we own a leading brand in most of the CSD categories in which we compete. 

Almost all of our beverage concentrates are manufactured at our plant in St. Louis, Missouri. 

Beverage concentrates are shipped to third party bottlers, as well as to our own manufacturing systems, who combine them with carbonation, water, sweeteners and other ingredients, package the combined product in PET containers, glass bottles and aluminum cans, and sell them as a finished beverage to retailers. Beverage concentrates are also manufactured into syrup, which is shipped to fountain customers, such as fast food restaurants, who mix the syrup with water and carbonation to create a finished beverage at the point of sale to consumers. Dr Pepper represents most of our fountain channel volume. Concentrate prices historically have been reviewed and adjusted at least on an annual basis. 

Our Beverage Concentrates brands are sold by our bottlers, including our own Packaged Beverages segment, through all major retail channels including supermarkets, fountains, mass merchandisers, club stores, vending machines, convenience stores, gas stations, small groceries, drug chains and dollar stores. Unlike the majority of our other CSD brands, &#32; 58% &#32; of Dr Pepper volumes are distributed through the Coca-Cola affiliated and PepsiCo affiliated bottler systems. 

PepsiCo and Coca-Cola are the two largest customers of the Beverage Concentrates segment and constituted approximately &#32; 26% &#32;and 20% , res pectively, of the segment's net sales during &#32; 2015 . 

Packaged Beverages 

Our Packaged Beverages segment is principally a brand ownership, manufacturing and distribution business. In this segment, we primarily manufacture and distribute packaged beverages and other products, including our brands, third party owned brands and certain private label beverages, in the U.S. and Canada. In &#32; 2015 , our Packaged Beverages segment had net sales of approximately &#32; $4,544 million . &#32; Key NCB brands in this segment include Snapple, Hawaiian Punch, Mott's, Clamato, Yoo-Hoo, FIJI mineral water, Deja Blue, AriZona tea, ReaLemon, Mr and Mrs T mixers, Vita Coco coconut water, Nantucket Nectars, Mistic, Garden Cocktail, Bai brands and Rose's. Key CSD brands in this segment include 7UP, Dr Pepper, A&#38;W, Canada Dry, Sunkist soda, Squirt, RC Cola, Big Red, Vernors, Diet Rite and Sun Drop. 

Approximately &#32; 81% &#32; of our &#32; 2015 &#32; Packaged Beverages net sales of branded products come from our own brands, with the remaining from the distribution of third party brands such as &#32; Big Red, FIJI mineral water, AriZona tea, Vita Coco coconut water, Bai brands, Neuro drinks, Sparkling Fruit2O and Hydrive energy drinks . Although the majority of our Packaged Beverages net sales relate to our brands, we also provide a route-to-market for these third party brand owners seeking effective distribution for their new and emerging brands. These brands give us exposure in certain markets to fast growing segments of the beverage industry with minimal capital investment. A portion of our sales also comes from bottling beverages and other products for private label owners or others, which is also referred to as contract manufacturing. &#32; 

Our Packaged Beverages products are manufactured in multiple facilities across the U.S. and are sold or distributed to retailers and their warehouses by our own distribution network or by third party distributors. The raw materials used to manufacture our products include aluminum cans and ends, glass bottles, PET bottles and caps, paper products, sweeteners, juices, water and other ingredients. 

&#32; 

We sell our Packaged Beverages products both through our Direct Store Delivery system ("DSD") and our Warehouse Direct delivery system ("WD"), both of which include the sales to all major retail channels, including supermarkets, fountains, mass merchandisers, club stores, vending machines, convenience stores, gas stations, small groceries, drug chains and dollar stores. 

In &#32; 2015 , Walmart, the largest customer of our Packaged Beverages segment, accounted for approximately &#32; 16% &#32; of our net sales in this segment. 

Latin America Beverages 

Our Latin America Beverages segment is a brand ownership, manufacturing and distribution business. This segment participates mainly in the carbonated mineral water, flavored CSD, bottled water and vegetable juice categories, with particular strength in carbonated mineral water, vegetable juice categories and grapefruit flavored CSDs. In &#32; 2015 , our Latin America Beverages segment had net sales of &#32; $497 million , with our operations in Mexico representing approximately &#32; 90% &#32; of the net sales of this segment. Key brands include Pe&#241;afiel, Squirt, Aguafiel, Clamato and Crush. 

In Mexico, we manufacture and distribute our products through our bottling operations and third party bottlers and distributors. In the Caribbean, we distribute our products through third party bottlers and distributors. We have also begun to distribute certain products in other international jurisdictions through various third party bottlers and distributors. In Mexico, we also participate in a joint venture to manufacture Aguafiel brand water with Acqua Minerale San Benedetto. 

We sell our finished beverages through all major Mexican retail channels, including "mom and pop" stores, supermarkets, hypermarkets, convenience stores and on-premise channels. 

In &#32; 2015 , OXXO and Walmart, the largest customers of our Latin America Beverages segment, accounted for approximately 11% and 10% &#32; of our net sales in this segment, respectively. 

BOTTLER AND DISTRIBUTOR AGREEMENTS 

In the U.S. and Canada, we generally grant perpetual, exclusive licenses for CSD brands and packages to bottlers for specific geographic areas. Many of our brands, such as Snapple, Mistic, Nantucket Nectars, Yoo-Hoo and Orangina, are licensed for distribution in various territories to bottlers and a number of smaller distributors such as beer wholesalers, wine and spirit distributors, independent distributors and retail brokers. These agreements prohibit bottlers and distributors from selling the licensed products outside their exclusive territory and selling any imitative products in that territory. Generally, we may terminate bottling and distribution agreements only for cause or change in control, breach of agreements and the bottler or distributor may terminate without cause upon giving certain specified notice and complying with other applicable conditions. Fountain agreements for bottlers generally are not exclusive for a territory, but do restrict bottlers from carrying imitative product in the territory. 

The following chart details &#32; the distribution sources of our total 288 fluid ounce cases sold in the U.S. in 2015 : 

Agreements with PepsiCo and Coca-Cola 

On February 26, 2010, we completed the licensing of certain brands to PepsiCo following PepsiCo's acquisition of Pepsi Bottling Group and PepsiAmericas, Inc. The agreements have an initial period of 20 years with automatic 20-year renewal periods and require PepsiCo to meet certain performance conditions. 

&#32; 

On October 4, 2010, we completed the licensing of certain brands to Coca-Cola following Coca-Cola's acquisition of Coca-Cola Enterprises' North American Bottling Business and executed separate agreements pursuant to which Coca-Cola began offering Dr Pepper and Diet Dr Pepper in local fountain accounts and its Freestyle fountain program. The agreements have an initial period of 20 years with automatic 20-year renewal periods and require Coca-Cola to meet certain performance conditions. 

Under a separate agreement, Coca-Cola has agreed to include Dr Pepper and Diet Dr Pepper brands in its Freestyle fountain program. The Freestyle fountain program agreement has a period of 20 years. 

CUSTOMERS 

We primarily serve two groups of customers: 1) bottlers and distributors and 2) retailers. 

Bottlers buy beverage concentrates from us and, in turn, they manufacture, bottle, sell and distribute finished beverages. Bottlers also manufacture an d distribute syrup for the fountain foodservice channel. In addition, bottlers and distributors purchase finished beverages from us and sell them to retail and other customers. We have strong relationships with bottlers affiliated with Coca-Cola and PepsiCo primarily because of the strength and market position of our key Dr Pepper brand. 

Retailers also buy finished beverages directly from us. Our portfolio of strong brands, operational scale and experience in the beverage industry has enabled us to maintain strong relationships with major retailers in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. In 2015 , our largest retailer was Walmart, representing approximately 12% &#32;of our consolidated net sales. 

SEASONALITY 

The beverage market is subject to some seasonal variations. Our beverage sales are generally higher during the warmer months and also can be influenced by the timing of holidays as well as weather fluctuations. 

COMPETITION 

The LRB industry is highly competitive and continues to evolve in response to changing consumer preferences. Competition is generally based upon brand recognition, taste, quality, price, availability, selection and convenience. We compete with multinational corporations, such as Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, with significant financial resources. 

We also compete against other large companies, including Nestl&#233;, S.A. ("Nestle"), Kraft Foods Group, Inc. ("Kraft Foods") and The Campbell Soup Company ("Campbell Soup"). These competitors can use their resources and scale to rapidly respond to competitive pressures and changes in consumer preferences by introducing new products, reducing prices or increasing promotional activities. As a bottler and manufacturer, we also compete with a number of smaller bottlers and distributors and a variety of smaller, regional and private label manufacturers, such as The Cott Corporation ("Cott"). Smaller companies may be more innovative, better able to bring new products to market and better able to quickly exploit and serve niche markets. Other bottlers and manufacturers could also expand their contract manufacturing. We also have exposure to some of the faster growing non-carbonated and bottled water segments in the overall LRB market. In Canada, Mexico and the Caribbean, we compete with many of these same international companies as well as a number of regional competitors. 

Although these bottlers and distributors are our competitors, several of these companies are also our customers as they purchase beverage concentrates from us. 

&#32; 

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND TRADEMARKS 

Our Intellectual Property. &#160; We possess a variety of intellectual property rights that are important to our business. We rely on a combination of trademarks, copyrights, patents and trade secrets to safeguard our proprietary rights, including our brands and ingredient and production formulas for our products. 

Our Trademarks. &#160; Our trademark portfolio includes approximately 2,100 &#32;registrations and applications in the U.S., Canada, Mexico and other countries. Brands we own through various subsidiaries in various jurisdictions include Dr Pepper, Canada Dry, 7UP, Squirt, Pe&#241;afiel, Crush, A&#38;W, Schweppes, RC Cola, Sun Drop, Venom, Hawaiian Punch, Snapple, Mott's, Clamato, Aguafiel, Deja Blue, Mistic, ReaLemon, Mr &#38; Mrs T and Nantucket Nectars. We own trademark registrations for most of these brands in the U.S., and we own trademark registrations for some but not all of these brands in Canada, Mexico and other countries. We also own trademark registrations for a number of smaller regional brands. Some of our other trademark registrations are in countries where we do not currently have any significant level of business. In addition, in many countries outside the U.S., Canada and Mexico, our rights to many of our CSD brands, including our Dr Pepper trademark and formula, were sold by Cadbury beginning over a decade ago to third parties including, in certain cases, to competitors such as Coca-Cola. 

Trademarks Licensed from Others. &#160; We license various trademarks from third parties, which generally allow us to manufacture and distribute certain products or brands throughout the U.S. and/or Canada and Mexico. For example, we license from third parties the Sunkist soda, Stewart's, Rose's, Orangina and Margaritaville trademarks. Although these licenses vary in length and other terms, they generally are long-term, cover the entire U.S. and/or Canada and Mexico and generally include a royalty payment to the licensor. 

Licensed Distribution Rights for our Allied Brands. &#160; We have rights in certain territories to bottle and/or distribute various brands we do not own. Some of these arrangements are relatively shorter in term and limited in geographic scope, and the licensor may be able to terminate the agreement upon an agreed period of notice, in some cases without payment to us. Our Allied Brand portfolio includes, but is not limited to, the following brands: 

Intellectual Property We License to Others. &#160; We license some of our intellectual property, including trademarks, to others. For example, we license the Dr Pepper trademark to certain companies for use in connection with food, confectionery and other products. We also license certain brands, such as Dr Pepper and Snapple, to third parties for use in beverages in certain countries where we own the brand but do not otherwise operate our business. 

MARKETING 

Our marketing strategy is to grow our brands through continuously providing new solutions to meet consumers' changing preferences and needs. We identify these preferences and needs and then develop innovative consumer and shopper programs to address the opportunities. Solutions include new and reformulated products, improved packaging design, pricing and enhanced availability. We use &#32; advertising, sponsorships, merchandising, public relations, promotions and social media &#32; to provide maximum impact for our brands and messages. We also apply a marketing return on investment analysis to ensure we focus our marketing spend in a manner to drive profitable and sustainable growth in our key brands. 

MANUFACTURING 

As of December 31, 2015 , we operated 21 &#32;manufacturing facilities across the U.S. and Mexico. Almost all of our CSD beverage concentrates are manufactured at a single plant in St. Louis, Missouri. All of our manufacturing facilities are either regional manufacturing facilities, with the capacity and capabilities to manufacture many brands and packages, facilities with particular capabilities that are dedicated to certain brands or products, or smaller bottling plants with a more limited range of packaging capabilities. 

&#32; 

We have a variety of production capabilities, including hot-fill, cold-fill and aseptic bottling processes, and we manufacture beverages in a variety of packaging materials, including aluminum, glass and PET cans and bottles and a variety of package formats, including single-serve and multi-serve packages and "bag-in-box" fountain syrup packaging. 

In 2015 , 91% &#32;of our manufactured volumes came from our brands and 9% &#32;from third party and private-label products. We also use third party manufacturers to package our products for us on a limited basis. 

RAW MATERIALS 

The principal raw materials we use in our business, which we commonly refer to as ingredients and packaging costs, are aluminum cans and ends, glass bottles, PET bottles and caps, paper products, sweeteners, juice, fruit, water and other ingredients. These ingredients and packaging costs can fluctuate substantially. As it relates to our costs of sales, these costs make up a significant portion of our costs, as shown below. 

In addition, we are significantly impacted by changes in fuel costs, which can also fluctuate substantially, due to the large truck fleet we operate in our distribution businesses. 

Under many of our supply arrangements for these raw materials, the price we pay fluctuates along with certain changes in underlying commodities costs, such as aluminum in the case of cans, natural gas in the case of glass bottles, resin in the case of PET bottles and caps, corn in the case of sweeteners and pulp in the case of paperboard packaging. When appropriate, we mitigate the exposure to volatility in the prices of certain commodities used in our production process through the use of forward contracts and supplier pricing agreements. The intent of the contracts and agreements is to provide a certain level of short-term predictability in our operating margins and our overall cost structure, while remaining in what we believe to be a competitive cost position. 

Manufacturing costs for our Packaged Beverages segment, where we manufacture and bottle finished beverages, are higher as a percentage of our net sales than our Beverage Concentrates segment, as the Packaged Beverages segment requires the purchase of a much larger portion of the ingredients and packaging. Although we have contracts with a relatively small number of suppliers, we have generally not experienced any difficulties in obtaining the required amount of raw materials. 

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT 

Our research and development team is composed of scientists and engineers in the U.S. and Mexico who are focused on developing high quality products which have broad consumer appeal, can be sold at competitive prices and can be safely and consistently produced across a diverse manufacturing network. Our research and development team engages in activities relating to product development, microbiology, analytical chemistry, process engineering, sensory science, nutrition, knowledge management and regulatory compliance. We have particular expertise in flavors and sweeteners, which allows us to focus our research in areas of importance to the industry, such as new sweetener development. Refer to Note 2 of the Notes to our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements &#32;for further information. 

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY 

We use a variety of IT systems and networks configured to meet our business needs. Our primary IT data center is hosted in Toronto, Canada by a third party provider. We also use a third party vendor for application support and maintenance, which is based in India and provides resources offshore and onshore. 

&#32; 

EMPLOYEES 

As of &#32; December 31, 2015 , we employed approximately &#32; 19,000 e mployees. 

In the U.S., we have approximately &#32; 16,000 &#160; full-time employees. We have union collective bargaining agreements covering approximately &#32; 4,000 &#160; full-time employees. Several agreements cover multiple locations. These agreements address working conditions as well as wage rates and benefits. In Mexico and the Caribbean, we employ approximately &#32; 3,000 fu ll-time employees, with approximately &#32; 2,000 &#32; employees party to collective bargaining agreements. We do not have a significant number of employees in Canada or overseas. 

We believe we have good relations with our employees. 

REGULATORY MATTERS 

We are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws and regulations in the countries in which we do business. Regulations apply to many aspects of our business, including our products and their ingredients, manufacturing, safety, labeling, transportation, recycling, advertising and sale. For example, our products and their manufacturing, labeling, marketing and sale in the U.S. are subject to various aspects of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, the Lanham Act, state consumer protection laws and state warning and labeling laws. In Canada and Mexico, the manufacture, distribution, marketing and sale of many of our products are also subject to similar statutes and regulations. Additionally, the government of Mexico enacted broad based tax reform, including a one peso per liter tax on the manufacturing of certain sugar-sweetened beverages, which went into effect January 1, 2014. 

We and our bottlers use various refillable and non-refillable, recyclable bottles and cans in the U.S. and other countries. Various states and other authorities require deposits, eco-taxes or fees on certain containers. Similar legislation or regulations may be proposed in the future at local, state and federal levels, both in the U.S. and elsewhere. In Mexico, the government has encouraged the soft drink industry to comply voluntarily with collection and recycling programs of plastic material, and we are in compliance with these programs. 

ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH AND SAFETY MATTERS 

In the normal course of our business, we are subject to a variety of federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. We maintain environmental, health and safety policies and a quality, environmental, health and safety program designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The cost of such compliance measures does not have a material financial impact on our operations.

MARKET AND INDUSTRY DATA 

The market and industry data in this Annual Report on Form 10-K is from Nielsen, an independent industry source, and is based on retail dollar sales and sales volumes in 2015 . Although we believe that this independent source is reliable, we have not verified the accuracy or completeness of this data or any assumptions underlying such data. Nielsen is a marketing information provider, primarily serving consumer packaged goods manufacturers and retailers. We use Nielsen data as our primary management tool to track market performance because it has broad and deep data coverage, is based on consumer transactions at retailers, and is reported to us monthly. Nielsen data provides measurement and analysis of marketplace trends such as market share, retail pricing, promotional activity and distribution across various channels, retailers and geographies. Measured categories provided to us by Nielsen Scantrack include CSDs, energy drinks, carbonated waters, non-alcoholic mixers and NCBs, including ready-to-drink teas, single-serve and multi-serve juice and juice drinks, sports drinks and still waters. Nielsen also provides data on other food items such as apple sauce. Nielsen data we present in this report is from Nielsen's Scantrack service, which compiles data based on scanner transactions in key retail channels, including grocery stores, mass merchandisers (including Walmart), drug chains, convenience stores and gas stations. However, this data does not include the fountain or vending channels, or small independent retail outlets, which together represent a meaningful portion of the U.S. LRB market and of our net sales and volume.
