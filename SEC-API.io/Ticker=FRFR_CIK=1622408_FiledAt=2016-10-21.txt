&#160;

Our Company 

&#160;

We are engaged in the business of acquiring, developing, managing and selling residential and commercial income-producing properties in the Cincinnati and Dayton, Ohio metropolitan areas. We generate revenue primarily from rental income from the tenants occupying the properties we acquire and from the proceeds of property sales.

&#160;

We were incorporated in the State of Delaware on March 31, 2014. Since starting our business, we have acquired one light industrial facility in Dayton, Ohio. Our commercial property is currently being leased. We intend to expand our acquisitions to other select markets in nearby areas and states that fit our investment criteria as we continue to evaluate new investment opportunities in different markets. All of our properties to date have been managed and improved from available cash.

&#160;

Real Estate Investment Strategy 

&#160;

Our principal objective is to generate cash flow while gaining price appreciation at the same time through the ownership and/or management of our properties. With this objective in mind, we have developed our primary real estate investment strategy to focus on:

&#160;

&#183; income-producing residential and commercial properties, &#160;

&#160;

&#183; properties undervalued and/or in need of some repairs, &#160;

&#160;

&#183; tax lien sales, bank-owned foreclosures and other lender-owned real estate, and &#160;

&#160;

&#183; public and private auction properties. 

&#160;

We believe the execution of this strategy will allow us to generate immediate and steady cash flow from the rental income from the properties that we acquire and/or manage, while potentially gaining significant appreciation over time after these properties are renovated and, in some cases, environmentally remediated. We expect that the available cash flow generated from the rental income of our properties, as well as net proceeds from their sales, will allow us to pay the operating and improvement costs of our properties.

&#160; &#160; 3 

&#160;

We intend to seek potential property acquisitions located in Ohio and nearby states that meet the above criteria. We believe the most important factors for evaluating the markets in which we intend to purchase properties include:

&#160;

&#183; historic and projected population growth, &#160;

&#160;

&#183; historically high levels of tenant demand and lower historic investment volatility for the type of property being acquired, &#160;

&#160;

&#183; markets with historic and growing numbers of a qualified and affordable workforce, &#160;

&#160;

&#183; high historic and projected employment growth, &#160;

&#160;

&#183; stable household income and general economic stability, and &#160;

&#160;

&#183; real estate fundamentals, such as high occupancy rates and strong rent rate potential. 

&#160;

The markets in which we invest may not meet all of these criteria and the relative importance that we assign to any one or more of these criteria may differ from market to market or change as general economic and real estate market conditions evolve. We may also consider additional important criteria in the future. In order to diversify our portfolio, we may acquire a portion of our real estate investments through joint ventures with affiliates and third parties, such as institutional investors.

&#160;

We intend to finance future property acquisitions primarily by obtaining mortgages from local and regional banks or other financial institutions and raising equity capital through the sale of our common stock.

&#160;

Competitive Advantage 

&#160;

In addition to our real estate investment strategy, we believe that our competitive advantage includes our experienced management team and extensive sourcing network. Our management team has cultivated and developed a wide network of industry relationships over the years with brokers, sellers, property managers, general contractors, institutional investors, policymakers, lenders, aggregators of assets, environmental specialists and real estate lawyers, which we believe provides us with a distinct competitive advantage to source a greater number of off-market transactions. Through this network, we have been able to source attractive portfolio acquisitions and management projects, and we believe they may provide us with additional attractive privately-negotiated acquisition and management opportunities that in some cases may not be available to other market participants. We believe that this can result in more favorable pricing for acquisitions than if we were bidding on fully-marketed deals.

&#160;

1784 Stanley Avenue, Dayton, Ohio &#8211; On July 1, 2014, we acquired from the Bank of Scotland (which had previously foreclosed on this property) a light industrial facility located in Dayton, Ohio. The contract purchase price for the property was $75,000, plus closing costs of $4,248, which we paid with cash on hand. In June 2014, we had previously issued a note to Holly1 LLC, an unaffiliated third party, in the amount of $85,000 to fund our purchase of this property. The Stanley Avenue property encompasses 5.55 acres and the building occupies 77,792 rental square feet. 

&#160;

The Stanley Avenue property was vacant and being renovated through January 2016. In February 2016, we signed a two-year lease with a third party to occupy this site. Under the lease, the rent escalates for each six-month period, from $2,269 through month 6, $4,538 through month 12, $6,807 through month 18, and $9,400 through month 24. There is also a two-year renewal term, at a higher monthly rental rate. During the first calendar quarter of 2015, we received a grant from Jobs Ohio (a private, non-profit corporation designed to drive job creation and new capital investment in the state) to help fund an environmental study of the commercial site. We also sought to obtain environmental insurance on the property. In October 2015, we attended a Board of Revision hearing in Dayton, Ohio to reduce the amount of realty taxes payable for the property. The property was purchased for $75,000, yet the value on the Montgomery County Property Database was $1,107,210. On March 21, 2016, the Montgomery County Board of Pension re-assessed the fair market value of the property at $125,000 as of January 1, 2014.

&#160;

Currently, we are prepping the site&#8217;s underground utilities and sampling onsite wells. We are having meetings with the Ohio EPA and environmental and real estate lawyers and having discussions with Dayton Power &#38; Light about power lines. We are also coordinating with Northrup Grumman and other companies to perform on site environmental tests and Phase II work plans, drilling wells for groundwater screening, and leasing space on the property for advertising billboards.

&#160;

We have engaged Miller-Valentine GEM Real Estate Group, a full-service real estate firm in Dayton (for whom Steve Ireland, our Secretary and Director, is a Vice President), to market this site. Miller-Valentine GEM uses flyers, word of mouth advertising and LoopNet, an online commercial real estate listing service, among other methods, in its marketing efforts. We have agreed to pay Miller-Valentine GEM a brokerage fee of 6% of the sale price for any sale of the property during the listing period or, if the property is leased during such period, a leasing commission of 6% of the total rent for the initial term of the lease, payable in full at the signing of the lease. Additionally, the City of Dayton markets this site through its economic development office.

&#160; &#160; 5 

&#160;

To date, our two officers, Michael Heitz and Steve Ireland, have directed all aspects of our real estate operations, including the selection and management of our properties. We expect them to continue in that role for the foreseeable future, aided from time to time by local real estate firms that market the availability of our properties for a fixed price and on site part-time workers that renovate and clean our properties.

&#160;

Plan of Operation 

&#160;

During the next 12 months, our goal is to acquire at least two additional large commercial properties and one other property possibly through the Land Bank, as discussed below. We have been actively searching our target areas in the southern Ohio region and believe this goal is reasonably attainable by that date.

&#160;

Once a property is identified, we believe that we can secure financing on a property in an amount from $25,000 to $500,000. In determining the commercial properties that may be suitable for us to purchase, we look primarily for tax delinquencies, foreclosures and sales by owners, which often results in advantageous purchase prices. We will also be in contact with the Montgomery County, Ohio local government in order to identify attractive tax liens for purchase. We are actively looking at commercial properties that appear on the government&#8217;s tax lien database for future properties.

&#160;

Due to the broad range of commercial properties that we review, we are prepared to make a premium investment that exceeds $500,000, if that opportunity exists. In determining to make any such premium investment, we most significantly take into consideration the desirability of the location of the property site and, if applicable, any advantageous tax lien price or potential scrap value of an existing structure. We have no limit in our certificate of incorporation or other governing documents on the amount we may invest in any one property. While we expect our Board of Directors to be involved in any such premium investment given the current size of our company, management does not require any specific Board approval to make such investment.

&#160;

We also intend to be in contact with the Land Bank to identify other properties that we can rehabilitate and eventually sell or lease. Our goal is to acquire at least one property through this method each year. Property purchase prices and associated costs (including refurbishing) by way of acquiring tax liens and through the Land Bank are expected to be below $100,000 per property.

&#160;

We intend to finance future property acquisitions primarily by obtaining mortgages from local and regional banks or other financial institutions and raising equity capital through the sale of our common stock. There is no guarantee that we will be able to obtain financing when it is needed, or that such financing, if available, will be obtainable on terms favorable to or affordable by us.

&#160;

Investment Policies and Policies with respect to Certain Activities 

&#160;

The following is a discussion of our investment policies and our policies with respect to certain other activities, including financing matters and conflicts of interest. These policies may be amended or revised from time to time at the discretion of our Board of Directors, without stockholder approval. Any change to any of these policies by our Board of Directors, however, would be made only after a thorough review and analysis of that change, in light of then-existing business and other circumstances, and then only if, in the exercise of its business judgment, our Board of Directors believes that it is advisable to do so in our best interests. We intend to disclose any changes in our investment policies in periodic reports that we file or furnish under the Exchange Act. We cannot assure you that our investment objective will be attained.

&#160;

Investments in Real Estate. We invest principally in residential and commercial properties in the Cincinnati and Dayton, Ohio metropolitan areas and intend in the future to acquire properties in nearby areas and states that we believe exhibit housing, economic, demographic, employment and other characteristics that make investments in those properties attractive as investment properties for redevelopment, sale or lease.

&#160; &#160; 6 

&#160;

We pursue our investment objective through the ownership by our properties. Our management team identifies and negotiates acquisition and other investment opportunities, subject to the oversight of our Board of Directors. Investments are also subject to our policy not to be treated as an investment company under the 1940 Act.

&#160;

We do not have a specific policy to acquire assets primarily for capital gain or primarily for income, although we generally target properties that we believe will generate income in the near term. No limits have been set on the concentration of our investments in any one geographic location or property type. We currently anticipate that our real estate investments will continue to be concentrated in Cincinnati and Dayton, Ohio and in single-family homes and light industrial facilities. We anticipate that, over time, our real estate investments will become more diversified in terms of geographic market, but we expect our assets to be concentrated in certain markets that exhibit the characteristics that support our real estate investment strategy.

&#160;

Purchase and Sale of Investments. We expect to invest in our properties primarily for generation of current income and long-term capital appreciation. Although we do not intend to routinely &#8220;flip&#8221; our properties, we may be presented with opportunities from the Land Bank and other organizations to renovate dilapidated properties for immediate occupancy within short timeframes. We may also deliberately and strategically dispose of assets in the future and redeploy funds into new acquisitions and development opportunities that align with our strategic objectives.

&#160;

Regulation 

&#160;

General . Our properties are subject to various covenants, laws and ordinances and certain of our properties are also subject to the rules of various HOAs where such properties are located. We believe that we are in compliance with such covenants, laws, ordinances and rules, and we also require that our tenants agree to comply with such covenants, laws, ordinances and rules in their leases with us.

&#160;

Fair Housing Act . The Fair Housing Act, or FHA, its state law counterparts and the regulations promulgated by HUD and various state agencies, prohibit discrimination in housing on the basis of race or color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status (including children under the age of 18 living with parents or legal custodians, pregnant women and people securing custody of children under the age of 18), handicap or, in some states, financial capability. We believe that our properties are in substantial compliance with the FHA and other regulations.

&#160;

Environmental Matters . As a current or prior owner of real estate, we are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws, regulations and ordinances, and we could be liable to third parties as a result of environmental contamination or noncompliance at our properties, even if we no longer own such properties.

&#160;

Investment Company Act of 1940 . We intend to conduct our operations so that we are not required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.

&#160;

REIT Status . We do not intend to elect to operate as a real estate investment trust.

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

We face competition from many entities engaged in real estate investment activities, including individuals, other real estate investment companies, including newly formed REITs, and real estate limited partnerships. Our competitors may enjoy significant competitive advantages that result from, among other things, having substantially more available capital, a lower cost of capital and enhanced operating efficiencies. Further, the market for the rental of properties is highly competitive. We also face competition from new home builders, investors and speculators, as well as homeowners renting their properties.

&#160;

Risk Management 

&#160;

We face various forms of risk in our business ranging from broad economic, housing market and interest rate risks, to more specific factors, such as credit risk related to our tenants or buyers, re-leasing of properties and competition for properties. We believe that the systems and processes developed by our experienced management team since commencing our real estate investment operations will allow us to monitor and manage these risks.

&#160; &#160; 7 

&#160;

Insurance 

&#160;

We maintain property and liability insurance coverage related to our properties, and workers&#8217; compensation coverage for our employees. We believe the policy specifications and insured limits under our insurance program are appropriate and adequate for our business and properties given the relative risk of loss, the cost of the coverage and industry practice. However, our insurance coverage is subject to substantial deductibles and carve-outs, and we will be self-insured up to the amount of such deductibles and carve-outs.

&#160;

Intellectual Property 

&#160;

We have no patents or trademarks, which are not material to our business.

&#160;

Legal Proceedings 

&#160;

We are not involved in any litigation nor, to our knowledge, is any litigation threatened against us.

&#160;

Employees 

&#160;

On October 18, 2016, we had two individuals working for our company, one of whom is Michael Heitz, our President. Mr. Heitz devotes approximately 75% of his business time to our company. There are no written employment contracts or consulting agreements. We do not expect any of our future employees, if any, to be covered by a collective bargaining agreement. From time to time, we hire individuals for daily or weekly clean-up and repair work.
