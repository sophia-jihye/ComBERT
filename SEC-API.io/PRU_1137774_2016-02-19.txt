 ITEM 1. 

BUSINESS 

&#160; 

Overview 

&#160; 

Prudential Financial, Inc., a financial services leader with approximately $1.184 trillion of assets under management as of December 31, 2015, has operations in the United States, Asia, Europe and Latin America. Through our subsidiaries and affiliates, we offer a wide array of financial products and services, including life insurance, annuities, retirement-related services, mutual funds and investment management. We offer these products and services to individual and institutional customers through proprietary and third-party distribution networks. Our principal executive offices are located in Newark, New Jersey. 

&#160; 

Demutualization and Elimination of the Historic Separation of the Businesses 

&#160; 

On December 18, 2001, Prudential Insurance converted from a mutual life insurance company owned by its policyholders to a stock life insurance company and became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Prudential Financial. The demutualization was carried out under Prudential Insurance&#8217;s Plan of Reorganization, which required us to establish and operate a regulatory mechanism known as the Closed Block. The Closed Block includes certain in force participating insurance and annuity products and corresponding assets that are used for the payment of benefits and policyholders&#8217; dividends on these products, as well as certain related assets and liabilities. On the date of demutualization, eligible policyholders received shares of Prudential Financial&#8217;s Common Stock or the right to receive cash or policy credits, which are increases in policy values or increases in other policy benefits, upon the extinguishment of all membership interests in Prudential Insurance. 

From demutualization through December 31, 2014, the businesses of Prudential Financial were separated into the Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business for financial statement purposes. Prior to December 31, 2014, the Financial Services Businesses were comprised of the U.S. Retirement Solutions and Investment Management division, the U.S. Individual Life and Group Insurance division and the International Insurance division, and the Closed Block formed the principal component of the Closed Block Business. From demutualization through December 31, 2014, Prudential Financial also had two classes of common stock outstanding: the Common Stock, which is publicly-traded (NYSE:PRU) and which reflected the performance of the Financial Services Businesses, and the Class B Stock, which was issued through a private placement, did not trade on any stock exchange, and which reflected the performance of the Closed Block Business. In January 2015 we repurchased and cancelled all of the outstanding shares of Class B Stock. 

As a result of the repurchase of the Class B Stock, for reporting periods commencing after December 31, 2014, the Company&#8217;s earnings per share of Common Stock reflect the consolidated earnings of Prudential Financial, and the distinction between the Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business has been eliminated for financial statement purposes. The results of the Closed Block, along with certain related assets and liabilities, are reported as a separate segment, referred to as the &#8220;Closed Block division&#8221; and treated as a divested business under Prudential Financial&#8217;s definition of adjusted operating income. The results of divested businesses are included in &#8220;Net income&#8221; and &#8220;Income from continuing operations&#8221; determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (&#8220;U.S. GAAP&#8221;) but are excluded from adjusted operating income. See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Company&#8217;s definition of a divested business and an explanation of adjusted operating income, and see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and &#8220;&#8212;Closed Block Division&#8221; below for more information on the Closed Block. 

We refer to the divisions and segments of the Company that formerly comprised the Financial Services Businesses as &#8220;PFI excluding the Closed Block division&#8221; and we refer to the operations that were formerly included in the Closed Block Business as the &#8220;Closed Block division,&#8221; except as otherwise noted. 

Our Businesses &#160; 

Our principal operations are comprised of four divisions, which together encompass seven segments, and our Corporate and Other operations. The U.S. Retirement Solutions and Investment Management division consists of our Individual Annuities, Retirement and Asset Management segments. The U.S. Individual Life and Group Insurance division consists of our Individual Life and Group Insurance segments. The International Insurance division consists of our International Insurance segment. The Closed Block division consists of our Closed Block segment. Our Corporate and Other operations include businesses that have been or will be divested, corporate items and initiatives that are not allocated to business segments and businesses that are not sufficiently material to warrant separate disclosure. These businesses are described below. 

See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for revenues, income and loss, and total assets by segment. 

&#160; 

U.S. Retirement Solutions and Investment Management Division 

&#160; 

The U.S. Retirement Solutions and Investment Management division conducts its business through the Individual Annuities, Retirement and Asset Management segments. 

&#160; 

Individual Annuities 

&#160; 

Our Individual Annuities segment manufactures and distributes individual variable and fixed annuity products, primarily to the U.S. mass affluent market. We focus on innovative product design and risk management strategies. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

We compete with other providers of retirement savings and accumulation products, including large, well-established insurance and financial services companies, primarily based on our innovative product features and our risk management strategies. We also compete based on brand recognition, financial strength, the breadth of our distribution platform and our customer service capabilities. 

&#160; 

In recent years, we have experienced a dynamic competitive landscape, prompted by challenging global financial markets. We proactively monitor changes in the annuity marketplace, and have taken actions to adapt our products to the current environment in order to maintain appropriate return prospects and improve our risk profile. These actions have included variable annuity product modifications for new sales to adjust benefits pricing and commissions as well as closing of a share class. We also suspended or limited additional contractholder deposits for variable annuities with certain optional living benefit riders. Similarly, certain of our competitors have taken actions to modify benefits, to exit, or limit their presence in, the variable annuity marketplace. We believe our product offerings are competitive relative to substitute products currently available in the marketplace. In addition, we have introduced new products to broaden our offerings and diversify our risk profile and utilized external reinsurance as a form of risk mitigation, as discussed below, and have incorporated provisions in product design that allow frequent revisions of key pricing elements for new business. We continue to look for opportunities to further enhance and differentiate our current suite of products to attract new customers while responding to market conditions and managing risks. 

&#160; 

Products 

&#160; 

We offer certain variable annuities that provide our contractholders with tax-deferred asset accumulation together with a base death benefit and a suite of optional guaranteed living benefits (including versions with enhanced guaranteed minimum death benefits), and annuitization options. The majority of our currently sold contracts include an optional living benefit guarantee which provides, among other features, the ability to make withdrawals based on the highest daily contract value plus a specified return, credited for a period of time. This contract value is a notional amount that forms the basis for determining periodic withdrawals for the life of the contractholder, and cannot be accessed as a lump sum surrender value. Certain optional living benefits can also be purchased with a companion optional death benefit, also based on a highest daily contract value. 

The Prudential Premier &#174; &#32;Retirement Variable Annuity with Highest Daily Lifetime Income (&#8220;HDI&#8221;) v.3.0 offers lifetime income based on the highest daily account value plus a compounded deferral credit. Effective April 1, 2015, we entered into an agreement with Union Hamilton Reinsurance, Ltd. (&#8220;Union Hamilton&#8221;), an external counterparty, to reinsure approximately 50% of the HDI v.3.0 business. This reinsurance agreement covers most new HDI v.3.0 variable annuity business issued between April 1, 2015 and December 31, 2016 on a quota share basis, until Union Hamilton&#8217;s quota share reaches $5 billion of new rider premiums through December 31, 2016. 

The Prudential Defined Income (&#8220;PDI&#8221;) Variable Annuity complements the variable annuity products we offer with the highest daily benefit. PDI provides for guaranteed lifetime withdrawal payments, but restricts contractholder investment to a single bond sub-account within the separate account. PDI includes a living benefit rider which provides for a specified lifetime income withdrawal rate applied to the initial premium paid, subject to annual roll-up increases until lifetime withdrawals commence, but does not have the highest daily feature. 

&#160; 

We also offer immediate annuities and variable annuities without guaranteed living benefits. We offer the Prudential Immediate Income Annuity, which is a fixed single premium immediate annuity that provides fixed payments over a specific time period and the Prudential Premier &#174; &#32;Investment Variable Annuity, which offers tax-deferred asset accumulation, annuitization options and an optional death benefit that guarantees the contractholder&#8217;s beneficiary a return of total purchase payments made to the contract, adjusted for any partial withdrawals, upon death. 

&#160; 

Excluding our PDI product, the majority of our variable annuities generally provide our contractholders with the opportunity to allocate purchase payments to sub-accounts that invest in underlying proprietary and/or non-proprietary mutual funds, frequently under asset allocation programs. Certain products also allow or require allocation to fixed-rate accounts that are invested in the general account and are credited with interest at rates we determine, subject to certain minimums. We also offer fixed annuities that provide a guarantee of principal and interest credited at rates we determine, subject to certain contractual minimums. Certain allocations made in the fixed-rate accounts of our variable annuities and certain fixed annuities impose a market value adjustment if the invested amount is not held to maturity. 

&#160; 

In addition, most contracts also guarantee the contractholder&#8217;s beneficiary a return of total purchase payments made to the contract, adjusted for any partial withdrawals, upon death. Certain inforce contracts include guaranteed benefits which are not currently offered, such as annuitization benefits based on a guaranteed notional amount and benefits payable at specified dates after the accumulation period. 

&#160; 

For information regarding the risks inherent in our products and the mitigants we have in place to limit our exposure to these risks, see &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Results of Operations by Segment&#8212;U.S. Retirement Solutions and Investment Management Division&#8212;Individual Annuities&#8212;Variable Annuity Risks and Risk Mitigants.&#8221; 

&#160; 

Marketing and Distribution 

&#160; 

Our annuity products are distributed through a diverse group of third-party broker-dealers and their representatives, in banks and wirehouses, and through independent financial planners. Additionally, our variable annuity products are distributed through financial professionals, including those associated with Prudential Advisors, our domestic national sales organization, and the agency distribution force of The Allstate Corporation (&#8220;Allstate&#8221;). Our distribution efforts are supported by a network of internal and external wholesalers. 

&#160; 

Underwriting and Pricing 

&#160; 

We earn asset management fees determined as a percentage of the average assets of the mutual funds in our variable annuity products, net of sub-advisory expenses related to non-proprietary sub-advisors. Additionally, we earn mortality and expense and other fees for various insurance-related options and features based on the average daily net asset value of the annuity separate accounts, account value, premium, or guaranteed value, as applicable. We also receive administrative service and distribution fees from many of the proprietary and non-proprietary mutual funds. 

&#160; 

We price our variable annuities based on an evaluation of the risks assumed and consideration of applicable risk management strategies, including hedging and reinsurance costs. Our pricing is also influenced by competition and assumptions regarding contractholder behavior, including persistency, benefit utilization and the timing and efficiency of withdrawals for contracts with living benefit features, as well as other assumptions. Significant deviations in actual experience from our pricing assumptions could have an adverse or positive effect on the profitability of our products. To encourage persistency, most of our variable and fixed annuities have surrender or withdrawal charges for a specified number of years. In addition, the living benefit features of our variable annuity products encourage persistency because the potential value of the living benefit is fully realized only if the contract persists. 

&#160; 

We price our fixed annuities and the fixed-rate accounts of our variable annuities based on assumed investment returns, expenses, competition and persistency, as well as other assumptions. We seek to maintain a spread between the return on our general account invested assets and the interest we credit on our fixed annuities and the fixed-rate accounts of our variable annuities. 

&#160; 

Reserves 

&#160; 

We establish reserves for our annuity products in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We use current best estimate assumptions when establishing reserves for our guaranteed minimum death and income benefits, including assumptions such as interest rates, equity returns, persistency, withdrawal, mortality and annuitization rates. Certain of the living benefit guarantee features on variable annuity contracts are accounted for as embedded derivatives and are carried at fair value. The fair values of these benefit features are calculated as the present value of future expected benefit payments to contractholders less the present value of future expected rider fees attributable to the embedded derivative feature and are based on assumptions a market participant would use in valuing these embedded derivatives. &#32; For life contingent payout annuity contracts, we establish reserves using best estimate assumptions with provisions for adverse deviations as of inception or best estimate assumptions as of the most recent loss recognition event. For variable and fixed annuity contracts, we establish liabilities for contractholders&#8217; account balances that represent cumulative deposits plus credited interest, less withdrawals, mortality and expense charges. Policyholders&#8217; account balances also include provisions for non-life contingent payout annuity benefits. 

Retirement 

&#160; 

Our Retirement segment, which we refer to in the marketplace as Prudential Retirement, provides retirement investment and income products and services to retirement plan sponsors in the public, private, and not-for-profit sectors. Our full service business provides recordkeeping, plan administration, actuarial advisory services, tailored participant education and communication services, trustee services and institutional and retail investments. We service defined contribution, defined benefit and non-qualified plans, and for clients with combinations of these plans, we offer integrated recordkeeping services. We also provide certain brokerage services through our broker-dealer, Prudential Investment Management Services LLC, and trust services through Prudential Bank &#38; Trust, FSB (&#8220;PB&#38;T&#8221;), a limited purpose trust-only institution. Our institutional investment products business offers investment-only stable value products, pension risk transfer solutions and other payout annuities, including guaranteed investment contracts (&#8220;GICs&#8221;), funding agreements, structured settlement annuities and other group annuities for defined contribution plans, defined benefit plans, non-qualified plans, and individuals. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

The Retirement segment competes with other large, well-established insurance companies, asset managers, recordkeepers and diversified financial institutions. In our full service business, we compete primarily based on pricing, the breadth of our service and investment offerings, investment performance, and our ability to offer product features to meet the retirement income needs of our clients. We collect revenue based on assets or per participant charges for plan administration, recordkeeping and employee education services. We continue to have heightened pricing pressures, driven by competition, contractual limits on fee income, the increasing presence of intermediaries and regulations requiring more standard and consistent fee disclosures across industry providers. Additionally, we have seen slow case turnover in our mid to large case target markets. 

&#160; 

In our institutional investment products business, we compete primarily based on our pricing and structuring capabilities, as well as our ability to offer innovative product solutions and successfully execute large-scale transactions. Sales of institutional investment products are affected by competitive factors such as investment performance, company credit and financial strength ratings, product design, marketplace visibility, distribution capabilities, fees, crediting rates, and customer service. We are a leader in providing innovative pension risk management solutions to plan sponsors and in the stable value wrap market. We believe the pension risk transfer market continues to offer attractive opportunities that are aligned with our expertise. Previous rapid growth in our investment-only stable value product has slowed as competitive supply has increased to meet demand. For certain other institutional investment products, issuances over the past several years were impacted by unfavorable economic conditions and other competitive factors. We have recently experienced an increase in new issuances of certain of these products; however, maturing contracts continue to outpace new issuances. 

&#160; 

Products and Services 

&#160; 

Full Service 

Our full service business offers plan sponsors and their participants a broad range of products and services to assist in the delivery and administration of defined contribution, defined benefit, and non-qualified plans, including recordkeeping and administrative services, comprehensive investment offerings and consulting services to assist plan sponsors in managing fiduciary obligations. As part of our investment products, we offer a variety of general and separate account stable value products and other fee-based separate accounts, as well as retail mutual funds and institutional funds advised by affiliated and non-affiliated investment managers. In addition, certain products are marketed and sold on an investment-only basis through our full service distribution channels. 

&#160; 

Our full service general account and separate account stable value products contain an obligation to pay interest at a specified rate for a specific period of time and to repay account balances or market value upon contract termination. These stable value products are either fully or partially participating, with annual or semi-annual rate resets subject to certain contractual minimums, giving effect to previous investment experience. We earn profits from partially participating products from the spread between the rate of return we earn on the investments and the interest rates we credit, less expenses. In addition, we may earn administrative fees for providing recordkeeping and other administrative services for both fully and partially participating products. 

&#160; 

We also offer fee-based products, through which customer funds are held in separate accounts, retail mutual funds, institutional funds, or a client-owned trust. These products generally pass all of the investment results to the customer. In certain cases, these contracts are subject to a minimum interest rate guarantee backed by the general account. Additionally, we offer guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits associated with certain defined contribution accounts, and hedge certain of the related risks utilizing externally purchased hedging instruments. 

&#160; 

Our full service fee-based advisory offerings are supported by participant communications and education programs, and a broad range of plan consulting services, including non-discrimination testing, plan document services, signature-ready documents for required filings, and full actuarial support for defined benefit plans. Additional services include non-qualified deferred compensation plan administration, including executive benefit solutions and financing strategies, investment advisory services, and merger and acquisition support. 

&#160; 

Institutional Investment Products 

Our institutional investment products business primarily offers products to the payout annuity and stable value markets. 

&#160; 

Payout Annuity Markets. &#32;We offer products designed to provide a predictable source of monthly income, generally for the life of the participant. Our newer pension risk transfer products include portfolio-protected products and a longevity reinsurance product. Our portfolio-protected products are non-participating group annuity contracts which we issue to pension plan sponsors and assume all of the investment and actuarial risk associated with a group of specified participants within a plan in return for a premium typically paid as a lump sum at inception. These products have economic features similar to our legacy general account annuity contracts, discussed below, but may also offer the added protection of an insulated separate account. Our longevity reinsurance product is a reinsurance contract from which we earn a fee for assuming the longevity risk of pension plans that have been insured by third-parties, typically with monthly net settlements of premiums and benefits. As of December 31, 2015, our pension risk transfer business in force had an approximate average age of 73. 

&#160; 

Our legacy products include structured settlements, voluntary income products and other group annuities, which fulfill the payment guarantee needs of the personal injury lawsuit settlement market, the distribution needs of defined contribution participants and the payment obligations of defined benefit plans, respectively. For our general account products, we bear all of the investment, mortality, retirement, asset/liability management, and expense risk associated with these contracts. Our profits reflect the emerging experience related to investment returns, timing of mortality, timing of retirement, and the level of expenses being more or less favorable than assumed in the original pricing. Our separate account products are primarily fee-based products that cover payments to be made to defined benefit plan retirees. These contracts permit a plan sponsor to retain the risks and rewards of investment and actuarial results while receiving a general account guarantee for all annuity payments covered by the contract. 

&#160; 

Stable Value Markets. We manufacture investment-only products for use in retail and institutional capital markets and qualified plan markets. Our primary stable value product offerings are investment-only wraps through which customers&#8217; funds are held in a client-owned trust. These are participating contracts for which investment results pass through to the customer, subject to a minimum interest rate guarantee backed by the general account, and we earn fees for providing this guarantee. For contracts currently in force, the minimum interest rate has a floor of zero percent. The fees we earn for providing this guarantee may be reset as defined by the underlying contracts. Contractholders are provided with proprietary and non-proprietary flexible fund investment alternatives. 

&#160; 

We also offer investment-only general account products in the form of GICs and funding agreements. These products contain an obligation to pay interest at a specified rate and to repay principal at maturity or following contract termination. Because these obligations are backed by our general account, we bear the investment and asset/liability management risk associated with these contracts. Generally, profits from these products result from the spread between the rates of return we earn on the investments and the interest rates we credit, less expenses. 

&#160; 

Marketing and Distribution 

&#160; 

We distribute our products through a variety of channels. In our full service business, our dedicated sales and support teams manage our distribution efforts in offices across the country. We sell our products and services through third-party financial advisors, brokers, and benefits consultants and, to a lesser extent, directly to plan sponsors. Our clients typically prefer to transition plans either at the beginning or end of their fiscal year, which are generally during our fourth quarter. 

&#160; 

In our stable value area within our institutional investment products business, we utilize our direct sales force and intermediaries to distribute investment-only stable value wraps and traditional GICs to plan sponsors and stable value fund managers, and to distribute funding agreements to investors. We also manage a global Funding Agreement Notes Issuance Program, pursuant to which a statutory trust issues medium-term notes secured by funding agreements issued to the trust by Prudential Insurance. Prudential Insurance may also issue funding agreements directly to the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York. 

&#160; 

In our payout annuity area within our institutional investment products business, our pension risk transfer products, traditional group annuities and participating separate account annuities are typically distributed through actuarial consultants and third-party brokers. Structured settlements are distributed through structured settlement specialists. Voluntary income products are distributed through the defined contribution portion of our full service business, directly to plan sponsors, or as part of annuity price quoting services. 

&#160; 

Underwriting and Pricing 

&#160; 

We set our rates for our full service and institutional investment products using pricing models that consider the investment environment and our risk, expense and profitability targets. In addition, for products within our payout annuity area, our models also use assumptions for mortality and, if pertinent, early retirement risks. These assumptions may be less predictable in certain markets, and deviations in actual experience from pricing assumptions could affect the profitability of these products. For our investment-only stable value wrap product, our pricing risk is mitigated by several features, including: the fees we earn for providing a guaranteed rate of return may be reset, as defined by the underlying contracts; the contracts allow participants to withdraw funds at book value, while contractholder withdrawals occur at market value immediately or at book value over time; and our obligation is limited to payments that are in excess of the fund value. 

&#160; 

Reserves 

&#160; 

We establish reserves for our retirement products in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We use best estimate assumptions with provisions for adverse deviation as of inception or best estimate assumptions as of the most recent loss recognition event when establishing reserves for future policyholder benefits and expenses, including assumptions for investment yield, expenses, mortality rates and retirement. Future policyholder benefit reserves also include amounts related to deferred profit liabilities, where applicable. We also establish liabilities for policyholders&#8217; account balances and additional reserves for investment experience that will accrue to the customer but have not yet been reflected in credited rates. Policyholders&#8217; account balances also include provisions for non-life contingent payout annuity benefits. 

Asset Management 

&#160; 

Effective January 1, 2016, the Asset Management segment, formerly known in the marketplace as Prudential Investment Management, has rebranded as PGIM, The Global Investment Management Businesses of Prudential Financial, Inc. 

The Asset Management segment provides a broad array of investment management and advisory services by means of institutional portfolio management, retail funds management, private lending and asset securitization activity and other structured products. These products and services are provided to third-party clients as well as other Prudential businesses. We also invest in asset management and investment distribution businesses in targeted countries, including through investments in operating joint ventures, to expand our mass affluent customer base outside the U.S. and to increase our global assets under management. 

&#160; 

We earn asset management fees which are typically based upon a percentage of assets under management. In certain asset management arrangements, we also receive performance-based incentive fees when the return on the managed assets exceeds certain benchmark returns or other performance targets. Transaction fees are earned as a percentage of the transaction price associated with the sale or purchase of assets in certain funds, primarily related to real estate. In addition, we earn investment returns from strategic investing and revenues from commercial mortgage origination and servicing. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

The Asset Management segment competes with numerous asset managers and other financial institutions. For our asset management products, we compete based on a number of factors, including investment performance, strategy and process, talent, organizational stability and client relationships. We offer products across multiple asset classes, with specialized investment teams that employ approaches designed to add value in each product area or asset class. Our organizational stability and robust institutional and retail businesses have helped attract and retain talent critical to delivering investment results for clients. Our private placement and commercial mortgage businesses compete based on price, terms, execution and the strength of our relationship with the borrower. Competition will vary depending on the product or service being offered. 

&#160; 

Products and Services 

&#160; 

We offer asset management services for public and private fixed income, public equity and real estate, as well as commercial mortgage origination and servicing, and mutual funds and other retail services through the following eight businesses:

Our global real estate organization has an established presence in the U.S., Europe, Asia and Latin America. 

&#160; 

Prudential Investments . Prudential Investments manufactures, distributes and services investment management products primarily utilizing proprietary asset management expertise in the U.S. retail market. These products are designed to be sold primarily by financial professionals including third-party advisors and licensed sales professionals within Prudential Advisors. We offer a family of retail investment products consisting of over 60 mutual funds as of December 31, 2015. These products cover a wide array of investment styles and objectives designed to attract and retain assets of individuals with varying objectives and to accommodate investors&#8217; changing financial needs. 

&#160;

Our international investment operations primarily consist of our asset management operations in Taiwan, and our operating joint ventures in Brazil, India and Italy that are accounted for under the equity method. 

&#160; 

In addition, we make strategic investments to support the creation and management of funds offered to third-party investors in private and public real estate, fixed income and public equities asset classes. Certain of these investments are made primarily for purposes of co-investment in our managed funds and structured products. Other strategic investments are made with the intention to sell or syndicate to investors, including our general account, or for placement in funds and structured products that we offer and manage (seed investments). We also make loans to, and guarantee obligations of, our managed funds that are secured by equity commitments from investors or assets of the funds. 

&#160; 

Marketing and Distribution 

&#160; 

We provide investment management services for our institutional customers through a proprietary sales force organized by each asset management business. Each business has an independent marketing and service team working with clients. Institutional asset management services are also offered through the Retirement segment. 

&#160; 

Most of the retail customer assets under management are invested in our mutual funds and our variable annuities and variable life insurance products. These assets are gathered by distribution forces associated with other Prudential businesses and by third-party networks. Additionally, we work with third-party product manufacturers and distributors to include our investment options in their products and platforms. 

&#160; 

We also provide investment management services across a broad array of asset classes for our general account, as described under &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;General Account Investments.&#8221; 

&#160; 

U.S. Individual Life and Group Insurance Division 

&#160; 

The U.S. Individual Life and Group Insurance division conducts its business through the Individual Life and Group Insurance segments. 

&#160; 

Individual Life 

&#160; 

Our Individual Life segment manufactures and distributes individual variable life, term life and universal life insurance products primarily to the U.S. mass middle, mass affluent and affluent markets. In general, we consider households with investable assets or annual income in excess of $100,000 to be mass affluent and households with investable assets in excess of $250,000 to be affluent in the U.S. market. Our life products are distributed through independent third-party distributors and licensed sales professionals within Prudential Advisors. 

&#160; 

On January 2, 2013, we acquired The Hartford Financial Services Group&#8217;s individual life insurance business through a reinsurance transaction. Under the agreement, we paid cash consideration of $615 million, primarily in the form of a ceding commission, to provide reinsurance for approximately 700,000 life insurance policies with a net retained face amount in force of approximately $141 billion. This acquisition increased our scale in the U.S. individual life insurance market, particularly universal life products, and provided complementary distribution opportunities through expanded wirehouse and bank distribution channels. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

The Individual Life segment competes with other large, well-established life insurance companies in a mature market. We compete primarily based on price, service, distribution channel relationships, brand recognition and financial strength. Due to the large number of competitors, pricing is competitive. Factors that could influence our ability to competitively price products while achieving targeted returns include the level, cost and availability of financing for statutory reserves required for certain term and universal life insurance policies, the availability, utilization and timing of tax deductions associated with statutory reserves, product designs that impact the amount of statutory reserves and the associated tax deductions, the level and volatility of interest rates, and our expense structure. 

&#160; 

We periodically adjust product prices and features based on the market and our strategy, which allows us to manage the Individual Life business for steady, consistent sales growth across a balanced product portfolio and to avoid over-concentration in any one product type. These actions, and the actions of competitors, can impact our sales levels from period to period. 

&#160; 

Products 

&#160; 

Our primary insurance products are term life, variable life, guaranteed universal life and all other universal life, which represent 42%, 34%, 15% and 8%, respectively, of our face amount of individual life insurance in force, net of reinsurance as of December 31, 2015. Our product diversification strategy has decreased the proportional contribution to sales of guaranteed universal life and increased the proportion of other products. This strategy has positioned us to better balance portfolio risk and enhance our value proposition to our distribution partners and their clients. Additionally, most of our variable and universal life products now offer a policy rider that allows death benefits to be accelerated to the policyholder during a chronic or terminal illness, under certain contractual requirements. 

&#160; 

Term Life Insurance. We offer a variety of term life insurance products that provide coverage for a specified time period. Most term products include a feature that allows the policyholder to convert the policy into permanent life insurance coverage. We also offer term life insurance that provides for a return of premium if the insured is alive at the end of the level premium period. There continues to be significant demand for term life insurance protection. 

&#160; 

Variable Life Insurance. We offer several individual variable life insurance products that give the policyholder the flexibility to change both the death benefit and premium payments, and provide the potential to earn returns linked to an underlying investment portfolio that the policyholder selects. The policyholder generally can make deposits for investments in a fixed-rate option which is part of our general account or in separate account investment options consisting of equity and fixed income funds. Funds invested in the fixed-rate option provide a guarantee of principal and are credited with interest at rates that we determine, subject to certain contractual minimums. In the separate accounts, the policyholder bears the fund performance risk. We also offer a variable life product that has an optional flexible guarantee against lapse where policyholders can select the guarantee period. While variable life insurance continues to be an important product, marketplace demand continues to favor term and universal life insurance. A meaningful portion of Individual Life&#8217;s profits, however, is associated with our large in force block of variable policies which are expected to run off over time as policies age. 

&#160; 

Universal Life Insurance. We offer universal life insurance products that feature flexible premiums and a crediting rate that we determine, subject to certain contractual minimums. Guaranteed universal life products provide a guarantee of death benefits to remain in force when a policy would otherwise lapse due to insufficient cash value. We also offer universal life insurance products that allow the policyholder to allocate all or a portion of their account balance into an index account. The index account provides interest or an interest component linked to, but not an investment in, S&#38;P 500 index performance over the following year, subject to certain participation rates and contractual minimums and maximums. Mortality and expense margins and net interest spread impact Individual Life&#8217;s profits from universal life insurance. 

&#160; 

Marketing and Distribution 

&#160; 

Individual Life provides products to the U.S. mass and mass affluent markets through the following two channels: 

Third-Party Distribution. Our individual life products are offered through a variety of third-party channels, including independent brokers, wirehouses, banks, general agencies and producer groups. We focus on sales through independent intermediaries who provide life insurance solutions to protect individuals, families and businesses and support estate and wealth transfer planning. 

&#160; 

Prudential Advisors. Prudential&#8217;s national in-house sales agency, formerly known as Agency Distribution, was renamed Prudential Advisors to more accurately reflect the role that its financial professionals play in the marketplace, as well as to better align with the array of financial products and services they offer. It distributes Prudential variable, term and universal life insurance, variable and fixed annuities and investment products with proprietary and non-proprietary investment options. It also distributes selected insurance and investment products from other carriers and has access to non-proprietary property and casualty products distributed under agreements with the purchasers of our property and casualty insurance operations, which we sold in 2003, and other third-party providers. In addition, Prudential Advisors offers certain retail brokerage and retail investment advisory services through our dually registered broker-dealer and investment adviser, Pruco Securities, LLC. These services include brokerage accounts, discretionary and non-discretionary investment advisory programs and financial planning services. 

&#160; 

Individual Life is paid a market rate by the Annuities and Asset Management segments to distribute their products. Any profit or loss is included in the results of the Individual Life segment and eliminated in consolidation. 

&#160; 

Underwriting and Pricing 

&#160; 

Underwriters assess and quantify the risk of our individual life insurance products based on the age, gender, health and occupation of the applicant and amount of insurance requested. We continually update our guidelines to keep pace with changes in healthcare, research, and experience. We base premiums and policy charges for individual life insurance on expected death benefits, surrender benefits, expenses and required reserves. We use assumptions for mortality and morbidity, interest rates, expenses, policy persistency, premium payment patterns, separate account fund performance and product-generated tax deductions, as well as the level, cost and availability of financing certain statutory reserves, in pricing policies. Deviations in actual experience from our pricing assumptions may adversely or positively impact the profitability of our products. 

&#160; 

Reserves 

&#160; 

We establish reserves for individual life products in accordance with U.S. GAAP. For term life insurance contracts and other benefits with fixed and guaranteed terms, we use best estimate assumptions with provisions for adverse deviation as of inception when establishing reserves for future policyholder benefits and expenses including assumptions for mortality and morbidity, investment yield, expenses, and policy persistency. We use current best estimate assumptions when establishing reserves for no lapse guarantees. Reserves also include claims reported but not yet paid, and claims incurred but not yet reported. For variable and universal life insurance contracts, we establish liabilities for policyholders&#8217; account balances. These liabilities represent cumulative deposits plus credited interest, less withdrawals, and expense and cost of insurance charges, as applicable. Policyholders&#8217; account balances also include unearned revenue reserves calculated based on current best estimate assumptions. 

&#160; 

Reinsurance 

&#160; 

The Individual Life segment uses reinsurance as a means of managing mortality volatility and risk capacity, which can impact product profitability. On policies sold since 2000, we have reinsured a significant portion of the mortality risk assumed, with that portion varying over time depending on market factors and strategic objectives. Commencing in 2013, the maximum exposure we retain for new business is $20 million on both single life policies and second-to-die policies. Over time we have accumulated policies with higher retained exposure which may result in earnings volatility. In addition, certain transactions, such as assumed reinsurance or acquisitions of in force contracts, may cause us to temporarily or permanently exceed this limit on an aggregate basis. We remain liable if a third-party reinsurer is for some reason unable to meet its obligations. On a Company-wide basis, we evaluate the financial condition of reinsurers and monitor the concentration of counterparty risk to mitigate this exposure. 

&#160; 

Group Insurance 

&#160; 

Our Group Insurance segment offers a full range of group life, long-term and short-term group disability, and group corporate-, bank- and trust-owned life insurance in the U.S. primarily to institutional clients for use in connection with employee plans and affinity groups. We also sell accidental death and dismemberment and other ancillary coverages, and provide plan administrative services in connection with our insurance coverages. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

We compete with other large, well-established life and health insurance providers in mature U.S. markets, and are a top provider of both group life and disability insurance. We compete primarily based on price, brand recognition, service capabilities, customer relationships, financial strength and range of product offerings. Pricing of group insurance products reflects the large number of competitors in the marketplace. The majority of our premiums are derived from large corporations, affinity groups or other organizations having over 10,000 insured individuals. Employee-paid (voluntary) coverage has become increasingly important as employers attempt to control costs and shift benefit decisions and funding to employees who continue to value benefits offered at the workplace. Our profitability is dependent, in part, on penetration in the voluntary coverage marketplace, which will be affected by future employment and compensation rates. 

&#160; 

Products 

&#160; 

Group Life Insurance. Our portfolio of group life insurance products consists of employer-paid (basic) and employee-paid coverages, including term life insurance for employees and employees&#8217; dependents as well as group universal life insurance. We offer group variable universal life insurance, basic and voluntary accidental death and dismemberment insurance, business travel accident insurance, a critical illness product and an accident insurance product. Many of our employee-paid coverages allow employees to retain their coverage when they change employers or retire. We also offer waiver of premium coverage where required premiums are waived in the event the insured suffers a qualifying disability. 

&#160; 

Our group corporate-, bank- and trust-owned life insurance products are group variable life insurance contracts utilizing separate accounts, and are typically used by large corporations to fund deferred compensation plans and benefit plans for retired employees. 

&#160; 

Group Disability Insurance. We offer short- and long-term group disability insurance, which protects against loss of wages due to illness or injury, as well as plan administrative services and absence management services. Disability benefits are limited to a portion, generally 50% to 70%, of the insured&#8217;s earned income up to a specified maximum benefit. Short-term disability generally provides a weekly benefit for three to six months, while long-term disability benefits are paid monthly, following a waiting period (usually 90 or 180 days, during which short-term disability may be provided) and generally continue until the insured returns to work or reaches normal retirement age. 

&#160; 

Marketing and Distribution 

&#160; 

Group Insurance offers its portfolio of products and customized benefit solutions through its own dedicated sales force that is organized around market segments and distributes primarily through employee benefit brokers and consultants. 

&#160; 

Underwriting and Pricing 

&#160; 

We price each product line using underwriting practices and rating systems that consider Company, industry and/or other experience. We assess the risk profile of prospective insured groups; however, certain voluntary products or coverages may require underwriting on an individual basis. We are not obligated to accept any individual certificate application, and may require a prospective insured to submit evidence of insurability. 

&#160; 

We maintain a disciplined approach to pricing our group life and disability insurance products. We base pricing of group insurance products on the expected pay-out of benefits and other costs that we calculate using assumptions for mortality and morbidity rates, interest rates and expenses, depending upon the specific product features. On many of our group policies, we provide multiple year rate guarantees, which can contribute to fluctuations in profitability. For certain policies with experience-rated return provisions, the final premium is adjusted to reflect the client&#8217;s actual experience during the past year. For these policies, the group contractholder bears some of the risk, or receives some of the benefit, associated with claim experience fluctuations, thus lessening the fluctuations in profitability. 

&#160; 

Reserves 

&#160; 

We establish reserves for group insurance products in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We primarily use current best estimate assumptions when establishing reserves for future policyholder benefits and expenses including assumptions for mortality, morbidity and claim termination rates, interest rates and Social Security offsets. Reserves also include claims reported but not yet paid, and claims incurred but not yet reported. We also establish liabilities for policyholders&#8217; account balances that represent cumulative deposits plus credited interest, less withdrawals, and expense and cost of insurance charges, as applicable. 

&#160; 

Reinsurance 

&#160; 

We use reinsurance primarily to limit losses from large claims, and in response to client requests. We remain liable if a third-party reinsurer is for some reason unable to meet its obligations. On a Company-wide basis, we evaluate the financial condition of reinsurers and monitor concentration of counterparty risk to mitigate this exposure. 

&#160; 

International Insurance Division 

&#160; 

The International Insurance division conducts its business through the International Insurance segment. 

&#160; 

International Insurance 

&#160; 

Our International Insurance segment manufactures and distributes individual life insurance, retirement and related products, including certain health products with fixed benefits. We provide these products to the broad middle income and mass affluent markets across Japan through multiple distribution channels including banks, independent agencies and Life Consultants associated with our Gibraltar Life Insurance Company, Ltd. (&#8220;Gibraltar Life&#8221;) operations. We also provide similar products to the mass affluent and affluent markets through our Life Planner operations in Japan, Korea and other countries outside the U.S., including Taiwan, Italy, Brazil, Argentina, Poland and Mexico. We continue to seek opportunities for expansion into high-growth markets in targeted countries. 

&#160; 

For the year ended December 31, 2015, our Life Planner and Gibraltar Life operations in Japan represented 37% and 51%, respectively, of the net premiums, policy charges and fee income of the International Insurance segment and, in aggregate, represented 36% of the net premiums, policy charges and fee income of Prudential Financial, translated on the basis of weighted average monthly exchange rates. 

&#160; 

In addition to the operations discussed above, as of December 31, 2015, we have a 26% interest in a life insurance joint venture in India and a 70% interest in an established life insurance business in Malaysia. 

&#160; 

We manage each operation on a stand-alone basis through local management and sales teams, with oversight by senior executives based in Newark, New Jersey and outside the United States. Each operation has its own marketing, underwriting, claims, investment management and actuarial functions. In addition, significant portions of the general account investment portfolios are managed by our Asset Management segment, primarily through international subsidiaries. Operations generally invest in local currency denominated securities, primarily bonds issued by the local government or its agencies. In our larger operations, we have more diversified portfolios that also include U.S. dollar-denominated investments, in large part to support products issued in U.S. dollars and as part of our foreign exchange hedging strategy. Our Gibraltar Life operations also have Australian dollar-denominated investments that support products issued in that currency. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

The life insurance markets in Japan and Korea are mature and pricing is competitive. Rather than competing primarily based on price, we generally compete on the basis of customer service, including our needs-based approach to selling, the quality and diversity of our distribution capabilities, and our financial strength. Demographic trends in Asia suggest that our target market is increasing as the percentage of the population between the ages of 20 and 65 increases over the next few decades. This creates an increasing opportunity for product innovation, introducing insurance products that allow for savings and income as a growing portion of the population prepares for retirement. Further, as many Asian insurers focus on entering other markets, we have the opportunity to continue to build our presence in the Asian markets we currently serve. The ability to sell through multiple and complementary distribution channels is also a competitive advantage; however, competition for sales personnel, as well as access to third-party distribution channels, is intense. 

&#160; 

Products 

&#160; 

Our international insurance operations have a diversified product mix, primarily denominated in local currencies and emphasizing death protection while supporting the growing demand for retirement and savings products. We classify our products into four general categories: life insurance protection, retirement, annuity and accident &#38; health, which represented 59%, 18%, 16% and 7%, respectively, of full year 2015 annualized new business premiums on a constant exchange rate basis. Each product category is described below: 

&#160; 

Life Insurance Protection Products . We offer various traditional whole life products that provide either level or increasing coverage, and offer limited or lifetime premium payment options. We also offer increasing, decreasing and level benefit term insurance products that provide coverage for a specified time period, as well as protection-oriented variable universal life products. Some of these protection products are denominated in U.S. dollars and some are sold as bundled products which, in addition to death protection, include health benefits or savings elements. 

&#160; 

Retirement Products. We offer a variety of retirement products, including endowments, savings-oriented variable universal life and retirement income. Endowments provide payment of the face amount on the earlier of death or policy maturity. Variable universal life products provide a non-guaranteed return linked to an underlying investment portfolio of equity and fixed income funds selected by the customer. Retirement income products combine insurance protection similar to term life with a lifetime income stream which commences at a predefined age. 

Annuity Products. Annuity products are primarily represented by U.S. and Australian dollar-denominated fixed annuities sold by our Gibraltar Life operations. Sales and surrenders of non-yen products are sensitive to foreign currency relationships which are impacted by, among other things, the comparative interest rates in the respective countries. Most of our annuity products impose a market value adjustment if the contract is not held to maturity. 

Accident and Health Products. In most of our operations, we offer accident and health products with fixed benefits. These products provide benefits to cover accidental death and dismemberment, hospitalization, surgeries, and cancer and other dread diseases, most of which are sold as supplementary riders and not as stand-alone products. We also offer waiver of premium coverage where required premiums are waived in the event the customer suffers a qualifying disability. 

&#160; 

Marketing and Distribution 

&#160; 

Our International Insurance segment distributes its products through multiple distribution channels, including two captive agent models, Life Planners and Life Consultants, as well as bank and independent agency third-party distribution channels. For additional information on headcount for our captive agents, see &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Results of Operations by Segment&#8212;International Insurance Division.&#8221; 

&#160; 

Life Planners. Our Life Planner model differentiates us from competitors in the countries where we do business by focusing on selling protection-oriented life insurance products on a needs basis to mass affluent and affluent customers, as well as retirement-oriented products to small businesses. We believe that our recruiting and selection process, training programs and compensation packages are key to the Life Planner model and have helped our Life Planner operations achieve higher rates of agent retention, agent productivity and policy persistency than our local competitors. The attributes considered when recruiting new Life Planners generally include but are not limited to: university or college degree, no prior life insurance sales experience, a minimum of two years of sales or sales management experience, and a pattern of job stability and success. The number of Life Planners as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, was 7,592 and 7,352, respectively. 

&#160; 

Life Consultants. Our Life Consultants are the proprietary distribution force for products offered by our Gibraltar Life operations. Their focus is to provide individual protection products to the broad middle income market, primarily in Japan, particularly through relationships with affinity groups. Our Life Consultant operation is based on a variable compensation plan designed to improve productivity and persistency that is similar to compensation plans in our Life Planner operations. The number of Life Consultants in Japan as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, was 8,805 and 8,707, respectively. 

&#160; 

Bank Distribution Channel. Bank distribution channel sales primarily consist of life insurance products intended to provide savings features, premature death protection and estate planning benefits as well as fixed annuity products primarily denominated in U.S. and Australian dollars. We view the bank distribution channel as an adjunct to our core Life Planner and Life Consultant distribution channels and will continue to pursue this channel with a focus on profitable growth. 

&#160; 

A significant portion of our sales in Japan through our bank channel distribution are derived through a single Japanese mega-bank; however, we have relationships with each of Japan&#8217;s four largest banks as well as many regional banks, and we continue to explore opportunities to expand our distribution capabilities through this channel, as appropriate. 

&#160; 

Independent Agency Distribution Channel. Our independent agency channel sells protection products and high cash value products for retirement benefits through the business market and sells a variety of other products including protection, medical and fixed annuity products through the individual market. Our focus is to maintain a diverse mix of independent agency relationships including accounting firms, corporate agencies and other independent agencies with a balanced focus on individual and business markets. We differentiate ourselves by providing quality service to producers in this distribution channel. 

&#160; 

Underwriting and Pricing 

&#160; 

Our International Insurance segment is subject to substantial local regulation that is generally more restrictive for product offerings, pricing and structure than U.S. insurance regulation. Each International Insurance operation has its own underwriting department that employs variations of U.S. practices in underwriting individual policy risks. To the extent permitted by local regulation, we base premiums and policy charges for our products on expected death and morbidity benefits, surrender benefits, expenses, required reserves, interest rates, policy persistency and premium payment patterns. In setting underwriting limits, we also consider local industry standards to prevent adverse selection and to stay abreast of industry trends. In addition, we set underwriting limits together with each operation&#8217;s reinsurers. 

&#160; 

Pricing of similar products among our various countries is designed to achieve a generally consistent targeted rate of return by product, with the competitive environment also being a contributing factor. The profitability of our products is impacted both positively and negatively by differences between actual mortality, morbidity, expense, and investment experience and the related assumptions used in pricing these policies. As a result, the profitability of our products can fluctuate from period to period. Interest rates guaranteed at issue under our insurance contracts may exceed the rates of return we earn on our investments and, as a result, we may experience negative spreads between the rate we guarantee and the rate we currently earn on investments. Additionally, profitability may also be affected by seasonal factors, such as common retirement dates for members of specific customer groups in the second quarter of each year, or the timing of new product introductions, sales campaigns, premium rate changes and changes in tax laws may also affect profitability. 

Reserves 

&#160; 

We establish reserves for our international insurance products in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We primarily use best estimate assumptions with provisions for adverse deviation as of inception when establishing reserves for future policyholder benefits and expenses including assumptions for investment yield, persistency, expenses, mortality and morbidity rates. Future policy benefit reserves also include amounts related to our deferred profit liability, claims reported but not yet paid, and claims incurred but not yet reported. For variable and interest-sensitive life products, as well as most annuity products, we establish liabilities for policyholders&#8217; account balances that represent cumulative deposits plus credited interest, less withdrawals, and expense and cost of insurance charges, as applicable. Policyholders&#8217; account balances also include unearned revenue reserves calculated based on current best estimate assumptions and provisions for non-life contingent payout annuity benefits. 

&#160; 

Reinsurance 

&#160; 

International Insurance reinsures portions of its insurance risks, primarily mortality, with both selected third-party reinsurers and Prudential Insurance. We remain liable if a third-party reinsurer is for some reason unable to meet its obligations. On a Company-wide basis, we evaluate the financial condition of reinsurers and monitor the concentration of credit risk to mitigate this exposure. 

&#160; 

Corporate and Other 

&#160; 

Corporate and Other includes corporate items and initiatives that are not allocated to our business segments, and divested businesses, other than those that qualify for &#8220;discontinued operations&#8221; accounting treatment under U.S. GAAP. As described in &#8220;Demutualization and Elimination of the Separation of the Businesses&#8221; above, effective January 2, 2015, results of the Closed Block, along with certain related assets and liabilities, are reported as the Closed Block division and are accounted for as a divested business that is reported separately from the divested businesses included in Corporate and Other. 

&#160; 

Corporate Operations 

&#160; 

Corporate Operations consist primarily of: (1) capital that is not deployed in any business segments; (2) investments not allocated to business segments, including debt-financed investment portfolios, as well as tax credit investments and other tax-enhanced investments financed by business segments; (3) capital debt that is used or will be used to meet the capital requirements of the Company and the related interest expense; (4) our qualified pension and other employee benefit plans, after allocations to business segments; (5) corporate-level activities, after allocations to business segments, including corporate governance, corporate advertising, philanthropic activities, deferred compensation, and costs related to certain contingencies and enhanced regulatory supervision; (6) certain retained obligations relating to pre-demutualization policyholders; (7) a life insurance joint venture and an asset management joint venture in China; (8) our Capital Protection Framework; (9) the foreign currency income hedging program used to hedge certain non-U.S. dollar denominated earnings in our International Insurance segment; and (10) transactions with and between other segments. 

&#160; 

Corporate Operations include certain results related to our Capital Protection Framework (&#8220;the Framework&#8221;), which we employ as part of our capital management strategy. The framework considers potential capital consequences under a range of market related stresses and the strategies we use to mitigate them. For additional information on our Capital Protection Framework, see &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Liquidity and Capital Resources&#8212;Capital&#8212;Capital Protection Framework.&#8221; 

&#160; 

Divested Businesses 

&#160; 

Divested Businesses reflect the results of the following businesses that have been, or will be, sold or exited, including businesses that have been placed in wind down status that do not qualify for &#8220;discontinued operations&#8221; accounting treatment under U.S. GAAP. We exclude these results from our adjusted operating income. See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for an explanation of adjusted operating income. 

&#160; 

Long-Term Care. In 2012, we discontinued sales of our individual and group long-term care insurance products. We establish reserves for these products in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We use best estimate assumptions with provisions for adverse deviation as of inception or best estimate assumptions as of the most recent loss recognition event when establishing reserves for future policyholder benefits and expenses, including assumptions for morbidity, mortality, persistency, expenses and interest rates. Our assumptions have also factored in our estimate of the timing and amount of anticipated premium increases which will require state approval. Reserves also include claims reported but not yet paid and claims incurred but not yet reported. 

&#160; 

Residential Real Estate Brokerage Franchise and Relocation Services. In 2011, we sold our real estate brokerage franchise and relocation services businesses to Brookfield Asset Management, Inc., but retained ownership of a financing subsidiary with debt and equity investments in a limited number of real estate brokerage franchises, which we have substantially exited. 

&#160; 

Individual Health and Disability Insurance. We ceased writing individual disability income policies in 1992, and a year later ceased writing hospital expense and major medical policies. Most of our individual disability income policies are non-cancelable; however, we reinsured all of these policies as of July 1999. For our hospital expense and major medical policies, the 1996 Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act guarantees renewal beyond age 65. Under certain circumstances, with appropriate approvals from state regulatory authorities, we are permitted to change the premiums charged for these policies if we can demonstrate the premiums have not been sufficient to pay claims. We establish reserves in accordance with U.S. GAAP for future policyholder benefits and expenses. 

&#160; 

Other. In addition to the businesses described above, the results of Divested Businesses also include the following: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

On July 1, 2013, we sold our wealth management solutions business to Envestnet, Inc. We will continue to have an ongoing relationship with these operations until the contractual terms of the sale are fulfilled. 

&#8226; 

In 2008, we announced our intention to exit our financial advisory business, which consisted of our investment in a retail securities brokerage and clearing operations joint venture which was sold on December 31, 2009. Certain expenses relating to the businesses we originally contributed to the joint venture were retained, primarily for litigation and regulatory matters. 

&#8226; 

In 2003, we sold our property and casualty insurance companies to Liberty Mutual Group (&#8220;Liberty Mutual&#8221;). We have reinsured Liberty Mutual for adverse loss development for specific property and casualty risks that they did not want to retain. We believe that we have adequately reserved for our remaining property and casualty obligations under these reinsurance contracts based on the current information available. 

&#8226; 

We have not actively engaged in the assumed life reinsurance market in the United States since the early 1990s; however, we remain subject to mortality risk for certain assumed individual life insurance policies under the terms of the reinsurance treaties. We establish reserves in accordance with U.S. GAAP for future policyholder benefits and expenses. 

&#160; 

Discontinued Operations 

&#160; 

Discontinued Operations reflect the results of businesses and of any direct real estate investments that qualified for &#8220;discontinued operations&#8221; accounting treatment under U.S. GAAP. 

&#160; 

Closed Block Division 

&#160; 

In connection with the demutualization in 2001, we ceased offering domestic participating individual life insurance and annuity products, under which policyholders are eligible to receive policyholder dividends reflecting experience. The liabilities for our individual in force participating products were segregated, together with assets to be used exclusively for the payment of benefits and policyholder dividends, expenses and taxes with respect to these products, in the Closed Block. We selected the amount of assets that were expected to generate sufficient cash flow, together with anticipated revenues from the Closed Block policies, over the life of the Closed Block to fund payments of all expenses, taxes, and policyholder benefits and to provide for the continuation of the policyholder dividend scales in effect in 2000, assuming experience underlying such scales continued. We also segregated additional assets that we needed to hold outside the Closed Block to meet capital requirements related to the policies included within the Closed Block at the time of demutualization. No policies sold after demutualization have been added to the Closed Block, and its in force business is expected to decline as we pay policyholder benefits in full. 

The results of the Closed Block, along with certain related assets and liabilities, comprise the Closed Block division, which is treated as a divested business under our definition of adjusted operating income and reported separately from other divested businesses. Prior to the repurchase of the Class B Stock and the resulting elimination of the distinction between the Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business, the Closed Block formed the principal component of the Closed Block Business. 

&#160; 

As discussed in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, if the performance of the Closed Block is more or less favorable than we originally assumed in funding, total dividends paid to Closed Block policyholders in the future may be greater or less than the total dividends that would have been paid to these policyholders if the policyholder dividend scales in effect in 2000 had been continued. Any cash flows in excess of amounts assumed may be available for distribution over time to Closed Block policyholders as part of policyholder dividends unless offset by future Closed Block experience that is less favorable than expected. These cash flows will not be available to shareholders. A policyholder dividend obligation liability is established for any excess cash flows. Each year, the Board of Directors of Prudential Insurance determines the dividends payable on participating policies for the following year based on the experience of the Closed Block, including investment income, net realized and unrealized investment gains, mortality experience and other factors. See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for revenues, income and loss, and total assets of the Closed Block division. 

&#160; 

Our strategy is to maintain the Closed Block as required by our Plan of Reorganization over the time period of its gradual diminishment as policyholder benefits are paid in full. We are permitted under the Plan of Reorganization, with the prior consent of the New Jersey Commissioner of Banking and Insurance, to enter into agreements to transfer to a third-party all or any part of the risks under the Closed Block policies. 

&#160; 

Effective January 1, 2015, we entered into a reinsurance agreement with a wholly-owned subsidiary of Prudential Insurance, Prudential Legacy Insurance Company of New Jersey (&#8220;PLIC&#8221;), pursuant to which Prudential Insurance reinsured substantially all of the outstanding liabilities of the Closed Block into a statutory guaranteed separate account of PLIC, primarily on a coinsurance basis. Under the reinsurance agreement with PLIC, approximately $57 billion of Closed Block assets were transferred to PLIC. Consistent with the participating nature of the Closed Block policies and contracts, experience of the Closed Block is ultimately passed along to policyholders over time through adjustments of the annual policyholder dividend scale. Prior to entering into the reinsurance agreement with PLIC, Prudential Insurance reinsured a substantial portion of the Closed Block liabilities to third-party and affiliated reinsurers. The results of these reinsurance arrangements were reported through December 31, 2014 within Corporate and Other operations. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion on the accounting for these reinsurance arrangements. 

&#160; 

Intangible and Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

We capture and protect the innovation in our financial services products by applying for federal business method patents and implementing trade secret controls, as appropriate. We also use numerous federal, state, common law and foreign servicemarks, including in particular &#8220;Prudential&#8221;, &#8220;Prudential Financial&#8221;, the &#8220;Prudential logo&#8221; and our &#8220;Rock&#8221; symbol. We believe that the value associated with many of our patents and trade secrets, and the goodwill associated with many of our servicemarks are significant competitive assets. 

&#160; 

On April 20, 2004, we entered into an agreement with Prudential plc of the United Kingdom, with whom we have no affiliation, concerning the parties&#8217; respective rights worldwide to use the names &#8220;Prudential&#8221; and &#8220;Pru.&#8221; The agreement restricts use of the &#8220;Prudential&#8221; and &#8220;Pru&#8221; name and mark in a number of countries outside the Americas, including Europe and most parts of Asia. Where these limitations apply, we combine our &#8220;Rock&#8221; symbol with alternative word marks. We believe that these limitations do not materially affect our ability to operate or expand internationally. 

&#160; 

Regulation 

&#160; 

Overview 

&#160; 

Our businesses are subject to comprehensive regulation and supervision. The purpose of these regulations is primarily to protect our customers and the overall financial system and not necessarily our shareholders or debt holders. Many of the laws and regulations to which we are subject are regularly re-examined, and existing or future laws and regulations may become more restrictive or otherwise adversely affect our operations or profitability. Financial market dislocations have produced, and are expected to continue to produce, extensive changes in existing laws and regulations, and regulatory frameworks, applicable to our businesses in the U.S. and internationally, including the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (&#8220;Dodd-Frank&#8221;) discussed below. 

&#160; 

Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act 

&#160; 

Dodd-Frank subjects us to substantial federal regulation, primarily as a non-bank financial company (a &#8220;Designated Financial Company&#8221;) designated for supervision by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (&#8220;FRB&#8221;) as discussed below. We cannot predict the timing or requirements of the regulations not yet adopted under Dodd-Frank or how such regulations will impact our business, credit or financial strength ratings, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition or competitive position. Furthermore we cannot predict whether such regulations will make it advisable or require us to hold or raise additional capital or liquid assets, potentially affecting capital deployment activities, including buying back shares or paying dividends. 

&#160; 

Regulation as a Designated Financial Company 

&#160; 

Dodd-Frank established a Financial Stability Oversight Council (&#8220;Council&#8221;) which is authorized to subject non-bank financial companies such as Prudential Financial to stricter prudential standards and to supervision by the FRB if the Council determines that either material financial distress at the Company, or the nature, scope, size, scale, concentration, interconnectedness, or mix of the Company&#8217;s activities could pose a threat to domestic financial stability. Prudential Financial has been a Designated Financial Company since September 2013 under the first criterion. 

As a Designated Financial Company, Prudential Financial is now subject to supervision and examination by the FRB and to stricter prudential standards. These standards include or will include requirements and limitations (many of which are the subject of ongoing rule-making as described below) relating to capital, leverage, liquidity, stress-testing, overall risk management, resolution and recovery plans, credit exposure reporting, early remediation, management interlocks and credit concentration. They may also include requirements regarding enhanced public disclosure, short-term debt limits, and other related subjects as may be deemed appropriate by the FRB acting on its own or pursuant to a recommendation of the Council. Thus far the FRB has focused its general supervisory authority over us in several areas, including oversight of a capital planning and capital analysis and review process, model governance and validation, operational risk management, resolution planning and information and technology security. 

Enhanced Prudential Standards 

Dodd-Frank requires the FRB to establish for Designated Financial Companies and certain large bank holding companies stricter requirements and limitations relating to capital, leverage and liquidity. The FRB has not adopted rules applicable to insurance holding company Designated Financial Companies, but in February 2014 it adopted enhanced prudential standards applicable to large bank holding companies and in July 2015 it adopted rules applicable to the one non-insurance Designated Financial Company. 

Dodd-Frank authorizes the FRB to tailor its application of enhanced prudential standards to different companies on an individual basis or by category, and the FRB has indicated that it intends to assess the business model, capital structure and risk profile of Designated Financial Companies to determine how enhanced prudential standards should apply to them, and, if appropriate, to tailor the application of these standards for Designated Financial Companies by order or regulation. In addition, in 2014 an amendment to Dodd-Frank clarified that, in establishing minimum leverage and capital requirements and minimum risk-based capital requirements on a consolidated basis for Designated Financial Companies, the FRB is permitted to exclude certain insurance activities from such requirements, although we cannot predict whether or how the FRB will use this authority. 

Stress Tests 

As a Designated Financial Company, we will be subject to stress tests to be promulgated by the FRB to determine whether, on a consolidated basis, we have the capital necessary to absorb losses as a result of adverse economic conditions. Dodd-Frank requires us to submit to annual stress tests conducted by the FRB and to conduct internal annual and semi-annual stress tests to be provided to the FRB. Under FRB rules, Designated Financial Companies must comply with these requirements the calendar year after the year in which a company first becomes subject to the FRB&#8217;s minimum regulatory capital requirements discussed above, although the FRB has the discretion to accelerate or extend the effective date. The FRB has indicated that it may tailor the application of the stress test requirements to Designated Financial Companies on an individual basis or by category. Summary results of such stress tests would be required to be publicly disclosed. 

Early Remediation 

The FRB is required under Dodd-Frank to prescribe regulations for the establishment of an &#8220;early remediation&#8221; regime for the financial distress of Designated Financial Companies, whereby failure to meet defined measures of financial condition (including regulatory capital, liquidity measures, and other forward-looking indicators) would result in remedial action by the FRB that increases in stringency as the financial condition of the Designated Financial Company declines. Depending on the degree of financial distress, such remedial action could result in capital-raising requirements, limits on transactions with affiliates, management changes and asset sales. 

Resolution and Recovery Planning 

We are required as a Designated Financial Company to submit to the FRB and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (&#8220;FDIC&#8221;), and periodically update in the event of material events, an annual plan for rapid and orderly resolution in the event of severe financial distress. We submitted our first resolution plan in June 2014, and were advised by the FRB and FDIC in September 2014 that the plan was &#8220;not incomplete,&#8221; the standard for evaluation of an initial plan. In July 2015, the FRB and the FDIC provided feedback to the Company, as well as to the other two Designated Financial Companies which filed initial plans in 2014, on our respective resolution plans. The FRB and FDIC also provided guidance on common areas that should be addressed in preparing the subsequent resolution plan. We submitted our second resolution plan in December 2015, which is subject to review for credibility, in addition to completeness. In 2016 we are also required to submit to the FRB a recovery plan that describes the steps that the Company could take to reduce risk and conserve or restore liquidity and capital in the event of severe financial stress scenarios. 

If the FRB and the FDIC were to jointly determine that our 2015 resolution plan, or any future resolution plan, is not credible or would not facilitate an orderly resolution of the Company under applicable law, and the Company is unable to remedy the identified deficiencies in a timely manner, the regulators may jointly impose more stringent capital, leverage or liquidity requirements on the Company or restrictions on growth, activities or operations. Any requirements or restrictions imposed by the FRB and FDIC would cease to apply on the date that the FRB and FDIC jointly determine that the Company has submitted a revised resolution plan that adequately remedies the deficiencies. 

The FRB and the FDIC, in consultation with the Council, may also jointly order the Company to divest assets or operations identified by the FRB and FDIC in circumstances where: 

&#8226; 

the FRB and the FDIC jointly decide that the Company or a subsidiary of the Company shall be subject to the requirements or restrictions described above, 

&#8226; 

the Company has failed to submit a resolution plan that adequately addresses the deficiencies identified by the FRB and FDIC for the two year period following the imposition of such requirements or restrictions, and 

&#8226; 

the FRB and FDIC jointly determine that the divestiture of such assets or operations is necessary to facilitate an orderly resolution of the Company in the event that the Company was to fail. 

In addition, in order to develop a resolution plan that the FRB and FDIC determine is credible or would facilitate the orderly resolution of the Company under applicable law, it may be necessary for the Company to take actions to restructure intercompany and external activities or other actions, which could result in increased funding or operational costs. 

Other Dodd-Frank Regulation 

&#8226; 

Dodd-Frank requires the FRB to promulgate regulations that would prohibit Designated Financial Companies from having a credit exposure to any unaffiliated company in excess of 25% of the Designated Financial Company&#8217;s capital stock and surplus. 

&#8226; 

As a Designated Financial Company, we must seek pre-approval from the FRB for the acquisition of specified interests in certain companies engaged in financial activities. 

&#8226; 

The Council may recommend that state insurance regulators or other regulators apply new or heightened standards and safeguards for activities or practices we and other insurers or other financial services companies engage in. 

&#8226; 

As a Designated Financial Company, we could be subject to additional capital requirements for, and other restrictions on, proprietary trading and sponsorship of, and investment in, hedge, private equity and other covered funds. 

&#160; 

Derivatives Regulation 

Dodd-Frank created a new framework for regulation of the over-the-counter (&#8220;OTC&#8221;) derivatives markets which has impacted various activities of Prudential Global Funding LLC (&#8220;PGF&#8221;), Prudential Financial and our insurance subsidiaries, which use derivatives for various purposes (including hedging interest rate, foreign currency and equity market exposures). This new framework sets out requirements regarding the clearing and reporting of derivatives transactions, as well as collateral posting requirements for uncleared swaps. Swaps entered into between PGF, Prudential Financial and our insurance subsidiaries are generally exempt from most of these requirements. In late 2015, final rules regarding the posting of collateral in connection with uncleared swaps were adopted, which we do not believe will have a significant impact on our current variation margin posting practices, but will require us, in the future, to post initial margin on uncleared swaps with external counterparties. 

Regulation of the derivatives markets continues to evolve, and we cannot predict the full effect of regulations yet to be adopted or fully implemented both in the U.S. and abroad. In particular, we continue to monitor increased capital requirements for derivatives transactions that may be imposed on banks that are our counterparties. These regulations may impact our hedging costs, our hedging strategy or implementation thereof or cause us to increase or change the composition of the risks we do not hedge. In addition, under Dodd-Frank the SEC and Commodity Futures Trading Commission are required to determine whether and how &#8220;stable value contracts&#8221; should be treated as swaps under the applicable regulations and whether various other products offered by our insurance subsidiaries should be treated as swaps. If regulated as swaps, we cannot predict how the rules would be applied to such products or the effect on their profitability or attractiveness to our clients. 

Federal Insurance Office 

Dodd-Frank established a Federal Insurance Office (&#8220;FIO&#8221;) within the Department of the Treasury headed by a director appointed by the Secretary of the Treasury. While the FIO does not have general supervisory or regulatory authority over the business of insurance, the FIO director performs various functions with respect to insurance, including serving as a non-voting member of the Council and coordinating with the FRB in the application of any stress tests required to be conducted with respect to an insurer. 

&#160; 

Securities Laws 

Dodd-Frank included various securities law reforms relevant to our business practices. In January 2011, the SEC staff issued a study that recommended that the SEC adopt a uniform federal fiduciary standard of conduct for registered broker-dealers and investment advisers that provide retail investors personalized investment advice about securities which the SEC continues to consider. 

&#160; 

International and Global Regulatory Initiatives 

&#160; 

In addition to the adoption of Dodd-Frank in the United States, lawmakers around the world are actively exploring steps to avoid future financial crises. In many respects, this work is being led by the Financial Stability Board (&#8220;FSB&#8221;), consisting of representatives of national financial authorities of the G20 nations. The G20, the FSB and related bodies have developed proposals to address such issues as financial group supervision, capital and solvency standards, systemic economic risk, corporate governance including executive compensation, and a host of related issues. &#160; 

We have been identified by the FSB as a global systemically important insurer (&#8220;G-SII&#8221;) since July, 2013. U.S. financial regulators are thereby expected to enhance their regulation of Prudential Financial to achieve a number of regulatory objectives, including enhanced group-wide supervision, enhanced capital standards, enhanced liquidity planning and management, and development of a risk reduction plan and recovery and resolution plans. 

The International Association of Insurance Supervisors (&#8220;IAIS&#8221;), acting at the direction of the FSB, has released two group-wide capital standards applicable to G-SIIs. The basic capital requirement (&#8220;BCR&#8221;), which was approved by the FSB and G20 in November 2014, is a globally consistent and comparable baseline capital metric. The higher loss absorbency (&#8220;HLA&#8221;) standard, which was approved by the FSB and G20 in November 2015, establishes a capital buffer to be held in addition to the BCR. As a standard setting body, the IAIS does not have direct authority to require G-SIIs to comply with the BCR and HLA standards; however, if they are adopted by group supervisory authorities in the U.S., Prudential Financial could become subject to these standards. Voluntary confidential reporting of BCR and HLA results to supervisors through IAIS field testing will begin in 2016 and will serve as a component of the IAIS process to refine the standards. Prudential Financial&#8217;s capital level is expected to be above the initial calibration for both standards. The IAIS anticipates its process to develop global group-wide capital standards will lead to changes to the HLA design and calibration prior to the proposed implementation in 2019. We will continue to evaluate the potential impact the standards and any revisions could have on the Company. 

The IAIS is also developing the Common Framework (&#8220;ComFrame&#8221;) for the supervision of Internationally Active Insurance Groups. Through ComFrame, the IAIS seeks to promote effective and globally consistent supervision of the insurance industry and contribute to global financial stability through uniform standards for insurer corporate governance, enterprise risk management and other control functions, group-wide supervision and group capital adequacy. ComFrame is targeted at firms that meet the IAIS&#8217; Internationally Active Insurance Group criteria, such as Prudential, and is scheduled to be adopted by the IAIS in 2019. At this time, we cannot predict what additional capital requirements, compliance costs or other burdens ComFrame would impose on us, if adopted by U.S. group supervisory authorities. 

&#160; 

The lawmakers and regulatory authorities in a number of jurisdictions in which we do business have already begun enacting or considering legislative and regulatory changes consistent with G20 and FSB recommendations, including new regulations and proposals governing consolidated regulation of insurance holding companies set forth by the Financial Services Agency (&#8220;FSA&#8221;) in Japan, as described below under &#8220;Regulation of our International Businesses.&#8221; In addition, the prudential regulation of insurance and reinsurance companies across the European Economic Area (&#8220;EEA&#8221;) is due for significant change under the Solvency II Directive which came into force in January 2016 and applies to our insurance subsidiaries based in the EEA. This new regime effects a full revision of the insurance industry&#8217;s solvency framework and prudential regime (in particular minimum capital and solvency requirements, governance requirements, risk management and public reporting standards) and imposes, among other things, group level supervision mechanisms. 

&#160; 

The foregoing requirements and developments could impact the manner in which we deploy our capital, structure and manage our businesses, and otherwise operate both within the U.S. and abroad. The possibility of inconsistent and conflicting regulation of the Prudential Financial &#8220;group&#8221; of companies also exists as law makers and regulators in multiple jurisdictions simultaneously pursue these initiatives. 

&#160; 

Other U.S. Federal Regulation 

&#160; 

U.S. Tax Legislation 

&#160; 

The American Taxypayer&#8217;s Relief Act (the &#8220;Act&#8221;) was signed into law in January 2013. The Act permanently extended the reduced Bush era individual tax rates for certain taxpayers and permanently increased those rates for higher income taxpayers. Higher tax rates increase the benefits of tax deferral on the build-up of value of annuities and life insurance. The Act also made permanent the current $5 million (indexed for inflation) per person estate tax exemption and increased the top estate tax rate from 35% to 40%. 

In December 2015, Congress enacted legislation renewing the Active Financing Exception retroactive for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2015 and making the provision a permanent part of the U.S. tax code. This provision allows for deferral of U.S. tax on certain earnings of our foreign insurance companies until distributed to the U.S. This provision is expected to lower the Company&#8217;s future U.S. tax liability on undistributed foreign earnings and increase after tax results. 

There continues to be uncertainty regarding U.S. taxes, both for individuals and corporations. Discussions in Washington continue concerning the need to reform the tax code, primarily by lowering tax rates and broadening the base, including by reducing or eliminating certain tax expenditures. Broadening the tax base or reducing or eliminating certain expenditures could make our products less attractive to customers. It is unclear whether or when Congress may take up overall tax reform and what would be the impact of reform on the Company and its products. However, even in the absence of overall tax reform, given the large federal deficit, Congress could raise revenue by enacting legislation to increase the taxes paid by individuals and corporations. This can be accomplished by either raising rates or otherwise changing the tax rules that affect the Company and its products. 

&#160; 

Current U.S. federal income tax laws generally permit certain holders to defer taxation on the build-up of value of annuities and life insurance products until payments are actually made to the policyholder or other beneficiary and to exclude from taxation the death benefit paid under a life insurance contract. Congress from time to time considers legislation that could make our products less attractive to consumers, including legislation that would reduce or eliminate the benefit of this deferral on some annuities and insurance products. 

&#160; 

Additionally, legislative or regulatory changes could also impact the amount of taxes that we pay, thereby affecting our consolidated net income. For example, the U.S. Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service intend to address through guidance the methodology to be followed in determining the dividends received deduction (&#8220;DRD&#8221;) related to variable life insurance and annuity contracts. The DRD reduces the amount of dividend income subject to U.S. tax and is a major reason for the difference between our actual tax expense and expected tax amount determined using the federal statutory tax rate of 35%. For the last several years, the revenue proposals included in the Obama Administration&#8217;s budgets (the &#8220;Administration&#8217;s Revenue Proposals&#8221;) included a proposal that would change the method used to determine the amount of the DRD. A change in the DRD, including the possible retroactive or prospective elimination of this deduction through guidance or legislation, could increase actual tax expense and reduce the Company&#8217;s consolidated net income. 

&#160; 

Furthermore, the Administration&#8217;s Fiscal Year 2017 Revenue Proposals also include items that would change the way U.S. multinationals are taxed, as well as a liability-based fee on financial services companies, including insurance companies, with consolidated assets in excess of $50 billion. If these types of provisions are enacted into law, they could increase the amount of taxes the Company pays. 

&#160; 

For additional discussion of possible tax legislative and regulatory risks that could affect our business, see &#8220;Risk Factors.&#8221; 

&#160; 

ERISA 

&#160; 

The Employee Retirement Income Security Act (&#8220;ERISA&#8221;) is a comprehensive federal statute that applies to U.S. employee benefit plans sponsored by private employers and labor unions. Plans subject to ERISA include pension and profit sharing plans and welfare plans, including health, life and disability plans. ERISA provisions include reporting and disclosure rules, standards of conduct that apply to plan fiduciaries and prohibitions on transactions known as &#8220;prohibited transactions,&#8221; such as conflict-of-interest transactions and certain transactions between a benefit plan and a party in interest. ERISA also provides for civil and criminal penalties and enforcement. Our insurance, asset management and retirement businesses provide services to employee benefit plans subject to ERISA, including services where we may act as an ERISA fiduciary. In addition to ERISA regulation of businesses providing products and services to ERISA plans, we become subject to ERISA&#8217;s prohibited transaction rules for transactions with those plans, which may affect our ability to enter transactions, or the terms on which transactions may be entered, with those plans, even in businesses unrelated to those giving rise to party in interest status. 

&#160; 

DOL Fiduciary Rule 

In April 2015, the U.S. Department of Labor (&#8220;DOL&#8221;) released a proposed regulation accompanied by new class exemptions and proposed amendments to long-standing exemptions from the prohibited transaction provisions under ERISA. The initial comment period for the proposed rules ended on July 21, 2015. After hearings in August 2015, the DOL re-opened the comment period until September 24, 2015. It is expected that the DOL will promulgate final rules in 2016. If enacted, the rules will redefine who would be considered a &#8220;fiduciary&#8221; for purposes of transactions with qualified plans, plan participants and Individual Retirement Accounts. We cannot predict the exact nature and scope of any new final rules or their impact on our business; however, the new rules may effectively impose limits on interactions with existing and prospective customers in our Individual Annuities, Retirement, Asset Management, Individual Life and Group Insurance businesses, and increase compliance costs. For a discussion of the potential impacts of the proposed rule on our businesses, see &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Regulatory and Legal Risks&#8212;Changes in the legislation and regulation of retirement products and services, including proposed regulations released by the DOL in 2015, could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.&#8221; 

&#160; 

USA Patriot Act 

&#160; 

The USA Patriot Act of 2001 contains anti-money laundering and financial transparency laws applicable to broker-dealers and other financial services companies, including insurance companies. The Patriot Act seeks to promote cooperation among financial institutions, regulators and law enforcement entities in identifying parties that may be involved in terrorism or money laundering. Anti-money laundering laws outside of the U.S. contain provisions that may be different, conflicting or more rigorous. The increased obligations of financial institutions to identify their customers, watch for and report suspicious transactions, respond to requests for information by regulatory authorities and law enforcement agencies, and share information with other financial institutions require the implementation and maintenance of internal practices, procedures and controls. 

&#160; 

Insurance Holding Company Regulation 

&#160; 

We are subject to the insurance holding company laws in the states where our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled, which currently include New Jersey, Arizona, Connecticut and Indiana, or are treated as commercially domiciled, such as New York. These laws generally require each insurance company directly or indirectly owned by the holding company to register with the insurance department in the insurance company&#8217;s state of domicile and to furnish annually financial and other information about the operations of companies within the holding company system. Generally, all transactions affecting the insurers in the holding company system must be fair and reasonable and, if material, require prior notice and approval or non-disapproval by the state&#8217;s insurance department. 

&#160; 

Most states, including the states in which our U.S. insurance companies are domiciled, have insurance laws that require regulatory approval of a direct or indirect change of control of an insurer or an insurer&#8217;s holding company. Laws such as these that apply to us prevent any person from acquiring control of Prudential Financial or of our insurance subsidiaries unless that person has filed a statement with specified information with the insurance regulators and has obtained their prior approval. Under most states&#8217; statutes, acquiring 10% or more of the voting stock of an insurance company or its parent company is presumptively considered a change of control, although such presumption may be rebutted. Accordingly, any person who acquires 10% or more of the voting securities of Prudential Financial without the prior approval of the insurance regulators of the states in which our U.S. insurance companies are domiciled will be in violation of these states&#8217; laws and may be subject to injunctive action requiring the disposition or seizure of those securities by the relevant insurance regulator or prohibiting the voting of those securities and to other actions determined by the relevant insurance regulator. In addition, many state insurance laws require prior notification to state insurance departments of a change in control of a non-domiciliary insurance company doing business in that state. 

Several of our domestic and foreign regulators, including the FRB, participate in an annual supervisory college. The purpose of the supervisory college is to promote ongoing supervisory coordination, facilitate the sharing of information among regulators and to enhance each regulator&#8217;s understanding of the Company&#8217;s risk profile. The 2015 college was held in October. 

&#160; 

Group Wide Supervision 

In 2014, New Jersey adopted legislation that authorizes group-wide supervision of internationally active insurance groups, and in 2015 the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance (&#8220;NJDOBI&#8221;) notified Prudential Financial that the law authorizes NJDOBI to act as the group-wide supervisor of Prudential Financial. The law, among other provisions, authorizes NJDOBI to examine Prudential Financial and its subsidiaries, in addition to its New Jersey domiciled insurance subsidiaries, for the purpose of ascertaining the financial condition of the insurance companies and compliance with New Jersey insurance laws. As group-wide supervisor, the NJDOBI has begun additional reviews of the Company&#8217;s operations. We cannot predict what additional requirements or costs may result from NJDOBI&#8217;s assertion of group-wide supervisor status with respect to Prudential Financial. 

Currently, there are several proposals to amend state insurance holding company laws to increase the scope of regulation of insurance holding companies (such as Prudential Financial). The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (&#8220;NAIC&#8221;) has promulgated model laws for adoption in the United States that would provide for &#8220;group-wide&#8221; supervision of certain insurance holding companies in addition to the current regulation of insurance subsidiaries. While the timing of their adoption and content will vary by jurisdiction, we have identified the following areas of focus in these model laws: (1) uniform standards for insurer corporate governance; (2) group-wide supervision of insurance holding companies; (3) adjustments to risk-based capital calculations to account for group-wide risks; and (4) additional regulatory and disclosure requirements for insurance holding companies. At this time, we cannot predict with any degree of certainty what additional capital requirements, compliance costs or other burdens these requirements will impose on Prudential Financial. 

&#160; 

Insurance Operations 

&#160; 

State insurance laws regulate all aspects of our U.S. insurance businesses, and state insurance departments in the fifty states, the District of Columbia and various U.S. territories and possessions monitor our insurance operations. Prudential Insurance is domiciled in New Jersey and its principal insurance regulatory authority is the NJDOBI. Our other U.S. insurance companies are principally regulated by the insurance departments of the states in which they are domiciled. Generally, our insurance products must be approved by the insurance regulators in the state in which they are sold. Our insurance products are substantially affected by federal and state tax laws. 

&#160; 

State Insurance Regulation 

&#160; 

State insurance authorities have broad administrative powers with respect to all aspects of the insurance business including: licensing to transact business; licensing agents; admittance of assets to statutory surplus; regulating premium rates for certain insurance products; approving policy forms; regulating unfair trade and claims practices; establishing reserve requirements and solvency standards; fixing maximum interest rates on life insurance policy loans and minimum accumulation or surrender values; regulating the type, amounts and valuations of investments permitted; regulating reinsurance transactions, including the role of captive reinsurers; and other matters. 

&#160; 

State insurance laws and regulations require our U.S. insurance companies to file financial statements with state insurance departments everywhere they do business in accordance with accounting practices and procedures prescribed or permitted by these departments. The operations of our U.S. insurance companies and accounts are subject to examination by those departments at any time. 

&#160; 

State insurance departments conduct periodic examinations of the books and records, financial reporting, policy filings and market conduct of insurance companies domiciled in their states, generally once every three to five years. Examinations are generally carried out in cooperation with the insurance departments of other states under guidelines promulgated by the NAIC. During 2013, the New Jersey insurance regulator, along with the insurance regulators of Arizona, Connecticut, Indiana and Iowa, completed a coordinated risk-focused financial examination for the five year period ended December 31, 2011, for all of our U.S. domestic insurance companies as part of the normal five year examination and found no material deficiencies. 

&#160; 

Financial Regulation 

&#160; 

Dividend Payment Limitations. The New Jersey insurance law and the insurance laws of the other states in which our insurance companies are domiciled regulate the amount of dividends that may be paid by Prudential Insurance and our other U.S. insurance companies. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 

&#160; 

Risk-Based Capital. In order to enhance the regulation of insurers&#8217; solvency, the NAIC adopted a model law to implement risk-based capital requirements for life, health and property and casualty insurance companies. All states have adopted the NAIC&#8217;s model law or a substantially similar law. The risk-based capital (&#8220;RBC&#8221;) calculation, which regulators use to assess the sufficiency of an insurer&#8217;s statutory capital, measures the risk characteristics of a company&#8217;s assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items. In general, RBC is calculated by applying factors to various asset, premium, claim, expense and reserve items. Within a given risk category, these factors are higher for those items with greater underlying risk and lower for items with lower underlying risk. Insurers that have less statutory capital than the RBC calculation requires are considered to have inadequate capital and are subject to varying degrees of regulatory action depending upon the level of capital inadequacy. 

&#160; 

Insurance Reserves and Regulatory Capital. State insurance laws require us to analyze the adequacy of our reserves annually. The respective appointed actuaries for each of our life insurance companies must each submit an opinion that our reserves, when considered in light of the assets we hold with respect to those reserves, make adequate provision for our contractual obligations and related expenses. 

As a result of a February 2014 agreement with the New York State Department of Financial Services (&#8220;NY DFS&#8221;) regarding our reserving methodologies for certain variable annuity and life insurance products, certain of our New York licensed insurance subsidiaries hold additional statutory reserves on a New York basis, which reduces their New York statutory surplus. None of our U.S. operating insurance companies are domiciled in New York, and these changes do not impact statutory reserves reported in our insurance subsidiaries&#8217; states of domicile, or any states other than New York, and therefore do not impact RBC ratios; however, the agreed reserve methodologies may require us to hold additional New York statutory reserves in the future. If we were required to establish material additional reserves on a New York statutory accounting basis or post material amounts of additional collateral with respect to annuity or insurance products, our ability to deploy capital held within our U.S. domestic insurance subsidiaries for other purposes could be affected. In the fourth quarter of 2015, Prudential Annuities Life Assurance Corporation (&#8220;PALAC&#8221;) surrendered its New York license and reinsured its New York business to an affiliate. The license surrender relieves PALAC of the requirement to hold additional New York statutory reserves mandated by the agreement. 

The NAIC has developed a principles-based reserving approach for life insurance products, which is designed to better address reserving for products for which the current formulaic basis for reserves may not accurately reflect the risks or costs of the liability or obligations to the insurer. The principles-based approach will become effective after the NAIC&#8217;s Standard Valuation Law is enacted by a minimum number of states representing a minimum premium volume, and may become effective as soon as January 1, 2017, with a three year phase-in period and would apply only to new business. The timing and the effect of these changes are still uncertain, and the Company is reviewing the application of the law to its reserves. 

Captive Reinsurance Companies. In December 2014, the NAIC adopted a new actuarial guideline, known as &#8220;AG 48,&#8221; that implements many of the recommendations set forth in the June 2014 report by Rector &#38; Associates, Inc. (&#8220;Rector Report&#8221;) concerning certain transactions involving captive reinsurance companies. Specifically, AG 48 prescribes an actuarial method to determine the portion of the assets held to support reserves for certain term and universal life policies that must be &#8220;primary securities&#8221;, which are defined as cash and securities rated by the Securities Valuation Office of the NAIC (subject to some limited exceptions) or, in limited cases, certain other assets. AG 48 provides that reserves in excess of those calculated with the prescribed actuarial method may be supported or financed with a broader range of assets, referred to as &#8220;other securities&#8221;. &#32; The requirements in AG 48 became effective on January 1, 2015 and apply for reporting periods ending December 31, 2015 in respect of certain term and universal life insurance policies written from and after January 1, 2015, or written prior to January 1, 2015, but not included in a captive reinsurer financing arrangement as of December 31, 2014. The NAIC and state regulators also continue to consider additional changes based on the Rector Report. 

We have used captive reinsurance subsidiaries to finance a portion of the statutory reserves for term and universal life policies that we consider to be non-economic. See &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Liquidity and Capital Resources&#8212;Capital&#8212;Financing Activities&#8212;Term and Universal Life Reserve Financing&#8221; for a discussion of the impact of AG 48 on our life product reserves and reserve financing. 

In addition to the changes recommended by the Rector Report, the NAIC continues to consider other changes that would regulate more strictly captive reinsurance companies that assume business directly written in more than one state and apply accreditation standards to those captives that historically were applicable only to traditional insurers. 

The NAIC and state and federal regulators also continue to study the use of captive reinsurance companies for variable annuities. In November 2015 the NAIC adopted the Variable Annuities Framework for Change, which outlines the NAIC&#8217;s commitment to change in concept the statutory framework to address concerns that have led to the development and utilization of captive reinsurance transactions for variable annuity business in order to create more consistency across regulators and remove the impetus for insurers to cede risk to captives. The framework contemplates extensive changes to the guidance and rules governing variable annuities, including with regard to reserving, capital, accounting, derivative use limitations and disclosure. We have agreed to participate in a quantitative impact study assessing the efficacy and potential impact of the recommended reforms. Given the uncertainty of the ultimate outcome of these initiatives, at this time we are unable to estimate their expected effects on our future capital and financial position and results of operations. In December 2015, we announced our intention to recapture our variable annuity living benefit riders from our captive reinsurer in 2016 and to manage the risks of these riders in our statutory entities. We have obtained approvals from insurance regulators for key aspects of our recapture plan. While we are initiating the recapture in advance of definitive guidance from the NAIC's Variable Annuities Framework for Change, we expect our plan to be reasonably aligned with the key concept changes planned under the framework. For information on our reinsurance of variable annuity risks to our captive, see &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Liquidity and Capital Resources&#8212;Capital&#8212;Captive Reinsurance Companies.&#8221; 

Own Risk and Solvency Assessment. New Jersey has enacted the NAIC's and Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (&#8220;ORSA&#8221;) model act which requires larger insurers to assess the adequacy of its and its group&#8217;s risk management and current and future solvency position. We began filing annual ORSA reports with NJDOBI in 2015. 

&#160; 

Market Conduct Regulation 

&#160; 

State insurance laws and regulations include numerous provisions governing the marketplace activities of insurers, including provisions governing the form and content of disclosure to consumers, illustrations, advertising, sales practices and complaint handling. State regulatory authorities generally enforce these provisions through periodic market conduct examinations. 

&#160; 

Insurance Guaranty Association Assessments 

&#160; 

Each state has insurance guaranty association laws under which insurers doing business in the state are members and may be assessed by state insurance guaranty associations for certain obligations of insolvent insurance companies to policyholders and claimants. Typically, states assess each member insurer in an amount related to the member insurer&#8217;s proportionate share of the business written by all member insurers in the state. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we paid approximately $0.6 million, $28.8 million and $66.1 million, respectively, in assessments pursuant to state insurance guaranty association laws. Many states offer a reimbursement of such assessments in the form of credits against future years&#8217; premium taxes. The 2013 assessments reflected the Executive Life of New York (&#8220;ELNY&#8221;) and the Executive Life Insurance Company insolvencies. In addition, in 2011, we agreed to make a voluntary contribution of $20 million to an insurance industry solvency fund, related to ELNY, which was subsequently paid in 2013. The 2014 assessments also included payments related to the ELNY insolvency, which substantially concluded our assessments related to this matter. While we cannot predict the amount and timing of future assessments on our U.S. insurance companies under these laws, we have established estimated reserves for future assessments relating to insurance companies that are currently subject to insolvency proceedings. 

&#160; 

Federal and State Securities Regulation Affecting Insurance Operations 

&#160; 

Our variable life insurance, variable annuity and mutual fund products generally are &#8220;securities&#8221; within the meaning of federal securities laws and may be required to be registered under the federal securities laws and subject to regulation by the SEC and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (&#8220;FINRA&#8221;). Certain of our insurance subsidiaries are subject to SEC public reporting and disclosure requirements based on offerings of these products. Federal and some state securities regulation similar to that discussed below under &#8220;&#8212;Investment Products and Asset Management Operations&#8221; and &#8220;&#8212;Securities and Commodities Regulation&#8221; affect investment advice, sales and related activities with respect to these products. 

&#160; 

Our mutual funds, and in certain states our variable life insurance and variable annuity products, are &#8220;securities&#8221; within the meaning of state securities laws. As securities, these products are subject to filing and certain other requirements. Also, sales activities with respect to these products generally are subject to state securities regulation. Such regulation may affect investment advice, sales and related activities for these products . 

&#160; 

Investment and Retirement Products and Asset Management Operations 

&#160; 

Our investment products and services are subject to federal and state securities, fiduciary, including ERISA, and other laws and regulations. The SEC, FINRA, CFTC, state securities commissions, state banking and insurance departments and the United States Department of Labor are the principal U.S. regulators that regulate our asset management operations. In some cases our domestic U.S. investment operations are also subject to non-U.S. securities laws and regulations. 

&#160; 

Some of the separate account, mutual fund and other pooled investment products offered by our businesses, in addition to being registered under the Securities Act, are registered as investment companies under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, and the shares of certain of these entities are qualified for sale in some states and the District of Columbia. Separate account investment products are also subject to state insurance regulation as described above. We also have several subsidiaries that are registered as broker-dealers under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;), as amended, and are subject to federal and state regulation. In addition, we have subsidiaries that are investment advisers registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended. Our third-party advisors and licensed sales professionals within Prudential Advisors and other employees, insofar as they sell products that are securities, are subject to the Exchange Act and to examination requirements and regulation by the SEC, FINRA and state securities commissioners. Regulation and examination requirements also extend to various Prudential entities that employ or control those individuals. The federal securities laws could also require re-approval by customers of our investment advisory contracts to manage mutual funds, including mutual funds included in annuity products, upon a change in control. 

&#160; 

Congress from time to time considers pension reform legislation that could decrease or increase the attractiveness of certain of our retirement products and services to retirement plan sponsors and administrators, or have an unfavorable or favorable effect on our ability to earn revenues from these products and services. Over time, these changes could hinder our sales of defined benefit pension products and services and cause sponsors to discontinue existing plans for which we provide asset management, administrative, or other services, but could increase the attractiveness of certain products we offer in connection with pension plans. 

&#160; 

Securities and Commodities Regulation 

&#160; 

We have subsidiaries that are broker-dealers, investment advisers, commodity pool operators or commodity trading advisers. The SEC, the CFTC, state securities authorities, FINRA, the National Futures Association (&#8220;NFA&#8221;), the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, and similar authorities are the principal regulators of these subsidiaries. 

&#160; 

Our broker-dealer and commodities affiliates are members of, and are subject to regulation by, &#8220;self-regulatory organizations,&#8221; including FINRA and the NFA. Self-regulatory organizations conduct examinations of, and have adopted rules governing, their members. In addition, state securities and certain other regulators have regulatory and oversight authority over our registered broker-dealers. Broker-dealers and their sales forces in the U.S. and in certain other jurisdictions are subject to regulations that cover many aspects of the securities business, including sales methods and trading practices. The regulations cover the suitability of investments for individual customers, use and safekeeping of customers&#8217; funds and securities, capital adequacy, recordkeeping, financial reporting and the conduct of directors, officers and employees. The SEC, CFTC and other governmental agencies and self-regulatory organizations, as well as state securities commissions in the U.S. and non-U.S. regulatory agencies, have the power to conduct administrative proceedings that can result in censure, fine, the issuance of cease-and-desist orders or suspension, termination or limitation of the activities of a broker-dealer, an investment adviser or commodities firm or its employees. Our U.S. registered broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to federal net capital requirements that may limit the ability of these subsidiaries to pay dividends to Prudential Financial. 

&#160; 

Privacy Regulation and Cybersecurity 

&#160; 

We are subject to federal and state laws and regulations that require financial institutions and other businesses to protect the security and confidentiality of personal information, including health-related and customer information, and to notify their customers and other individuals of their policies and practices relating to the collection and disclosure of health-related and customer information. Federal or state laws or regulations also: 

&#8226; provide additional protections regarding the use and disclosure of certain information such as social security numbers; 

&#8226; 

require notice to affected individuals, regulators and others if there is a breach of the security of certain personal information; 

&#8226; 

require financial institutions and creditors to implement effective programs to detect, prevent, and mitigate identity theft; 

&#8226; 

regulate the process by which financial institutions make telemarketing calls and send e-mail or fax messages to consumers and customers; and 

&#8226; 

prescribe the permissible uses of certain personal information, including customer information and consumer report information. 

&#160; 

Federal and state legislative and regulatory bodies may consider additional or more detailed or restrictive laws and regulations regarding these subjects and the privacy and security of personal information. 

We are also subject to privacy laws, regulations, and directives that require our business units in countries outside the U.S. to protect the security and confidentiality of employee and customer personal information. In addition, we must comply with international privacy laws, regulations, and directives concerning the cross border transfer or use of employee and customer personal information. 

Federal and state financial regulators continue to focus on cybersecurity and have communicated heightened expectations and have increased emphasis in this area in their examinations of regulated entities. The Company reviews and revises its privacy and information security policies, procedures and standards accordingly. See &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Risk Management&#8212;Risk Exposure and Monitoring&#8212;Operational Risk.&#8221; 

&#160; 

Environmental Considerations 

&#160; 

Federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations apply to our ownership and operation of real property. Inherent in owning and operating real property are the risks of hidden environmental liabilities and the costs of any required clean-up. Although unexpected environmental liabilities can always arise, we seek to minimize this risk by undertaking environmental assessments, among other measures prior to taking title to real estate. 

&#160; 

Unclaimed Property Laws 

&#160; 

We are subject to the laws and regulations of states and other jurisdictions concerning the identification, reporting and escheatment of unclaimed or abandoned funds, and we are subject to audit and examination for compliance with these requirements. For additional discussion of these matters, see Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

&#160; 

Regulation of our International Businesses 

&#160; 

Our international businesses are subject to comprehensive regulation and supervision. As in the U.S., the purpose of these regulations is primarily to protect our customers and not our shareholders or debt holders. These regulations may apply heightened scrutiny to non-domestic companies, which can reduce our flexibility as to intercompany transactions, investments and other aspects of business operations and adversely affect our liquidity and profitability. Many of the laws and regulations to which our international businesses are subject are regularly re-examined, in some instances resulting in comprehensive restatements of applicable laws, regulations and reorganization of supervising authorities. Existing or future laws or regulations may become more restrictive or otherwise adversely affect our operations as regulators seek to protect their financial systems from perceived systemic risk. In some instances, jurisdictions may also impose different, conflicting or more rigorous laws and requirements, including regulations governing privacy, consumer protection, employee protection, corporate governance and capital adequacy. Changes such as these can increase compliance costs and potential regulatory exposure. 

&#160; 

In addition, our international operations face political, legal, operational and other risks that we do not face in the U.S., including the risk of discriminatory regulation, labor issues in connection with workers&#8217; associations and trade unions, nationalization or expropriation of assets, price controls and currency exchange controls or other restrictions that limit our ability to transfer funds from these operations out of the countries in which they operate or to convert local currencies we hold into U.S. dollars or other currencies. Some jurisdictions in which we operate joint ventures restrict our maximum percentage of ownership, which exposes us to joint venture partner risks and limits our array of potential remedies. 

&#160; 

Our international insurance operations are principally supervised by regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions in which they operate, including the Japanese Ministry of Finance and the FSA, the financial services regulator in Japan. We operate insurance companies in Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, Italy and Poland and have insurance operations in India, China and Malaysia through joint ventures. The insurance regulatory bodies for these businesses typically oversee such issues as company licensing, the licensing of insurance sales staff, insurance product approvals, sales practices, claims payment practices, permissible investments, solvency and capital adequacy, and insurance reserves, among other items. In some jurisdictions, for certain products, regulators will also mandate premium rates (or components of pricing) or minimum guaranteed interest rates. Periodic examinations of insurance company books and records, financial reporting requirements, market conduct examinations and policy filing requirements are among the techniques used by these regulators to supervise our non-U.S. insurance businesses. 

&#160; 

In order to monitor insurers&#8217; solvency, regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate outside the U.S. generally establish some form of minimum solvency margin requirements for insurance companies, similar in concept to the RBC ratios that are employed by U.S. insurance regulators. These solvency margins are used by regulators to assess the sufficiency of an insurer&#8217;s capital and claims-paying ability and include the impact of transactions with affiliated entities. The solvency margin ratios (&#8220;SMR&#8221;) in certain jurisdictions are required to be disclosed to the public. Insurers that have less solvency margin than the regulators require are considered to have inadequate capital and are subject to varying degrees of regulatory action depending upon the level of capital inadequacy. 

&#160; 

In 2012, the FSA implemented revisions to the solvency margin requirements and developed a consolidated basis capital standard. These new standards require insurers to adopt changes in the manner in which an insurance company&#8217;s core capital is calculated and are meant to respond to changes in financial markets, improve risk management practices of insurers and consider risks associated with the insurer&#8217;s subsidiaries. We anticipate further changes in solvency regulation from jurisdiction to jurisdiction based on regulatory developments in the U.S., the EEA, and recommendations by the IAIS, as well as regulatory requirements for those companies deemed to be G-SIIs, as described above under &#8220;International and Global Regulatory Initiatives.&#8221; 

&#160; 

The insurance regulatory bodies in some of the countries where our international insurance businesses are located regulate the amount of dividends that they can pay to shareholders. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the ability of our international subsidiaries to pay dividends to Prudential Financial. 

&#160; 

Our non-insurance international operations are also supervised primarily by regulatory authorities in the countries in which they operate. We operate investment-related businesses in, among other jurisdictions, Japan, Taiwan, the United Kingdom, Hong Kong, Mexico, India, Germany and Singapore, and participate in investment-related joint ventures in Brazil, Italy and China. These businesses may provide investment-related products such as investment management products and services, mutual funds and separately managed accounts. The regulatory authorities for these businesses typically oversee such issues as company licensing, the licensing of investment product sales staff, sales practices, solvency and capital adequacy, mutual fund product approvals and related disclosures, and securities, commodities and related laws, among other items. In some cases, our international investment operations are also subject to U.S. securities laws and regulations. 

&#160; 

Our international businesses may also be subject to U.S. laws governing businesses controlled by U.S. companies such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, various anti-money laundering laws and regulations, and certain regulations issued by the U.S. Office of Foreign Asset Controls. In addition, under current U.S. law and regulations we may be prohibited from dealing with certain individuals or entities in certain circumstances and we may be required to monitor customer activities, which may affect our ability to attract and retain customers. Furthermore, certain of our businesses, particularly those with operations in the United Kingdom (&#8220;U.K.&#8221;), are also subject to the U.K.&#8217;s Anti-Bribery Law, which governs interactions with both governmental and private commercial entities. 

&#160; 

Certain of our international insurance operations, including those in Japan, may be subject to assessments, generally based on their proportionate share of business written in the relevant jurisdiction, for certain obligations of insolvent insurance companies to policyholders and claimants. As we cannot predict the timing of future assessments, they may materially affect the results of operations of our international insurance operations in particular quarterly or annual periods. Under the Japanese insurance guaranty law, all licensed life insurers in Japan are required to be members of and are assessed, on a pre-funded basis, by the Japan Policyholders Protection Corporation (&#8220;PPC&#8221;). These assessments generate a collective fund which is used to satisfy certain obligations of insolvent insurance companies to policyholders and claimants. The PPC assesses each member in an amount related to its proportionate share of new business written by all member insurers. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, we paid approximately $25 million, $26 million, and $27 million, respectively, based on fixed currency exchange rates, in assessments pursuant to Japanese insurance guaranty association laws. 

&#160; 

In 2014 and 2015, the FSA announced several amendments to its &#8220;Comprehensive Guidelines for Supervision of Insurance Business Operators&#8221; and &#8220;Inspection Manual for Insurance Companies&#8221; addressing enterprise risk management readiness and ORSA. During the same period, the FSA conducted several horizontal reviews of Japanese insurance companies in order to assess current risk management practices. The FSA has periodically released the results of these reviews and intends to continue to encourage insurers to develop risk management systems which are in line with the international insurance supervisory framework, including the Insurance Core Principles adopted by the IAIS. Additionally, insurance companies were required to prepare and submit an ORSA by September 30, 2015. The ORSA requirement is an annual requirement for each Japanese insurance company and its holding company, including Prudential Holdings of Japan, and we submitted an ORSA in accordance with this requirement in 2015. 

&#160; 

In addition to the FSA&#8217;s initiatives, in March 2014, amendments to the Japan Deposit Insurance Law became effective which expand the scope of the Deposit Insurance Corporation of Japan and provide for the development of a new comprehensive regime for the resolution of financial institutions, including life insurance companies. The amendments are in accordance with commitments made by the Government of Japan in connection with policies agreed to among the G20 financial ministers and recommendations of the FSB for the development of an effective orderly resolution framework for dealing with a financial crisis caused by severe market disruptions. 

In 2013, the FSA indicated its intention to develop a new comprehensive regime for the resolution of financial institutions, including life insurance companies. The enabling legislation for the establishment of the regime was enacted in 2013, and new regulations to effectuate these changes were released in 2015. The primary impact of the regulations has been the inclusion of insurance companies in the comprehensive resolution framework for dealing with a financial crisis, discussed above. 

&#160; 

Our international businesses are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the countries in which they are organized and in which they operate. Foreign governments from time to time consider legislation that could impact the amount of taxes that we pay or impact the sales of our products. 

&#160; 

On March 20, 2014, Japan repealed the Special Reconstruction Corporation Tax reducing the national corporate tax rate from 28.05% to 25.5% for tax years beginning on or after April, 1, 2014. The national corporate rate was further reduced to 23.9% for tax years beginning on or after April 1, 2015. There is a proposal to further reduce the national corporate rate to 23.4% for tax years beginning on or after April 1, 2016 and to 23.2% for tax years beginning on or after April 1, 2018. The Japanese consumption tax rate increased on April 1, 2014 from 5% to 8%. The consumption tax rate is scheduled to increase to 10% on April 1, 2017. Insurance commissions paid to our Life Planners and Life Consultants are subject to consumption tax for individuals exceeding certain earnings thresholds; however, the tax is not charged on employee compensation (other than commissions) or insurance premiums. The consumption tax increase has led to increased costs for insurers. 

&#160; 

Effective in January 2015, Japan amended its inheritance tax laws, which lowered the exemption amount and increased tax rates. The increase in this tax could make protection products more attractive to our customers as they look for ways to manage the increased inheritance tax burden. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, we had 49,384 employees and sales associates, including 28,810 located outside of the U.S. We believe our relations with our employees and sales associates are satisfactory. 

&#160;
