Our merchandise is developed for women of all sizes, age 40 and older with an income level from moderate to above average. 

&#160; 

We operate an integrated, omni-channel business platform that is designed to provide customers a seamless retail experience with the ability to shop when and where they want, including retail stores, outlet stores, online and mobile.

Unless otherwise noted, the use of the terms &#8220;the Company&#8221;, &#8220;we&#8221;, &#8220;us&#8221; and &#8220;our&#8221; in this Annual Report on Form 10-K refers to Christopher &#38; Banks Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries, Christopher &#38; Banks, Inc. and Christopher &#38; Banks Company. 

&#160; 

Our Brand 

&#160; 

Christopher &#38; Banks Corporation was incorporated in 1986 to acquire Braun&#8217;s Fashions, Inc., which had operated as a family-owned business since 1956. We became a publicly traded corporation in 1992 and, in July 2000, our stockholders approved a company name change from Braun&#8217;s Fashions Corporation to Christopher &#38; Banks Corporation. Christopher &#38; Banks caters to missy and petite sized customers. In 2000, we introduced our women&#8217;s plus sized collection under the name C.J. Banks. 

&#160; 

We offer merchandise assortments that reflect a balance of novelty and basic core pieces, at affordable prices. We emphasize comfort and easy care in classic and relevant fashion. To differentiate ourselves from our competitors, our buyers, working in conjunction with our product development teams, strive to create a merchandise assortment of coordinated outfits, the majority of which are manufactured exclusively for us under our proprietary Christopher &#38; Banks &#174; and C.J. Banks &#174; names. 

&#160; 

Our Channels 

&#160; 

Our Christopher and Banks (&#8220;CB&#8221;) stores offer merchandise assortments in women&#8217;s apparel and accessories for missy sizes 4 to 16 and petite sizes 4P to 16P. 

&#160; 

Our C.J. Banks (&#8220;CJ&#8221;) stores offer merchandise assortments in similar women&#8217;s apparel and accessories for women&#8217;s sizes 14W to 26W. 

&#160; 

Our Missy, Petite, Women (&#8220;MPW&#8221;) stores, outlet stores, and online or web store offer merchandise assortments from both Christopher and Banks and C.J. Banks in all three size ranges resulting in greater opportunity to service our customers and improve our store productivity. 

&#160; 

Our Vision 

&#160; 

Our vision is to be our customer&#8217;s trusted brand by delivering style and value every day. 

&#160; 

Our Mission 

&#160; 

Our mission is to provide her with the style and versatility that reflects who she is, the lasting quality and affordable value that she expects, and the personalized attention that she deserves. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Our Strategy 

&#160; 

We strive to provide our customer with experiences that make her look and feel her best. 

&#160; 

Our strategy includes three key initiatives: &#160; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Bring the &#8220;special&#8221; back to our specialty store 

&#183; 

Increase brand awareness and drive engagement 

&#183; 

Leverage our omni-channel capabilities 

&#160; 

Bring the &#8220;Special&#8221; Back to Our Specialty Store 

&#160; 

We are committed to ensuring we consistently meet our customers&#8217; needs with differentiated styles that fit her lifestyle. We intend to increase the breadth of our fashion offering and ensure frequent newness to encourage repeat visits and increased spend. We also will continue our focus on expanding on our new categories to augment her wardrobe needs. We will continue to localize our store assortments, tailoring our offerings by market type and customer size. 

&#160; 

Our focus remains on cultivating and delivering a true &#8220;specialty&#8221; shopping experience through exceptional customer service and inspirational merchandising presentations. We have a highly loyal customer base largely attributable to our shopping environment and our engaged, knowledgeable store associates. Our associates have long-term relationships with our customers and understand their preferences to assist them in selecting styles that makes them look and feel their best. We believe this genuine service focus is a competitive advantage and is key in our omni-channel approach. 

&#160; 

As we continue to convert to the MPW store format, we have re-merchandised our product placement and visual elements to assist customers of all sizes more easily find the product they seek. 

&#160; 

Increase Brand Awareness and Drive Engagement 

&#160; 

We have a very loyal customer base that is highly engaged. As such, we will continue to leverage our direct and digital marketing channels to encourage our customer to shop more frequently and increase her spend with us. During the fiscal year, we also will be focused on increasing our brand awareness to acquire new customers. We intend to invest incremental marketing spend to build the brand through refreshing our creative brand, look and feel, and by expanding our marketing mix during the latter part of the year. 

&#160; 

We continue to be focused on maximizing the benefits of our customer relationship management ("CRM") system database and Friendship Rewards Loyalty Program (&#8220;Friendship Rewards&#8221;) to strengthen our engagement with our customers. Friendship Rewards is a point-based program where members earn points based on purchases and other interactions with us. After reaching a certain level of accumulated points, members are rewarded with a certificate which may be applied towards purchases at our stores or on our web site. The program has helped us build our customer file in our database, allowing us to analyze purchasing behavior and to communicate more effectively with our customers. Early in fiscal 2016, we plan to launch a more personalized reward system that is differentiated by level of purchase activity and provides enhanced benefits as customers achieve the next reward level. 

&#160; 

Leverage Our Omni-Channel Capabilities 

&#160; 

During fiscal 2015, we made significant investments in support of developing our integrated, omni-channel strategy which is designed to provide customers a seamless retail experience together with the ability to shop when and where they want, including retail stores, outlet stores, online and mobile. Our omni-channel investments will enable us to address multiple customer touch points to drive spend and build our brand awareness. Our customers will be able to browse merchandise in one channel and consummate a transaction in a different channel. At the same time, our customers have the option to return merchandise to a store or to our third-party distribution center, regardless of the original channel used for purchase. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Our Merchandise 

&#160; 

Our merchandise assortments include mostly exclusive designs of women&#8217;s apparel, generally consisting of casual clothing, everyday basics, wear-to-work, leisure / active wear, and sleepwear in missy, petite and women sizes. The Company also offers a selection of jewelry and accessories, including footwear to complement our customer&#8217;s wardrobe. 

&#160; 

While each store offers a base merchandise assortment, store assortments vary to reflect individual store demands and local market preferences. We design our products and merchandise them in our stores and through our website in a coordinated manner intended to drive the number of units per transaction. On average, our customers purchase two to three items per transaction. 

&#160; 

Our Operations 

&#160; 

All of the Company operations are located in the United States. Merchandise selection, pricing and promotions, procurement and sourcing, marketing and advertising, and labor deployment across all channels are centrally managed at our corporate headquarters. In addition, functional support capabilities (e.g. human resources, finance, legal) are generally performed at our corporate location. We also have field operations that support our retail teams. Our retail stores have procedures for transaction processing, customer experience, merchandise display, inventory management, asset protection, and staff training. 

&#160; 

Our Stores 

&#160; 

As of January 30, 2016, we operated 518 stores in 45 states. The following table illustrates the change in store count and store format by fiscal year:

&#160; 

We believe that the investments we have made in our stores, particularly the MPW and Outlet formats, represent a significant asset that we can leverage in our strategies to improve performance. When our foundational investments in an omni-channel platform are completed this fiscal year, we will have the ability to provide our customer with the ability to review inventory availability and shop when, where and how she wants. 

&#160; 

We continue to be pleased with the overall performance of our MPW stores, which generate higher productivity per square foot, higher gross margin and higher operating margin than the predecessor CB &#160; or CJ store formats. We will continue the conversion of the majority of the remaining Christopher &#38; Banks and CJ Banks stores to the MPW format over the next two years. 

&#160; 

Our new store growth strategy will be focused primarily on outlets. These stores enable us to expand our customer reach to new geographies and heighten brand awareness. Our outlet stores contain a mixture of core merchandise, made-for-outlet merchandise and clearance merchandise. The made-for-outlet product carries a higher margin than the clearance items from our retail store base. We regularly review the appropriate ratio of made-for-outlet and clearance merchandise 

&#160;

for our outlets and adjust that ratio as appropriate. We see an ongoing growth opportunity in our outlet business and believe we can successfully operate approximately 100 outlet locations. 

&#160; 

Our Website 

&#160; 

Our website at www.christopherandbanks.com provides customers the ability to browse our offerings, locate our stores, and order merchandise online. Our website is designed to be an extension of our brand and is key to our developing omni-channel strategy. The online merchandise assortment consists of a combination of exclusive styles as well as special sizes and lengths. We offer online customers the option to return items in our stores. For fiscal 2016, we will continue to focus on our omni-channel opportunity with the launch of a new web platform with enhanced functionality to improve our customer&#8217;s experience. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

The women&#8217;s retail apparel business is highly competitive and includes regional, national and international department stores, specialty stores, boutique stores, catalog companies, and online retailers. Many of these competitors have greater name recognition and some of these competitors may have greater financial, marketing and other resources compared to us. We compete in the specialty retail space by offering unique, classic and versatile clothing that fits her everyday needs at a good value. We believe our visual merchandise presentation, attentive customer service and physical store locations supplement our compelling value proposition. 

&#160; 

Global Sourcing and Product Sourcing 

&#160; 

We utilize a broad base of manufacturers located throughout the world that we believe produce goods at the level of quality that our customers desire at a competitive price. For the most recently completed fiscal year, our ten largest suppliers accounted for approximately 70% of the merchandise we purchased, and we purchased 30% and 10% of our goods respectively from our two largest suppliers. 

&#160; 

We purchase our merchandise using purchase orders and, therefore, are not subject to long-term production contracts with any of our vendors, manufacturers, or buying agents. We intend to continue our efforts to maximize our purchasing power by consolidating the number of key suppliers with consideration for the potential risk of limiting our manufacturing flexibility. 

&#160; 

We may take ownership to product in the foreign country where the factory is located, at a designated point of entry into the United States, or at our distribution center depending on the specific terms of the sale. Most of our sourcing activities are performed by a single-shared sourcing and procurement function. We believe that this function, working in concert with our key supply chain partners, will deliver high quality apparel and accessories at a lower cost while providing the opportunity to minimize freight costs through consolidation. We believe that the decision to centralize our sourcing and procurement operations has helped us mitigate the impact of higher sourcing costs. 

&#160; 

Typical lead times for delivery of our merchandise are 90 to 150 days from the date of order placement, however we have the ability to expedite the sourcing of merchandise in those cases where we see an opportunity to garner incremental sales on those items that have resonated with our customer. In addition we will purchase domestically when demand warrants. 

&#160; 

We expect product costs, including the cost of cotton, to remain relatively constant in fiscal 2016. 

&#160; 

Merchandise Distribution 

&#160; 

We centrally distribute most of our products sold in our stores from our distribution center located in Plymouth, Minnesota. New merchandise is generally received each week day at our corporate distribution center. After arrival, merchandise is sorted and packaged for shipment to individual stores or is held for future store replenishment. Merchandise is generally pre-ticketed with price and related informational tags at the point of manufacture. 

&#160;

Merchandise is typically shipped to our stores via third-party delivery services multiple times per week, providing our stores with a steady flow of new inventory. 

&#160; 

Merchandise sold through our eCommerce channel is delivered directly to the customer through a third-party service provider. 

&#160; 

Information Technology 

&#160; 

Our information technology strategy is intended to provide a platform for an integrated, omni-channel retail experience. Our information systems are designed to enable us to obtain, analyze, and take action on information in a timely fashion. We are committed to leveraging technology to maintain effective financial and operational controls. 

&#160; 

We continue to make investments in capabilities that will allow us to better manage the flow of product. Existing and anticipated system enhancements are intended to allow our teams to analyze store-level data to tailor the merchandise assortment to the demographics of the surrounding community. We expect these insights will lead to improved merchandise assortments thereby generating higher unit velocity and improved average unit retail, which should translate into higher merchandise margins. 

&#160; 

We are committed to evolving change management and portfolio management processes and standards to improve the security of our data and our customers&#8217; information as well as to maintain effective financial and operational controls. We have established an information security infrastructure and methodology which can adapt to the evolving needs of the business in an effort to ensure the appropriate safeguarding of assets and secure and reliable customer transactions. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

As of January 30, 2016 , we employed approximately 4,355 &#160; associates, approximately 31% of whom were full-time employees and the balance of whom were part-time employees . The number of part-time employees &#160; fluctuates during peak selling periods . Approximately 22 0 of our associates are employed at our corporate office and distribution center facility, with the majority of the associate population employed in our store field organization. We have no collective bargaining agreements covering any of our employees, have never experienced a work stoppage and are unaware of any efforts or plans to organize our employees. We consider relations with our employees to be good. &#160; 

&#160; 

Trademarks and Service Marks 

&#160; 

We are the owner of certain registered and common law trademarks and service marks (collectively referred to as &#8220;Marks&#8221;). 

&#160; 

Our wholly owned subsidiary, Christopher &#38; Banks Company, is the owner of the federally registered Marks &#8220;christopher &#38; banks &#174;,&#8221; which is our predominant private brand, and &#8220;cj banks &#174;,&#8221; our private brand for women sizes 14W to 26W. 

&#160; 

In the opinion of management, our rights in the Marks are important to our business and are recognized in the women&#8217;s retail apparel industry . Accordingly, we intend to maintain our Marks and the related registrations and applications. U.S. trademark registrations are for a term of ten years and are renewable every ten years as long as the trademarks are used in the regular course of trade. We are not aware of any claims of infringement or other challenges to our rights to use any registered Marks in the United States. 

&#160; 

Seasonality &#160; 

&#160; 

Our quarterly results may fluctuate significantly depending on a number of factors, including general economic conditions, consumer confidence, customer response to our seasonal merchandise mix, timing of new store openings, adverse weather conditions, and shifts in the timing of certain holidays and promotional events. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Working Capital 

&#160; 

We fund our business operations through a combination of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and cash flows generated from operations. In addition, our revolving credit facilities are available for additional working capital needs, for general corporate purposes and investment opportunities. 

&#160; 

Effective inventory management is critical to our success. We employ various methods to manage inventory levels including demand forecasting, optimal allocations, and various forms of inventory replenishment. We seek to minimize markdowns through effective inventory management.
