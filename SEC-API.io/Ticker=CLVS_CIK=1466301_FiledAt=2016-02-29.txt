BUSINESS 

Overview 

We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on acquiring, developing and commercializing innovative anti-cancer agents in the United States, Europe and other international markets. We generally target our development programs for the treatment of specific subsets of cancer populations and seek to simultaneously develop, with partners, companion diagnostics that direct our product candidates to the patients that are most likely to benefit from their use. We are currently developing three product candidates: 

&#160;

&#9679; 

Rociletinib , an oral epidermal growth factor receptor (&#8220;EGFR&#8221;), mutant-selective covalent inhibitor that is currently under review with the U.S. and E.U. regulatory authorities for the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (&#8220;NSCLC&#8221;) in patients with activating EGFR mutations, as well as the dominant resistance mutation, T790M; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

Rucaparib , an oral inhibitor of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (&#8220;PARP&#8221;) that is currently in advanced clinical development for the treatment of ovarian cancer and for which the first U.S. regulatory application is expected to be submitted for approval during the second quarter of 2016 and the first E.U. regulatory application is expected to be submitted in the second half of 2016; and 

&#160;

&#9679; 

Lucitanib , an oral inhibitor of the tyrosine kinase activity of vascular endothelial growth factor receptors 1-3 (&#8220;VEGFR1-3&#8221;), platelet-derived growth factor receptors alpha and beta (&#8220;PDGFR &#97; /&#223;&#8221;) and fibroblast growth factor receptors 1-3 (&#8220;FGFR1-3&#8221;) that is currently in Phase II development for the treatment of breast cancer. 

We hold global development and commercialization rights for rociletinib and rucaparib. For lucitanib, we hold development and commercialization rights in the U.S. and Japan and have sublicensed rights to Europe and rest of world markets, excluding China, to Les Laboratoires Servier (&#8220;Servier&#8221;). 

We have built our organization to support innovative oncology drug development for the treatment of specific subsets of cancer populations. To implement our strategy, we have assembled an experienced team with core competencies in global clinical development and regulatory operations in oncology, as well as conducting collaborative relationships with companies specializing in companion diagnostic development. We have fully established our U.S. commercial and medical affairs organizations in preparation for potential approvals for our New Drug Applications (&#8220;NDAs&#8221;) for rociletinib, which was filed in July 2015, and for rucaparib, which we expect to file in the second quarter of 2016.

Rociletinib - an Oral EGFR Mutant-Selective Inhibitor 

Overview 

Rociletinib is a novel, oral, targeted covalent (irreversible) mutant-selective inhibitor of EGFR in development for the treatment of NSCLC, and is the subject of a global clinical development program. 

In May 2010, we in-licensed rociletinib from Avila Therapeutics, Inc. (now Celgene Avilomics Research Inc., part of Celgene Corporation). In May 2014, rociletinib received &#8220;Breakthrough Therapy&#8221; designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (&#8220;FDA&#8221;) for the treatment of patients with EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC, whose disease has progressed on prior EGFR-directed therapy due to T790M-mediated acquired drug resistance. 

In July 2015, we submitted an NDA to the FDA and a Marketing Authorization Application (&#8220;MAA&#8221;) to the European Medicines Agency (&#8220;EMA&#8221;) for rociletinib as treatment for patients with mutant EGFR NSCLC who have been previously treated with an EGFR-targeted therapy and have the EGFR T790M mutation. During a regularly scheduled Mid-Cycle Communication meeting in early November 2015, the FDA requested additional clinical data for use in the efficacy analysis for both the 500mg and 625mg BID dose patient groups for rociletinib. We submitted these data in a Major Amendment on November 16, 2015 after which the FDA extended the Prescription Drug User Fee Act goal date for the rociletinib NDA by three months to June 28, 2016 to allow additional time for review of the new information requested by the agency. The FDA has scheduled the NDA for rociletinib for discussion by the Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee (&#8220;ODAC&#8221;) on April 12, 2016. The ODAC reviews and evaluates data concerning the safety and effectiveness of marketed and investigational human drug products used in the treatment of cancer and makes recommendations to the FDA.

Market Overview - Resistance to EGFR Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors (&#8220;TKIs&#8221;) Represents an Unmet Medical Need 

Lung Cancer and EGFR TKIs. According to the American Cancer Society, in 2016, there will be an estimated 224,000 new cases of lung cancer in the United States, making it one of the most common types of cancer. In addition, according to GLOBOCAN, in 2012, there were an estimated 313,000 new cases of lung cancer in the European Union and an estimated 95,000 new cases in Japan. Lung cancer typically presents relatively late in its clinical course, when locally-directed therapy (surgery and radiation) is not curative. 

Lung cancer is typically divided into two groups based upon the histologic appearance of the tumor cells (small cell and non-small cell lung cancer), each of which is treated with distinct chemotherapeutic approaches. According to the American Cancer Society, NSCLC accounts for approximately 85% of lung cancer cases. The standard of care for treatment of advanced or metastatic NSCLC has historically been a cytotoxic chemotherapy doublet of platinum plus paclitaxel. In the last few years, in a subset of NSCLC patients, Avastin &#174; (bevacizumab) has been shown to prolong survival when added to the chemotherapy doublet, and Alimta &#174; (pemetrexed) has replaced paclitaxel on the basis of improved tolerability and ease of administration. Despite these additions, patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC have five-year survival rates of just 27% and 4%, respectively, according to the Survival Epidemiology and End Results program of the National Cancer Institute. 

Small molecule inhibitors of the tyrosine kinase activity of EGFR were introduced into the treatment of lung cancer just over 10 years ago. The growth-promoting EGFR was known to be frequently expressed on lung cancer cells, often at high levels, and non-clinical work had suggested that EGFR TKIs, such as gefitinib and erlotinib, could provide effective cancer therapy in certain patient subsets. Iressa &#174; (gefitinib) and Tarceva &#174; (erlotinib) were approved by the FDA in 2003 and 2004, respectively, for patients who had failed to respond to conventional chemotherapy. 

In 2004, it was discovered that the subset of NSCLC patients who experienced dramatic clinical responses to EGFR TKIs had activating mutations in the EGFR gene in their lung cancer tissue, typically either a point mutation in exon 21 (L858R) or a deletion mutation in exon 19 (del(19)). It became clear that the EGFR TKIs potently inhibited the mutant EGFR proteins, switching off their activity and causing dramatic tumor shrinkage in patients. This is an example of &#8220;oncogene addiction,&#8221; whereby a single gene mutation (EGFR in this case) is absolutely necessary for the proliferation and/or survival of a tumor cell. A corollary of this situation is that inhibition of that single gene product (in this case with TKIs) is therapeutic and drives tumor shrinkage. It was subsequently shown in a study conducted by Jeffrey A. Engelman, et al. published in Clinical Cancer Research in 2008 that EGFR mutations generate tumors with adenocarcinoma histology and are found in approximately 10% to 15% of Caucasian NSCLC patients and 30% to 35% of East Asian NSCLC patients. 

The original approvals of the TKIs made no reference to patient selection, but these more recent data suggest that the majority, if not all, of their therapeutic benefit can be attributed to the subset of patients with activating EGFR mutations. During 2013, the FDA approved Gilotrif &#174; (afatinib) and expanded the label for Tarceva &#174; (erlotinib) for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer whose tumors have activating EGFR mutations, as detected by FDA-approved tests. During 2015, the FDA also approved Iressa &#174; (gefitinib) for the same indication. 

Resistance to EGFR TKIs. Despite the success of TKIs in patients with mutant EGFR-related NSCLC, most patients&#8217; disease will progress, typically after approximately one year of therapy. Molecular studies, including a study conducted by Helena A. Yu, et al., published in Clinical Cancer Research in 2013, have shown that approximately 60% of the resistant tumors carry a second, acquired resistance mutation in the EGFR gene. This resistance mutation is a specific change in the type of amino acid located at position 790 in the EGFR protein, called a &#8220;T790M&#8221; mutation. As a consequence of this switch, the three-dimensional structure of the TKI binding site changes and the EGFR becomes resistant to TKI therapy. This T790M mutation is also called the &#8220;gatekeeper&#8221; mutation because of its strategically important position in the EGFR protein. Until recently, there were no approved therapies for patients whose disease progressed due to the emergence of the T790M mutation. Patients who developed TKI resistance received standard cytotoxic chemotherapy that carried toxicity and only modest palliative efficacy. In November 2015, the FDA approved Tagrisso TM (osimertinib) for the treatment of patients with metastatic EGFR T790M mutation-positive NSCLC as detected by an FDA-approved test, who have progressed on or after EGFR TKI therapy, representing the first approved therapy for the treatment of EGFR mutant NSCLC patients who test positive for the T790M mutation. In February 2016, the European Commission granted conditional marketing approval to Tagrisso&#8482; for the treatment of advanced NSCLC patients who test positive for the T790M mutation. 

Design of Rociletinib - a Target ed Covalent Drug 

Most human diseases are rooted in the abnormal activity of certain proteins. Traditional small molecule drugs, while able to inhibit disease-causing proteins, are generally only able to form transient binding interactions with the disease targets and are thus considered reversible. A covalent drug, however, forms a strong and durable bond with its protein target, known as a covalent bond. A targeted covalent drug is designed to form its covalent bond in a highly directed and controlled manner with a specific site on the disease target. This directed bond formation is key to achieving a distinct selectivity profile that is difficult to achieve with traditional reversible small molecules. Rociletinib was developed using a proprietary platform to purposefully and systematically design and develop targeted covalent inhibitors. 

Rociletinib was designed by identifying a site on the EGFR protein where a covalent bond could be formed and, using proprietary drug design techniques, modeling chemical structures that could selectively form a bond with this site. These molecules were then synthesized and tested in assays to verify their ability to form targeted covalent bonds and to potently inhibit the mutant forms of EGFR and also to demonstrate that covalent bonds were not formed indiscriminately with other targets. 

Clinical Development 

We are pursuing the development of rociletinib as both a second-line or later treatment for EGFR-mutated NSCLC patients who become resistant to TKIs due to the emergence of the T790M mutation, and potentially, as a first-line treatment for EGFR-mutated NSCLC when given in combination with other agents. We are also exploring rociletinib&#8217;s utility for progressing EGFR-mutated NSCLC patients who do not express the T790M mutation (T790M-negative patients).

In the first quarter of 2012, we initiated our first Phase I/II study of rociletinib in patients with metastatic or unresectable recurrent NSCLC and a documented EGFR mutation. Patients were not required to be T790M positive for the Phase I portion of the study but had to have progressed on prior EGFR-directed TKI therapy (prior chemotherapy was also allowed). The Phase I portion of the study was conducted in the U.S., France and Australia. Data from this study were used to determine the tolerability and pharmacokinetics of rociletinib, as well as provide initial evidence of efficacy. 

We recently completed enrollment of the Phase II expansion cohorts of that study, designated as TIGER-X under the TIGER ( T hird-generation I nhibitor of Mutant E G FR in Lung Canc ER ) program, conducted in the U.S., Europe and Australia. These cohorts are testing the safety and efficacy of rociletinib in patients with T790M-positive NSCLC, either immediately after progression on their first and only TKI therapy or after progression on their second or later TKI therapy of subsequent chemotherapy.

In addition to TIGER-X, three global studies are currently ongoing as part of the TIGER program: 

&#160;

&#9679; 

TIGER-1, a randomized Phase II study of rociletinib vs. erlotinib in EGFR mutation-positive patients who have not had TKI therapy, but who may have received one type of chemotherapy. Enrollment for this study was recently discontinued, as we intend to focus our evaluation of rociletinib as a first-line therapy only in combination with other agents.

&#160;

&#9679; 

TIGER-2, a single-arm study in second-line patients immediately after progression on their first and only TKI therapy, which includes both T790M-positive and T790M-negative cohorts. Enrollment in this study was recently completed.

&#160;

&#9679; 

TIGER-3, a randomized study of rociletinib vs. chemotherapy in later-line patients progressing on second or later TKI or subsequent chemotherapy, which includes both T790M-positive and T790M-negative cohorts. TIGER-3 continues to enroll patients and is intended to serve as the confirmatory study following accelerated approval of rociletinib, which is currently under review by the FDA. 

Data from the interim data cuts of the TIGER-X expansion cohorts, combined with an interim data cut of TIGER-2, serve as the basis of the NDA in the U.S. and the MAA in the E.U. filed in July 2015 for the initial approvals for rociletinib for the treatment of patients with mutant EGFR NSCLC who have been previously treated with an EGFR-targeted therapy and have the EGFR T790M mutation. The primary efficacy analysis for these submissions is based on pooled data from patients enrolled in the TIGER-X and TIGER-2 studies who were given rociletinib at doses of 500mg and 625mg BID, or twice daily. The data in the final MAA dataset will be based on a larger number of patients than in the NDA dataset. 

In the intent to treat analysis of the 79 patients in the 500mg BID dose group, the confirmed response rate by investigator was 28% and by independent review was 2 3 % , and the duration of response by both investigator and independent review was nine months. For the 170 patients in the 625mg BID dose group, the confirmed response rate by investigator was 34% and by independent review was 32 %, and the duration of response by investigator was seven months and by independent review was nine months . The only grade 3 or higher treatment emergent adverse reaction observed in greater than 15% of patients is hyperglycemia (2 7 % for the 500mg BID dose and 28 % for the 625mg BID dose , both based on lab values ), with QTc prolongation also notable , though with lower frequency of grade 3 or higher events. Based on this data set, we have requested that the FDA consider 625mg BID as the dose for rociletinib approval, althoug h this matter is still under review by the FDA . The data in the final MAA dataset, including a pre-agreed update that includes a larger number of patients, is planned to be submitted to the EMA in the second quarter of 2016. Based on our planned second quarter su bmission, we anticipate the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (&#8220;CHMP&#8221;) to issue an opinion on the rociletinib MAA by the end of 2016. 

We expect that should rociletinib be approved, the primary information on response rates and duration of response included in the prescribing information will be based on confirmed response rate by independent review. 

As noted above, we are also exploring rociletinib&#8217;s utility for progressing T790M-negative, EGFR-mutated NSCLC patients. In T790M-negative patients treated in the TIGER-X study at the 625mg BID dose, a confirmed response rate of 29% was achieved (N=24), with a median duration of response of approximately seven months. T790M-negative patient cohorts are being further evaluated in both the TIGER-2 and TIGER-3 studies.

These studies are ongoing, so data may change over time.

In January 2016, we announced our intention to explore rociletinib in Phase Ib/II combination studies with other agents in first- and later-line NSCLC patients who possess the EGFR mutation. These include combinations with immuno-oncology agents, anti-VEGF inhibitors (e.g. bevacizumab) and EGFR monoclonal antibodies (e.g. cetuximab). These studies will include both T790M-positive and T790M-negative patients. The first of these studies, a trial evaluating the combination of rociletinib with Genentech&#8217;s investigational cancer immunotherapy atezolizumab (MPDL3280A; anti-PDL-1) for the treatment of advanced EGFR-mutant NSCLC, was initiated in January 2016.

Concurrent with our drug development program, we are collaborating with QIAGEN for the development of a companion diagnostic to enable identification of the T790M mutation in patients with mutant EGFR driven NSCLC. The PCR-based diagnostic test will build on QIAGEN&#8217;s therascreen &#174; EGFR RGQ PCR Kit, which was approved by the FDA in July 2013 as a companion diagnostic used in the treatment of metastatic NSCLC patients whose tumors have certain EGFR mutations. Analytical performance of the therascreen EGFR test has been established for 21 EGFR mutations, including T790M. The diagnostic is being developed in parallel with the clinical development of rociletinib, and QIAGEN submitted a Premarket Approval Application (&#8220;PMA&#8221;) with the FDA during the third quarter of 2015, in a time frame intended to allow for regulatory approval of the companion diagnostic at substantially the same time that rociletinib may be approved. 

Rucaparib - a PARP Inhibitor 

Overview 

Rucaparib is a novel, oral, small molecule inhibitor of PARP-1 and PARP-2, which is currently being explored in Phase II and III clinical trials as both treatment and maintenance therapy for advanced ovarian cancer patients with tumor-BRCA mutations (germline and somatic mutations in genes that are linked to breast and ovarian cancers) and with other DNA repair deficiencies, commonly referred to as &#8220;BRCA-like&#8221; mutations. We in-licensed rucaparib from Pfizer Inc. in June 2011. In April 2015, rucaparib received &#8220;Breakthrough Therapy&#8221; designation from the FDA as monotherapy treatment of advanced ovarian cancer in patients who have received at least two lines of prior platinum-containing therapy, with BRCA-mutated tumors, inclusive of both germline BRCA (gBRCA) and somatic BRCA (sBRCA) mutations. 

We intend to submit our initial NDA for rucaparib to the FDA as treatment for advanced ovarian cancer patients with a germline or somatic BRCA mutation in the second quarter of 2016. We completed enrollment of the mutant BRCA population that will serve as the basis of the submission during the fourth quarter of 2015. In addition, a planned MAA filing in the E.U. for the same indication is expected by the end of 2016. We also intend to study rucaparib as a treatment for BRCA mutant prostate cancer patients and plan to initiate a registration study in this patient population in the second half of 2016.

DNA Repair and PARP 

Cells in the human body are under constant attack from agents that can cause damage to DNA, including sunlight and other forms of radiation, as well as DNA-binding chemicals that can cause changes in the composition of DNA. Since DNA is the vehicle by which fundamental information is passed on when a cell divides, it is critical to the integrity of cells and human health that DNA damage can be repaired. Cells have evolved multiple mechanisms to enable such DNA repair, and these mechanisms are complementary to each other, each driving repair of specific types of DNA damage. If a cell&#8217;s DNA damage repair system is overwhelmed, then the cell will undergo a form of suicide called apoptosis that appears to operate as a fail-safe system to limit the ability of a mutated cell to proliferate and potentially form a cancer. A fundamental principle of cancer therapy is to damage cells profoundly with radiation or DNA-binding drugs, such as alkylating agents or platinums, and induce apoptosis in those cells, thus killing the cancer cells. DNA repair mechanisms may reduce the activity of these anti-cancer therapies but, conversely, inhibition of DNA repair processes may enhance the effects of DNA-damaging anti-cancer therapy. 

Poly (ADP-ribose) is a part of the early warning system for DNA damage and is synthesized by PARP enzymes on regions of damaged DNA, where it signals to the cell that DNA repair needs to take place. In the absence of PARP, as is seen in gene-knockout mice, cells are unusually sensitive to DNA damage when exposed to radiation or DNA-alkylating agents. There are two major forms of PARP that signal DNA damage in this way, PARP-1 and PARP-2. Knockout of either PARP gene leads to enhanced DNA damage in both instances, although the mice may survive; however, the double knockout in which both the PARP-1 and PARP-2 genes are deleted is fatal to the mice at an embryonic stage. We believe that a drug that inhibits both PARP-1 and PARP-2, which rucaparib does, may have enhanced activity in preventing DNA repair. 

Synthetic Lethality 

An important advance in the field of cancer treatment occurred when it was recognized that germline mutations in the BRCA genes (BRCA1 and BRCA2, two tumor suppressor genes) were associated both with high rates of breast and ovarian cancer in female mutant gene carriers and also impaired the ability of cells to repair DNA damage. BRCA gene products were shown to be key mediators of DNA repair. The notion was that advanced treatment of BRCA-defective cells with PARP inhibitors could lead to a disabling blow against a tumor cell&#8217;s ability to repair DNA and could induce apoptosis. This phenomenon was termed &#8220;synthetic lethality&#8221; and was demonstrated in humans in a study conducted by Peter C. Fong, M.D. et al., published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2009, as evidenced by women with advanced breast and ovarian cancer and germline BRCA mutations experiencing objective tumor responses when treated with monotherapy PARP inhibitors. Germline and somatic BRCA mutations are a minority subset of all breast and ovarian cancers, representing approximately 20% to 25% of those cancers.

&#160;

BRCA-like Tumors

The hypothesis that some tumors might have defective DNA repair function for reasons other than germline (hereditary) or somatic (acquired) gene mutation has also been explored. This notion has been called &#8220;BRCAness&#8221; or &#8220;BRCA-like.&#8221; Subsequent work has shown that BRCA-like alterations exist, and that these cancer patients with normal BRCA genes, but BRCA-like mutations can respond to monotherapy with PARP inhibitors. Work is underway to identify a molecular signature for patients with tumors that are BRCA-like that could enable patient selection for therapy. If successful, this work has the potential to increase the percentage of high-grade serous ovarian cancer patients eligible for rucaparib therapy from the approximately 20% to 25% typically found to have germline or somatic BRCA mutations to an estimated 50%, which includes those patients whose tumors have certain DNA repair deficiencies, and thus may be considered a BRCA-like population.

Clinical Development 

Rucaparib is currently the subject of several clinical studies, including the ARIEL ( A ssessment of R ucaparib I n Ovarian Canc E r Tria L ) program, which includes the Phase II ARIEL2 treatment study and the Phase III ARIEL3 maintenance study, both in advanced ovarian cancer patients. 

ARIEL2 is a single-arm, registration study of rucaparib treatment in relapsed patients, designed to identify tumor characteristics that predict sensitivity to rucaparib using DNA sequencing to evaluate each patient&#8217;s tumor. Both archived tumor and recent biopsy samples are collected from patients and DNA sequenced. The patients&#8217; response to rucaparib is being assessed and those clinical responses are correlated to pre-defined molecularly defined patient sub-groups, including germline BRCA mutant, somatic BRCA mutant and the BRCA-like signature identified through the genetic diagnostic testing. The first part of the global ARIEL2 study completed enrollment of 206 ovarian cancer patients with relapsed, platinum-sensitive disease in 2014. In early 2015, ARIEL2 was expanded (ARIEL2 extension or ARIEL2 Part 2) to include an additional 300 patients with recurrent disease after at least three prior lines of chemotherapy. Enrollment in the ARIEL2 extension study is not limited to platinum-sensitive disease, but also includes patients with platinum-resistant or platinum-refractory disease.

ARIEL3 is a randomized, double-blind , registration study comparing the effects of rucaparib against placebo to evaluate whether rucaparib given as a maintenance therapy to platinum-sensitive patients can extend the per iod of time for which the disease is controlled after a positive outcome with platinum-based chemotherapy. Patients are randomized to receive either placebo or rucaparib and the primary endpoint of the study is progression-free survival (&#8220;PFS&#8221;). The primar y efficacy analysis will evaluate mutant BRCA patients, all HRD patients (i ncluding mutant BRCA and BRCA-like) and all patients. 

In addition to ARIEL2 and ARIEL3, the Phase II portion of rucaparib&#8217;s initial dose finding study (Study 010) continues to assess efficacy of rucaparib in advanced ovarian cancer patients with tumors harboring a germline or somatic BRCA mutation. 

Data from a blended population of patients from ARIEL2, the ARIEL2 extension and the Phase II portion of Study 010 are expected to form the basis of a planned NDA filing for the treatment of patients with tumor-BRCA-mutant advanced ovarian cancer, which includes both germline and somatic BRCA patients, expected to be submitted during the second quarter of 2016, as well as a planned MAA filing in the E.U. for the same indication, which is expected to be submitted by the end of 2016. During 2016, we currently plan to initiate the ARIEL4 study, a Phase III study of rucaparib versus chemotherapy as a treatment for patients with tumor-BRCA-mutant and, potentially, BRCA-like relapsed ovarian cancer. We expect that ARIEL4 will serve as the confirmatory study required by the FDA for the potential accelerated approval of rucaparib using data from ARIEL2 and Study 010.

Data from ongoing rucaparib studies presented at medical conferences during 2015 demonstrated meaningful clinical activity and safety in ovarian cancer patients with tumors with BRCA mutations, as well as in those with the BRCA-like signature. Data from 204 evaluable patients in the first part of the ongoing ARIEL2 study presented in September 2015 and updated in January 2016 demonstrated encouraging clinical activity and safety in two pre-specified subgroups of these patients. The most robust clinical activity was observed in platinum-sensitive patients with tumor BRCA mutations. Seventy-five percent (30/40) of BRCA-mutant patients achieved a confirmed response. The response rate was similar in both germline and somatic BRCA-mutant tumors. Six of these patients achieved a complete response by RECIST. The median duration of response was 9.5 months in this patient population, in which patients had received a median of two prior therapies. In addition, in platinum-sensitive patients with normal BRCA genes, rucaparib activity was different between those with the prospectively-defined BRCA-like signature versus biomarker negative (normal BRCA and no BRCA-like mutations) patients. Thirty percent (23/77) of patients with normal BRCA, but with the BRCA-like signature, achieved a confirmed response. In biomarker negative patients, few responses were observed. Ten percent (7/68) achieved a confirmed response. Median duration of response in both the tumor BRCA mutant and the BRCA-like populations was 9.5 months compared to 5.5 months in the biomarker negative patients.

In early 2016, we also presented interim data from a blended population of tumor BRCA-mutant ovarian cancer patients who had received at least three prior lines of therapy from Study 010 and ARIEL2. Sixty-one percent (14/23) of the platinum-sensitive patients achieved a confirmed response, including 13% who achieved a complete response. The median duration of response for these patients was 12.9 months. As we expand enrollment to a larger number of patients, the response rate and duration of response may be different than that reported to date for the smaller set of patients. Data presented to date include only platinum-sensitive patients, while the NDA submission will include a blended population of platinum-sensitive, -resistant and &#8211;refractory patients from the ARIEL2 extension study, in addition to the platinum-sensitive patients in ARIEL2 and Study 010.

Data from ARIEL2 and Study 010 have also demonstrated that rucaparib is generally well-tolerated with a manageable safety profile. The only grade 3/4 treatment-related adverse reactions observed in greater than 15% of patients are anemia/decreased hemoglobin (19%) in the first part of ARIEL2 and fatigue/asthenia (21%) and anemia (26%) in the Phase II portion of Study 010. The safety profile of rucaparib is an important attribute for a drug that is also intended to be used in a maintenance setting. These studies are ongoing, so data may change over time.

We intend to explore rucaparib as a treatment for BRCA-mutant and BRCA-like patients with other solid tumors through a combination of Company-sponsored and investigator initiated studies. In particular, we plan to initiate a registration study of rucaparib in castrate-resistant BRCA mutant prostate cancer patients in the second half of 2016. 

We are collaborating with Foundation Medicine, Inc. for the development of a companion diagnostic to identify our BRCA-like signature, as well as both germline and somatic BRCA mutations. The diagnostic is being developed in parallel with the clinical development of rucaparib, with a goal of filing a PMA with the FDA in a time frame that would allow for regulatory approval of the companion diagnostic at substantially the same time that rucaparib would be approved.

Lucitanib &#8211; a VEGFR , PDGFR and FGFR Inhibitor 

Overview 

Lucitanib is a potent, oral angiogenesis inhibitor that selectively inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor receptors 1-3 (VEGFR1-3), platelet-derived growth factor receptors alpha and beta (PDGFR &#97; /&#223;) and fibroblast growth factor receptors 1-3 (FGFR1-3). In a Phase I/IIa clinical study, lucitanib demonstrated multiple tumor responses in FGFR1 gene-amplified breast cancer patients, as well as in patients with tumors often sensitive to VEGFR inhibitors, such as renal cell and thyroid cancer. In collaboration with Servier, we initiated a broad Phase II development program in advanced breast and lung cancer, where FGFR amplification is common. 

We obtained rights to lucitanib through our acquisition of Ethical Oncology Science S.p.A. (&#8220;EOS&#8221;) (now known as Clovis Oncology Italy S.r.l.) in November 2013, which had in-licensed exclusive development and commercial rights to lucitanib on a global basis, excluding China, from Advenchen Laboratories LLC in 2008. EOS, in turn, sublicensed lucitanib rights to markets outside of the U.S. and Japan to Servier in 2012. We hold exclusive rights for lucitanib in the U.S. and Japan, and we are collaborating with Servier on the global clinical development of lucitanib outside of China. 

VEGF, PDGF and FGF 

The VEGFs are a family of related extracellular proteins that normally regulate blood and lymphatic vessel development in humans. They act by binding to and activating VEGF receptors, which are cell surface proteins that transmit growth signals to specific cells that are involved in the development of new blood vessels. Certain VEGFs promote growth of multiple solid tumors by stimulating the formation of new blood vessels to feed the tumor and allow it to grow and metastasize. Tumors produce an excessive amount of VEGF. This results in excess VEGFR signaling and the formation of new blood vessels within the tumor. The VEGF ligands that induce angiogenesis are often present in a wide range of cancer indications, including a type of kidney cancer called renal cell carcinoma, a type of liver cancer called hepatocellular carcinoma, gastric cancer, head and neck cancers and other solid tumors.

The PDGF family consists of five different isoforms of PDGF ligand that bind to and activate cellular responses through two different receptors (PDGFR &#97; /&#223;). In tumors, PDGF signaling plays a diverse role in many aspects of tumor development promoting cell proliferation, invasion, migration and angiogenesis. Amplification and/or mutation of the gene encoding the PDGFR &#97; receptor is observed in a wide range of cancers, including lung cancer, an aggressive form of brain cancer called glioblastoma and a cancer of the gastrointestinal tract known as gastrointestinal stromal tumors. Amplification of the PDGFR &#97; &#32; gene results in excess production, or the over-expression, of PDGFR &#97; protein on the surface of the tumor cell. The over-expression of PDGFR &#97; on the tumor cell surface leads to an increased receptor signaling, which stimulates uncontrolled proliferation of some types of tumor cells. 

The FGFs are a family of related extracellular proteins that normally regulate cell proliferation and survival in humans. The FGF family consists of 22 ligands that exert their physiological effect on cells by binding to four FGFRs (FGFR1- 4). As with the PDGF family, some cancers display FGF/FGFR gene amplification/mutation resulting in continual activation of the FGFR signaling pathway leading to uncontrolled cell division. Tumors with a relatively high incidence of FGF aberrations, which include amplification of the FGFR1 gene and amplification of a region of chromosome 11q that contains several FGF ligands, include breast cancer (25%) and lung cancer (15%). In addition, FGFR gene amplification/mutation is also observed at a frequency of 3% to 19% in a wide range of cancer indications including sarcoma, ovarian cancer, adenocarcinoma of the lung, bladder cancer, colorectal cancer and endometrial cancer. 

As an inhibitor of VEGFR1-3, PDGFR &#97; /&#223; and FGFR1-3 and given the role that each of these receptor kinases plays in tumor progression and metastasis formation, lucitanib has the potential benefit of targeting three relevant pro-angiogenic growth factors in targeted patient populations identified by molecular markers. 

Clinical Development

The first-in-man clinical trial of lucitanib was initiated in Europe in July 2010. This initial trial was an open-label, dose-escalation, Phase I/IIa study to determine efficacy, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of oral lucitanib in adult patients with advanced solid tumors. A maximum tolerated dose (&#8220;MTD&#8221;) dose of 20mg QD was identified using a standard dose limiting toxicity window definition, but in the heavily pre-treated study population, toxicity-related dose reductions were frequent and, therefore, 15mg QD was adopted as a starting dose for the Phase II portion of the study. Overall, the toxicity profile observed to date is consistent with what was expected from non-clinical studies, with hypertension, proteinuria and subclinical hypothyroidism requiring supplementation being commonly observed. Other common treatment-related events include asthenia and gastrointestinal symptoms (diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting). Subsequent to MTD identification, a dose expansion phase was initiated in patients who were either FGFR or 11q amplified or angiogenesis inhibitor-sensitive. Six of 12 FGF-aberrant breast cancer patients achieved partial responses, some of which were confirmed, with additional responses seen across other tumor types. Median PFS for these heavily pre-treated breast cancer patients (median of six prior lines of therapy) was 9.4 months. 

Development Strategy 

Based on the initial signals of activity and safety described above, a Phase II program is underway exploring lucitanib in advanced breast cancer. A Clovis-sponsored study of lucitanib monotherapy in metastatic breast cancer initiated in 2014 and is expected to complete enrollment in early 2016. The goal of this study is to compare two doses of lucitanib, 10mg and 15mg, with PFS as the primary endpoint. In 2015, an interim analysis was completed, which indicated a difference in tolerability of the two doses. Based on this result, the go-forward dose for all lucitanib studies is 10mg. An ongoing Phase II study in advanced metastatic lung cancer is being discontinued due to low enrollment.

In parallel with our breast study underway in the U.S., Servier is conducting a Phase II study of lucitanib monotherapy in patients with advanced breast cancer. This ex-U.S. study, known as FINESSE, is expected to enroll approximately 100 patients into three cohorts: (1) FGFR-1 amplified, (2) 11q amplified and (3) neither FGFR-1 nor 11q amplified. This study seeks to determine whether the activity of lucitanib is limited to a biomarker-defined population of breast cancer tumors with FGF-aberrations or if a more broadly defined population may benefit. 

As data emerge from ongoing studies, it appears that lucitanib&#8217;s VEGF inhibition may be the primary driver of its activity. Accordingly, we believe its future development will likely be focused in combination with other cancer therapies. In addition to evaluating lucitanib in breast cancer, we intend to explore it in combination with other agents and in other solid tumors, including ovarian and hepatocellular cancers. 

Development costs for lucitanib incurred to date have been fully funded by Servier as part of its commitment to fund the first &#8364;80 million of development costs in accordance with the sub-license agreement (see License Agreements &#8211; Les Laboratoires Servier below). Based on current cost estimates, we expect that commitment will be fulfilled in late 2016 or early 2017, and thereafter, we will share equally in future development costs with Servier pursuant to a mutually agreed upon global development plan. 

Competition 

The development and commercialization of new drugs is competitive, and we face competition from major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies worldwide. Our competitors may develop or market products or other novel technologies that are more effective, safer or less costly than any that have been or will be commercialized by us, or may obtain regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours. 

The acquisition or licensing of pharmaceutical products is also very competitive, and a number of more established companies, which have acknowledged strategies to license or acquire products, may have competitive advantages over us, as may other emerging companies taking similar or different approaches to product acquisitions. Many of our competitors will have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we have. Additional mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical industry may result in even more resources being concentrated in our competitors. Competition may increase further as a result of advances made in the commercial applicability of technologies and greater availability of capital for investment in these fields. Our success will be based in part on our ability to build and actively manage a portfolio of drugs that addresses unmet medical needs and creates value in patient therapy. 

Rociletinib Competition 

Tarceva &#174; , Iressa &#174; and Gilotrif &#174; are currently approved drugs for the treatment of first-line EGFR-mutant NSCLC, and Tagrisso&#8482; was approved in November 2015 for patients with metastatic EGFR T790M mutation-positive NSCLC who have progressed on or after EGFR TKI therapy. Tagrisso&#8482; is the first approved therapy for the treatment of EGFR mutant NSCLC who test positive for the T790M mutation. In February 2016, the European Commission granted conditional marketing approval to Tagrisso&#8482; for the treatment of advanced NSCLC patients who test positive for the T790M mutation. In addition, we are aware of a number of other products in development targeting cancer-causing mutant forms of EGFR for the treatment of NSCLC patients. These products include Pfizer&#8217;s PF-06747775, currently in Phase I/II trials, Astellas Pharma&#8217;s ASP8273, currently in Phase I/II trials, Novartis&#8217; EGF816, currently in Phase I/II trials, Hanmi Pharmaceutical&#8217;s and Boehringer Ingelheim&#8217;s BI-1482694 (HM61713), HM781-36B (Poziotinib), currently in Phase I/II trials, and Acea Bio (Hangzhou)&#8217;s avitinib and AC0010MA, currently in Phase I/II trials. Bristol Myers Squibb&#8217;s Opdivo &#174; and Merck&#8217;s Keytruda &#174; , both approved for second-line NSCLC, may also represent competition to rociletinib.

Rucaparib Competition 

In late 2014, Lynparza&#8482; (olaparib) was approved in the U.S. as monotherapy in patients with germline BRCA mutated advanced ovarian cancer who have been treated with three or more prior lines of chemotherapy and in the EU for the maintenance treatment of BRCA mutated platinum-sensitive relapsed serous ovarian cancer. There are a number of other PARP inhibitors in clinical development including AbbVie&#8217;s ABT-888 (veliparib), currently in Phase III clinical trials, Tesaro, Inc.&#8217;s niraparib, currently in Phase III trials, Eisai&#8217;s E-7016, currently in Phase II trials and Medivation&#8217;s talazoparib (BMN-673), currently in Phase III trials. 

Lucitanib Competition 

There are currently no approved drugs that specifically inhibit each of VEGFR, PDGFR and FGFR; however, there are currently a number of oral antiangiogenic drugs that target one or a subset of those markers and are approved or in development for various solid tumors, including: nintedanib (Boehringer Ingelheim), lenvatinib (Eisai), sunitinib (Pfizer), sorafenib (Bayer), pazopanib (Novartis), axitinib (Pfizer) and cabozantinib (Exelixis).

License Agreements 

Celgene Corporation 

In May 2010, we entered into an exclusive worldwide license agreement with Avila Therapeutics, Inc. (now Celgene Avilomics Research Inc., part of Celgene Corporation (&#8220;Celgene&#8221;)) to discover, develop and commercialize a covalent inhibitor of mutant forms of the EGFR gene product. As a result of the collaboration contemplated by the agreement, rociletinib was identified as the lead inhibitor candidate, which we are developing under the terms of the license agreement. Under the agreement, we are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize rociletinib, and we are responsible for all non-clinical, clinical, regulatory and other activities necessary to develop and commercialize rociletinib. 

We made an upfront payment of $2.0 million upon execution of the license agreement, a $4.0 million milestone payment in the first quarter of 2012 upon the acceptance by the FDA of our Investigational New Drug (&#8220;IND&#8221;) application for rociletinib and a $5.0 million milestone payment in the first quarter of 2014 upon the initiation of the Phase II study for rociletinib. In the third quarter of 2015, we made milestone payments totaling $12.0 million upon acceptance of the NDA and MAA for rociletinib by the FDA and EMA, respectively.

Pfizer Inc. 

In June 2011, we entered into a license agreement with Pfizer Inc. to obtain the exclusive global rights to develop and commercialize rucaparib. The exclusive rights are exclusive even as to Pfizer and include the right to grant sublicenses. Under the terms of the license agreement, we made a $7.0 million upfront payment to Pfizer. In April 2014, the Company initiated the ARIEL3 pivotal registration study for rucaparib, which resulted in a $0.4 million milestone payment to Pfizer as required by the license agreement. This payment was recognized as acquired in-process research and development expense. 

We are obligated under the license agreement to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize rucaparib, and we are responsible for all remaining development and commercialization costs for rucaparib . When and if commercial sales of rucaparib begin, we will pay Pfizer tiered royalties at a mid-teen percentage r ate on our net sales , with standard provisions for royalty offsets to the extent we need to obtain any rights from third parties to commercialize rucaparib . 

We are required to make regulatory milestone payments to Pfizer of up to an additional $88.5 million if specified clinical study objectives and regulatory filings, acceptances and approvals are achieved, including $20.75 million associated with the first approval of an NDA by the FDA. In addition, we are obligated to make sales milestone payments to Pfizer if specified annual sales targets for rucaparib are met, the majority of which relate to annual sales targets of $500.0 million and above, which, in the aggregate, could amount to total milestone payments of $170.0 million. 

The license agreement with Pfizer will remain in effect until the expiration of all of our royalty and sublicense revenue obligations to Pfizer, determined on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, unless we elect to terminate the license agreement earlier. If we fail to meet our obligations under the agreement and are unable to cure such failure within specified time periods, Pfizer can terminate the agreement, resulting in a loss of our rights to rucaparib and an obligation to assign or license to Pfizer any intellectual property rights or other rights we may have in rucaparib, including our regulatory filings, regulatory approvals, patents and trademarks for rucaparib. 

Advenchen Laboratories LLC 

In October 2008, EOS entered into an exclusive license agreement with Advenchen Laboratories LLC (&#8220;Advenchen&#8221;) to develop and commercialize lucitanib on a global basis, excluding China. If and when commercial sales commence, we are obligated to pay Advenchen tiered royalties at percentage rates in the mid-single digits on net sales of lucitanib, based on the volume of annual net sales achieved. In addition, after giving effect to the first and second amendments to the license agreement, we are required to pay to Advenchen 25% of any consideration, excluding royalties, we receive from sublicensees, in lieu of the milestone obligations set forth in the agreement. We are obligated under the agreement to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize at least one product containing lucitanib, and we are also responsible for all remaining development and commercialization costs for lucitanib. 

The license agreement with Advenchen will remain in effect until the expiration of all of our royalty obligations to Advenchen, determined on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, unless we elect to terminate the agreement earlier. If we fail to meet our obligations under the agreement and are unable to cure such failure within specified time periods, Advenchen can terminate the agreement, resulting in a loss of our rights to lucitanib. 

Les Laboratoires Servier 

In September 2012, EOS entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Servier, whereby EOS sublicensed to Servier exclusive rights to develop and commercialize lucitanib in all countries outside of the U.S., Japan and China. In exchange for these rights, EOS received an upfront payment of &#8364;45.0 million. We are entitled to receive additional payments on the achievement of specified development, regulatory and commercial milestones up to &#8364;100.0 million in the aggregate, &#8364;10.0 million of which was received in the first quarter of 2014. In addition, we are entitled to receive sales milestone payments if specified annual sales targets for lucitanib are met, each of which relates to annual sales targets of &#8364;250.0 million and above, which, in the aggregate, could amount to a total of &#8364;250.0 million. We are also entitled to receive royalties at percentage rates ranging from low to mid-teens on sales of lucitanib by Servier. 

We, along with Servier, are obligated to use diligent efforts to develop a product containing lucitanib and to carry out the activities delegated to each party under a mutually-agreed global development plan. Servier is responsible for all of the development costs for lucitanib up to &#8364;80.0 million, as incurred by each party in connection with global development plan activities. Cumulative global development plan costs in excess of &#8364;80.0 million, if any, will be shared equally between the Company and Servier. Based on current estimates, we expect that Servier&#8217;s &#8364;80.0 million funding commitment will be fulfilled in late 2016 or early 2017, and thereafter, we and Servier will share in future development costs pursuant to a mutually agreed upon global development plan. 

The collaboration and license agreement will remain in effect until the expiration of all of Servier&#8217;s royalty obligations to us, determined on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, unless Servier elects to terminate the agreement earlier. If we fail to meet our obligations under the agreement and are unable to cure such failure within specified time periods, Servier can terminate the agreement, resulting in the granting of a perpetual license to Servier of rights to lucitanib. 

Government Regulation 

Government authorities in the United States (including federal, state and local authorities) and in other countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the manufacturing, research and clinical development, marketing, labeling and packaging, storage, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, advertising and promotion, pricing and export and import of pharmaceutical products, such as those we are developing. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Moreover, failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements may result in, among other things, warning letters, clinical holds, civil or criminal penalties, recall or seizure of products, injunction, disbarment, partial or total suspension of production or withdrawal of the product from the market. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. 

U.S. Government Regulation 

In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (&#8220;FDCA&#8221;) and its implementing regulations. Drugs are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process required by the FDA before product candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 

&#160;

&#9679; 

submission to the FDA of an IND which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin and must be updated annually; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

completion of extensive non-clinical laboratory tests and non-clinical animal studies, all performed in accordance with the FDA&#8217;s Good Laboratory Practice regulations; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for each proposed indication; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

submission to the FDA of an NDA after completion of all pivotal clinical trials; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA to file the NDA for review; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities at which the active pharmaceutical ingredient (&#8220;API&#8221;) and finished drug product are produced and tested to assess compliance with Current Good Manufacturing Practices (&#8220;cGMP&#8221;); and 

&#160;

&#9679; 

FDA review and approval of an NDA prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the United States. 

An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational drug product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for human studies. The IND also includes results of animal studies or other human studies, as appropriate, as well as manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature to support the use of the investigational new drug. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. An IND will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to the proposed clinical trials. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before clinical trials can begin. Accordingly, submission of an IND may or may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence. 

Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with Good Clinical Practices (&#8220;GCPs&#8221;), which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the efficacy criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Additionally, approval must also be obtained from each clinical trial site&#8217;s Institutional Review Board (&#8220;IRB&#8221;) before the trials may be initiated, and the IRB must monitor the study until completed. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and clinical trial results to public registries. 

The clinical investigation of a drug is generally divided into three phases. Although the phases are usually conducted sequentially, they may overlap or be combined. The three phases of an investigation are as follows: 

&#160;

&#9679; 

Phase I. Phase I includes the initial introduction of an investigational new drug into humans. Phase I clinical trials are typically closely monitored and may be conducted in patients with the target disease or condition or in healthy volunteers. These studies are designed to evaluate the safety, dosage tolerance, metabolism and pharmacologic actions of the investigational drug in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. During Phase I clinical trials, sufficient information about the investigational drug&#8217;s pharmacokinetics and pharmacological effects may be obtained to permit the design of well-controlled and scientifically valid Phase 2 clinical trials. The total number of participants included in Phase I clinical trials varies, but is generally in the range of 20 to 80. 

&#160;

&#9679; 

Phase II. Phase II include s controlled clinical trials conducted to preliminarily or further evaluate the effectiveness of the investigational drug for a particular indication(s) in patients with the disease or condition under study, to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage , and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks associated with the drug. Phase II clinical trials are typically well-controlled, closely monitored, and conducted in a limited patient population, usually involving no more than several hund red participants. 

&#160;

&#9679; 

Phase III. Phase III clinical trials are generally controlled clinical trials conducted in an expanded patient population generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. They are performed after preliminary evidence suggesting effectiveness of the drug has been obtained and are intended to further evaluate dosage, clinical effectiveness and safety, to establish the overall benefit-risk relationship of the investigational drug product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval. Phase III clinical trials usually involve several hundred to several thousand participants. 

A pivotal study is a clinical study which adequately meets regulatory agency requirements for the evaluation of a drug candidate&#8217;s efficacy and safety such that it can be used to justify the approval of the product. Generally, pivotal studies are also Phase III studies but may be Phase II studies if the trial design provides a well-controlled and reliable assessment of clinical benefit, particularly in situations where there is an unmet medical need. 

The FDA, the IRB or the clinical trial sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study. We may also suspend or terminate a clinical trial based on evolving business objectives and/or competitive climate. 

Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, detailed investigational drug product information is submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. 

The application includes all relevant data available from pertinent non-clinical and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results, as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product&#8217;s chemistry, manufacturing, controls and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of a product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and effectiveness of the investigational drug product to the satisfaction of the FDA. 

Once the NDA submission has been accepted for filing, the FDA&#8217;s goal is to review applications within 10 months of submission or, if the application relates to an unmet medical need in a serious or life-threatening indication, six months from submission. The review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA may refer the application to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it typically follows such recommendations. 

After the FDA evaluates the NDA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the drug product and/or its API will be produced, it may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete, and the application is not ready for approval. A Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data and/or an additional pivotal Phase III clinical trial(s), and/or other significant, expensive and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, non-clinical studies or manufacturing. Even if such additional information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. The FDA could also approve the NDA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies plan to mitigate risks, which could include medication guides, physician communication plans or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling, development of adequate controls and specifications or a commitment to conduct one or more post-market studies or clinical trials. Such post-market testing may include Phase IV clinical trials and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product&#8217;s safety and effectiveness after commercialization. Regulatory approval of oncology products often requires that patients in clinical trials be followed for long periods to determine the overall survival benefit of the drug. 

After regulatory approval of a drug product is obtained, we are required to comply with a number of post-approval requirements. As a holder of an approved NDA, we would be required to report, among other things, certain adverse reactions and pro duction problems to the FDA, to provide updated safety and efficacy information and to comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling for any of our products. Also, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to con form to cGMP after approval to ensure and preserve the long term stability of the drug product. The FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMP, which imposes extensive procedural, substantive and record keeping requir ements. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any de viations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality cont rol to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance. 

We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our product candidates. Future FDA and state inspections may identify compliance issues at our facilities or at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution or require substantial resources to correct. In addition, discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable requirements may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved NDA, including withdrawal or recall of the product from the market or other voluntary, FDA-initiated or judicial action that could delay or prohibit further marketing. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product&#8217;s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established or the FDA&#8217;s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development. 

Europe/Rest of World Government Regulation 

In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of our products. 

Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In Europe, for example, a clinical trial application, (&#8220;CTA&#8221;) must be submitted to each country&#8217;s national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and IRB, respectively. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country&#8217;s requirements, clinical trial development may proceed. 

The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. 

To obtain regulatory approval of an investigational drug under European Union regulatory systems, we must submit a marketing authorization application. The application used to file the NDA in the United States is similar to that required in Europe, with the exception of, among other things, country-specific document requirements. 

For other countries outside of the European Union, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, again, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. 

If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution. 

Available Special Regulatory Procedures 

Formal Meetings 

We are encouraged to engage and seek guidance from health authorities relating to the development and review of investigational drugs, as well as marketing applications. In the United States, there are different types of official meetings that may occur between us and the FDA. Each meeting type is subject to different procedures. Conclusions and agreements from each of these meetings are captured in the official final meeting minutes issued by the FDA. 

The EMA also provides the opportunity for dialogue with us. This is usually done in the form of Scientific Advice, which is given by the Scientific Advice Working Party of the CHMP. A fee is incurred with each Scientific Advice meeting. 

Advice from either the FDA or EMA is typically provided based on questio ns concerning, for example, quality (chemistry, manufacturing and controls testing), nonclinical testing and clinical studies and pharmacovigilance plans and risk-management programs. Such advice is not legally binding on the sponsor. To obtain binding com mitments from health authorities in the United States and the European Union, SPA or Protocol Assistance procedures are available. A SPA is an evaluation by the FDA of a protocol with the goal of reaching an agreement with the sponsor that the protocol des ign, clinical endpoints and statistical analyses are acceptable to support regulatory approval of the product candidate with respect to effectiveness in the indication studied. The FDA&#8217;s agreement to a SPA is binding upon the FDA except in limited circumst ances, such as if the FDA identifies a substantial scientific issue essential to determining the safety or effectiveness of the product after clinical studies begin, or if the study sponsor fails to follow the protocol that was agreed upon with the FDA. Th ere is no guarantee that a study will ultimately be adequate to support an approval even if the study is subject to a SPA. 

Orphan Drug Designation 

The FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or if it affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States, there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States. In the European Union, the EMA&#8217;s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products grants orphan drug designation to promote the development of products that are intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions affecting not more than five in 10,000 persons in the European Union Community. Additionally, designation is granted for products intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition and when, without incentives, it is unlikely that sales of the drug in the European Union would be sufficient to justify the necessary investment in developing the drug or biological product. 

In the United States, orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages and user-fee waivers. In addition, if a product receives the first FDA approval for the indication for which it has orphan designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means the FDA may not approve any other application to market the same drug for the same indication for a period of seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority over the product with orphan exclusivity. 

In the European Union, orphan drug designation also entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and 10 years of market exclusivity is granted following drug or biological product approval. This period may be reduced to six years if the orphan drug designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. 

Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an application for marketing approval. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. 

Pediatric Development 

In the United States, the FDCA provides for an additional six months of marketing exclusivity for a drug if reports are filed of investigations studying the use of the drug product in a pediatric population in response to a written request from the FDA. Separate from this potential exclusivity benefit, NDAs must contain data (or a proposal for post-marketing activity) to assess the safety and effectiveness of an investigational drug product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric populations in order to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults or full or partial waivers if certain criteria are met. Discussions about pediatric development plans can be discussed with the FDA at any time, but usually occur any time between the end-of-Phase II meeting and submission of the NDA. 

For the EMA, a Pediatric Investigation Plan, and/or a request for waiver or deferral, is required for submission prior to submitting a marketing authorization application. 

Authorization Procedures in the European Union 

Medicines can be authorized in the European Union by using either the centralized authorization procedure or national authorization procedures. 

&#160;

&#9679; 

Centralized procedure . The EMA implemented the centralized procedure for the approval of human medicines to facilitate marketing authorizations that are valid throughout the European Union. This procedure results in a single marketing authorization issued by the EMA that is valid across the European Union, as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The centralized procedure is compulsory for human medicines that are: derived from biotechnology processes, such as genetic engineering, contain a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders or autoimmune diseases and other immune dysfunctions, and officially designated orphan medicines. 

For medicines that do not fall within these categories, an applicant has the option of submitting an application for a centralized marketing auth orization to the EMA, as long as the medicine concerned is a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation, or if its authorization would be in the interest of public health. 

&#160;

&#9679; 

National authorization procedures. There are also two other possible routes to authorize medicinal products in several countries, which are available for investigational drug products that fall outside the scope of the centralized procedure: 

&#160;

&#167; 

Decentralized procedure. Using the decentralized procedure, an applicant may apply for simultaneous authorization in more than one European Union country of medicinal products that have not yet been authorized in any European Union country and that do not fall within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure. 

&#160;

&#167; 

Mutual recognition procedure. In the mutual recognition procedure, a medicine is first authorized in one European Union Member State, in accordance with the national procedures of that country. Following this, further marketing authorizations can be sought from other European Union countries in a procedure whereby the countries concerned agree to recognize the validity of the original, national marketing authorization. 

Breakthrough Therapy Designation in the United States

The U.S. Congress created the Breakthrough Therapy designation program as a result of the passage of the Food and Drug Administration Safety Act of 2012. FDA may grant Breakthrough Therapy status to a drug intended for the treatment of a serious condition when preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. The Breakthrough Therapy designation, which may be requested by a sponsor when filing or amending an IND, is intended to facilitate and expedite the development and FDA review of a product candidate. Specifically, the Breakthrough Therapy designation may entitle the sponsor to more frequent meetings with FDA during drug development, intensive guidance on clinical trial design and expedited FDA review by a cross-disciplinary team comprised of senior managers. The designation does not guarantee a faster development or review time as compared to other drugs, however, nor does it assure that the drug will obtain ultimate marketing approval by the FDA. Once granted, the FDA may withdraw this designation at any time. 

We have received Breakthrough Therapy designation for rociletinib for the treatment of second-line EGFR mutant NSCLC in patients with the T790M mutation and for rucaparib as monotherapy treatment of advanced ovarian cancer in patients who have received at least two lines of prior platinum-containing therapy, with BRCA-mutated tumors, inclusive of both germline BRCA and somatic BRCA. Because the Breakthrough Therapy designation program is relatively new, it is difficult for us to predict the effect that this designation will have on the development and FDA review of rociletinib or rucaparib.

Expedited Review and Approval in the United States 

The FDA has various programs, including Fast Track, priority review and accelerated approval, which are intended to expedite or simplify the process for reviewing drugs and biologics, and/or provide for the approval of a drug or biologic on the basis of a surrogate endpoint. Even if a drug qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the drug no longer meets the conditions for qualification or that the time period for FDA review or approval will be shortened. Generally, drugs that are eligible for these programs are those for serious or life-threatening conditions, those with the potential to address unmet medical needs and those that offer meaningful benefits over existing treatments. For example, based on results of the Phase III clinical trial(s) submitted in an NDA, upon the request of an applicant, the FDA may grant the NDA a priority review designation, which sets the target date for FDA action on the application at six months, rather than to the standard FDA review period of 10 months. Priority review is granted where preliminary estimates indicate that a product, if approved, has the potential to provide a safe and effective therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists, or a significant improvement compared to marketed products is possible. Priority review designation does not change the scientific/medical standard for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval.

Accelerated approval provides for an earlier approval for a new drug that is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit and is better than available therapy. A surrogate endpoint is a laboratory measurement or physical sign used as an indirect or substitute measurement representing a clinically meaningful outcome. The FDA will also take into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition. As a condition of approval for drugs granted accelerated approval, one or more post-marketing confirmatory studies are required to confirm as predicted by the surrogate marker trial an effect on clinical benefit, which is defined as having a positive effect on how a patient feels, functions or survives. 

Accelerated Review in the European Union 

Under the Centralized Procedure in the European Union, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a marketing authorization application is 210 days (excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CHMP). Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of a major public health interest, defined by three cumulative criteria: the seriousness of the disease (e.g. heavy disabling or life-threatening diseases) to be treated; the absence or insufficiency of an appropriate alternative therapeutic approach; and anticipation of high therapeutic benefit. In this circumstance, EMA ensures that the opinion of the CHMP is given within 150 days of submission of the MAA, excluding clock stops. 

Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement 

Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any drug products for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government health administrative authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the drug product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA approvals. Our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. A payor&#8217;s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be established. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. 

There have been a number of federal and state proposals in recent years regarding the pricing of pharmaceutical products, government control and other changes to the healthcare system of the United States. The U.S. government enacted legislation providing a partial prescription drug benefit for Medicare beneficiaries. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for any products for which we receive marketing approval; however, to obtain payments under this program, we would be required to sell products to Medicare recipients through prescription drug plans operating pursuant to this legislation. These plans will likely negotiate discounted prices for our products. Additionally, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively, the &#8220;Affordable Care Act&#8221;) was enacted in 2010 with a goal of reducing the cost of healthcare and substantially changing the way healthcare is financed by both government and private insurers. Among other cost containment measures, the Affordable Care Act established: 

&#160;

&#9679; 

An annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs and biologic agents; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

A Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which pharmaceutical manufacturers who wish to have their drugs covered under Part D must offer discounts to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period (the &#8220;donut hole&#8221;); and 

&#160;

&#9679; 

A formula that increases the rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. 

We expect that federal, state and local governments in the United States will continue to consider legislation to limit the growth of healthcare costs, including the cost of prescription drugs. Future legislation could limit payments for pharmaceuticals such as the drug candidates that we are developing. 

Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. In the European Community, governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country. 

The marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors f ail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, emphasis on reducing the rate of healthcare spending in the United States has increased , and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be imple mented in the future. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our products. 

Advertising and Promotion

The FDA and other U.S. federal regulatory agencies closely regulate the marketing and promotion of drugs through, among other things, the FDCA and the FDA&#8217;s implementing regulations and standards. The FDA&#8217;s review of marketing and promotional activities encompasses, but is not limited to, direct-to-consumer advertising, healthcare provider-directed advertising and promotion, sales representative communications to healthcare professionals, communications regarding unapproved or &#8220;off-label&#8221; uses, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. A product cannot be commercially promoted before it is approved. After approval, product promotion can include only those claims relating to safety and effectiveness that are consistent with the labeling approved by the FDA. FDA regulations impose stringent restrictions on manufacturers&#8217; communications regarding off-label uses. Failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements and restrictions regarding unapproved uses of a drug or for other violations of its advertising and labeling laws and regulations, may result in adverse publicity and enforcement action by the FDA, the Department of Justice or the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, as well as state authorities. A range of penalties are possible that could have a significant commercial consequences, including product seizures, injunctions, civil and/or criminal fines and agreements that materially restrict the manner in which a company promotes or distributes its products or regulatory letters, which may require corrective advertising or other corrective communications to healthcare professionals.

Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements 

If we obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, we may be subject to various federal and state laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. For example, in the United States, there are federal and state anti-kickback laws that prohibit the payment or receipt of kickbacks, bribes or other remuneration intended to induce the purchase or recommendation of healthcare products and services or reward past purchases or recommendations. Violations of these laws can lead to civil and criminal penalties, including fines, imprisonment and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. 

The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, recommending, or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The reach of the Anti-Kickback Statute was broadened by the Affordable Care Act, which, among other things, amended the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the applicable criminal healthcare fraud statutes contained within 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1320a-7b. Pursuant to the statutory amendment, a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the Affordable Care Act provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act (discussed below) or the civil monetary penalties statute. Many states have adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, some of which apply to the referral of patients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any source, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs. 

The federal False Claims Act imposes liability on any person who, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment by a federal program, including federal healthcare programs. The &#8220;qui tam&#8221; provisions of the False Claims Act allow a private individual to bring civil actions on behalf of the federal government alleging that the defendant has submitted a false claim to the federal government, and to share in any monetary recovery. In addition, various states have enacted false claims laws analogous to the False Claims Act. Many of these state laws apply where a claim is submitted to any third-party payer and not merely a federal healthcare program. When an entity is determined to have violated the False Claims Act, it may be required to pay up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus civil penalties. 

In addition to the laws described above, the Affordable Care Act also imposed new reporting requirements on drug manufacturers for payments made to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $150,000 per year (or up to an aggregate of $1.0 million per year for &#8220;knowing failures&#8221;), for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests that are not timely, accurately and completely reported in an annual submission. Applicable drug manufacturers are required to collect data for each calendar year and submit reports to CMS by March 31st of each subsequent calendar year.

Also, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (&#8220;HIPAA&#8221;) created several new federal crimes, including health care fraud and false statements relating to health care matters. The health care fraud statute prohibits knowingly and will fully executing a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program, including private third-party payers. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits, items or services. In addition, we may be subject to, or our marketing activities may be limited by, HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Tech nology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (&#8220;HITECH&#8221;) and its implementing regulations, which established uniform standards for certain &#8220;covered entities&#8221; (healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses) and their business associates gov erning the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protecting the security and privacy of protected health information. 

Regulation of Diagnostic Tests 

In the United States, the FDCA and its implementing regulations, and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, medical device design and development, non-clinical and clinical testing, premarket clearance or approval, registration and listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, export and import, and post-market surveillance. Diagnostic tests are classified as medical devices under the FDCA. Unless an exemption applies, diagnostic tests require marketing clearance or approval from the FDA prior to commercial distribution. The two primary types of FDA marketing authorization applicable to a medical device are premarket notification, also called 510(k) clearance, and premarket approval, or PMA approval. Because the diagnostic tests being developed by our third-party collaborators are of substantial importance in preventing impairment of human health, they are subject to the PMA approval process. 

PMA applications must be supported by valid scientific evidence, which typically requires extensive data, including technical, non-clinical, clinical and manufacturing data, to demonstrate to the FDA&#8217;s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the device. For diagnostic tests, a PMA application typically includes data regarding analytical and clinical validation studies. As part of its review of the PMA, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities to ensure compliance with the Quality System Regulation, or QSR, which requires manufacturers to follow design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures. FDA review of an initial PMA application is required by statute to take between six to ten months, although the process typically takes longer, and may require several years to complete. If the FDA evaluations of both the PMA application and the manufacturing facilities are favorable, the FDA will either issue an approval letter or an approvable letter, which usually contains a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure the final approval of the PMA. If the FDA&#8217;s evaluation of the PMA or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, the FDA will deny approval of the PMA or issue a not approvable letter. A not approvable letter will outline the deficiencies in the application and, where practical, will identify what is necessary to make the PMA approvable. The FDA may also determine that additional clinical trials are necessary, in which case the PMA approval may be delayed for several months or years while the trials are conducted and then the data submitted in an amendment to the PMA. Once granted, PMA approval may be withdrawn by the FDA if compliance with post approval requirements, conditions of approval or other regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing. 

We and our third-party collaborators who are developing the companion diagnostics will work cooperatively to generate the data required for submission with the PMA application, and will remain in close contact with the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (&#8220;CDRH&#8221;) at the FDA to ensure that any changes in requirements are incorporated into the development plans. We anticipate that meetings with the FDA with regard to our drug product candidates, as well as companion diagnostic product candidates, will include representatives from the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research and CDRH to ensure that the NDA and PMA submissions are coordinated to enable FDA to conduct a parallel review of both submissions. On July 14, 2011, the FDA issued its final guidance document addressing the development and approval process for &#8220;In Vitro Companion Diagnostic Devices.&#8221; According to the guidance, for novel therapeutic products such as our product candidates, the PMA for a companion diagnostic device should be developed and approved or cleared contemporaneously with the therapeutic. We believe our programs for the development of our companion diagnostics are consistent with this guidance. 

In the European Economic Area (&#8220;EEA&#8221;), in vitro medical devices are required to conform with the essential requirements of the E.U. Directive on in vitro diagnostic medical devices (Directive No 98/79/EC, as amended). To demonstrate compliance with the essential requirements, the manufacturer must undergo a conformity assessment procedure. The conformity assessment varies according to the type of medical device and its classification. For low-risk devices, the conformity assessment can be carried out internally, but for higher risk devices it requires the intervention of an accredited EEA Notified Body. If successful, the conformity assessment concludes with the drawing up by the manufacturer of an EC Declaration of Conformity entitling the manufacturer to affix the CE mark to its products and to sell them throughout the EEA. The data generated for the U.S. registration will be sufficient to satisfy the regulatory requirements for the European Union and other countries. 

Patents and Proprietary Rights 

The proprietary nature of, and protection for, our product candidates, processes and know-how are important to our business. Our success depends in part on our ability to protect the proprietary nature of our product candidates, technology, and know-how, to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others, and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. We seek patent protection in the United States and internationally for our product candidates and other technology. Our policy is to patent or in-license the technology, inventions and improvements that we consider important to the development of our business. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how and continuing innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our technology. 

In May 2010, we acquired an exclusive, worldwide license to rociletinib from Avila Therapeutics, Inc. (now Celgene Avilomics Research Inc., part of Celgene Corporation). U.S. Patent 8,975,927, directed to rociletinib composition of matter, expires in 2032 and U.S. Patent 9,108,927, directed to rociletinib HBr salts and polymorphs, expires in 2033. Other patent applications are pending that claim rociletinib generically that, if issued, would have expiration dates in 2029. In January 2013, we acquired from Gatekeeper Pharmaceuticals, Inc. an exclusive worldwide sub-license to a Dana Farber patent family having claims directed to wild-type sparing irreversible EGFR inhibitors, such as rociletinib. We or our licensors have filed additional patent applications related to rociletinib methods of use, metabolites, combinations, diagnostic methods and dosing regimens. 

In June 2011, we obtained an exclusive, worldwide license from Pfizer to develop and commercialize rucaparib. U.S. Patent 6,495,541, and its equivalent counterparts issued or pending in dozens of countries, directed to the rucaparib composition of matter, expire in 2020 and are potentially eligible for up to five years patent term extension in various jurisdictions. We believe that patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act could be available to extend our patent exclusivity for rucaparib to at least 2024 in the United States depending on timing of our first approval. In Europe, we believe that patent term extension under a supplementary protection certificate could be available for an additional five years to at least 2025. In April 2012, we obtained an exclusive license from AstraZeneca under a family of patents and patent applications which will permit the development and commercialization of rucaparib for certain methods of treating patients with PARP inhibitors. Additionally, other patents and patent applications are directed to methods of making, methods of using, dosing regimens, various salt and polymorphic forms and formulations and have expiration dates ranging from 2020 through 2035. 

We obtained rights to lucitanib by acquiring EOS in November 2013, along with its license agreements with Advenchen and Servier. In October 2008, EOS entered into an exclusive license agreement with Advenchen to develop and commercialize lucitanib on a global basis, excluding China. In September 2012, EOS entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Servier whereby EOS sublicensed to Servier exclusive rights to develop and commercialize lucitanib in all countries outside of the U.S., Japan and China. Composition of matter and method of use patent protection for lucitanib and a group of structurally-related compounds is issued in the U.S., Europe and Japan and is issued or pending in other jurisdictions. In the U.S., the composition of matter patent will expire in 2030, and in other jurisdictions, it expires in 2028. We believe that patent term extension could be available to extend our composition of matter patent up to five years beyond the scheduled expiration under the Hatch-Waxman Act. Additionally, patents or patent applications directed to methods of manufacturing lucitanib are issued or pending in the United States, Europe, Japan, and China. 

In addition, we intend to seek patent protection whenever available for any products or product candidates and related technology we acquire in the future. 

The patent positions of pharmaceutical firms like us are generally uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued. Consequently, we do not know whether any of the product candidates we acquire or license will gain patent protection or, if any patents are issued, whether they will provide significant proprietary protection or will be challenged, circumvented or invalidated. Because patent applications in the United States and certain other jurisdictions are maintained in secrecy for 18 months, and since publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries, until that time we cannot be certain that we were the first to file any patent application related to our product candidates. Moreover, we may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the U.S. PTO to determine priority of invention or in opposition or other third-party proceedings in the U.S. or a foreign patent office, either of which could result in substantial cost to us, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us. There can be no assurance that the patents, if issued, would be held valid by a court of competent jurisdiction. An adverse outcome in a third-party patent dispute could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties, require disputed rights to be licensed from third parties or require us to cease using specific compounds or technology. 

The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application. In the United States, a patent&#8217;s term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the U.S. PTO in granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over another patent. 

The patent term of a patent that covers a FDA-approved drug may also be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (&#8220;Hatch-Waxman Act&#8221;) permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review. Patent extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other non-U.S. jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. In the future, if and when our pharmaceutical products receive FDA approval, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on patents covering those products. 

To protect our rights to any of our issued patents and proprietary information, we may need to litigate against infringing third parties, or avail ourselves of the courts or participate in hearings to determine the scope and validity of those patents or other proprietary rights. These types of proceedings are often costly and could be very time-consuming to us, and we cannot assure you that the deciding authorities will rule in our favor. An unfavorable decision could allow third parties to use our technology without being required to pay us licensing fees or may compel us to license needed technologies to a third-party. Such a decision could even result in the invalidation or a limitation in the scope of our patents or forfeiture of the rights associated with our patents or pending patent applications. To the extent prudent, we intend to bring litigation against third parties that we believe are infringing one or more of our patents.

In addition we have sought and intend to continue seeking orphan drug status whenever it is available. If a product which has an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first regulatory approval for the indication for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan exclusivity, meaning that the applicable regulatory authority may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication, except in certain very limited circumstances, for a period of seven years in the United States and ten years in the European Union. Orphan drug designation does not prevent competitors from developing or marketing different drugs for an indication. 

We also rely on trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information. No assurance can be given that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose such technology, or that we can meaningfully protect our trade secrets. However, we believe that the substantial costs and resources required to develop technological innovations will help us to protect the competitive advantage of our products. 

It is our policy to require our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual&#8217;s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. In the case of employees, the agreements provide that all inventions conceived by the individual shall be our exclusive property. There can be no assurance, however, that these agreements will provide meaningful protection or adequate remedies for our trade secrets in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information. 

Manufacturing 

We currently contract with third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates for non-clinical studies and clinical trials and intend to do so in the future. We currently have a long-term agreement with a third-party contract manufacturing organization (&#8220;CMO&#8221;) for the production of the active ingredient for rucaparib. For contract manufacturers not under long-term agreements, we currently obtain our supplies of active ingredients and finished drug product through individual purchase orders. We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of clinical quantities of our product candidates. We currently have no plans to build our own clinical or commercial scale manufacturing capabilities. To meet our projected needs for commercial manufacturing, third parties with whom we currently work will need to increase their scale of production or we will need to secure alternate suppliers. Although we rely on contract manufacturers, we have personnel with extensive manufacturing experience to oversee the relationships with our contract manufacturers. 

The active pharm aceutical ingredient for rociletinib is currently being manufactured by two CMO s, each at a single site. The current drug substance production process has already been sufficiently developed to satisfy immediate clinical demands.

We have developed the process for manufacturing rucaparib&#8217;s active pharmaceutical ingredient to a degree sufficient to meet clinical demands and projected commercial requirements. Manufacturing of rucaparib drug substance is being performed at a single CMO. The rucaparib drug product formulation and manufacturing process to produce that formulation have been developed to a degree sufficient to meet clinical demands. Additional development work is being performed to optimize the drug product formulation and manufacturing process to meet projected commercial requirements. A single third-party contract manufacturer capable of both formulation development and drug product manufacturing is currently producing rucaparib drug product. To date, our third-party manufacturers have met our manufacturing requirements. We expect third-party manufacturers to be capable of providing sufficient quantities of our product candidates to meet anticipated full scale commercial demands.

Sales and Marketing 

We have built the commercial infrastructure in the U.S. necessary to effectively support the commercialization of our product candidates, if and when they receive regulatory approval. The commercial infrastructure for oncology products typically consists of a targeted, specialty sales force that calls on a limited and focused group of physicians supported by sales management, internal sales support, an internal marketing group and distribution support. Additional capabilities important to the oncology marketplace include the management of key accounts such as managed care organizations, group-purchasing organizations, specialty pharmacies, oncology group networks and government accounts. To develop the appropriate commercial infrastructure, we have invested significant amounts of financial and management resources, some of which have been committed prior to any confirmation that rociletinib, rucaparib or lucitanib will be approved. We have also begun to establish a commercial presence in the major European markets with the hiring of certain country managers and market access professionals. 

We may also elect in the future to utilize strategic partners, distributors or contract sales forces to assist in the commercialization of our products.
