 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

&#160; 

The Company 

&#160; 

Ingredion Incorporated (&#147;Ingredion&#148;) is a leading global ingredients solutions provider. We turn corn, tapioca, potatoes and other vegetables and fruits into value-added ingredients and biomaterials for the food, beverage, paper and corrugating, brewing and other industries. Ingredion was incorporated as a Delaware corporation in 1997 and its common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange. 

&#160; 

On March 11, 2015, we completed our acquisition of Penford Corporation (&#147;Penford&#148;), a manufacturer of specialty starches that was headquartered in Centennial, Colorado. The total purchase consideration for Penford was $332 million, which included the extinguishment of $93 million in debt in conjunction with the acquisition. The acquisition of Penford provides us with, among other things, an expanded specialty ingredient product portfolio consisting of potato starch-based offerings. Penford had net sales of $444 million for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2014 and operated six manufacturing facilities in the United States, all of which manufacture specialty starches.

&#160; 

On August 3, 2015, we completed our acquisition of Kerr Concentrates, Inc. (&#147;Kerr&#148;), a privately-held producer of natural fruit and vegetable concentrates for approximately $102 million in cash. Kerr serves major food and beverage companies, flavor houses and ingredient producers from its manufacturing locations in Oregon and California. The acquisition of Kerr provides us with the opportunity to expand our product portfolio. 

&#160; 

We are principally engaged in the production and sale of starches and sweeteners for a wide range of industries, and are managed geographically on a regional basis. Our operations are classified into four reportable business segments: North America, South America, Asia Pacific and Europe, Middle East and Africa (&#147;EMEA&#148;). Our North America segment includes businesses in the United States, Canada and Mexico. Our South America segment includes businesses in Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador and the Southern Cone of South America, which includes Argentina, Chile, Peru and Uruguay. Our Asia Pacific segment includes businesses in South Korea, Thailand, Malaysia, China, Japan, Indonesia, the Philippines, Singapore, India, Australia and New Zealand. Our EMEA segment includes businesses in the United Kingdom, Germany, South Africa, Pakistan and Kenya. 

&#160; 

For purposes of this report, unless the context otherwise requires, all references herein to the &#147;Company,&#148; &#147;Ingredion,&#148; &#147;we,&#148; &#147;us,&#148; and &#147;our&#148; shall mean Ingredion Incorporated and its subsidiaries. 

&#160; 

Ingredion supplies a broad range of customers in many diverse industries around the world, including the food, beverage, paper and corrugating, brewing, pharmaceutical, textile and personal care industries, as well as the global animal feed and corn oil markets. 

&#160; 

Our product line includes starches and sweeteners, animal feed products and edible corn oil. Our starch-based products include both food-grade and industrial starches, and biomaterials. Our sweetener products include glucose syrups, high maltose syrups, high fructose corn syrup (&#147;HFCS&#148;), caramel color, dextrose, polyols, maltodextrins and glucose and syrup solids. 

&#160; 

Our products are derived primarily from the processing of corn and other starch-based materials, such as tapioca, potato and rice. 

&#160; 

Our manufacturing process is based on a capital-intensive, two-step process that involves the wet milling and processing of starch-based materials, primarily corn. During the front-end process, corn is steeped in a water-based solution and separated into starch and co-products such as animal feed and corn oil. The starch is then either dried for sale or further processed to make sweeteners, starches and other ingredients that serve the particular needs of various industries. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

We believe our approach to production and service, which focuses on local management and production improvements of our worldwide operations, provides us with a unique understanding of the cultures and product requirements in each of the geographic markets in which we operate, bringing added value to our customers through innovative solutions. At the same time, we believe that our corporate functions allow us to identify synergies and maximize the benefits of our global presence. 

&#160; 

Our consolidated net sales were $5.62 billion in 2015. Approximately 60 percent of our 2015 net sales were provided from our North American operations. Our South American operations provided 18 percent of net sales, while our Asia Pacific and EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa) operations contributed approximately 13 percent and 9 percent, respectively. 

&#160; 

Products 

&#160; 

Sweetener Products. Our sweetener products represented approximately 40 percent, 39 percent and 42 percent of our net sales for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

&#160; 

Glucose Syrups : Glucose syrups are fundamental ingredients widely used in food products, such as baked goods, snack foods, beverages, canned fruits, condiments, candy and other sweets, dairy products, ice cream, jams and jellies, prepared mixes and table syrups. Glucose syrups offer functionality in addition to sweetness to processed foods. They add body and viscosity; help control freezing points, crystallization and browning; add humectancy (ability to add moisture) and flavor; and act as binders.

&#160; 

High Maltose Syrup : This special type of glucose syrup is primarily used as a fermentable sugar in brewing beers. High maltose syrups are also used in the production of confections, canning and some other food processing applications. Our high maltose syrups speed the fermentation process, allowing brewers to increase capacity without adding capital.

&#160; 

High Fructose Corn Syrup : High fructose corn syrup is used in a variety of consumer products including soft drinks, fruit-flavored beverages, baked goods, dairy products, confections and other food and beverage products. In addition to sweetness and ease of use, high fructose corn syrup provides body; humectancy; and aids in browning, freezing point and crystallization control.

&#160; 

Dextrose : Dextrose has a wide range of applications in the food and confection industries, in solutions for intravenous and other pharmaceutical applications, and numerous industrial applications like wallboard, biodegradable surface agents and moisture control agents. Dextrose functionality in foods, beverages and confectionary includes sweetness control; body and viscosity; acting as a bulking, drying and anti-caking agent; serving as a carrier; providing freezing point and crystallization control; and aiding in fermentation. Dextrose is also a fermentation agent in the production of light beer. In pharmaceutical applications dextrose is used in IV solutions as well as an excipient suitable for direct compression in tableting.

&#160; 

Polyols : These products are sugar-free, reduced calorie sweeteners primarily derived from starch or sugar for the food, beverage, confectionery, industrial, personal and oral care, and nutritional supplement markets. In addition to sweetness, polyols inhibit crystallization; provide binding, humectancy and plasticity; add texture; extend shelf life; prevent moisture migration; and are an excipient suitable for tableting.

&#160; 

Maltodextrins and Glucose Syrup Solids : These products have a multitude of food applications, including formulations where liquid syrups cannot be used. Maltodextrins are resistant to browning, provide excellent solubility, have a low hydroscopicity (do not retain moisture), and are ideal for their carrier/bulking properties. Glucose syrup solids have a bland flavor, remain clear in solution, are easy to handle and provide bulking properties.

&#160; 

Starch Products. Our starch products represented approximately 44 percent, 43 percent and 41 percent of our

&#160; 

&#160; 

net sales for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Starches are an important component in a wide range of processed foods, where they are used for adhesion, clouding, dusting, expansion, fat replacement, freshness, gelling, glazing, mouth feel, stabilization and texture. Cornstarch is sold to cornstarch packers for sale to consumers. Starches are also used in paper production to create a smooth surface for printed communications and to improve strength in recycled papers. Specialty starches are used for enhanced drainage, fiber retention, oil and grease resistance, improved printability and biochemical oxygen demand control. In the corrugating industry, starches and specialty starches are used to produce high quality adhesives for the production of shipping containers, display board and other corrugated applications. The textile industry uses starches and specialty starches for sizing (abrasion resistance) to provide size and finishes for manufactured products. Industrial starches are used in the production of construction materials, textiles, adhesives, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics, as well as in mining, water filtration and oil and gas drilling. Specialty starches are used for biomaterial applications including biodegradable plastics, fabric softeners and detergents, hair and skin care applications, dusting powders for surgical gloves and in the production of glass fiber and insulation. 

&#160; 

Specialty Ingredients . We consider certain of our starch and sweetener products to be specialty ingredients. Specialty ingredients comprised approximately 25 percent of our net sales for 2015, up from 24 percent and 21 percent in 2014 and 2013, respectively. Our specialty ingredients are aligned with growing market and consumer trends such as health and wellness, clean-label, affordability, indulgence and sustainability. We plan to drive growth for our specialty ingredients portfolio by leveraging the following six platforms: Wholesome, Texture, Nutrition, Sweetness, Delivery Systems and Biomaterial Solutions.

&#160; 

Wholesome &#151; Clean and simple ingredients that consumers can identify and trust

&#160; 

Nutrition - Nutritional carbohydrates with benefits of digestive health and energy management

&#160; 

Texture - Precise texture solutions that optimize the consumer experience and build back texture

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Delivery Systems &#151; Clean label emulsifiers that add value for customers by protecting and stabilizing expensive ingredients and flavors

&#160; 

Sweetness - Sweetening systems that provide affordable, natural, reduced calorie, and sugar-free solutions

&#160; 

Biomaterial Solutions - Nature-based materials for selected industrial segments and customers that answer demand for sustainable, non-synthetic ingredients

&#160; 

Wholesome: Clean and simple specialty ingredients that consumers can identify and trust. Products include Novation clean label functional starches, value added pulse-based ingredients and Gluten Free offerings. Texture: Specialty ingredients that provide precise food texture solutions designed to optimize the consumer experience and build back texture. Include starch systems that replace more expensive ingredients and are designed to optimize customer formulation costs, texturizers that are designed to create rich, creamy mouth feel, and products that enhance texture in healthier offerings. Nutrition : Specialty ingredients that provide nutritional carbohydrates with benefits of digestive health and energy management. Our fibers and complimentary nutritional ingredients address the leading health and wellness concerns of consumers, including digestive health, infant nutrition, weight and energy management, aging and immunity. Sweetness: Specialty ingredients that provide affordable, natural, reduced calorie and sugar-free solutions for our customers. We have a broad portfolio of nutritive and non-nutritive sweeteners, including high potency sweeteners and our naturally based stevia sweetener. Delivery Systems: Clean label emulsifiers that are designed to add value for customers by protecting and stabilizing expensive ingredients and flavors. Products include starches to help emulsify or mix natural colors in beverages and specialty starches that encapsulate and protect flavors and vitamins in pharmaceuticals and spray-dried food ingredients. Biomaterial Solutions: Nature-based materials that help manufacturers become more sustainable by replacing synthetic materials with nature-based ingredients in personal care, home care and other industrial segments.

&#160; 

Each growth platform addresses multiple consumer trends. For instance, specialty texture solutions are leveraged to address consumer health and wellness, affordability and indulgence demands while wholesome solutions can address clean-label, indulgence and health and wellness consumer demands. Specialty ingredients that provide nutrition solutions for health and wellness can also address food indulgence and convenience desires of consumers. Specialty ingredients that provide sweetness solutions for health and wellness demands can also deliver affordability and food indulgence solutions. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Co-Products and others. Co-products and others accounted for 16 percent, 18 percent and 17 percent of our net sales for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Refined corn oil (from germ) is sold to packers of cooking oil and to producers of margarine, salad dressings, shortening, mayonnaise and other foods. Corn gluten feed is sold as animal feed. Corn gluten meal is sold as high-protein feed for chickens, pet food and aquaculture.

&#160; 

Geographic Scope and Operations 

&#160; 

We are principally engaged in the production and sale of sweeteners and starches for a wide range of industries, and we manage our business on a geographic regional basis. Our operations are classified into four reportable business segments: North America, South America, Asia Pacific and EMEA. In 2015, approximately 60 percent of our net sales were derived from operations in North America, while net sales from operations in South America represented 18 percent. Net sales from operations in Asia Pacific and EMEA represented approximately 13 percent and 9 percent, respectively, of our 2015 net sales. See Note 13 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements entitled &#147;Segment Information&#148; for additional financial information with respect to our reportable business segments. 

&#160; 

In general, demand for our products is balanced throughout the year. However, demand for sweeteners in South America is greater in the first and fourth quarters (its summer season) while demand for sweeteners in North America is greater in the second and third quarters. Due to the offsetting impact of these demand trends, we do not experience material seasonal fluctuations in our net sales. 

&#160; 

Our North America segment consists of operations in the US, Canada and Mexico. The region&#146;s facilities include 20 plants producing a wide range of sweeteners, starches and fruit and vegetable concentrates. 

&#160; 

We are the largest manufacturer of corn-based starches and sweeteners in South America, with sales in Brazil, Colombia and Ecuador and the Southern Cone of South America, which includes Argentina, Chile, Peru and Uruguay. Our South America segment includes 11 plants that produce regular, modified, waxy and tapioca starches, high fructose and high maltose syrups and syrup solids, dextrins and maltodextrins, dextrose, specialty starches, caramel color, sorbitol and vegetable adhesives. 

&#160; 

Our Asia Pacific segment manufactures corn-based products in South Korea, Australia and China. Also, we manufacture tapioca-based products in Thailand, which supplies not only our Asia Pacific segment but the rest of our global network. The region&#146;s facilities include 7 plants that produce modified, specialty, regular, waxy and tapioca starches, dextrins, glucose, high maltose syrup, dextrose, HFCS and caramel color. 

&#160; 

Our EMEA segment includes 5 plants that produce modified and specialty starches, glucose and dextrose in England, Germany and Pakistan. 

&#160; 

Additionally, we utilize a network of tolling manufacturers in various regions in the production cycle of certain specialty starches. In general, these tolling manufacturers produce certain basic starches for us, and we in turn complete the manufacturing process of the specialty starches through our finishing channels. 

&#160; 

We utilize our global network of manufacturing facilities to support key global product lines. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

The starch and sweetener industry is highly competitive. Many of our products are viewed as basic ingredients that compete with virtually identical products and derivatives manufactured by other companies in the industry. The US is a highly competitive market where there are other starch processors, several of which are divisions of larger enterprises. Some of these competitors, unlike us, have vertically integrated their starch processing and other operations. Competitors include ADM Corn Processing Division (&#147;ADM&#148;) (a division of Archer-Daniels-Midland Company), Cargill, Inc., Tate &#38; Lyle Ingredients Americas, Inc., and several others. Our operations in Mexico and Canada face competition from US imports and local producers including ALMEX, a Mexican joint venture between ADM and Tate &#38; Lyle Ingredients Americas, Inc. In South America, Cargill has starch processing operations in Brazil and Argentina. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Many smaller local corn and tapioca refiners also operate in many of our markets. Competition within our markets is largely based on price, quality and product availability. 

&#160; 

Several of our products also compete with products made from raw materials other than corn. HFCS and monohydrate dextrose compete principally with cane and beet sugar products. Co-products such as corn oil and gluten meal compete with products of the corn dry milling industry and with soybean oil, soybean meal and other products. Fluctuations in prices of these competing products may affect prices of, and profits derived from, our products. 

&#160; 

Customers 

&#160; 

We supply a broad range of customers in over 60 industries worldwide. &#160; The following table provides the percentage of total net sales by industry for each of our segments for 2015:

&#160; 

Raw Materials 

&#160; 

Corn (primarily yellow dent) is the primary basic raw material we use to produce starches and sweeteners. The supply of corn in the United States has been, and is anticipated to continue to be, adequate for our domestic needs. The price of corn, which is determined by reference to prices on the Chicago Board of Trade, fluctuates as a result of various factors including: farmers&#146; planting decisions, climate, and government policies (including those related to the production of ethanol), livestock feeding, shortages or surpluses of world grain supplies, and domestic and foreign government policies and trade agreements. We use starch from potato processors as the primary raw material to manufacture ingredients derived from potato-based starches. We also use tapioca, rice and sugar as raw material. 

&#160; 

Corn is also grown in other areas of the world, including Canada, Mexico, Europe, South Africa, Argentina, Australia, Brazil, China and Pakistan. Our affiliates outside the United States utilize both local supplies of corn and corn imported from other geographic areas, including the United States. The supply of corn for these affiliates is also generally expected to be adequate for our needs. Corn prices for our non-US affiliates generally fluctuate as a result of the same factors that affect US corn prices. 

&#160; 

We also utilize specialty grains such as waxy and high amylose corn in our operations. In general, the planning cycle for our specialty grain sourcing begins three years in advance of the anticipated delivery of the specialty corn since the necessary seed must be grown in the season prior to grain contracting. In order to secure these specialty grains at the time of our anticipated needs, we contract with certain farmers to grow the specialty corn approximately two years in advance of delivery. These specialty grains are higher cost due to their more limited supply and require longer planning cycles to mitigate the risk of supply shortages. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Due to the competitive nature of our industry and the availability of substitute products not produced from corn, such as sugar from cane or beets, end product prices may not necessarily fluctuate in a manner that correlates to raw material costs of corn. 

&#160; 

We follow a policy of hedging our exposure to commodity fluctuations with commodities futures and options contracts primarily for certain of our North American corn purchases. We use derivative hedging contracts to protect the gross margin of our firm-priced business in North America. Other business may or may not be hedged at any given time based on management&#146;s judgment as to the need to fix the costs of our raw materials to protect our profitability. Outside of North America, we generally enter into short-term commercial sales contracts and adjust our selling prices based upon the local raw material costs. See Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, in the section entitled &#147;Commodity Costs&#148; for additional information. 

&#160; 

Research and Development 

&#160; 

We have a global network of more than 350 scientists working in 25 Ingredion Idea Labs&#153; innovation centers with headquarters in Bridgewater, New Jersey. Activities at Bridgewater include plant science and physical, chemical and biochemical modifications to food formulations, food sensory evaluation, as well as development of non-food applications, such as starch-based biopolymers. In 2013, we expanded our Bridgewater facility with the addition of a lab and sensory evaluation space dedicated to our sweeteners portfolio. In addition, we have product application technology centers that direct our product development teams worldwide to create product application solutions to better serve the ingredient needs of our customers. Product development activity is focused on developing product applications for identified customer and market needs. Through this approach, we have developed value-added products for use by customers in various industries. We usually collaborate with customers to develop the desired product application either in the customers&#146; facilities, our technical service laboratories or on a contract basis. These efforts are supported by our marketing, product technology and technology support staff. Research and development expense was approximately $43 million in 2015 and $37 million in both 2014 and 2013. 

&#160; 

Sales and Distribution 

&#160; 

Our salaried sales personnel, who are generally dedicated to customers in a geographic region, sell our products directly to manufacturers and distributors. In addition, we have a staff that provides technical support to our sales personnel on an industry basis. We generally contract with trucking companies to deliver our bulk products to customer destinations. In North America, we generally use trucks to ship to nearby customers. For those customers located considerable distances from our plants, we use either rail or a combination of railcars and trucks to deliver our products. We generally lease railcars for terms of three to ten years. 

&#160; 

Patents, Trademarks and Technical License Agreements 

&#160; 

We own 844 patents and patents pending which relate to a variety of products and processes, and a number of established trademarks under which we market our products. We also have the right to use other patents and trademarks pursuant to patent and trademark licenses. We do not believe that any individual patent or trademark is material to our business. There is no currently pending challenge to the use or registration of any of our significant patents or trademarks that would have a material adverse impact on us or our results of operations if decided against us. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015 we had approximately 11,000 employees, of which approximately 2,400 were located in the United States. Approximately 68 percent of US and 49 percent of our non-US employees are unionized. Additionally, we have approximately 1,000 temporary employees. 

&#160; 

Government Regulation and Environmental Matters 

&#160; 

As a manufacturer and marketer of food items and items for use in the pharmaceutical industry, our operations and the use of many of our products are subject to various federal, state, foreign and local statutes and regulations, 

&#160; 

&#160; 

including the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and the Occupational Safety and Health Act. We and many of our products are also subject to regulation by various government agencies, including the United States Food and Drug Administration. Among other things, applicable regulations prescribe requirements and establish standards for product quality, purity and labeling. Failure to comply with one or more regulatory requirements can result in a variety of sanctions, including monetary fines. No such fines of a material nature were imposed on us in 2015. We may also be required to comply with federal, state, foreign and local laws regulating food handling and storage. We believe these laws and regulations have not negatively affected our competitive position. 

&#160; 

Our operations are also subject to various federal, state, foreign and local laws and regulations with respect to environmental matters, including air and water quality and underground fuel storage tanks, and other regulations intended to protect public health and the environment. We operate industrial boilers that fire natural gas, coal, or biofuels to operate our manufacturing facilities and they are our primary source of greenhouse gas emissions. In Argentina, we are in discussions with local regulators associated with conducting studies of possible environmental remediation programs at our Chacabuco plant. We are unable to predict the outcome of these discussions; however, we do not believe that the ultimate cost of remediation will be material. Based on current laws and regulations and the enforcement and interpretations thereof, we do not expect that the costs of future environmental compliance will be a material expense, although there can be no assurance that we will remain in compliance or that the costs of remaining in compliance will not have a material adverse effect on our future financial condition and results of operations. 

&#160; 

During 2015, we spent approximately $9 million for environmental control and wastewater treatment equipment to be incorporated into existing facilities and in planned construction projects. We currently anticipate that we will spend approximately $8 million and $18 million for environmental facilities and programs in 2016 and 2017, respectively.
