MARKETING &#38; EVENTS GROUP

The Marketing &#38; Events Group, comprised of Global Experience Specialists, Inc. and affiliates (&#8220;GES&#8221;), is a global, full-service provider for live events that produces exhibitions, congresses and conferences, corporate events, consumer events, exhibits, and entertainment experiences.

See &#8220;Item 1A - Risk Factors - The failure of a large client to renew its services contract or the loss of business from exhibition facilities could adversely 

&#160;

impact revenue&#8221; for a discussion of the risks related to the Marketing &#38; Events Group&#8217;s client relationships , which is incorporated herein by reference. 

The Marketing &#38; Events Group is divided into two reportable segments based on geography: The Marketing &#38; Events U.S. Segment (the &#8220;U.S. Segment&#8221;) and the Marketing &#38; Events International Segment (the &#8220;International Segment&#8221;). 

&#160;

&#183; 

The U.S. Segment holds a leading position in the U.S. with full-service operations in every major exhibition market in the U.S., including Las Vegas, Nevada; Chicago, Illinois; Orlando, Florida; New York, New York; and Los Angeles, California. 

&#160;

&#160;

The International Segment holds leading positions in Canada, Europe, and the Middle East. The International Segment has full-service operations at many of the most active and popular destinations and venues, including seven cities in Canada, six cities in the United Kingdom, one city in Germany, two cities in the United Arab Emirates, and two cities in the Netherlands.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Core Services 

&#160;

GES provides official contracting services and products to event organizers and exhibitors during Live Events in both the U.S. Segment and the International Segment. Contracting services and products are provided primarily to Exhibitions and to a lesser degree to Congresses and Conferences, Corporate Events, and Consumer Events. For the U.S. Segment, Core Services accounted for 63 percent of Viad&#8217;s 2015 consolidated revenue, as compared to 66 percent in both 2014 and 2013. For the International Segment, Core Services accounted for 23 percent of Viad&#8217;s 2015 consolidated revenue, as compared to 23 percent and 25 percent in 2014 and 2013, respectively.

Under various agreements with event organizers of Live Events, GES serves as the official services contractor and provides the services and products listed above under &#8220;Services/Products Provided to Event Organizers.&#8221; As the official services contractor, GES is designated as the exclusive provider of certain services to exhibitors participating in a Live Event. This designation provides exhibitors with a single point of contact to facilitate a timely, safe, and efficient move-in and move-out of a Live Event and to facilitate an organized, professional, during-show experience. Whether or not GES is the official services contractor of a Live Event, GES competes with other service providers to sell discretionary services to exhibitors. GES also offers discretionary services, combined with complete event program management, including creative design, strategy, and planning to corporate brand marketers across all Live Events in which they participate. 

&#160;

Event Accommodations 

&#160;

With the acquisition of onPeak LLC and Travel Planners, Inc. (collectively, &#8220;onPeak&#8221;) in October 2014, and Travel Planners, Inc.&#8217;s subsequent merger into onPeak LLC, the U.S. Segment of GES positioned itself as the leading provider of Event Accommodations services in North America. As the distributor of exclusive accommodations services for a Live Event, GES is responsible for researching and recommending local hotels, securing room blocks, marketing reserved room blocks to event attendees and exhibitors, managing attendee and exhibitor reservations, and addressing any accommodations concerns during the show. Event Accommodations offer GES the unique potential to serve multiple Live Event participants through a single integrated service network. Event attendees and exhibitors benefit from GES&#8217; accommodations services by receiving convenient and affordable hotel accommodations. Additionally, event organizers benefit from GES&#8217; management of complex hotel booking administration before, during, and after the event. GES also helps drive revenue per available room for hotels by acting as a direct sales channel to high-value, professional guests. For the U.S. Segment, Event Accommodations accounted for 3 percent of Viad&#8217;s 2015 consolidated revenue, as compared to 1 percent in 2014 and none in 2013. 

&#160;

Audio-Visual

&#160;

In both the U.S. Segment and the International Segment, GES offers a variety of audio-visual (&#8220;AV&#8221;) and digital services for Live Events and corporate brand marketers. GES combines the science of innovative digital solutions with the latest AV technology and superior service to create award-winning attendee engagements. Services provided include digital design and content, media production, content testing, equipment rental, staging, and creative services. With the acquisition of Blitz Communications Group Limited and its affiliates (collectively, &#8220;Blitz&#8221;) in September 2014, GES obtained a prominent position in the United Kingdom AV market and delivery services in continental Europe. For the U.S. Segment, AV accounted for 1 percent of Viad&#8217;s 2015 consolidated revenue, as compared to less than 1 percent in 2014 and none in 2013. For the International Segment, AV accounted for 2 percent of Viad&#8217;s 2015 consolidated revenue, as compared to 1 percent in 2014 and none in 2013.

&#160;

Registration and Data

&#160;

&#160;

In the International Segment, GES provides event registration and data services. GES positioned itself as a leading provider of registration services for a Live Event with the acquisition of N200 Limited and its affiliates (collectively, &#8220;N200&#8221;) in November 2014. As Europe&#8217;s leading software-as-a-service event registration and data intelligence service provider, N200&#8217;s Visit Registration platform is used by 258 clients to stage over 1,100 events across 41 countries. N200 also supports 57,000 exhibitors who use its Connect platform to capture and manage sales leads at events. The N200 acquisition enables GES to expand and cross-sell its service and technology offering globally, reaching new markets, clients, and customers. For the International Segment, registration and data accounted for 1 percent of Viad&#8217;s 2015 consolidated revenue, as compared to less than 1 percent in 2014 and none in 2013.

&#160;

Seasonality and Show Rotation 

For both the U.S. Segment and the International Segment, exhibition and event activity can vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year depending on the frequency and timing of shows, as some shows are not held each year and some may shift between quarters. The U.S. Segment generally reports its highest revenue during the first and second quarters. The International Segment generally reports its highest revenue during the second and fourth quarters. The show rotation metric refers to the net change in revenue from 2014 to 2015 due to show movement between quarters and years. Show rotation refers to shows that occur less frequently than annually, as well as annual shows that shift quarters from one year to the next. See &#8220;Item 1A &#8211; Risk Factors &#8211; Viad&#8217;s businesses are seasonal, which causes results of operations to fluctuate and makes results of operations particularly sensitive to adverse events during peak periods&#8221; and &#8220;Item 1A &#8211; Risk Factors - Show rotation impacts overall profitability and makes comparisons between periods difficult,&#8221; which are incorporated herein by reference.

Competition

For both the U.S. Segment and the International Segment, GES generally competes across all classes of services and all markets in the Live Events industry on the basis of discernible differences, value, quality, price, convenience, and service. GES has a competitive advantage through its worldwide network of resources, experienced personnel, pioneering service programs and offerings, first class execution, proprietary technology platforms, and financial strength. All known U.S. competitors and most international competitors are privately held companies that provide limited public information regarding their operations. The primary competitor for GES within its Core Services is The Freeman Company (a privately held company); however, there is substantial competition from a large number of service providers in the other categories of service offerings. 

Growth Strategy

GES is committed to becoming the preferred global, full-service provider for Live Events, with further reach to Exhibitions, Congresses and Conferences, Corporate Events, and Consumer Events. GES has uniquely combined the art of high-impact creativity, service, and expertise with the science of easy-to-use technology, strategy, and worldwide logistics to help clients gain a greater return at their events and enhance the exhibitor experience.

&#160;

&#183; 

Global Reach. Leverage global capabilities and large customer base to drive continued growth in new services and other Live Events; 

&#160;

&#183; 

Full-Service Provider. Growth of adjacent services to create a unique and integrated offering to deepen client relationships, expand client base, and increase share of total event spend; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

Live Events. Growth of exhibition business and penetration into new events to extend industry leadership and leverage capabilities. 

&#160;

With its strategic acquisitions in 2014, GES made significant progress creating the most comprehen sive suite of services for the Live E vents industry. GES extended its AV services beyond North America with the acquisition of Blitz, positioned itself as a leading e vent registration and data intelligence services provider in Europe with the acquisition of N200, and acquired a leading event accommodations company, onPeak. In 2015, these acquisitions enhanced overall competiveness, facilitated growth in under-penetrate d areas, and formed a basis for a data platform. The Company continues to pursue opportunities to acquire business es with proven products and services that complement, enhance, or expand current businesses or offer growth opportunities.

It is scheduled to reopen in phases from May 2016 through August 2016.

Seasonality

The Travel &#38; Recreation Group experiences peak activity during the summer months. During 2015, 87 percent of the Travel &#38; Recreation Group&#8217;s revenue was earned in the second and third quarters. See &#8220;Item 1A &#8211; Risk Factors &#8211; Viad&#8217;s businesses are seasonal, which causes results of operations to fluctuate and makes results of operations particularly sensitive to adverse events during peak periods,&#8221; which is incorporated herein by reference. 

Competition

The Travel &#38; Recreation Group generally competes on the basis of location, uniqueness of facilities, service, quality, and price. Competition exists both locally and regionally across all four lines of business. The hospitality business has a large number of competitors and competes for leisure travelers (both individual and tour groups) across the United States and Canada. The Travel &#38; Recreation Group has a competitive advantage through its distinctive attractions and the iconic destinations of its assets.

&#160;

Cabins, the Apgar Village Lodge and related land, food and beverage services, and retail operations (collectively, the &#8220; West Glacier Properties &#8221;) in 2014. The Company continues to search for opportunities to acquire high return tourism assets i n iconic natural destinations that enjoy perennial demand , bring meaningful scale and market share , and offer cross-selling advantages with a combination of attractions and hotels.
