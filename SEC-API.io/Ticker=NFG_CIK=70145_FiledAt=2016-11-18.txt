Business 

The Company and its Subsidiaries 

National Fuel Gas Company (the Registrant), incorporated in 1902, is a holding company organized under the laws of the State of New Jersey. Except as otherwise indicated below, the Registrant owns directly or indirectly all of the outstanding securities of its subsidiaries. Reference to &#8220;the Company&#8221; in this report means the Registrant, the Registrant and its subsidiaries or the Registrant&#8217;s subsidiaries as appropriate in the context of the disclosure. Also, all references to a certain year in this report relate to the Company&#8217;s fiscal year ended September 30 of that year unless otherwise noted. 

The Company is a diversified energy company engaged principally in the production, gathering, transportation, distribution and marketing of natural gas. The Company operates an integrated business, with assets centered in western New York and Pennsylvania, being used for, and benefiting from, the production and transportation of natural gas from the Marcellus Shale basin. The common geographic footprint of the Company&#8217;s subsidiaries enables them to share management, labor, facilities and support services across various businesses and pursue coordinated projects designed to produce and transport natural gas from the Marcellus Shale to markets in Canada and the eastern United States. The Company also develops and produces oil reserves, primarily in California. The Company reports financial results for five business segments: Exploration and Production, Pipeline and Storage, Gathering, Utility, and Energy Marketing. 

1. The Exploration and Production segment operations are carried out by Seneca Resources Corporation (Seneca), a Pennsylvania corporation. Seneca is engaged in the exploration for, and the development and production of, natural gas and oil reserves in California and in the Appalachian region of the United States. At September 30, 2016, Seneca had U.S. proved developed and undeveloped reserves of 29,009 Mbbl of oil and 1,674,575 MMcf of natural gas. 

2. The Pipeline and Storage segment operations are carried out by National Fuel Gas Supply Corporation (Supply Corporation), a Pennsylvania corporation, and Empire Pipeline, Inc. (Empire), a New York corporation. Supply Corporation provides interstate natural gas transportation and storage services for affiliated and nonaffiliated companies through (i) an integrated gas pipeline system extending from southwestern Pennsylvania to the New York-Canadian border at the Niagara River and eastward to Ellisburg and Leidy, Pennsylvania, and (ii) 27 underground natural gas storage fields owned and operated by Supply Corporation as well as four other underground natural gas storage fields owned and operated jointly with other interstate gas pipeline companies. Empire, an interstate pipeline company, transports natural gas for Distribution Corporation and for other utilities, large industrial customers and power producers in New York State. Empire owns the Empire Pipeline, a 249-mile pipeline system comprising three principal components: a 157-mile pipeline that extends from the United States/Canadian border at the Niagara River near Buffalo, New York to near Syracuse, New York; a 77-mile pipeline extension from near Rochester, New York to an interconnection with the unaffiliated Millennium Pipeline near Corning, New York (the Empire Connector), and a 15-mile pipeline extension from Corning into Tioga County, Pennsylvania (the Tioga County Extension). 

3. The Gathering segment operations are carried out by wholly-owned subsidiaries of National Fuel Gas Midstream Corporation (Midstream Corporation), a Pennsylvania corporation. Through these subsidiaries, Midstream Corporation builds, owns and operates natural gas processing and pipeline gathering facilities in the Appalachian region. 

4. The Utility segment operations are carried out by National Fuel Gas Distribution Corporation (Distribution Corporation), a New York corporation. Distribution Corporation sells natural gas or provides natural gas transportation services to approximately 742,235 customers through a local distribution system located in western New York and northwestern Pennsylvania. The principal metropolitan areas served by Distribution Corporation include Buffalo, Niagara Falls and Jamestown, New York and Erie and Sharon, Pennsylvania. 

5. The Energy Marketing segment operations are carried out by National Fuel Resources, Inc. (NFR), a New York corporation, which markets natural gas to industrial, wholesale, commercial, public authority and residential 

- 6 - 

customers primarily in western and central New York and northwestern Pennsylvania, offering competitively priced natural gas for its customers. 

Financial information about each of the Company&#8217;s business segments can be found in Item 7, MD&#38;A and also in Item 8 at Note J &#8212; Business Segment Information. 

The following business is not included in any of the five reported business segments: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

Seneca&#8217;s Northeast Division, which markets timber from Appalachian land holdings. At September 30, 2016, the Company owned approximately 93,000 acres of timber property and managed approximately 3,000 additional acres of timber cutting rights. 

No single customer, or group of customers under common control, accounted for more than 10% of the Company&#8217;s consolidated revenues in 2016. 

Rates and Regulation 

The Utility segment&#8217;s rates, services and other matters are regulated by the NYPSC with respect to services provided within New York and by the PaPUC with respect to services provided within Pennsylvania. For additional discussion of the Utility segment&#8217;s rates and regulation, see Item 7, MD&#38;A under the heading &#8220;Rate and Regulatory Matters&#8221; and Item 8 at Note A &#8212; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Regulatory Mechanisms) and Note C &#8212; Regulatory Matters. 

The Pipeline and Storage segment&#8217;s rates, services and other matters are regulated by the FERC. For additional discussion of the Pipeline and Storage segment&#8217;s rates and regulation, see Item 7, MD&#38;A under the heading &#8220;Rate and Regulatory Matters&#8221; and Item 8 at Note A &#8212; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Regulatory Mechanisms) and Note C &#8212; Regulatory Matters. 

The discussion under Item 8 at Note C &#8212; Regulatory Matters includes a description of the regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Balance Sheets in accordance with applicable accounting standards. To the extent that the criteria set forth in such accounting standards are not met by the operations of the Utility segment or the Pipeline and Storage segment, as the case may be, the related regulatory assets and liabilities would be eliminated from the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Balance Sheets and such accounting treatment would be discontinued. 

In addition, the Company and its subsidiaries are subject to the same federal, state and local regulations on various subjects, including environmental matters, to which other companies doing similar business in the same locations are subject. 

The Exploration and Production Segment 

The Exploration and Production segment incurred a net loss in 2016. This represented 155.6% of the Company's 2016 net loss. 

Additional discussion of the Exploration and Production segment appears below in this Item 1 under the headings &#8220;Sources and Availability of Raw Materials&#8221; and &#8220;Competition: The Exploration and Production Segment,&#8221; in Item 7, MD&#38;A and in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. 

The Pipeline and Storage Segment 

The Pipeline and Storage segment contributed net income in 2016. This net income partially offset the Company's 2016 net loss by 26.3%. 

Supply Corporation&#8217;s firm transportation capacity is subject to change as the market identifies different transportation paths and receipt/delivery point combinations. At the end of fiscal year 2016, Supply Corporation had firm transportation service agreements for approximately 3,207 MDth per day (contracted transportation capacity). The Utility segment accounts for approximately 1,124 MDth per day or 35% of contracted transportation capacity, and the Energy Marketing and Exploration and Production segments represent another 172 MDth per day or 5%. Additionally, Supply Corporation leases 55 MDth per day or 2% of firm transportation capacity to Empire Pipeline. The remaining 1,856 MDth or 58% is subject to firm contracts with nonaffiliated customers. 

- 7 - 

Contracted transportation capacity with both affiliated and unaffiliated shippers is expected to remain relatively constant in fiscal year 2017. 

Supply Corporation had service agreements for all of its firm storage capacity, totaling 68,042 MDth, at the end of 2016. The Utility segment has contracted for 28,491 MDth or 42% of the total firm storage capacity, and the Energy Marketing segment accounts for another 2,644 MDth or 4%. Additionally, Supply Corporation leases 3,753 MDth or 5% of its firm storage capacity to Empire. Nonaffiliated customers have contracted for the remaining 33,154 MDth or 49%. Supply Corporation expects 1% of its contracts for firm storage capacity will expire or terminate and be available for remarketing in fiscal year 2017. 

At the end of 2016, Empire had service agreements in place for firm transportation capacity totaling up to approximately 948 MDth per day, with 98% of that capacity contracted as long-term, full-year deals. The Utility segment accounted for 4% of Empire&#8217;s firm contracted capacity, with the remaining 96% subject to contracts with nonaffiliated customers. None of the long-term contracts will expire or terminate in fiscal year 2017. 

Empire&#8217;s firm storage capacity, totaling 3,753 MDth, was fully contracted at the end of fiscal year 2016. The total storage capacity is contracted on a long-term basis, with a nonaffiliated customer. The contract will not expire or terminate in fiscal year 2017. 

The majority of Supply Corporation&#8217;s transportation and storage contracts, and the majority of Empire&#8217;s transportation contracts, allow either party to terminate the contract upon six or twelve months&#8217; notice effective at the end of the primary term, and include &#8220;evergreen&#8221; language that allows for annual term extension(s).

The Gathering Segment 

The Gathering segment contributed net income in 2016. This net income partially offset the Company's 2016 net loss by 10.5%. 

Additional discussion of the Gathering segment appears below under the headings &#8220;Sources and Availability of Raw Materials&#8221; and &#8220;Competition: The Gathering Segment,&#8221; in Item 7, MD&#38;A and in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. 

The Utility Segment 

The Utility segment contributed net income in 2016. This net income partially offset the Company's 2016 net loss by 17.5%. 

Additional discussion of the Utility segment appears below under the headings &#8220;Sources and Availability of Raw Materials,&#8221; &#8220;Competition: The Utility Segment&#8221; and &#8220;Seasonality,&#8221; in Item 7, MD&#38;A and in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. 

The Energy Marketing Segment 

The Energy Marketing segment contributed net income in 2016. This net income partially offset the Company's 2016 net loss by 1.5%. 

Additional discussion of the Energy Marketing segment appears below under the headings &#8220;Sources and Availability of Raw Materials,&#8221; &#8220;Competition: The Energy Marketing Segment&#8221; and &#8220;Seasonality,&#8221; in Item 7, MD&#38;A and in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. 

All Other Category and Corporate Operations 

The All Other category and Corporate operations incurred a net loss in 2016. This represented 0.2% of the Company's 2016 net loss. 

- 8 - 

Additional discussion of the All Other category and Corporate operations appears below in Item 7, MD&#38;A and in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. 

Sources and Availability of Raw Materials 

The Exploration and Production segment seeks to discover and produce raw materials (natural gas, oil and hydrocarbon liquids) as further described in this report in Item 7, MD&#38;A and Item 8 at Note J &#8212; Business Segment Information and Note M &#8212; Supplementary Information for Oil and Gas Producing Activities. 

The Pipeline and Storage segment transports and stores natural gas owned by its customers, whose gas originates in the southwestern, mid-continent and Appalachian regions of the United States as well as in Canada. Additional discussion of proposed pipeline projects appears below under &#8220;Competition: The Pipeline and Storage Segment&#8221; and in Item 7, MD&#38;A. 

The Gathering segment gathers, processes and transports natural gas that is produced by Seneca in the Appalachian region of the United States. Additional discussion of proposed gathering projects appears below in Item 7, MD&#38;A. 

Natural gas is the principal raw material for the Utility segment. In 2016, the Utility segment purchased 55.8 Bcf of gas for delivery to its customers. Gas purchased from producers and suppliers in the United States under firm contracts (seasonal and longer) accounted for 51% of these purchases. Purchases of gas on the spot market (contracts for one month or less) accounted for 49% of the Utility segment&#8217;s 2016 purchases. Purchases from DTE Energy Trading, Inc. (22%), SWN Energy Services Company, LLC (16%), NextEra Energy Power Marketing, LLC (14%), J. Aron &#38; Company (14%) and South Jersey Resources Group, LLC (12%) accounted for 78% of the Utility&#8217;s 2016 gas purchases. No other producer or supplier provided the Utility segment with more than 9% of its gas requirements in 2016. 

The Energy Marketing segment depends on an adequate supply of natural gas to deliver to its customers. In 2016, this segment purchased 40.4 Bcf of gas, including 39.8 Bcf for delivery to its customers. The remaining 0.6 Bcf largely represents gas used in operations. The gas purchased by the Energy Marketing segment originates primarily in either the Appalachian or mid-continent regions of the United States. 

Competition 

Competition in the natural gas industry exists among providers of natural gas, as well as between natural gas and other sources of energy, such as fuel oil and electricity. Management believes that the environmental advantages of natural gas have enhanced its competitive position relative to other fuels. 

The Company competes on the basis of price, service and reliability, product performance and other factors. Sources and providers of energy, other than those described under this &#8220;Competition&#8221; heading, do not compete with the Company to any significant extent. 

Competition: The Exploration and Production Segment 

The Exploration and Production segment competes with other oil and natural gas producers and marketers with respect to sales of oil and natural gas. The Exploration and Production segment also competes, by competitive bidding and otherwise, with other oil and natural gas producers with respect to exploration and development prospects and mineral leaseholds. 

To compete in this environment, Seneca originates and acts as operator on certain of its prospects, seeks to minimize the risk of exploratory efforts through partnership-type arrangements, utilizes technology for both exploratory studies and drilling operations, and seeks market niches based on size, operating expertise and financial criteria. 

Competition: The Pipeline and Storage Segment 

Supply Corporation competes for market growth in the natural gas market with other pipeline companies transporting gas in the northeast United States and with other companies providing gas storage services. Supply 

- 9 - 

Corporation has some unique characteristics which enhance its competitive position, as described below. Most of Supply Corporation&#8217;s facilities are in or near areas overlying the Marcellus and Utica Shale production areas in Pennsylvania, and it has established interconnections with producers and other pipelines to access these supplies. Its facilities are also located adjacent to the Canadian border at the Niagara River (Niagara) providing access to markets in Canada and, through TransCanada Pipeline, to markets in the northeastern and midwestern United States. Supply Corporation has developed and placed into service a number of pipeline expansion projects to receive natural gas produced from the Marcellus Shale and transport it to key markets within New York and Pennsylvania, the northeastern United States, Canada, and most recently to long-haul pipelines moving gas into the U.S. Midwest and even back to the gulf coast. For further discussion of these projects, refer to Item 7, MD&#38;A under the headings &#8220;Investing Cash Flow&#8221; and &#8220;Rate and Regulatory Matters.&#8221; 

Empire competes for market growth in the natural gas market with other pipeline companies transporting gas in the northeast United States and upstate New York in particular. Empire is well situated to provide transportation of Appalachian-sourced gas as well as gas received at the Niagara River at Chippawa. Empire&#8217;s location provides it the opportunity to compete for an increased share of the gas transportation markets both for delivery to the New York and Northeast markets and from and into Canada. As noted above, the Empire Connector and other projects expanded Empire&#8217;s natural gas pipeline and enables Empire to serve new markets in New York and elsewhere in the Northeast, and to attach to prolific Marcellus and Utica supplies principally from Tioga and Bradford Counties in Pennsylvania. Like Supply Corporation, Empire&#8217;s expanded system facilitates transportation of Marcellus Shale gas to key markets within New York State, the northeastern United States and Canada. 

Competition: The Gathering Segment 

The Gathering segment provides gathering services for Seneca&#8217;s production and competes with other companies that gather and process natural gas in the Appalachian region. 

Competition: The Utility Segment 

With respect to gas commodity service, in New York and Pennsylvania, both of which have implemented &#8220;unbundling&#8221; policies that allow customers to choose their gas commodity supplier, Distribution Corporation has retained a substantial majority of small sales customers. In New York, approximately 21%, and in Pennsylvania, approximately 14%, of Distribution Corporation&#8217;s small-volume residential and commercial customers purchase their supplies from unregulated marketers. In contrast, almost all large-volume load is served by unregulated retail marketers. However, retail competition for gas commodity service does not pose an acute competitive threat for Distribution Corporation, because in both jurisdictions, utility cost of service is recovered through rates and charges for gas delivery service, not gas commodity service. Over the longer run, it is possible that rate design changes resulting from further customer migration to marketer service could expose utility companies such as Distribution Corporation to stranded costs and revenue erosion in the absence of compensating rate relief. 

Competition for transportation service to large-volume customers continues with local producers or pipeline companies attempting to sell or transport gas directly to end-users located within the Utility segment&#8217;s service territories without use of the utility&#8217;s facilities (i.e., bypass). In addition, competition continues with fuel oil suppliers. 

The Utility segment competes in its most vulnerable markets (the large commercial and industrial markets) by offering unbundled, flexible, high quality services. The Utility segment continues to develop or promote new uses of natural gas as well as new services, rates and contracts. 

Competition: The Energy Marketing Segment 

The Energy Marketing segment competes with other marketers of natural gas and with other providers of energy supply. Competition in this area is well developed with regard to price and services from local, regional and national marketers.

Seasonality 

Variations in weather conditions can materially affect the volume of natural gas delivered by the Utility segment, as virtually all of its residential and commercial customers use natural gas for space heating. The effect that this has on Utility segment margins in New York is mitigated by a WNC, which covers the eight-month period from October through May. Weather that is warmer than normal results in an upward adjustment to customers&#8217; current bills, while weather that is colder than normal results in a downward adjustment, so that in either case projected operating costs calculated at normal temperatures will be recovered. 

Volumes transported and stored by Supply Corporation and volumes transported by Empire may vary materially depending on weather, without materially affecting the revenues of those companies. Supply Corporation&#8217;s and Empire&#8217;s allowed rates are based on a straight fixed-variable rate design which allows recovery of fixed costs in fixed monthly reservation charges. Variable charges based on volumes are designed to recover only the variable costs associated with actual transportation or storage of gas. 

Variations in weather conditions materially affect the volume of gas consumed by customers of the Energy Marketing segment. Volume variations have a corresponding impact on revenues within this segment. 

Capital Expenditures 

A discussion of capital expenditures by business segment is included in Item 7, MD&#38;A under the heading &#8220;Investing Cash Flow.&#8221; 

Environmental Matters 

A discussion of material environmental matters involving the Company is included in Item 7, MD&#38;A under the heading &#8220;Environmental Matters&#8221; and in Item 8, Note I &#8212; Commitments and Contingencies. 

Miscellaneous 

The Company and its wholly owned or majority-owned subsidiaries had a total of 2,080 full-time employees at September 30, 2016. 

The Company has agreements in place with collective bargaining units in New York and Pennsylvania. Agreements covering employees in collective bargaining units in New York are scheduled to expire in February 2017. One of the New York collective bargaining units approved a new agreement that will take effect in February 2017 and expire in February 2021. The Company is in ongoing settlement discussions with the other New York collective bargaining unit with respect to a new agreement. Agreements covering employees in collective bargaining units in Pennsylvania are scheduled to expire in April 2018 and May 2018. 

The Utility segment has numerous municipal franchises under which it uses public roads and certain other rights-of-way and public property for the location of facilities. When necessary, the Utility segment renews such franchises. 

The Company makes its annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and any amendments to those reports, available free of charge on the Company&#8217;s internet website, www.nationalfuelgas.com, as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC. The information available at the Company&#8217;s internet website is not part of this Form 10-K or any other report filed with or furnished to the SEC.
