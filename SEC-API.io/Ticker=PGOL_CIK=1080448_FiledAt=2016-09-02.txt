 Item 1. Description of Business 

&#160;

We are engaged in natural resource exploration and anticipate acquiring, exploring, and developing natural resource properties. Currently we are undertaking programs in Arizona and Nevada.

&#160;

Development of Business 

&#160;

We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on November 30, 1998. The Company was originally organized to engage in the business of breeding, raising and marketing meat and by-products to the wholesale and retail markets, and operated from November 30, 1998 through approximately May 31, 2000 when it ceased all operations due to lack of capital.

&#160;

In June, 2003, the Company filed Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada changing its name to Patriot Gold Corp. and moving the Company into its current business of natural resource exploration and mining. On June 17, 2003, the Company adopted a new trading symbol - PGOL- to reflect the name change. The Company has been in the resource exploration and mining business since June, 2003.

&#160;

On April 16, 2010, we caused the incorporation of our wholly owned subsidiary, Provex Resources Inc. (&#8220;Provex&#8221;) under the laws of Nevada.

&#160;

On April 16, 2010, the Company entered into an Assignment Agreement with Provex to assign the exclusive option to an undivided right, title and interest in the Bruner and Vernal properties and the Bruner Expansion property to Provex. Pursuant to the Assignment Agreements, Provex assumed the rights, and agreed to perform all of the duties and obligations, of the Company arising under the Bruner and Vernal Property Option Agreement and the Bruner Property Expansion Option Agreement. Provex&#8217;s only assets are the aforementioned agreements and it does not have any liabilities.

&#160;

On May 28, 2010, Provex entered into an exclusive right and option agreement with Canamex Resources Corp. (&#8220;Canamex&#8221;) whereby Canamex could earn up to 75% in the Bruner and the Bruner Property Expansion. Canamex agreed to spend an aggregate total of US $6 million on exploration and related expenditures over the ensuing seven years whereupon Provex agreed to grant the right and option to earn a vested seventy percent (70%) and an additional five percent (5%) upon delivery of a bankable feasibility study.

&#160;

On February 28, 2011, the Company entered into an Exploration and Option to Enter Joint Venture Agreement with Idaho State Gold Company, LLC, (&#8220;ISGC&#8221;) whereby the Company granted the option and right to earn a vested seventy percent (70%) interest in the property and the right and option to form a joint venture for the management and ownership of the property called the Moss Mine Property, Mohave County, Arizona (the &#34;Moss Property&#34; or &#34;Moss Mine Property&#34;). Upon execution of the agreement ISGC paid the Company $500,000 USD and agreed to spend an aggregate total of $8,000,000 USD on exploration and related expenditures over the ensuing five years. Subsequent to exercise of the earn-in, ISGC and the Company agreed to form a 70/30 joint venture.

&#160;

In March, 2011, ISGC transferred its rights to the Exploration and Option to Enter Joint Venture Agreement dated February 28, 2011, to Northern Vertex Capital Inc. (&#8220;Northern Vertex&#8221;).

&#160;

On May 12, 2016, the Company entered into a material definitive Agreement for Purchase and Sale of Mining Claims and Escrow Instructions (the &#8220;Purchase and Sale Agreement&#8221;) with Golden Vertex Corp., an Arizona corporation (&#8220;Golden Vertex,&#8221; a wholly-owned Subsidiary of Northern Vertex) whereby Golden Vertex agreed to purchase the Company&#8217;s remaining 30% working interest in the Moss Gold/Silver Mine for C$1,500,000 (the &#8220;Purchase Price&#8221;) plus the retention by Patriot of a 3% net smelter returns royalty. Specifically, the Company conveyed all of its right, title and interest in those certain patented and unpatented lode mining claims situated in the Oatman Mining District, Mohave County, Arizona (the &#8220;Claims&#8221;) together with all extralateral and other associated rights, water rights, tenements, hereditaments and appurtenances belonging or appertaining thereto, and all rights-of-way, easements, rights of access and ingress to and egress from the Claims appurtenant thereto and in which Seller had any interest (collectively, the &#8220;Property&#8221;). The Purchase Price consisted of C$1,200,000 in cash payable at closing and the remaining C$300,000 was paid by the issuance of Northern Vertex common shares to the Company valued at $0.35 (857,140 shares), issued pursuant to the terms and provisions of an investment agreement (the &#8220;Investment Agreement&#8221;) entered between the Company and Northern Vertex contemporaneous to the Purchase and Sale Agreement. The Investment Agreement prohibits the resale of the shares during the four month period following the date of issuance and thereafter, the Company will not sell the shares in an amount exceeding 100,000 shares per month.

Business Operations 

&#160;

We are a natural resource exploration and mining company with an objective of acquiring, exploring, and developing natural resource properties. Our primary focus in the natural resource sector is gold.

&#160;

The search for valuable natural resources as a business is extremely risky. We can provide investors with no assurance that the properties we have either optioned or purchased in Nevada and Arizona contain commercially exploitable reserves. Exploration for mineral reserves is a speculative venture involving substantial risk. Few properties that are explored are ultimately developed into producing commercially feasible reserves. Problems such as unusual or unexpected formations and other conditions are involved in mineral exploration and often result in unsuccessful exploration efforts. In such a case, we would be unable to complete our business plan and any money spent on exploration would be lost.

&#160;

Natural resource exploration and development requires significant capital and our assets and resources are limited. Therefore, we anticipate participating in the natural resource industry through the selling or partnering of our properties, the purchase of small interests in producing properties, the purchase of properties where feasibility studies already exist or by the optioning of natural resource exploration and development projects. To date, we have three (3) gold projects located in the southwest United States. In May 2016, we sold our interest in the Moss Mine project, leaving our project inventory to consist of the Bruner project, the Vernal project, and the Windy Peak project. Our Bruner Property is now jointly owned with Canamex which has earned 70% of the project having now fulfilled the terms of its option agreement with us; the project is still in the exploration and development stage, and further technical work will be required before final evaluation of the economic and legal feasibility of the projects can be determined. We have neither drilled nor developed exploration plans for our Vernal and recently acquired Windy Peak Property interests.

&#160;

Financing 

&#160;

There was $552,008 of financing activities undertaken by the Company during the fiscal year ended May 31, 2016 through the issuance of common stock and warrants, and checks written in excess of cash. Management estimates that the Company will require approximately $350,000 to fund the Company&#8217;s planned operations for the next twelve months. Therefore, management believes current cash on hand is not sufficient to fund planned operations for 2017 after payment of outstanding checks written in-excess of cash and accounts payable outstanding at May 31, 2016. Our policy is to pay all operational expenses when due, provided that the vendor, in the normal course of business, has satisfied all necessary conditions for payment. Management plans to seek the additional capital through private placements and public offerings of its common stock but there can be no assurance that management would be successful in its attempt to raise the additional funds.

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

The mineral exploration industry, in general, is intensely competitive and even if commercial quantities of ore are discovered, a ready market may not exist for sale of same. Numerous factors beyond our control may affect the marketability of any substances discovered. These factors include market fluctuations, the proximity and capacity of natural resource markets and processing equipment, government regulations, including regulations relating to prices, taxes, royalties, land tenure, land use, importing and exporting of minerals and environmental protection. The exact effect of these factors cannot be accurately predicted, but the combination of these factors may result in our not receiving an adequate return on invested capital.

&#160;

Compliance with Government Regulation and Regulatory Matters 

&#160;

Mining Control and Reclamation Regulations 

&#160;

The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (&#34;SMCRA&#34;) is administered by the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (&#34;OSM&#34;) and establishes mining, environmental protection and reclamation standards for all aspects of U.S. surface mining, as well as many aspects of underground mining. Mine operators must obtain SMCRA permits and permit renewals for mining operations from the OSM. Although state regulatory agencies have adopted federal mining programs under SMCRA, the state becomes the regulatory authority. States in which we expect to have active future mining operations have achieved primary control of enforcement through federal authorization.

&#160;

SMCRA permit provisions include requirements for prospecting including mine plan development, topsoil removal, storage and replacement, selective handling of overburden materials, mine pit backfilling and grading, protection of the hydrologic balance, subsidence control for underground mines, surface drainage control, mine drainage and mine discharge control and treatment and re-vegetation.

&#160;

&#160; 7 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

The U.S. mining permit application process is initiated by collecting baseline data to adequately characterize the pre-mining environmental condition of the permit area. We will develop mine and reclamation plans by utilizing this geologic data and incorporating elements of the environmental data. Our mine and reclamation plans incorporate the provisions of SMCRA, state programs and complementary environmental programs which impact mining. Also included in the permit application are documents defining ownership and agreements pertaining to minerals, oil and gas, water rights, rights of way and surface land and documents required of the OSM&#8217;s Applicant Violator System, including the mining and compliance history of officers, directors and principal stockholders of the applicant.

&#160;

Once a permit application is prepared and submitted to the regulatory agency, it goes through a completeness and technical review. Public notice of the proposed permit is given for a comment period before a permit can be issued. Some SMCRA mine permit applications take over a year to prepare, depending on the size and complexity of the mine and often take six months to two years to be issued. Regulatory authorities have considerable discretion in the timing of the permit issuance and the public has the right to comment on, and otherwise engage in, the permitting process including public hearings and intervention by the courts.

&#160;

Surface Disturbance 

&#160;

All mining activities governed by the Bureau of Land Management (&#34;BLM&#34;) require reasonable reclamation. The lowest level of mining activity, &#8220;casual use,&#8221; is designed for the miner or weekend prospector who creates only negligible surface disturbance (for example, activities that do not involve the use of earth-moving equipment or explosives may be considered casual use). These activities would not require either a notice of intent to operate or a plan of operation. For further information regarding surface management terms, please refer to 43 CFR Chapter II Subchapter C, Subpart 3809.

&#160;

The second level of activity, where surface disturbance is 5 acres or less per year, requires a notice advising the BLM of the anticipated work 15 days prior to commencement. This notice must be filed with the appropriate field office . No approval is needed although bonding is required. State agencies must be notified to ensure all requirements are met.

&#160;

For operations involving more than 5 acres total surface disturbance on lands subject to 43 CFR 3809, a detailed plan of operation must be filed with the appropriate BLM field office . Bonding is required to ensure proper reclamation. An Environmental Assessment (EA) is to be prepared for all plans of operation to determine if an Environmental Impact Statement is required. A National Environmental Policy Act review is not required for casual use or notice level operations unless those operations involve occupancy as defined by 43 CFR 3715. Most occupancies at the casual use and notice level in Arizona are covered by a programmatic EA.

&#160;

An activity permit is required when use of equipment is utilized for the purpose of land stripping, earthmoving, blasting (except blasting associated with an individual source permit issued for mining), trenching or road construction.

&#160;

Future legislation and regulations are expected to become increasingly restrictive and there may be more rigorous enforcement of existing and future laws and regulations and we may experience substantial increases in equipment and operating costs and may experience delays, interruptions or termination of operations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal fines or penalties, the acceleration of cleanup and site restoration costs, the issuance of injunctions to limit or cease operations and the suspension or revocation of permits and other enforcement measures that could have the effect of limiting production from our future operations.

&#160;

Trespassing 

&#160;

The BLM will prevent abuse of public lands while recognizing valid rights and uses under the mining laws. The BLM will take appropriate action to eliminate invalid uses, including unauthorized residential occupancy. The Interior Board of Land Appeals (IBLA) has found that a claim may be declared void by the BLM when it has been located and held for purposes other than the mining of minerals. The issuance of a notice of trespass may occur if an unpatented claim/site is:

&#160;

&#160; (1) used for a home site, place of business, or for other purposes not reasonably related to mining or milling activities; &#160;

&#160; (2) used for the mining and sale of leasable minerals or mineral materials, such as sand, gravel and certain types of building stone; or &#160;

&#160; (3) located on lands that for any reason have been withdrawn from location after the effective date of the withdrawal. &#160;

Trespass actions are taken by the BLM Field Office.

&#160;

Environmental Laws 

&#160;

We may become subject to various federal and state environmental laws and regulations that will impose significant requirements on our operations. The cost of complying with current and future environmental laws and regulations and our liabilities arising from past or future releases of, or exposure to, hazardous substances, may adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. In addition, environmental laws and regulations, particularly relating to air emissions, can reduce our profitability. Numerous federal and state governmental permits and approvals are required for mining operations. When we apply for these permits or approvals, we may be required to prepare and present to federal or state authorities data pertaining to the effect or impact that a proposed exploration for, or production or processing of, may have on the environment. Compliance with these requirements can be costly and time-consuming and can delay exploration or production operations. A failure to obtain or comply with permits could result in significant fines and penalties and could adversely affect the issuance of other permits for which we may apply.

&#160;

Clean Water Act 

&#160;

The U.S. Clean Water Act and corresponding state and local laws and regulations affect mining operations by restricting the discharge of pollutants, including dredged or fill materials, into waters of the United States. The Clean Water Act provisions and associated state and federal regulations are complex and subject to amendments, legal challenges and changes in implementation. As a result of court decisions and regulatory actions, permitting requirements have increased and could continue to increase the cost and time we expend on compliance with water pollution regulations. These and other regulatory requirements, which have the potential to change due to legal challenges, Congressional actions and other developments increase the cost of, or could even prohibit, certain current or future mining operations. Our operations may not always be able to remain in full compliance with all Clean Water Act obligations and permit requirements. As a result, we may be subject to compliance orders and private party litigation seeking fines, penalties or changes to our operations.

&#160;

Clean Water Act requirements that may affect our operations include the following:

&#160;

Section 404 

&#160;

Section 404 of the Clean Water Act requires mining companies to obtain U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (&#8220;ACOE&#8221;) permits to place material in streams for the purpose of creating slurry ponds, water impoundments, refuse areas, valley fills or other mining activities.

&#160;

Our construction and mining activities, including our surface mining operations, will frequently require Section 404 permits. ACOE issues two types of permits pursuant to Section 404 of the Clean Water Act: nationwide (or &#8220;general&#8221;) and &#8220;individual&#8221; permits. Nationwide permits are issued to streamline the permitting process for dredging and filling activities that have minimal adverse environmental impacts. An individual permit typically requires a more comprehensive application process, including public notice and comment; however, an individual permit can be issued for ten years (and may be extended thereafter upon application).

&#160;

The issuance of permits to construct valley fills and refuse impoundments under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, whether general permits commonly described as the Nationwide Permit 21 (NWP 21) or individual permits, has been the subject of many recent court cases and increased regulatory oversight. The results may materially increase our permitting and operating costs, permitting delays, suspension of current operations and/or prevention of opening new mines.

&#160;

Employees 

&#160;

Currently, we have no full time employees. Our officers and directors provide planning and organizational services for us on a part-time basis. All field work is tendered out and completed by service providers and/or exploration partners.

&#160;

Subsidiaries 

&#160;

On April 16, 2010, we caused the incorporation of our wholly owned subsidiary, Provex Resources, Inc., under the laws of Nevada. On April 16, 2010, the Company entered into an Assignment Agreement to assign the exclusive option to an undivided right, title and interest in the Bruner and Vernal property; and the Bruner Property Expansion to Provex. Pursuant to the Assignment Agreement, Provex assumed the rights, and agreed to perform all of the duties and obligations, of the Company arising under the Bruner and Vernal Property Option Agreement; and the Bruner Property Expansion Option Agreement. Provex&#8217;s only assets are the aforementioned agreements and it does not have any liabilities.

&#160;

On May 28, 2010, Provex Resources, Inc. entered into an exclusive right and option agreement with Canamex Resources Corp. (&#8220;Canamex&#8221;) whereby Canamex could earn up to a 75% undivided interest in the Bruner and the Bruner Property Expansion. Canamex agreed to spend an aggregate total of US $6 million on exploration and related expenditures over the ensuing seven years whereupon the Company agreed togrant the right and option to earn a vested seventy percent (70%) and an additional five percent (5%) upon delivery of a bankable feasibility study.
