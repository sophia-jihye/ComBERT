Overview 

Equinix, Inc. connects more than 6,300 (1) &#32;companies directly to their customers and partners inside the world&#8217;s most interconnected data centers. Today, businesses leverage the Equinix interconnection platform in 33 strategic markets across the Americas, Asia-Pacific, and Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA). 

In September 2012, we announced that our Board of Directors approved a plan for Equinix to pursue conversion to a real estate investment trust (a &#8220;REIT&#8221;). On December 23, 2014, our Board of Directors formally approved our conversion to a REIT effective on January 1, 2015. We completed the implementation of the REIT conversion in 2014 and as a result, we began operating as a REIT for federal income tax purposes effective January 1, 2015. In May 2015, we received a favorable response to the private letter ruling (&#8220;PLR&#8221;) we had requested from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (&#8220;IRS&#8221;) in connection with our conversion to a REIT for federal income tax purposes. The REIT conversion includes almost all of our data center operations in the U.S., Europe and Japan held through qualified REIT subsidiaries (&#8220;QRSs&#8221;); our data center operations in other jurisdictions have initially been designated as taxable REIT subsidiaries (&#8220;TRSs&#8221;). 

In May 2015 we announced an offer for the entire issued and to be issued share capital of Telecity Group plc (&#8220;TelecityGroup&#8221;), valued at approximately &#163;2.4 billion, or $3.8 billion in U.S. dollars. The transaction closed in January 2016. The total consideration consisted of $1.7 billion in cash and 6.9 million shares of our common stock, valued at $2.1 billion.

More than 6,300+ potential partners to deploy world-class solutions. 

Equinix has established a critical mass of customers that continues to drive new and existing customer growth and bookings. Our network- and cloud-neutral business model also contributes to our success in the market. Rather than selling a particular network, we offer customers direct interconnection to an aggregation of bandwidth providers. The providers in our sites include the world&#8217;s top carriers, mobile providers, Internet service providers (ISPs), broadband access networks (DSL / cable) and international carriers. Our neutrality also means our customers can choose to buy from, or partner with, leading companies across our five targeted verticals. These include: 

&#8226; 

Network and Mobile Providers (AT&#38;T, British Telecom, China Mobile, Comcast, Level 3 Communications, Lycamobile, NTT Communications, SingTel Ltd., Syniverse Technologies, T-Mobile, TATA Communications, Verizon) 

&#8226; 

Cloud and IT Services (Amazon Web Services, Box Inc., Carpathia Hosting Inc., NetApp, Microsoft Azure, Salesforce.com, SoftLayer, Cisco Systems Inc., Oracle, Datapipe, CloudSigma, Workday, Inc.) 

&#8226; 

Content Providers (Brightroll, eBay, DIRECTV, Hulu, LinkedIn, Netflix, Priceline.com) 

&#8226; 

Enterprise (Anheuser-Busch, InBev, Bechtel, Burger King Corporation, Caterpillar, Inc., CDM Smith, Chevron, GE, Harper Collins Publishers, Ingram Micro) 

&#8226; 

Financial Companies (ACTIV Financial, Bloomberg, Chicago Board Options Exchange, DirectEdge, Quantlab Financial, NASDAQ, OMX Group Inc., NYSE Technologies, Thomson Reuters) 

Equinix generates revenue by providing colocation and related interconnection and managed IT infrastructure offerings on a global platform of 112 IBX data centers. 

&#8226; 

Colocation offerings include operations space, storage space, cabinets and power for customers&#8217; colocation needs. 

&#8226; 

Interconnection offerings include Equinix Cloud Exchange&#8482;, which enables simultaneous, direct and secure connections to multiple clouds from a single port, and Performance Hub&#8482;, which takes enterprise IT inside any one of our global data centers, bringing &#32; our customers closer to their end users for improved network reliability, performance and security. Equinix also offers cross connects, as well as switch ports on the Equinix Internet Exchange. These offerings provide scalable and reliable connectivity that allows customers to exchange traffic directly and securely with the service provider of their choice or with each other, creating a performance optimized business ecosystem for the exchange of data between strategic partners. 

&#8226; 

Managed IT infrastructure services are offered in limited regional markets to allow customers to leverage Equinix&#8217;s significant telecommunications expertise, maximize the benefits of our IBX data centers and optimize their infrastructure and resources. 

&#8226; 

Equinix professional services guide customers though complex IT infrastructure changes and hybrid and multi-cloud deployments quickly and securely, while delivering continuous and reliable technical support. Equinix cloud consulting services, led by recently acquired professional service company Nimbo, optimize cloud migrations, matching service providers and architectures to individual business needs. Solution Validation Centers&#8482; (SVCs&#8482;) allow customers to test and fine-tune cloud, network and IT infrastructure rollouts in a real-world setting prior to deployment. Global Solution Architects&#8482; run our SVCs and are experts in emerging trends and the range of solutions and services available from providers inside our data centers. They can design, build and implement solutions that best match enterprise aims and budgets. The Equinix Customer Portal delivers full-time access to support, instant reporting and requests for Equinix Smart Hands&#8482; technicians. These highly trained data center experts are on call for everything from routine cable installations to technical assistance and troubleshooting. 

The market for Equinix&#8217;s offerings has previously been served by large telecommunications carriers that have bundled their telecommunications and managed services with their colocation offerings. In addition, some Equinix customers, such as Microsoft, build and operate their own data centers for their large infrastructure deployments, called server farms. However, these customers 

rely upon Equinix IBX data centers for many of their critical interconnection relationships. The need for sizable, wholesale, outsourced data centers is also being addressed by providers that build large data centers to meet customers&#8217; needs for standalone data centers, a different customer segment than Equinix serves. 

Due to the increasing cost and complexity of the power and cooling requirements of today&#8217;s data center equipment, Equinix has gained many customers that have outgrown their existing data centers or have realized the benefits of a network-neutral model and the ability to create their own optimized business ecosystems for the exchange of data. Strategically, we will continue to look at attractive opportunities to grow market share and selectively expand our footprint and offerings. We continue to leverage our global reach and depth to differentiate Equinix based upon our ability to support truly global customer requirements in all our markets. 

Equinix is benefiting from a growth in demand for data center offerings. Several factors contribute to this growth in demand, including: 

&#8226; 

The growth of &#8220;proximity communities&#8221; that rely on immediate physical colocation and interconnection with their strategic partners and customers, such as financial exchange ecosystems for electronic trading and settlement and ecosystems for real-time bidding and fulfillment of Internet advertising. 

&#8226; 

The adoption of cloud computing technology services, including the growth of hybrid/multi-clouds, enterprise cloud service offerings such as Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) and Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) and disaster recovery services. 

&#8226; 

The continuing growth of consumer Internet traffic from new bandwidth-intensive services, such as video, voice over IP (VoIP), social media, mobile data, gaming, data-rich media, Ethernet and wireless services. The financial services market is experiencing tremendous growth due to electronic trading and the increased volume of peak messages (transactions per second), requiring optimized data exchange through business ecosystems. 

&#8226; 

The increasing requirements for anytime, anywhere and any device interconnection out at the edge of the corporate network to improve the performance, security, scalability and reliability of interconnecting people, locations, clouds and data. 

&#8226; 

Significant increases in power and cooling requirements for today&#8217;s data center equipment. New generations of servers continue to concentrate processing capability, with associated power consumption and cooling load, into smaller footprints, and many legacy-built data centers are unable to accommodate these new power and cooling demands. The high capital costs associated with building and maintaining &#8220;in-sourced&#8221; data centers creates an opportunity for capital savings by leveraging an outsourced colocation model. 

Industry Background 

The Internet is a collection of numerous independent networks interconnected to form a network of networks. Users on different networks are able to communicate with each other through interconnection between these networks. For example, when a person sends an email to someone who uses a different provider for his or her connectivity (e.g., Comcast versus Verizon), the email must pass from one network to the other to get to its final destination. Equinix provides a physical point at which that interconnection can occur. 

To accommodate the rapid growth of Internet traffic, an organized approach for network interconnection was needed. This was the start of the network era, when networks gained mutual advantage by exchanging data traffic on interoperable platforms. The exchange of traffic between these networks became known as peering. Peering is when networks trade traffic at relatively equal amounts and set up agreements to trade traffic, often at no charge to the other party. At first, government and nonprofit organizations established places where these networks could exchange traffic, or peer, with each other-these points were known as network access points, or NAPs. Over time, many NAPs became a natural extension of carrier services and were run by such companies as MFS (now a part of Verizon Business), Sprint, Ameritech and Pacific Bell (the latter two are now part of AT&#38;T). 

Ultimately, these NAPs were unable to scale with the growth of the Internet, and the lack of &#8220;neutrality&#8221; by the carrier owners of these NAPs created a conflict of interest with the participants. This created a market need for network-neutral interconnection points that could accommodate the rapidly growing need to increase performance for enterprise and consumer users of the Internet, especially with the rise of important content providers such as AOL, Microsoft, Yahoo! and others. In addition, the providers, as well as a growing number of enterprises, required a more secure and reliable solution for direct connection to a variety of 

telecommunications networks, as the importance of their Internet operations continued to grow. These were the seeds of the connected era, when peering expanded exponentially, and between new players, and access to information anytime and anywhere became the norm. 

To accommodate Internet traffic growth, the largest networks left the NAPs and began connecting and trading traffic by placing private circuits between each other. Peering, which once occurred at the NAP locations, was moved to these private circuits. Over the years, these circuits became expensive to expand and could not be built quickly enough to accommodate traffic growth. This led to a need by the large carriers to find a more efficient way to peer. Today, many customers satisfy their requirements for peering through data center providers like Equinix because this strategy permits them to peer with the networks they require within one location, using simple, direct and secure connections. Their ability to peer within a data center or across a data center campus, instead of across a metro area, has increased the scalability of their operations while decreasing network costs. 

The interconnection model has further evolved over the years to include new offerings, as the collaborative landscape of the interconnected era imposes new demands on connectivity. As enterprises become increasingly interdependent and cloud-enabled, they need real-time data exchange and reliable, instant connections between the various corners of any given digital ecosystem to compete. Starting with the peering and network communities, interconnection has been used for new network services, including carrier Ethernet, multiprotocol label switching (MPLS), virtual private networks (VPNs) and mobile services, in addition to traditional international private line and voice services. The industry continues to evolve with a set of new offerings where interconnection is often used to solve the network-to-network and the cloud-to-cloud interconnection challenges in order to keep up with the rapid digital transformation of today&#8217;s businesses. 

In addition, the enterprise customer segment is also evolving. In the past, most enterprises opted to keep their data center requirements in house. However, current trends are leading more and more enterprise chief information officers (CIOs) to either outsource their data center requirements, and/or extend their corporate wide area networks (WANs) into carrier-neutral colocation facilities. The combination of globalization, the proliferation of bandwidth intensive Internet-facing applications and rich media content, the need to provide access to cloud computing environments and business continuity and disaster recovery options, plus tight corporate IT budgets, mean that enterprise CIOs must do more with less. Industry analysts forecast growth in the colocation market to be approximately 10% per year over the next four years.

Our Strategy 

Our objective is to expand our global leadership position as the premier network- and cloud-neutral data center platform for cloud and IT services providers, content providers, financial companies, enterprises and network and mobile services providers. Key components of our strategy include the following: 

Improve customer performance through interconnection. &#32; To succeed in today&#8217;s digital economy, enterprises around the globe must adopt interconnected, on-demand IT architectures. To help companies understand, deploy and benefit from &#32; interconnection, Equinix created a blueprint for becoming an interconnected enterprise - the Interconnection Oriented Architecture&#8482; (IOA&#8482;). Based on work with more than 100 Fortune 500 customers, and 400+ Equinix Performance Hub&#8482; deployments, Equinix developed IOA as a proven and repeatable engagement model that both enterprises and solution providers can leverage to directly and securely connect people, locations, clouds and data. IOA shifts the fundamental IT delivery architecture from siloed and centralized to interconnected and distributed. When combined with Equinix's longstanding &#32; critical mass of premier network and cloud providers and content companies, this IOA strategy is enabling Equinix to extend its leadership as one of the core interconnection hubs of the information-driven world. Equinix's critical mass is a key selling point for companies that want to connect with a diverse set of networks to provide the best connectivity to their end customers and network companies that want to sell bandwidth to companies and interconnect with other networks in the most efficient manner available. Currently, we house more than 1,100 unique networks, including all of the top tier networks, allowing our customers to directly interconnect with providers that best meet their unique global and regional price and performance needs. We have a growing mass of key players in cloud and IT services, such as Accenture, Amazon Web Services, AT&#38;T, Microsoft Azure and Salesforce.com, and in the enterprise and financial sectors, such as Bechtel, Bloomberg, Chicago Board of Trade, The GAP, McGraw-Hill and others. We expect these segments will continue to grow as they seek to leverage our critical mass of network providers and interconnect directly with each other to improve performance. 

Streamline ease of doing business globally. Data center reliability, power availability and network choice are the most important attributes considered by our customers when they choose a data center provider in a particular location. We have long been recognized as a leader in these areas and our performance continues to improve against these criteria. Our power infrastructure delivered 99.9999% uptime globally in 2015. 

In 2015, more than half of our revenue came from customers with deployments in all three of our global regions, and as globalization continues, seamless global solutions will become increasingly important data center selection criteria. We continue to focus on strategic acquisitions to expand our market coverage and on global product standardization, pricing and contracts harmonization initiatives to meet these global demands. 

&#160; Deepen existing and grow new ecosystems. As networks, cloud and IT services providers, content providers, financial services providers and enterprises locate in our IBX data centers, it benefits their suppliers and business partners to do so as well, to gain the full economic and performance benefits of direct interconnection for their business ecosystems. These partners, in turn, pull in their business partners, creating a &#8220;network effect&#8221; of customer adoption. Our interconnection offerings enable scalable, reliable and cost-effective interconnectivity and optimized traffic exchange, thus lowering overall cost and increasing flexibility. The ability to directly interconnect with a wide variety of companies is a key differentiator for us in the market and enables companies to create new opportunities within unique ecosystems by working together. We have efficient and innovative Internet and Cloud Exchange platforms to accelerate commercial growth within the ecosystems in our IBX sites via this network effect. 

&#160; Expand vertical go-to-market plan. We plan to continue to focus our go-to-market efforts on customer segments and business applications that appreciate the Equinix value proposition of interconnection, reliability, global reach and ecosystem collaboration opportunities. Today, we have identified these segments as cloud services, content and digital media, financial services, enterprises, IT services, and network and mobile service providers. As digital business evolves, we will continue to identify and focus our go-to-market efforts on industry segments that need our value proposition. 

Accelerate global reach and scale. &#32;We continue to evaluate expansion opportunities in select markets based on customer demand. In 2014, we completed the acquisition of ALOG Data Centers of Brazil S.A. and took the remaining ownership interest in the four data centers at ALOG, obtaining the remaining ownership interest in four data centers, two in S&#227;o Paulo and two in Rio de Janeiro. In 2015, we acquired professional services company Nimbo in the U.S. and Bit-isle in Japan. In January 2016, we also closed the TelecityGroup acquisition in Europe. The TelecityGroup acquisition significantly expands Equinix's global interconnection platform from 112 data centers in 33 metros to 145 data centers in 40 metros. The new metros we entered with our TelecityGroup acquisition in 2016 were Dublin, Helsinki, Istanbul, Milan, Sofia, Stockholm and Warsaw. We also added capacity across our global footprint in 2015 by opening our ninth data center in New York, our second in Toronto, our first in Melbourne, our third in Singapore and our sixth in London. 

Our strategy is to continue to grow in select existing markets and possibly expand to additional markets where warranted by demand and financial return potential. We expect to execute this expansion strategy in a cost-effective and disciplined manner through a combination of acquiring existing data centers through lease or purchase, acquiring or investing in local data center operators and building new IBX data centers based on key criteria, such as demand and potential financial return, in each market.

Our Offerings &#160; 

Equinix provides a choice of data center offerings primarily comprised of colocation, interconnection solutions and managed IT infrastructure and professional services. 

Colocation and Related Offerings 

Our IBX data centers provide our customers with secure, reliable and robust environments that are necessary for optimum Internet commerce interconnection. Many of our IBX data centers include multiple layers of physical security, scalable cabinet space availability, on-site trained staff (24x7x365), dedicated areas for customer care and equipment staging, redundant AC/DC power systems and other redundant and fault-tolerant infrastructure systems. Some specifications of offerings provided by individual IBX data centers may differ based on original facility design or market. 

Within our IBX data centers, customers can deploy their equipment and interconnect with a choice of networks, cloud providers or other business partners. We also provide customized solutions for customers looking to package our IBX offerings as part of their complex solutions. Our colocation offerings include: 

Cabinets. Our customers have several choices for colocating their networking, server and storage equipment. They can place the equipment in one of our shared or private cages or customize their space. In certain select markets, customers can purchase their own private &#8220;suite&#8221; which is walled off from the rest of the data center. As customers&#8217; colocation requirements increase, they can expand within their original cage (or suite) or upgrade into a cage that meets their expanded requirements. Customers buy the hardware they place in our IBX data centers directly from their chosen vendors. Cabinets (or suites) are priced with an initial installation fee and an ongoing recurring monthly charge. 

Power. Power is an element of increasing importance in customers&#8217; colocation decisions. We offer both AC and DC power circuits at various amperages and phases customized to a customer&#8217;s individual power requirements. We also offer metered power in certain markets. Power is priced with an initial installation fee and an ongoing recurring monthly charge. 

IBXflex. &#32;IBXflex allows customers to deploy mission-critical operations personnel and equipment on-site at our IBX data centers. Because of the close proximity to their infrastructure within our IBX data centers, IBXflex customers can offer a faster response and quicker troubleshooting solution than those available in traditional colocation facilities. This space can also be used as a secure disaster recovery point for customers&#8217; business and operations personnel. This service is priced with an initial installation fee and an ongoing recurring monthly charge. 

Interconnection Solutions &#160; 

Our interconnection solutions enable high-performance, secure, scalable, reliable and cost-effective interconnection and traffic exchange between Equinix customers. These interconnection solutions are either on a one-to-one basis with direct cross connects or one-to-many through one of our Equinix Exchange solutions. In the peering community, we play an important industry leadership role by acting as the relationship broker between parties who would like to interconnect within our IBX data centers. Our staff holds or has held significant positions in many leading industry groups, such as the North American Network Operators&#8217; Group, or NANOG, and the Internet Engineering Task Force, or IETF. Members of our staff have published industry-recognized white papers and strategy documents in the areas of peering and interconnection, many of which are used by other institutions worldwide in furthering the education and promotion of this important set of solutions. We expect to continue to develop additional solutions in the area of traffic exchange that will allow our customers to leverage the critical mass of networks, cloud services providers, and many important financial services and e-commerce industry leaders now available in our IBX data centers. Our current exchange solutions are comprised of the following: 

Physical Cross Connect/Direct Interconnections. &#32;Customers needing to directly and privately connect to another IBX data center customer can do so through single or multi-mode fiber. These cross connections are the physical link between customers and can be implemented within 24 hours of request. Cross-connect offerings are priced with an initial installation fee and an ongoing monthly recurring charge. 

Equinix Internet Exchange&#8482;. &#32;Customers may choose to connect to and peer through the central switching fabric of our Equinix Internet Exchange, rather than purchase a direct physical cross connection. With a connection to this switch, a customer can aggregate multiple interconnects over one physical connection with multiple, linked 10 gigabit ports of capacity, instead of purchasing individual physical cross connects. The offering is priced per IBX data center with an initial installation fee and an ongoing monthly recurring charge. Individual IBX data center prices increase as the number of participants on the exchange service grows. 

Equinix Metro Connect . Customers who are located in one IBX data center may need to interconnect with networks or other customers located in an adjacent or nearby IBX data center in the same metro area. Metro Connect allows customers to seamlessly interconnect between IBX data centers at capacities up to an OC-192, or 10 gigabits per second level. Metro Connect offerings are priced with an initial installation fee and an ongoing monthly recurring charge dependent on the capacity purchased by the customer. 

Internet Connectivity Services. Customers who are installing equipment in our IBX data centers generally require IP connectivity or bandwidth services. Although many large customers prefer to contract directly with carriers, we offer customers the ability to contract for these services through us from any of the major bandwidth providers in that data center. This service, which is provided in our Asia-Pacific and EMEA regions, is targeted to customers who require a single bill and a single point of 

support for their entire contract through Equinix for their bandwidth needs. Internet connectivity services are priced with an initial installation fee and an ongoing monthly recurring charge based on the amount of bandwidth committed. 

Equinix Cloud Exchange&#8482;. The &#32; Equinix Cloud Exchange is an advanced interconnection solution that enables seamless, on-demand, direct access to multiple clouds from multiple networks around the world. Cloud Exchange provides virtualized, private direct connections that bypass the Internet to provide better security and performance with a range of bandwidth options.

Our SVCs operate in eight strategic markets globally, helping companies reduce risk and maximize their IT investments. 

Smart Hands Services&#8482;. The Equinix Smart Hands service enables customers to use our highly trained IBX data center personnel to act as their hands (or eyes and ears) when their own staff can&#8217;t be on-site. Smart Hands technicians offer a range of services, from routine equipment inventory and labeling to more complex installations and configuring. Smart Hands technicians also provide technical assistance and troubleshooting services.

BCTR offerings are protected with back-up generators and uninterruptible power supply to guarantee reliability and deliver peace of mind. 

Sales and Marketing 

Sales. We use a direct sales force and channel marketing program to market our offerings to global enterprises, content providers, financial companies, and mobile and network service providers. We organize our sales force by customer type, as well as by establishing a sales presence in diverse geographic regions, which enables efficient servicing of the customer base from a network of regional offices. In addition to our worldwide headquarters located in Silicon Valley, we have established an Asia-Pacific regional headquarters in Hong Kong and a European regional headquarters in Amsterdam. Our Americas sales offices are located in Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, Reston, Silicon Valley and Toronto and sales offices in Brazil operate out of data centers in Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. Our EMEA sales offices are located in Amsterdam, Dubai, Dusseldorf, Enschede, Frankfurt, Geneva, London, Munich, Paris, Zurich and Zwolle. Our Asia-Pacific sales offices are located in Beijing, Hong Kong, Jakarta, Osaka, Seoul, Shanghai, Singapore, Sydney, Melbourne and Tokyo. 

Our sales team works closely with each customer to foster the natural network effect of our IBX model, resulting in access to a wider potential customer base via our existing customers. As a result of the IBX interconnection model, IBX data center participants often encourage their customers, suppliers and business partners to also locate in our IBX data centers. These customers, suppliers and business partners, in turn, encourage their business partners to locate in our IBX data centers, resulting in additional customer growth. This network effect significantly reduces our new customer acquisition costs. In addition, large network providers, cloud providers or managed service providers may refer customers to Equinix as a part of their total customer solution. Equinix also focuses selling by our vertical sales specialists on supporting specific industry requirements for network, mobile and content providers, financial services, cloud computing, systems integrators and enterprise customer segments. 

Marketing. &#32;To support our sales efforts and to actively promote our brand in the Americas, Asia-Pacific and EMEA, we conduct comprehensive marketing programs. Our marketing strategies include active public relations and ongoing customer communications programs. Our marketing efforts are focused on major business and trade publications, online media outlets, industry events and sponsored activities. Our staff holds leadership positions in key networking organizations, and we participate in a variety of Internet, enterprise IT, computer and financial industry conferences, placing our officers and employees in keynote speaking engagements at these conferences. We also regularly measure customer satisfaction levels and host key customer forums to ensure customer needs are understood and incorporated in product and service planning efforts. From a brand perspective, we build recognition through our website, sponsoring or leading industry technical forums, participating in Internet industry standard-setting bodies and through advertising and online campaigns. We continue to develop and host industry educational forums focused on peering technologies and practices for ISPs and content providers. 

Our Competition &#160; 

While a large number of enterprises own their own data centers, many others outsource some or all of their requirements to multi-tenant Internet data center facilities, such as those operated by Equinix. We believe that the outsourcing trend is likely to not only continue but also to grow in the coming years. It is estimated that Equinix is one of more than 650 companies that provide Internet data center offerings around the world, ranging in size from firms with a single data center in a single market to firms in over 20 markets. Equinix competes with these firms, which vary in terms of their data center offerings, including: 

Colocation Providers 

Colocation data centers are a type of Internet data center that can also be referred to as &#8220;retail&#8221; data center space. Typically, colocation data center space is offered on the basis of individual racks/cabinets or cages ranging from 500 to 10,000 square feet in size. Typical customers of colocation providers include: 

&#8226; 

Large enterprises with significant IT expertise and requirements. 

&#8226; 

Small and medium businesses looking to outsource data center requirements. 

&#8226; 

Internet application providers. 

&#8226; 

Major Internet content, entertainment and social networking providers. 

&#8226; 

Shared, dedicated and managed hosting providers. 

&#8226; 

Mobile and network service providers. 

&#8226; 

Content delivery networks. 

Full facility maintenance and systems, including fire suppression, security, power backup and HVAC, are routinely included in managed colocation offerings. A variety of additional services are typically available, including remote hands technician services and network monitoring services. 

In addition to Equinix, providers that offer colocation both globally and locally include firms such as AT&#38;T, CenturyLink, COLT, CyrusOne, Level 3 Communications, NTT and Verizon Business. 

Carrier-Neutral Colocation Providers 

In addition to data center space and power, colocation providers also offer interconnection. Certain of these providers, known as network or carrier-neutral colocation providers, can offer customers the choice of hundreds of network service providers or ISPs to choose from. Typically, customers use interconnection to buy Internet connectivity, connect to VoIP telephone networks, perform financial exchange and settlement functions or perform business-to-business e-commerce. Carrier-neutral data centers are often located in key network hubs around the world, such as New York, Ashburn, London, Amsterdam, Singapore and Hong Kong. Two types of data center facilities offering carrier-neutral colocation are used for many network-to-network interconnections: &#32; 

&#8226; 

A Meet Me Room (MMR) is typically a smaller space, generally 5,000 square feet or less, located in a major carrier hotel and often found in a wholesale data center facility. 

&#8226; 

A carrier-neutral data center is generally larger than an MMR and may be a stand-alone building separate from existing carrier hotels. 

In addition to Equinix, other providers that we believe could be defined as offering carrier-neutral colocation include CoreSite, Digital Reality, Global Switch, Interxion and Telehouse. 

Wholesale Data Center Providers 

Wholesale data center providers lease data center space that is typically offered in cells or pods (i.e., individual white-space rooms) ranging in size from 10,000 to 20,000 square feet, or larger. Wholesale data center offerings are targeted to both enterprises and colocation providers. These data centers primarily provide space and power without additional services like technicians, remote hands services or network monitoring (although other tenants might offer such services). 

Sample wholesale data center providers include Digital Realty Trust, DuPont Fabros Technology, e-Shelter and Global Switch. 

Managed Hosters 

Managed hosting services are provided by several firms that also provide data center colocation services. Typically, managed hosting providers can manage server hardware that is owned by either the hosting provider or the customer. They can also provide a combination of comprehensive systems administration, database administration and sometimes application management services. Frequently, this results in managed hosting providers &#8220;running&#8221; the customer&#8217;s servers, although such administration is frequently shared. The provider may manage such functions as operating systems, databases, security and patch management, while the customer will maintain management of the applications riding on top of those systems. 

The full list of potential services that can be offered as part of managed hosting is substantial and includes services such as remote management, custom applications, helpdesk, messaging, databases, disaster recovery, managed storage, managed virtualization, managed security, managed networks and systems monitoring. Managed hosting services are typically used for: 

&#8226; 

Application hosting by organizations of any size, including large enterprises. 

&#8226; 

Hosted or managed messaging, including Microsoft Exchange and other complex messaging applications. 

&#8226; 

Complex or highly scalable Web hosting or e-commerce websites. 

&#8226; 

Managed storage solutions (including large drive arrays or backup robots). 

&#8226; 

Server disaster recovery and business continuity, including clustering and global server load balancing. 

&#8226; 

Database servers, applications and services. 

Examples of managed hosters include AT&#38;T, CenturyLink, NaviSite, Rackspace, SunGard and Verizon Business. 

Unlike other providers whose core businesses are bandwidth or managed services, we focus on neutral interconnection hubs for cloud and IT service providers, content providers, financial companies, enterprises and network service providers. As a result, we do not have the limited choices found commonly at other hosting/colocation companies. We compete based on the quality of our IBX data centers, our ability to provide a one-stop global solution in our Americas, EMEA and Asia-Pacific locations, the performance and diversity of our network- and cloud-neutral strategy, and the economic benefits of the aggregation of top network, cloud and business ecosystems under one roof. We expect to continue to benefit from several industry trends, including the need for contracting with multiple networks due to the uncertainty in the telecommunications market; customers&#8217; increasing power requirements; enterprise customers&#8217; increased use of virtualization and outsourcing; the continued growth of broadband and significant growth in Ethernet as a network alternative; and the growth in mobile applications.
