&#32;3 

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS 

Matrix Applied Technologies 

On February 1, 2016, the Company completed the acquisition of all outstanding stock of Baillie Tank Equipment, Ltd. ("BTE"), an internationally-based company with nearly 20 years of experience in the design and manufacture of products for use on aboveground storage tanks. Founded in 1998, BTE is a provider of tank products including geodesic domes, aluminum internal floating roofs, floating suction and skimmer systems, roof drain systems, and seals. BTE is headquartered in Sydney, Australia with a manufacturing facility in Seoul, South Korea. The Company acquired BTE to expand its service offerings of certain technical solutions for aboveground storage tanks. The business is now known as Matrix Applied Technologies, and its operating results are included in the Storage Solutions segment. 

The Company purchased BTE with cash on-hand for a net purchase price of $13.0 million. The Company paid $15.4 million when including the subsequent repayment of long-term debt acquired and the settlement of certain other liabilities acquired, and excluding the cash acquired and certain amounts owed to the former owners for working capital adjustments. 

HDB Ltd. Limited Partnership 

On August 22, 2014, the Company purchased substantially all of the assets of HDB Ltd. Limited Partnership ("HDB"). HDB, headquartered in Bakersfield, California provides construction, fabrication and turnaround services to energy companies throughout California's central valley. The acquisition advanced a strategic goal of the Company to expand into the upstream energy market. The acquisition purchase price was $5.6 million and was funded with cash on hand. Commencing on August 22, 2014, HDB's operating results are included in the Oil Gas &#38; Chemical Segment. 

Matrix NAC &#160; 

Effective as of December 21, 2013, the Company acquired 100% of the stock of Kvaerner North American Construction Ltd. and substantially all of the assets of Kvaerner North American Construction Inc,. together referenced as "KNAC". The businesses are now known as Matrix North American Construction Ltd. and Matrix North American Construction, Inc., together referenced as "Matrix NAC". Matrix NAC is a provider of maintenance and capital construction services to power generation, integrated iron and steel, and industrial process facilities. The acquisition significantly expanded the Company's presence in the Electrical Infrastructure and Industrial segments, and to a lesser extent, the Oil Gas and Chemical segment. In addition, the KNAC acquisition has brought opportunities in additional geographical markets, the ability to execute additional and larger projects and has allowed us to expand our relationship with some existing clients. 

The Company purchased KNAC for $51.6 million, net of cash acquired. The acquisition was funded through a combination of cash-on-hand and borrowings under our senior revolving credit facility. 

Impact of Commodity Price Volatility 

The prolonged decline in crude prices has begun to impact our income from operations and project awards, particularly in the Oil Gas &#38; Chemical and Storage Solutions segments. The Industrial segment continues to be negatively impacted by the low prices of other commodities, principally steel and copper. The decline in commodity prices has not had, and we do not expect a significant impact on the Electrical Infrastructure segment. 

In the mid and downstream portions of the Oil Gas &#38; Chemical segment, we are seeing lower volumes of routine maintenance and turnaround work as well as a general slowdown of capital projects. Additionally, since some of our mid and downstream customers are integrated oil companies with exposure to the price of crude, if the prices remain at current levels or decline further, spending levels may continue to be reduced. Our exposure to non-integrated upstream clients in the Oil Gas &#38; Chemical segment is not significant. 

&#32;4 

In our Storage Solutions segment, our customers continue to take a long-term view of the market, but continue to be cautious short-term, particularly on larger projects. Based on current market conditions, we are seeing a reduction in customer spending and project award delays. We cannot predict the direction of commodity prices or our customers&#8217; ultimate reaction to the market and therefore cannot predict the magnitude of the impact to our future earnings. 

In the Industrial segment, our iron and steel customers face significant uncertainty related to the slowdown in the Chinese economy and the related impact on steel imports and steel prices, the strong United States Dollar, the domestic demand for steel and the impact of anti-dumping duties on steel imports. This uncertainty has reduced the capital, expansion and elective maintenance spending of our customers. Although we are seeing some encouraging signs in the market, we do not expect higher levels of spending until the overall uncertainty in this market is reduced and economic conditions within the industry improve. In the mining and minerals markets, we continue to see lower spending due to the softness of other commodity prices, particularly copper, to which our clients are exposed. 

OTHER BUSINESS MATTERS 

Customers and Marketing 

The Company provided services to approximately 500 customers in fiscal 2016 . One customer, TransCanada Corporation, accounted for $194.0 million or 14.8% of our consolidated revenue, $135.7 million of which was in the Electrical Infrastructure segment and $57.5 million of which was in the Storage Solutions segment. Another customer, Energy Transfer Partners, L.P., accounted for $139.5 million or 10.6% of our consolidated revenue, all of which was in the Storage Solutions segment. &#160; The loss of these major customers or other significant customers could have a material adverse effect on the Company; however, we are not dependent on any single contract or customer on an on-going basis. 

Matrix markets its services and products primarily through its marketing and business development personnel, senior professional staff and its operating management. We competitively bid most of our projects; however, we have a number of preferred provider relationships with customers who award us work through long-term agreements. Our projects have durations ranging from a few days to multiple years. 

Segment Financial Information 

Financial information for our operating segments is provided in Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and in Note 13-Segment Information of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. 

Competition 

Our industry is highly fragmented and intensely competitive. We compete with local, regional, national and international contractors and service providers. Competitors vary with the markets we serve with few competitors competing in all of the markets we serve or in all of the services we provide. Contracts are generally awarded based on price, quality, safety performance, schedule, and customer satisfaction. 

Backlog 

We define backlog as the total dollar amount of revenue that we expect to recognize as a result of performing work that has been awarded to us through a signed contract, notice to proceed or other type of assurance that we consider firm. The following arrangements are considered firm: 

&#8226; 

fixed-price awards; 

&#8226; 

minimum customer commitments on cost plus arrangements; and 

&#8226; 

certain time and material arrangements in which the estimated value is firm or can be estimated with a reasonable amount of certainty in both timing and amount. 

For long-term maintenance contracts, we include only the amounts that we expect to recognize as revenue over the next 12 months. For all other arrangements, we calculate backlog as the estimated contract amount less revenues recognized as of the reporting date.

Project awards in all segments are cyclical and are typically the result of a sales process that can take several months to complete. Backlog in the Storage Solutions and Electrical Infrastructure segments generally have the greatest volatility because individual project awards can be less frequent and more significant. 

The decline in backlog in the Electrical Infrastructure segment is mainly attributable to the work related to the previously announced Napanee Power Generating Station project. Awards in power delivery continue to meet the Company's expectations. 

Backlog in the Industrial segment was negatively impacted by a slowdown in the iron and steel and mining industries as well as a mining-related project cancellation of $11.6 million in the first quarter. The cancellation was not attributable to the Company's performance on the project. It is our belief that the cancellation was attributable to softness in commodity prices, including copper, to which the client is exposed. 

The decline in backlog in the Storage Solutions Segment is attributable to the work related to the previously announced project for the construction of terminals supporting the Dakota Access Pipeline. In addition, a more cautious approach to decision-making on the part of clients, together with more stringent financial and regulatory requirements, is delaying the timing of some of the larger awards. Although we are seeing increased competition, awards for small and medium sized projects are generally meeting the Company's expectations. 

Backlog in the Storage Solutions segment was negatively impacted in the second quarter by $22.0 million related to the indefinite delay of remaining work on a project for one of our Canadian customers for the construction of aboveground storage tanks at a storage terminal. At the onset of the project, the customer anticipated receiving the appropriate permitting approvals for the pipeline that would have run from the storage terminal to the Gulf Coast of the United States. In November of 2015, the President of the United States rejected approval of the pipeline. The customer was also considering deploying the storage tanks for another project that was indefinitely deferred due to the low price of crude oil. 

Seasonality and Other Factors 

Our operating results can exhibit seasonal fluctuations, especially in our Oil Gas &#38; Chemical segment, for a variety of reasons. Turnarounds and planned outages at customer facilities are typically scheduled in the spring and the fall when the demand for energy is lower. Within the Electrical Infrastructure segment, transmission and distribution work is generally scheduled by the public utilities when the demand for electricity is at its lowest. Therefore, revenue volume in the summer months is typically lower than in other periods throughout the year. Also, we typically see a lower level of operating activity relating to construction projects during the winter months and early in the calendar year because many of our customers&#8217; capital budgets have not been finalized. Our business can also be affected, both positively and negatively, by seasonal factors such as energy demand or weather conditions including hurricanes, snowstorms, and abnormally low or high temperatures. Some of these seasonal factors may cause some of our offices and projects to close or reduce activities temporarily. In addition to the above noted factors, the general timing of project starts and completions could exhibit significant fluctuations. Accordingly, results for any interim period may not necessarily be indicative of future operating results. 

Other factors impacting operating results in all segments come from work site permitting delays or customers accelerating or postponing work. The differing types, sizes, and durations of our contracts, combined with their geographic diversity and stages of completion, often results in fluctuations in the Company's operating results. 

&#32;6 

Material Sources and Availability 

Steel plate and steel pipe are key materials used by the Company. Supplies of these materials are available throughout the United States and globally from numerous sources. We anticipate that adequate amounts of these materials will be available in the foreseeable future. However, the price, quantity, and the delivery schedules of these materials could change rapidly due to various factors, including producer capacity, the level of imports, worldwide demand, tariffs on imported steel and other market conditions. 

Insurance 

The Company maintains insurance coverage for various aspects of its operations. However, exposure to potential losses is retained through the use of deductibles, self-insured retentions and coverage limits. 

Typically our contracts require us to indemnify our customers for injury, damage or loss arising from the performance of our services and provide warranties for materials. The Company may also be required to name the customer as an additional insured up to the limits of insurance available, or we may be required to purchase special insurance policies or surety bonds for specific customers or provide letters of credit in lieu of bonds to satisfy performance and financial guarantees on some projects. Matrix maintains a performance and payment bonding line sufficient to support the business. The Company generally requires its subcontractors to indemnify the Company and the Company&#8217;s customer and name the Company as an additional insured for activities arising out of the subcontractors&#8217; work. We also require certain subcontractors to provide additional insurance policies, including surety bonds in favor of the Company, to secure the subcontractors&#8217; work. There can be no assurance that our insurance and the additional insurance coverage provided by our subcontractors will fully protect us against a valid claim or loss under the contracts with our customers. 

Employees 

As of June 30, 2016 , the Company had 3,560 employees of which 936 were employed in non-field positions and 2,624 were employed in field or shop positions. The number of employees varies significantly throughout the year because of the number, type and size of projects we have in progress at any particular time. 

The Company&#8217;s subsidiaries include both merit and union companies. The union businesses operate under collective bargaining agreements with various unions representing different groups of our employees. Union agreements provide union employees with benefits including health and welfare, pension, training programs and competitive compensation plans. We have not experienced any strikes or work stoppages in recent years. We maintain health and welfare, retirement and training programs for our merit employees and administrative personnel. 

Patents and Proprietary Technology 

Matrix Service Company&#8217;s subsidiaries have several patents and patents pending, and continue to pursue new ideas and innovations to better serve our customers in all areas of our business. The Flex-A-Span&#174; and Flex-A-Seal&#174; trademarks are utilized to market the Company&#8217;s unique seals for floating roof tanks. The FastFroth&#174; trademark is utilized to market the Company&#8217;s unique industrial cleaning process. Our patented RS 1000 Tank Mixer controls sludge build-up in crude oil tanks through resuspension. The Flexible Fluid Containment System patent covers a system that captures and contains flue leaking from pipe and valve connections. The Flex-A-Swivel patent refers to our unique pipe swivel joint assembly. Our patent for Spacerless or Geocomposite Double Bottom for Storage Tanks relates to a replacement bottom with leak detection and containment that allows for the retrofitting of an existing tank while minimizing the loss of capacity. The patent for the Training Tank for Personnel Entry, Exit and Rescue relates to a training device that can be used to train personnel on equipment that is made to simulate confined space scenarios. 

The Company also holds a perpetual license to use various patents and technologies related to LNG storage tanks, LIN/LOX storage tanks, LPG storage tanks and thermal vacuum chambers. 

While the Company&#8217;s intellectual property is not its main business, we believe that the ability to use these patents and technology enables us to expand our presence in the markets and minimizes the development costs typically associated with organic growth. 

&#32;7 

Regulation 

Health and Safety Regulations 

Our operations are subject to regulation by the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration (&#8220;OSHA&#8221;) and Mine Safety and Health Administration (&#8220;MSHA&#8221;), and to regulation under state laws and by the Canadian Workers&#8217; Compensation Board and its Workplace Health, Safety and Compensation Commission. Regulations promulgated by these agencies require employers and independent contractors to implement work practices, medical surveillance systems and personnel protection programs to protect employees from workplace hazards and exposure to hazardous chemicals and materials. In recognition of the potential for accidents within various scopes of work, these agencies have enacted strict and comprehensive safety regulations. The Company has established and consistently reinforces and monitors compliance with comprehensive programs intended to ensure that it complies with all applicable health and safety regulations to protect the safety of its workers, subcontractors and customers. While the Company believes that it operates safely and prudently, there can be no assurance that accidents will not occur or that the Company will not incur substantial liability in connection with the operation of its businesses. In order to minimize the financial exposure resulting from potential accidents associated with the Company's work, the Company maintains liability insurance to limit losses that could result from our work. 

Environmental 

The Company&#8217;s operations and the operations of its customers are subject to extensive and changing environmental laws and regulations. These laws and regulations relate primarily to air and water pollutants and the management and disposal of hazardous materials. The Company is exposed to potential liability for personal injury or property damage caused by any release, spill, exposure or other accident involving such pollutants, substances or hazardous materials. 

In order to limit costs incurred as a result of environmental exposure, the Company maintains contractor&#8217;s pollution liability insurance that covers liability that may be incurred as a result of accidental releases of hazardous materials. 

The Company believes that it is currently in compliance, in all material aspects, with all applicable environmental laws and regulations. The Company does not expect any material charges in subsequent periods relating to environmental conditions that currently exist and does not currently foresee any significant future capital spending relating to environmental matters.
