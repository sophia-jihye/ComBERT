 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

&#160; 

Envision invents, designs, and manufactures solar products and proprietary technology solutions targeting three verticals: electric vehicle charging infrastructure; out of home advertising infrastructure; and energy security and disaster preparedness. We focus on creating renewable energized powered platforms for electric vehicle (&#8220;EV&#8221;) charging, media and branding, and energy security which management believes are attractive, rapidly deployable, and of the highest quality. Management believes that our chief differentiator is our ability to invent, design, engineer, and manufacture solar powered products which are a complex integration of our own proprietary technology and other commonly available engineered components. The resulting products are built to have the longest life expectancy in the industry while also delivering valuable amenities and potentially highly attractive revenue opportunities for our customers. Management believes that Envision&#8217;s products deliver multiple layers of value including: impact free renewably energized EV charging; media, branding, and advertising platforms; sustainable and secure energy production; architectural enhancement; reduced carbon footprint; high visibility &#8220;green-halo&#8221; branding; reduction of net operating costs through reduced utility bills; and revenue creation opportunities through sales of digital out of home (&#8220;DOOH&#8221;) media. We believe our products can qualify for various federal, state and local incentives which could significantly reduce final out-of-pocket costs from our selling price for eligible customers. The Company sells its products to customers with requirements in one or more of the three verticals the Company addresses.

&#160;

Products and Technologies 

&#160;

The Company produces two categories of product: the EV ARC&#8482; product (Electric Vehicle Autonomous Renewable Charger) and the Solar Tree&#174; product. Both product lines incorporate the same underlying technology and value, but one in a transportable format and one in a fixed format.

&#160;

Leveraging the structural and technological attributes of its existing products, the Company has developed a patented product called EV ARC&#8482;. We have observed that the EV ARC&#8482; can solve many problems associated with electric vehicle charging infrastructure deployments and, we believe, is a product with a potentially large addressable market. Until now, the deployment of EV chargers could be hindered by complications in the site acquisition processes caused by the complicated and invasive processes required to fulfill the installation. Each EV charger requires a pedestal which is typically mounted to a poured concrete foundation which first requires excavation. Chargers also typically require a trench run to deliver grid connected electricity, and often require transformers and other local electrical equipment upgrades. Additional entitlements, easements, leases, and other site acquisition requirements may slow, or prevent entirely, the deployment of large numbers of chargers. When an EV charger is deployed successfully, the host may be liable for increased kilowatt hour charges and at times, more expensive demand charges. Landlords, corporations, venues, and other hosts often do not perceive enough value creation in the deployment of an EV charger, and as such, may not be inclined to grant permission to the service providers who approach them, or to install EV Chargers for their own employees and guests, because the costs and disruption associated with grid tied chargers can be prohibitive.

&#160;

We believe EV ARC&#8482; changes this paradigm completely because it is entirely self-contained and is delivered to the site ready to operate. It requires no foundation, trenching, concrete, electrical or civil works and is deployed in minutes. Its ballasted, high traction base pad creates a structurally sound platform that supports the rest of the structure. The solar array is connected via our EnvisionTrak&#8482; tracking solution to a column which is mounted to the ballasted pad. There is an electrical cabinet which is attractively integrated into the unit and in which various components enable the conversion of sunlight to electricity which is stored in on-board batteries, and the delivery of that electricity to the EV charging station. Incorporating battery storage means that an EV ARC&#8482; operates day and night. An EV ARC&#8482; delivers a clean source of power to any model of EV charger that is integrated into the structure. Envision continues to maintain a vendor agnostic stance in regards to EV charging, and as such, EV ARC&#8482; is designed to accept whichever EV charger the end customer chooses. The EV ARC&#8482; can be set up to charge up to three EVs at a time or multiple electric scooters or smaller electric vehicles.

&#160;

The Company has integrated a digital advertising screen onto the EV ARC&#8482; creating the EV ARC&#8482; Digital. This advertising screen is weather, theft, and vandalism resistant and will be powered entirely by the EV ARC&#8482;. The introduction of the advertising screen creates new potential revenue streams for the owner of the EV ARC&#8482; and we believe that this makes EV ARC&#8482; a more attractive product for certain prospective customers. This advancement could lead to multiple other similar uses of our products.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 2 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

EV ARC&#8482; also provides a highly reliable source of energy that is not susceptible to grid interruptions. Because EV ARC&#8482; has on-board energy storage, it can be used as a disaster preparedness tool. It is a reliable back up source of energy in times of emergency or grid failure caused by hurricanes, terrorism, cascading blackouts or other grid vulnerabilities. EV ARC&#8482; can be configured to allow only a select group, such as first responders, to access the solar generated and stored energy. A fireman or police officer will be able to connect, safely, to the EV ARC&#8482; and power any devices that would typically require a gasoline or diesel generator. We believe that the EV ARC&#8482; will be a much more reliable and cleaner source of energy than the electric grid or other traditional back up energy sources. The EV ARC&#8482; does not require the level of ongoing maintenance that a diesel or gasoline generator does and there is much less chance that it will not be operational in times of emergency as the first responders are not required to start it or fill it with fuel. We believe and, we have been told by our customers and prospects, that the triple use of EV charging, digital advertising and emergency energy production make the EV ARC&#8482; an extremely compelling value proposition.

&#160;

EV ARC&#8482; is designed to address the sizable market of EV charging infrastructure. The current lack of such infrastructure is the single greatest impediment to the adoption of EVs in the US and elsewhere. A standardized, easily deployable EV charger, which is renewably energized rather than relying on carbon based electrical energy, would appear to have significant appeal to those that are interested in the proliferation of EV&#8217;s and EV charging infrastructure. Management believes that the EV ARC&#8482; could generate significant sales in the coming months. We believe no competing company has a similar product, so the Company&#8217;s first-to-market position should create an opportunity for a share in the market interest. Last year, the State of California released an RFI (Request for Information) seeking vendors of &#8220;transportable, solar powered, EV chargers.&#8221; The State described the required solution and went on to cite Envision&#8217;s EV ARC&#8482; as exemplary of what they seek. The RFI closed in early March 2015 and we have been told by the State of California that no other vendors have produced a product which does what EV ARC&#8482; does.

&#160;

In July 2015 the Department of General Services of the State of California awarded us a one year contract, with options for the State to have two one-year extensions, to produce and sell the EV ARC&#8482; to any California state, local, or municipal agency that orders them from us. The State assigned an initial value of over $16 million for the first year of this contract and though we cannot be certain of how many orders we will receive, we believe initial indications are positive as evidenced by the purchase orders we are currently executing for Caltrans.

&#160;

Current EV ARC&#8482; customers include Google, Caltrans, New York City, Genentec, Johnson and Johnson, the City of Boulder, the City of Shasta and others.

&#160;

In the early stage of the production evolution for the EV ARC&#8482; with low volumes, the Company believed the appropriate selling price point would be lower than the actual initial costs of production. Management believes that certain production elements are maturing allowing for gross profit on future sales. These elements include possible production economies of scale, lower costs of components including the cost of battery storage which is currently a significant cost contributor, as well as design changes to allow for improved production processes and transportation. In October 2014, the Company opened up its own fabrication facility. With our own facility, management believes it is able to better control its production costs and realize potential manufacturing economies of scale as orders for the product continue to be accepted, thus decreasing our costs and ultimately leading to positive gross profit margins in the future.

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s patented Solar Tree&#174; structure has been in deployment and continued improvement for over seven years. During the last few years, the Solar Tree&#174; structure was redesigned from the ground up to incorporate what management felt were the best attributes of previous designs. We believe the resulting product has become the standard of quality in larger scale solar powered EV charging, energy security, and media and branding. We understand the Solar Tree&#174; product to be the only single column, bio mimicked, tracking, and architectural solar support structure with integrated energy storage and media platforms available today. We believe that Solar Tree&#174; products with integrated battery storage will become important contributors to the growing EV charging infrastructure requirements in California and the rest of the world. Because our products do not require a connection to the electrical grid, they can enable EV charging in locations where it would otherwise be impossible. For example, rest areas and park and ride locations which might have sufficient energy for lights and vending machines, but do not have sufficient power for EV charging can be served by our Solar Tree&#174; products which are optimized for direct current (&#8220;DC&#8221;) fast charging. The costs and environmental impact associated with delivering a 50kw circuit to a remote rest area may be prohibitive whereas a Solar Tree&#174; direct current fast charger (&#8220;DCFC&#8221;) can be deployed in a matter of days with minimal site disturbance. Management believes that our relationship with Caltrans, which is currently limited to the sale of EV ARC&#8482; systems, can be leveraged to enable sales of our larger and more expensive Solar Tree&#174; products. We further believe that success with Caltrans might be leveraged with other departments of transportation across the United States and the rest of the world.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 3 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

We believe Solar Tree&#174; products with on-board battery storage can provide a highly reliable source of energy to be used in the event of a failure of the grid. Grid failures cost businesses in the United States approximately $200 billion per year and when those failures impact vital services such as hospitals, they have been responsible for loss of life. We believe that a hospital equipped with Solar Tree&#174; energy security products could benefit both economically and from a life safety point of view. We believe that there are many other such instances where the reliable combination of renewable energy and energy storage can deliver value which exceeds simply competing with the utility.

&#160;

The Company has invented and incorporated EnvisionTrak&#8482;, its patented and proprietary tracking solution, to all of its products, furthering the unique nature of the product and we believe increasing the Company&#8217;s technological leadership within the industry. We believe EnvisionTrak&#8482; to be a complex integration of the highest quality gearing, electrical motors, and controls which are combined in a robust, highly engineered, and supremely reliable manner. While there are many tracking solutions available to the solar industry, we believe EnvsionTrak&#8482; is the only tracking solution which causes the solar array to orient itself in alignment with the sun without swinging, rotating, or leaving its lineal alignment with the parking spaces below. We believe this is a vital attribute in solar shaded parking as any swinging or rotating of the arrays could result in impeding the flow of traffic, particularly first responders such as fire trucks, in the drive aisles. It is a violation of many local codes to have restricted overhead clearance in the drive aisles. EnvisionTrak&#8482; has been demonstrated, through data obtained from our past customers, to significantly increase electrical production, but perhaps a greater value is the high visual appeal created by Solar Tree&#174; structures which are tracking the sun in perfect synchronicity.

&#160;

The Solar Tree&#174; structure&#8217;s canopy measures 35&#8217;X35&#8217; and covers between six and eight parking spaces. Envision has also developed a single parking space version of the product that leverages the same technology, components, and architectural qualities, but is one tenth the size and less expensive. The Solar Tree&#174; Socket is designed for tight locations and offers customer budget flexibility. It has been produced by the Company to broaden the addressable market for its technology.

&#160;

The Company has also began deploying its latest generation of Solar Tree&#174; products, the Solar Tree&#174; HVLC (High Value, Low Cost) array. This new Solar Tree&#174; product incorporates our latest engineering and fabrication improvements. This newly engineered product has allowed us to reduce costs and time to deploy Solar Tree&#174; structures. We have observed many improvements in the fabrication and installation process during the initial deployments of this product. We anticipate further improvements to Solar Tree&#174; in the future.

&#160;

We also believe that Solar Tree&#174; products optimized for branding can create visually stunning platforms for the delivery of a business&#8217;s brand message with a less onerous planning and entitlement process than traditional signage might expect.

&#160;

Envision continues to identify other complimentary product offerings and enhancements to current offerings, and is in the design, engineering, and patenting phase on certain such products.

&#160;

We strive to produce products integrating only the highest quality components available. The Company&#8217;s production philosophy is to invest in quality design, components and integration so as to ensure the lowest costs of warranty and service in the industry, while maintaining and growing a brand which is already recognized as one of the leading producers of the highest quality solar products available.

&#160;

The Company produces a series of products which management believes offer multiple layers of value to its customers leveraging the same underlying technology and fabrication techniques and infrastructure. This enables the Company to reach a broad customer base with varied product offerings without maintaining the overhead normally associated with a diverse set of products.

&#160;

Operations 

&#160;

The Company is headquartered in San Diego, California in a 31,350 sq/ft building located in an industrial park. The building houses the Company&#8217;s corporate operations, sales, design, engineering and product manufacturing.

&#160;

In the current location the design, engineering and fabrication disciplines are housed under one roof. Changes, improvements and developments in the product can be quickly communicated between the disciplines such that opportunities to improve efficiency and quality or to reduce costs can be more readily taken advantage of. Scheduling of product fabrication is under the Company&#8217;s control allowing management, rather than a third party vendor, to make decisions about priorities.

&#160;

The challenges associated with setting up the fabrication facility, and with finding the human capital to make it operational, have been significant and are ongoing, but management believes that we are already experiencing improvements in our products and processes, as well as cost decreases in many of the components and processes required to produce them.

&#160;

One example of this has been the prototyping and testing of our new transportation trailer for our EV ARC&#8482; products. ARC Mobility is a specialized trailer which carries an EV ARC&#8482; structure to the customer location and will set it in a parking space without using specialized equipment like 18 wheeled trucks or forklifts. The ARC Mobility&#8482; trailer is towed to the site behind a pick-up truck much like a boat trailer. The driver &#8220;parks&#8221; the unit in a space and is single handedly able to disconnect the trailer and drive away. This development has allowed us to significantly reduce the delivery costs of these products.

&#160;

ARC Mobility was designed, engineered and fabricated in our new facility. This is a example of the impact our new facility is having on our ability to grow the Company successfully.

&#160;

The EV ARC&#174; and Solar Tree&#174; structures are being built and assembled in this new facility. We believe this fabrication facility may enable the Company to reduce direct costs associated with individual products with the right scale while enabling us to better control quality. We believe the facility may further enable the Company to make improvements to existing products and also to introduce new products in a much more timely and efficient manner. Management believes that the product development process could be significantly faster and less expensive when carried out by an in-house fabrication facility. The Company intends to continue to outsource installation and deployment of its products, and as further improvements and standards are attained, it is management&#8217;s belief the Company can continue to reduce (a) the amount of installation resources required in the field and (b) the Company&#8217;s need to supervise those resources.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 5 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Management believes that the continuation of the Company&#8217;s strategy to create highly engineered, highly scalable products which are delivered complete or as a kit of parts to the customer site, and which require minimal planning, entitlement, or field labor activities, is further positioning the Company as a leader in the provision of unique and highly scalable solutions to the three market verticals it targets. The Company&#8217;s products are complex but standardized and readily deployable and reduce the exposure of the Company and its customers to the risks and inherent margin erosion that are incumbent in field deployments. The Company continues to execute in its transition away from being involved in the field installation of its Solar Tree&#174; products, instead selling them as a kit to be installed by others. The EV ARC&#8482; product family requires no field installation work and is typically delivered to the customer site by the Company for a fee.

&#160;

The Company intends to systematize the fabrication of its products such that during times of rapid or international expansion the Company could export its designs and fabrication processes to a variety of subcontracted or subsidiary fabricators. Product and process development will continue to be undertaken at the Company headquarters, but spikes in demand can be processed by qualified subcontractors using Envision designs and fabrication processes.

&#160;

The Company continues to bring engineering improvements to its products that are designed to increase the level of standardization and reduce the field labor and effort required for product deployment. The EV ARC&#8482; is the embodiment of this strategy in that it requires almost no field activity beyond &#8220;parking&#8221; it in a space. Wherever possible, the components of the Solar Tree&#174; structures are factory integrated and assembled such that complete assemblies are delivered to customer sites with a regularly decreasing level of field installation activity required. This allows the Company to reduce risks associated with field work such as weather, labor deficiencies, and accidents. Our strategy also helps enable us to better control future labor costs through mass production in a factory environment and the avoidance of prevailing wage, union, or other labor related conditions which may be outside of the Company&#8217;s control on deployment sites. This improvement in products, standardization, and modularization has enabled the Company to significantly reduce field deployment timeframes.

&#160;

Management believes that the Company has significant operating leverage through the deliberate continued leveraging of certain outsourced resources. All intellectual property is developed in-house. Product designs are then vetted by third-party structural and electrical engineering firms to ensure that the designs meet the jurisdictional requirements and codifications for the deployment locations. We believe this further helps dissipate any potential liabilities for the structural and electrical elements by providing additionally insured experts with partial responsibility for the designs.

&#160;

Envision's proprietary technology is described and covered through various patented and patent-pending intellectual properties. Management believes innovation and the ability to create multiple layers of value beyond competing with utility-produced electricity are key differentiators for the Company.

&#160;

Sales and Marketing 

&#160;

Leading up to the current period, the Company concentrated a sizable portion of its resources on product development and engineering. Management believes that we now have a reproducible suite of products which address the three market verticals we address (EV charging infrastructure; out of home advertising infrastructure; and renewable energy production), and as a result, we intend to increase our focus on sales and marketing efforts in 2016.

&#160;

Our current sales activities are undertaken in the following manners:

&#160;

&#183; Direct sales efforts undertaken by our &#8220;in-house&#8221; sales team, &#183; Direct sales efforts undertaken by other independent contractors, &#183; Direct sales efforts as a result of management relationships. &#160;

Our marketing efforts are responsible for the generation of many of our sales leads and have consisted of the following:

&#160;

&#183; Web Site and limited search engine optimization, &#183; Direct electronic mailings to prospects within our target markets, &#183; Social Media outreach on Facebook, Twitter, and Linkedin, &#183; Video postings on YouTube and Vimeo, &#183; Distribution of printed materials promoting our products, &#183; Attendance at trade shows and conferences, often with live demonstrations of EV ARC&#8482;, &#183; Industry speaking engagements and SME panel participation across the United States, &#183; Media interviews in print, radio and TV, &#183; Industry specific trade magazine advertising. 

&#160;

&#160; 6 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Examples of the audiences we target are:

&#160;

&#183; Corporations, &#160; &#183; Outdoor advertising companies, &#160; &#183; Automotive related companies, &#160; &#183; Municipalities, &#160; &#183; State government, &#160; &#183; Utilities, &#160; &#183; Commercial real estate. 

&#160;

Leads come to the company through the &#8220;Contact Us&#8221; page on our web site or through direct calls to our 800 and local phone line as well as through direct introductions and &#8220;cold calling&#8221;. When leads are received, they are distributed to one of our sales and business development managers. The sales manager contacts the customer prospect, ascertains their needs, and develops a proposal to address those needs. In most cases where EV ARC&#8482; sales are concerned, the sales manager can prepare and present a proposal without input from management or technical teams because EV ARC&#8482; pricing is set and there are generally no site or installation considerations. In the case of our Solar Tree&#174; products, proposals are generated using a set format and with input from the technical and operational teams with input and final sign-off by management.

&#160;

Sales and business development team members may receive a mixture of base and performance based pay. They are paid a percentage of revenue only when the company actually receives payment from our customers.

&#160;

We also have independently contracted sales resources that are purely paid based upon performance. They are paid a percentage of revenue only when the company actually receives payment from our customers. Our team will assist such contractors in the creation of proposal documents when the prospective sale appears to warrant the commitment of resources to such an activity. These contractors are responsible for their own costs except in some instances where the Company&#8217;s management pre-approves an expenditure aimed at winning a sales contract.

&#160;

We are increasingly exploring the use of sales channels to communicate the value of and sell our products. Examples of the types of channels we seek are:

&#160;

&#183; Upstream vendors such as solar module manufacturers, inverter manufacturers, EVSE manufactures, &#183; EV charging service providers, &#183; Outdoor advertising companies &#183; General contractors, &#183; Architects, &#183; Engineers and consultants. &#160;

Our channel sales initiative is intended to significantly increase the exposure of our product to a broader audience without investment or other resource allocations on the part of the Company. We are currently working with a solar module vendor who has included our EV ARC&#8482; in a sales presentation they have made to a major global retail brand. We are in preliminary discussions with general contractors who wish to offer our products as part of their offering. We have deployed many of the top EV charging station brands, and are increasingly attempting to educate their teams as to the value of increasing their own sales through the offering of our products as a means to execute deployments which might not otherwise be possible.

&#160;

During 2016 we plan to deliver the EV ARC&#8482; on our ARC Mobility&#8482; trailer to a variety of locations during a &#8220;Gorilla&#8221; marketing road show. The EV ARC&#8482; will be delivered to corporate campuses in major California cities such as San Diego, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Silicon Valley. We will pre-announce the free availability of solar powered EV charging &#8211; &#8220;Driving on Sunshine&#8221; &#8211; through the human resource and marketing departments of the host companies. It is hoped that the host companies and their employees will see the ease of deployment and the value of highly visible solar powered EV charging, and as a result, buy our products. We believe that this will be an exciting manner in which to raise awareness about the unique values our products deliver. We intend to attract the attention of local news media and dignitaries which will further increase our exposure.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 7 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

During the holiday season of 2015 our EV ARC&#8482; product was featured at Westfield Shopping Towns in San Diego, California. Westfield offered free solar powered EV charging to guests at the mall and enabled donations to veterans&#8217; causes with Envision. We arranged for this activity to draw attention to the Company and the EVARC&#8482; product which was equipped with a digital screen to promote both the EV ARC&#8482; and our ability to enable outdoor advertising. We believe that the veterans&#8217; cause with which we are working will further enhance the Company's image. We believe that the installation of the EV ARC&#8482; digital in these circumstances will create opportunities in the retail market and in the outdoor advertising market.

&#160;

Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

Envision owns the registered trademarks Solar Grove&#174; and Solar Tree&#174; structures.

&#160;

The Company has been issued three patents: one for our Solar Tree &#174; structure (patent No. 7,705,277) one for EnvisionTrak&#8482; (a dual-synchronous tracking system for its Solar Tree&#174; structures) (patent No. 8,648,551) and as of December 8, 2015, we were granted a patent for our EV ARC&#8482; product (patent No. 9209648).

&#160;

Key Initiatives 

&#160;

International &#8211; We believe that our products solve the same problems globally that they solve in the United States and in the same ways. We believe our ability to export our intellectual property and our knowledge is better than it has ever been. We have adapted our products so that they are shipped in a standard shipping container. We have moved away from a project sales model to a product sales model so that we do not have to be on site when our products are installed which, we believe, means that we can ship products anywhere in the world leaving any installation work to local resources. We also believe that the learning we gained in putting a fabrication facility in place, inexpensively, to fabricate our products could allow us to rapidly scale in international markets.

&#160;

Our current international focuses are in Spain, the European Union (&#8220;EU&#8221;), and Fujian Province in China. In Spain, we continue to work with Aconfort, a Spanish company with whom we have a three-year relationship. Acnfort recently secured a building in Andalusia, which is very similar to ours. Aconfort has represented that the sole purpose of this decision on its part (and at its cost) is to sell EV ARC&#8482; units in Europe. We have registered the name Envision Europe SA and we plan to send the EV ARC&#8482; to Spain early in 2016. We expect that initially, EV ARC&#8482; will be shipped in pieces to Spain where it will be reassembled by Envision Europe personnel (these will be Aconfort employees in the early stages). Certain components such as solar modules and gears, which are subject to tariffs when imported to the EU, will be sourced locally to reduce costs. Because the units arrive in the EU in pieces and are assembled by EU employees, we believe that we will not be subjected to completed product duties. As the market for our products expands, we plan to hire employees and take on more of the fabrication tasks in Spain while reducing the components we ship from the United States. As quickly as the market will support this, we intend to become self-sufficient in the EU. It is our intention to form a subsidiary in Spain and we are currently working with lawyers in the United States and EU to help ensure that we choose the most efficient and safest structure which will maximize our European opportunities while shielding us in the United States from any risk associated with the EU venture to the greatest extent possible.

&#160;

According to the government, China will spend $200 billion on EV charging infrastructure over the next decade. According to industry publications, China is the fastest growing market for digital outdoor advertising in the world. China&#8217;s requirements for energy security products are massive and growing rapidly due to electricity interruptions according to Chinese governmental agencies.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

In China, we are working with Fuzhou Rongzheng Technology Company (&#8220;Fuzhou&#8221;) in Fujian Province. Our initial relationship with this group is for business development. We believe that Fuzhou is currently doing business with state owned companies and regional government players who we would like to target as customers for our products, and as such, have existing relationships. We intend to test the market through these relationships and then expand our capabilities in China as demand dictates. The terms of our brokerage contract dictate that we pay our Chinese partners a success fee only when we sign contracts and sell products. We have sole discretion over whether or not we sign contracts. We believe that there may be opportunities to partner with companies in Fujian to produce our products jointly. There may also be opportunities to create Envision China with combinations of Chinese and other investment. For this reason, we have entered into a separate agreement (the &#8220;Cooperation Agreement&#8221;) with our partners to enlist their aid in discovering opportunities to partner with existing entities or to set up a new venture to produce our products in Fujian. The terms of the Cooperation Agreement only call for us to pay our partners in the event that we are successful in our endeavors. They will be paid with equity in the resulting entity only and we believe they have, as a result, parallel interests to ours where the success of Envision in China is concerned. We have specifically targeted partners who are not currently engaged in solar or EV charging, but do business with our target audience, as a means to reduce the threat of intellectual property infringement, circumvention, or competition. Our strategy relies on our ability to ally ourselves with Chinese partners who are powerful, well positioned, and see an opportunity to grow with our help (rather than use our intellectual property without us). We believe that our Chinese partners, who include the president of the Fujian Chamber of Commerce, are well respected and well connected. We engaged a United States based attorney with 25 years of experience in crafting relationships between United States and Chinese companies to ensure that the agreements we signed were as safe as possible and matched or exceeded historical standards of fairness and equity.

&#160;

We believe that our international efforts could represent a significant set of new, large, and growing opportunities for the Company.

&#160;

ARC Mobility&#8482; - We have observed that the commercialization of our ARC Mobility transportation solution has revolutionized the way that we deliver our EV ARC&#8482; product to our customers. We believe that EV ARC&#8482; is already the most easily deployed EV charging solution available today. ARC Mobility makes it even easier and as a result, we believe, it could help increase the product&#8217;s penetration and sales. We intend to have multiple ARC&#8482; Mobility trailers in service transporting EV ARC&#8482; products all over the country. We have already sold the first ARC Mobility unit to a large customer and we hope to sell many more to customers who are interested in moving EV ARC&#8482; systems around their facilities. For example, ARC Mobility&#8482; has reduced our cost to deliver EV ARC&#8482; products to the San Francisco Bay Area from approximately $5,000 to approximately $1,000. This level of cost reduction is typical for ARC Mobility&#8482; deliveries when compared to our previous method which involved renting forklifts at both ends of the delivery and using commercial trucking companies with specialized trailers to deliver the units.

&#160;

Out Door Advertising (OOH) - We are in discussions with two outdoor advertising companies with whom we hope to collaborate to deploy EV ARC&#8482; Digital in multiple locations. We have secured an agreement with ACE Parking to deploy EV ARC&#8482; Digital in their parking lots across San Diego and more broadly. We seek an advertising partner to monetize the value of the advertising screens. To date, we have an agreement with one OOH company to sell the advertising space. We have an agreement with ACE Parking to deploy our EV ARC&#8482; Digital products in key locations in downtown San Diego, California, free of charge. We have walked these locations with an OOH company which has confirmed that they will allow for sufficient visibility of our screens to make an attractive advertising platform. The OOH company identified 60 initial locations in San Diego which the company believes will generate advertising revenue using our EV ARC&#8482; Digital. We will continue to develop relationships with OOH providers and we are currently working with a senior executive in the advertising operations (&#8220;AdOps&#8221;) industry to explore other methods of securing advertising content (revenue) for our EV ARC&#8482; Digital in San Diego locations. With success in San Diego, management plans to endeavor to expand our EV ARC&#8482; Digital network to other cities. Management believes that the combination of our transportable, solar powered EV chargers with digital and static advertising may present a very significant growth opportunity for the Company.

State and Local Government &#8211; Envision&#8217;s EV ARC&#8482; product was recently named in a State of California RFI for transportable, solar powered EV chargers. As far as we are aware, there were no other respondents with products which qualified, which further supports our belief that EV ARC&#8482; is a product which is unique to the Company. Members of staff of the State of California have commented to us that they believe that they are behind goals where the deployment of EV charging infrastructure is concerned. In June 2015, we were awarded a contract to supply EV ARCS&#8482; to California state agencies (to the extent ordered by them) by the Department of General Services of the State of California, for a term of one year with two optional one year renewal periods. We believe that the major impediments to the deployment of EV chargers are the requirements for civil works such as trenching and foundations, as well as limited access to sufficient electrical circuits to support EV charging in the locations where it is needed. Envision&#8217;s products do not require access to utility grid circuits, and as such are perfect for remote locations such as rest areas and park &#38; rides. Our EV ARC&#8482; products can be deployed in minutes and our Solar Tree&#174; DCFC can provide over 600 e miles per day through DC fast chargers which will deliver a full charge to a Nissan Leaf (for example) in 20 minutes or so. We believe that this makes our products ideal for many of the State of California&#8217;s goals for the electrification of transportation, and as such, we are aggressively targeting the state with face to face meetings and educational materials. We believe that if we are successful with the State of California and Caltrans, then it is not unreasonable to expect that we can expand sales to other states, the federal government, and the Department of Defense. During a meeting with the City of New York, city officials informed Envision&#8217;s CEO that being listed on California&#8217;s state approved vendor&#8217;s list will make a purchase by the City of New York easier. New York City made its first purchase of EV ARC&#8482; products during the third quarter of 2015. New York&#8217;s Mayor Deblasio recently announced what the city believes is the most aggressive EV adoption targets of any major city anywhere. The city&#8217;s goals call for over 2,000 EVs to enter the city&#8217;s fleets during the next few years with an investment of $50 to $80 million over the next 10 years to support additional charging infrastructure. Based on our relationship with New York City, we believe that our products are ideal for New York City&#8217;s infrastructure plans due to our lack of requirements for trenching, foundations, or electrical circuitry which can be hard to find in a city with aging infrastructure. Management believes that New York City and other similar large metropolises constitute a potentially significant growth opportunity for the Company.

&#160;

EV ARC&#8482; Containerized &#8211; We are starting to see increased interest from overseas markets for our products. We are in the process of extending elements of our IP protection to Europe and China. We have designed EV ARC&#8482; to be transportable, and within the Continental United States, we can now transport it using either our ARC Mobility&#8482; trailer or commercial trucking companies. Management and the technology team have invented, tested, and delivered a design modification which allows us to effectively collapse the EV ARC&#8482; for containerization with a simple expansion process at the destination which does not require sophisticated personnel, tools or significant time. Our first successful delivery of such a unit was made to New York City during the third quarter of 2015. We are producing more EV ARC&#8482; &#8220;Transformers&#8221; for the Caribbean and Europe. Management believes that our ability to ship EV ARC&#8482; products in commercial container units will allow us to address overseas and distant markets in a way which has not been possible up until the successful testing and delivery of Transformer ARC&#8482;. We believe global growth in EV charging, Out Of Home advertising, and energy security is vibrant. We believe that our ability to ship product worldwide will allow us to take advantage of these global opportunities.

&#160;

New Fabrication Facility &#8211; The Company moved into a new fabrication facility in October 2014 which also houses the Company&#8217;s corporate headquarters. With this facility, the Company itself performs a significant portion of the manufacturing, as well as assembly, of our products. Management has observed that this facility has reduced the direct labor costs associated with manufacturing our individual products. Management also believes that, with the right scale, the direct cost reductions on individual products will translate to overall positive gross margin, while allowing maximum flexibility and control in the delivery and quality of the finished goods. Further, the facility is allowing us to make improvements to existing products and introduce new products in a more timely and efficient manner.

&#160;

Solar Tree&#174; Structure Product/Technology Development - the Company is continuing to improve the designs and efficiencies of its products. Significant emphasis is placed on innovation which we believe enables higher quality with increased deployment efficiency and reduced deployment risk. Fabrication and installation methodologies which replace labor with mechanized processes are favored. The Company's design, fabrication, and procurement processes are under constant improvement to increase efficiency and control costs.

&#160;

ARC&#8482; Technology is the integration of storage into all existing Envision Solar products. Battery storage removes the intermittency of electrical delivery often cited as a reason for not taking advantage of renewable energy. We believe Envision Solar is positioning itself to be a leader in the convergence of renewable energy generation and storage. We believe our EV ARC&#8482; product is an elegant embodiment of this convergence. The Company plans to continue to commit engineering resources to this space with the intention of making all products storage capable starting with the Solar Tree&#174; array, which already has a large hollow space in its existing column which we believe could be suited for the elegant placement of battery storage technologies. The battery storage market is nascent, and according to industry analysts, poised for growth in the coming months and years. Management intends that the Company be a leader in the integration of renewable energy products with battery storage solutions.

The Market and the Verticals addressed 

&#160;

Envision has created a suite of products which management believes are unique, compelling, and ideally suited to address the following market verticals:

&#160;

1. Outdoor Advertising, 2. Electric Vehicle Charging, and 3. Energy Security. &#160;

Management has observed that industry analysts and experts believe that each of these market verticals has:

&#160;

a) Annual spending in the billions, b) A global marketplace, c) Significant growth, and 

d) A compelling need for the products Envision produces. &#160; 

Outdoor Advertising 

As the value of traditional advertising media such as television, radio, and print diminishes, advertisers in the United States and abroad are looking for new outlets to capture the attention of consumers. Management believes that industry experts believe that there will be significant growth in spending on outdoor advertising platforms such as billboards. We believe this is particularly true relative to digital content. The DOOH (digital out of home) industry, from what we understand, is enjoying a period of rapid growth and may continue to do so for the foreseeable future. Management has seen statistics suggesting DOOH and other outdoor advertising spending exceeded $7B in the United States and $25B globally in 2014, with massive potential markets such as China just beginning to enter the marketplace.

&#160;

While we believe there is a great deal of pent up demand for billboard spending in the United States, there are also significant barriers to the widespread deployment of the infrastructure, which we believe enhance our competitive position:

&#160;

a) Entitlement &#8211; traditional billboards are increasingly difficult to take through the permitting and zoning process. Some jurisdictions have outlawed them entirely. b) Public perception &#8211; the value of billboard advertising becomes questionable when the constituency views the medium as anti-social, as is often the case with traditional billboards. c) Energy Costs &#8211; lit and digital billboards are major energy consumers. d) Content updates &#8211; billboards can be slow and costly to update. e) Civil engineering and construction &#8211; billboards require costly installations and electrical connections. &#160;

We believe Envision has products that solve each of the above impediments to billboard and DOOH infrastructure deployments.

&#160;

Because the Envision products are renewably energized, they are shrouded in what is often referred to as the &#8220;Green Halo.&#8221; We believe that the green/sustainable aspect of our products can make them more likely to win approval through the entitlement process, while also making them more popular with an increasingly environmentally-conscious public. The dual effect, we believe, is that our products may be deployable in locations where traditional billboards may be denied. We believe these products will be more popular with an advertisers&#8217; intended audience and, as a result, advertisers may be willing to pay for them either as a capital purchase or through an existing payment schedule they have with vendors such as Lemar, Clear Channel or JC Decaux. Envision plans to sell products either directly to the end user or to one of the brokerages. We do not currently intend to sell space to content providers as there are other well established companies doing that to which we can sell. Technology advances in advertising operations are making it increasingly possible to place digital content on advertising screens through the leveraging of automated platforms. Google is piloting programs in the United Kingdom for place and time based advertising on digital screens. Management is meeting with various companies involved in the automatic placement of digital content on outdoor screens to ascertain whether there is a model which will allow us to successfully monetize the EV ARC&#8482; Digital without the active involvement of a third party which will increase direct costs. Management also intends to endeavor to engage with Google in this space. Google is a current customer, buying and using EV ARC&#8482; for workplace charging. We believe Google&#8217;s interest in transportation, renewable energy, and advertising potentially makes it a highly suitable partner with whom Envision can further its OOH aspirations.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 11 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Because our products produce more energy than they consume through the display of advertising content, they do not have ongoing operating expenses associated with energy costs. In fact, they can also support other local energy requirements such as lighting or, even more politically important, EV charging infrastructure or disaster preparedness.

&#160;

Each of our products can be equipped with a WAN (Wide Area Network) connection that can be used to monitor the condition and performance of the unit. This WAN connection can be used equally to deliver content updates to our products&#8217; advertising screens and to network the products so that they can be intelligently linked to one another as well as to local consumers through NFC (Near Field Communications). This means that our products can be deployed without any connection to power or telecommunications while delivering the same value as those that have gone through expensive construction processes to connect to power and data.

&#160;

Electric Vehicle Charging 

The growth rates in electric vehicle sales and, as a result, the requirements for supporting infrastructure are impressive. To date, the deployment of electric vehicle service equipment (&#8220;EVSE&#8221;) has not met the goals set by federal or state governments or any of the larger companies currently engaged in the space. The reasons for the delays are numerous but the main impediments include the following:

&#160;

&#160; a) Site Acquisition &#8211; identifying and leasing/controlling locations b) Entitlement &#8211; permitting and zoning requirements c) Civil Works &#8211; foundations and trenching d) Inability to move the EVSE once deployed e) Energy &#8211; sources and cost of energy &#160; f) Telemetry &#8211; communications with the EV chargers &#160;

We believe the Envision EV ARC&#8482; is the world&#8217;s first and only transportable, solar powered EV charger. Because it produces and stores all its own energy, it does not need a grid connection and therefore needs no trenching, switch gear, or transformer upgrades. Management believes the lack of a foundation or trench means that in most jurisdictions the EV ARC&#8482; will not need a building permit and we have found that to be the case in every jurisdiction in which it has been deployed to date. It is immune to grid interruptions such as black outs or brown outs. As such, it will allow for vehicle charging even in times of grid failure. It can be moved at any time because it is not connected to the ground or grid, and we believe, creates an attractive and highly visible branding asset for the host. There are no utility bills to pay and, as the number of EVs increase on the host campuses, more EV ARC&#8482; units can be added with a continued lack of disruption.

&#160;

EV ARC&#8482; can also be set to provide emergency power to users such as first responders during times of emergency or other grid failures. Because the EV ARC&#8482; replenishes its batteries every day, even during cloudy conditions, we believe that it is one of the most robust and reliable back up energy sources available today.

&#160;

EV ARC&#8482; can be grid connected if the customer wishes. In the second quarter of 2015, we delivered the first EV ARC&#8482; products that we have sold to a utility. The utility connected the EV ARC&#8482; units to the grid. The EV ARC&#8482; products provide solar powered EV charging, but they also serve as grid stability tools. During times of low energy usage the utility will charge the EV ARC&#8482; on board batteries. During times of grid stress, the utility takes energy from EV ARC&#8482; batteries thus reducing stress on their generation assets and grid infrastructure. We believe that &#8220;Grid Balancing&#8221; offers a potentially significant market opportunity for Envision&#8217;s products as electrical grids become increasingly unstable due to increased demand, aging infrastructure, and extreme weather events. Experts from utilities such as San Diego Gas &#38; Electric have told us that this is the case and that distributed storage is an important part of their future plans.

&#160;

We believe these factors make the EV ARC&#8482; a very compelling value proposition to anyone who intends to install such devices. A corporate customer can deploy EV charging quickly, efficiently, and without digging up its parking lots. The positive carbon foot print impact is greater because the EV ARC&#8482; uses sunlight to charge the employees&#8217; EVs and, we believe, the marketing and branding impact is far greater because the enterprise has a highly visible demonstration of its commitment to the environment.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 12 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

We believe Envision Solar&#8217;s larger Solar Tree&#174; structures also make perfect EVSE locations. Considering the list of impediments to EV infrastructure deployments, we believe that the Solar Tree&#174; structure with column integrated CleanCharge&#8482; EV chargers offers significant advantages over a typical grid tied EV charger. We believe that they offer the most attractive and practical mounting assets for fixed EV charging stations. The single column design is ideal for centrally locating multiple chargers and making them available to the maximum number of spaces. Entitlement might go more smoothly because the Solar Tree&#174; structures contribute more benefits to the local environment than simple EV chargers. Those additional benefits include shade, reduction in heat islanding, reduction in light pollution, architectural accretion, reduction in grid stress, and even disaster preparedness when equipped with ARC&#8482; technology. We believe that commercial real estate owners and corporate campuses will recognize the multiple layers of increased value delivered by Solar Tree&#174; structures and CleanCharge&#8482; deployed with little disruption to their facilities.

&#160;

Solar Tree&#174; structures with ARC&#8482; technology energy storage could generate and store enough energy to provide over 600 e miles per day through any high quality EV charger including DC fast chargers. They could be deployed in any location that is not shaded and will not require any utility grid connection. We believe that this vital factor makes them a compelling choice for remote locations where there is inadequate utility grid connection (e.g. remote rest areas). Corridor charging, the term used to describe EV charging on highways between built up areas, is recognized as being very important, but also very difficult to achieve with traditional grid tied chargers because of the lack of electrical circuits and the environmental and economic impact of bringing infrastructure to remote sites. We believe that our Solar Tree&#174; and EV ARC&#8482; products are ideal for corridor charging because they do not need to connect to the electrical grid. Additionally, where the requirement is for charging of mission critical vehicles (e.g. first responders, hospitals), Solar Tree&#174; and EV ARC&#8482; products can provide a highly robust and secure source of energy even when the grid is not available. Unlike gasoline or diesel powered generators, our products are not reliant on external sources of fuel and, we believe, require much less maintenance, testing and service. It is our further contention that any campus environment with an EV charging need and a wish for a high degree of reliability in its electrical supply can benefit from our Solar Tree&#174; structures with ARC&#8482; on-board energy storage because, we believe, in times of grid instability (e.g. natural disaster, terrorism, capacity constraints), the Envision products could provide the most reliable source of energy at the location.

&#160;

Management believes that so called &#8220;range anxiety&#8221; is one of the top two reasons that customers are not buying EVs. We believe that our products can contribute in a significant and material manner to reducing range anxiety. As a result, we believe that any company or governmental entity that views the roll out of EV charging infrastructure as important to its business could reasonably be expected to become our customer.

&#160;

Energy Security 

&#160;

Envision was initially conceived as an entity structured to provide architectural and design services to customers looking for shaded parking solutions. The Company invented the Solar Tree&#174; product line that we believe still provides the best option for solar and shade generation in parking lots. Now, with the introduction of the newest Envision product, the Solar Tree&#174; HVLC (high value low cost) array, we believe that we can be competitive in many purely energy focused projects as well. Management believes that the opportunity in energy resilience offers opportunities for differentiation from our competition and growth in sales. We believe that many customers already view energy security as more important than cheap energy.

&#160;

Using solar power to reduce an entity&#8217;s utility bill is not new and is now a highly competitive market. Envision believes that the growth in energy security products will create a significant opportunity for the Company. We have overcome many hurdles inherent in the production of reliable, cost effective, stand alone, renewable energy generation and storage solutions. Our EV ARC&#8482; product is essentially a micro-grid which generates, stores, and makes available, day or night, clean, reliable electrical energy. This technology is already offering our customers an option to back up generators or other expensive measures which they feel compelled to take to safeguard their increasingly important energy supplies. Many of our customers have expressed that they view the fact that EVs can charge from our products even when the utility grid fails as one of the key components in their decision to buy. Their ability to connect external devices to the EV ARC&#8482; power outlets and &#8220;shore power&#8221; cable may allow them to eliminate the need for gasoline or diesel generators where EV ARC&#8482; is deployed.

&#160;

Power outages cost the United States $200 billion per year according to the Department of Energy. A report in the Wall Street Journal stated that the United States is nine key sub stations away from a total black out, and further reported that if one of a few transformer companies who could supply the hardware to repair the sub stations was also disabled, that the black outs would last 18 months. We believe that energy security will be an important growth market and that our Solar Tree&#174; and EV ARC&#8482; products with ARC technology energy storage can address this and provide possible growth opportunities.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 13 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Distributed generation photovoltaic solar projects have historically been rooftop or adjacent property installations. Rooftops have a number of inherent problems that are avoided by utilizing parking lots and the top levels of parking structures for solar installations. Rooftops are populated with mechanical equipment, vents, skylights, elevator overruns and most importantly, roofing materials and systems including waterproof membranes, that require maintenance, are warranted, and must be replaced often &#8211; more often than solar PV products. Rooftops are also limited in the area which is required for large scale energy production by PV systems. The low returns generated by many roof top and adjacent property solar deployments are often not sufficient inducement to a real estate owner to expose themselves to the encumbrance and risks associated with those sorts of deployments, which in part, might explain the relatively low adoption of this otherwise beneficial technology.

&#160;

There are over 800 million parking spaces in the United States. We believe there are numerous reasons that parking lots are preferable locations, in many cases, to building rooftops, which we believe accounts for the rapid growth of the solar parking array market. Parking lots are large, unobstructed, sun-drenched areas that are easily accessible during project construction. They have no waterproofing issues and benefit significantly from shade for both cars and drivers. In addition, our products emphasize &#8220;Solar You Can See!&#8221; as rooftop solar can&#8217;t be seen in most cases. Solar parking arrays, on the other hand, are experienced and enjoyed by employees and visitors. With the installation of a solar parking array, a previously barren and unpleasant parking lot could become a cool, shady, area where everyone can directly experience clean solar energy generation, shade, and soft safe lighting at night. We believe property owners will enjoy the benefits of the positive demonstration such a visible display of sustainable design that their properties are and assist in turning cost centers into revenue centers. As the adoption of Electric Vehicles increase, we believe parking lots will be ideal locations for EV charging infrastructure and Envision&#8217;s products with SunCharge&#8482; will offer an attractive option to any entity considering the deployment of such solutions.

&#160;

We believe, globally, solar deployments are growing significantly. While much of the growth has been focused on low-cost solutions, we believe that there will be a shift towards quality over cost as the market matures and the reduced costs of commoditized components allow for higher quality deployments while still approaching or even surpassing grid parity. Our deployment speed is also important to our marketing efforts. In most cases, we deploy our Solar Tree&#174; products in active parking lots of active businesses. Whether we are deploying for EV charging, shade, energy security, or for marketing purposes, our prospective customers often consider business disruption in their analysis and buying decisions. We believe that our products can be installed faster than any other products in the industry, making deployment of Envision products less negatively impactful than the deployment of our competitor&#8217;s products. The potential loss of revenue or opportunity caused by a torn-up parking lot can, over time, be quite substantial. We believe our deployment speed will increasingly contribute to Envision&#8217;s competitive edge.

&#160;

Customer Concentration 

&#160;

During 2015, the Company had two customers that each exceeded 10% of our revenue.

&#160;

Silicon Valley Bank Loan 

&#160; 

On October 30, 2015, Envision and its wholly owned subsidiary Envision Solar Construction, Inc., a California corporation, entered into a Loan and Security Agreement (the &#8220;LSA&#8221;) with Silicon Valley Bank, a California corporation (&#8220;Bank&#8221;), pursuant to which the Bank agreed to provide Borrower with a revolving line of credit in the aggregate principal amount of $1,000,000, bearing interest at a floating per annum rate equal to the greater of three quarters of one percentage point (0.75%) above the Prime Rate (as that term is defined in the LSA) or four percent (4.00%). The loan is due and payable in full on or before October 30, 2016. The line of credit is secured by a second priority perfected security interest in all of the assets of the Company in favor of the Bank. Under the terms of the LSA, the Bank received a commitment fee of $2,500, reimbursement of Bank expenses for documentation of $10,000, and a reimbursement of filing fees amounting to $1,836. As of December 31, 2015 and the date of this report, the Company has $800,000 and $1,000,000 of borrowings under this line of credit, respectively.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 14 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

As a condition to the extension of credit to us under the LSA, Keshif Ventures, LLC (&#8220;Keshif&#8221;) agreed to guarantee all of the our obligations under the LSA pursuant to a Master Unconditional Limited Guaranty between the Bank and Keshif, dated October 30, 2015 (&#8220;Guaranty&#8221;). Keshif pledged cash equivalent collateral to the Bank as security for the Guaranty. Keshif also agreed to subordinate to the Bank all of our indebtedness and other monetary obligations owing to Keshif pursuant to a Subordination Agreement, dated October 30, 2015 (&#8220;Subordination Agreement&#8221;). In consideration for the Guaranty, Envision issued 571,429 shares of its common stock (the &#8220;Shares&#8221;) to Keshif pursuant to a stock purchase agreement, dated October 30, 2015 (&#8220;SPA&#8221;). Pursuant to the terms of the SPA, for each six-month period from and after the six-month anniversary of October 30, 2015 (each, a &#8220;Measurement Period&#8221;) that Keshif guarantees our obligations under the LSA, Keshif will also receive the number of additional shares of Envision&#8217;s common stock, rounded upward to the nearest whole number, equal to (a) two and one half percent (2.5%) multiplied by the maximum outstanding principal amount of the LSA at any time during such Measurement Period, such amount to be divided by (b) the twenty (20) day average closing price of the Company&#8217;s common stock, measured for the twenty (20) consecutive trading days immediately prior to such Measurement Period, the quotient of which shall be multiplied by (c) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of calendar days during the Measurement Period which the Guaranty remained in effect and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days in such Measurement Period. The Company also issued a side letter to Keshif (the &#8220;Side Letter&#8221;), which in addition to confirming Keshif&#8217;s entitlement to the Shares, provided certain contractual rights to Keshif in consideration for the Guaranty, including a covenant by the Company to provide financial statements and other periodic reports to Keshif, an agreement to reimburse Keshif for payments made by Keshif to the Bank in accordance with the Guaranty (&#8220;Reimbursement Obligation&#8221;), if any, and the grant of a security interest, subordinated to the Bank under the Subordination Agreement, to secure the Reimbursement Obligation. Keshif also has the right under the Side Letter to invite one representative to attend all meetings of Envision&#8217;s Board of Directors and, in the event Envision is unable to meet its obligations under the LSA, Keshif will immediately become entitled to elect one member to Envision&#8217;s Board of Directors.

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

The solar energy industry is intensely competitive. We are subject to competition from a number of other companies manufacturing, selling, and installing solar power products in the commercial market, many of which have longer operating histories and greater financial and other resources than the Company.

&#160;

EV Charging 

&#160;

The EV charging sector is growing rapidly with many companies playing different roles in the space. Companies such as Schneider, Eaton, Aerovironment, and Bosch manufacture EV charging units, but do not offer charging services. Companies such as Chargepoint and Car Charging Group offer EV charging services and hardware, but not, typically, installation. There are many companies which offer installation services typically from electrical and general contracting backgrounds. There are one or two companies which are endeavoring to find ways to monetize EV charging beyond generating revenue from services or hardware. Volta is a San Francisco based EV charging company which derives revenue through the sale of advertising. Volta gives charging away for free. They are deployed in a small number of shopping malls and other locations. Many solar companies are now fixing EV chargers to their parking lot structures and some are offering packages combining solar rooftop installations and EV charger installations for the residential market place. These installations are almost always grid tied and do not include energy storage. We know of no other company that has a fully self-contained, transportable, autonomous, solar powered EV charging solution and we know of no other company that offers a product which delivers DC fast charging solely from solar generation.

&#160;

Outdoor Advertising 

&#160; 

Envision&#8217;s role in the outdoor advertising space is currently anticipated by management to be one of delivering hardware solutions in the billboard, street furniture, and digital signage space. There are large well established companies such as JC Decaux which specialize in the sale of advertising and also in the production of street furniture solutions. Other vendors in the space include Daktronics which makes digital billboards and street furniture. We have met with both companies and determined that neither has a transportable solar powered solution. Both companies have expressed that they recognize the value of EV charging infrastructure as a platform for DOOH. They have also expressed an interest in working with us though we have nothing definitive with either at this point. Either of them could compete with us if they determined to invest in developing solar powered products.

There are many companies which specialize in the placement of outdoor content on existing infrastructure, including but not limited to Capitol Outdoors, Vistar Media, EMC Outdoor and Outfront Media. We are in contact with some and intend to be in contact with all to educate them about our products. These companies can be seen as competition as they are in the business of taking as much of the market share as they can for digital content. However, they do not produce hardware and we currently do not intend to sell advertising space. With that in mind we see these companies more as potential partners than competitors. Perhaps one of the most interesting entrants into the outdoor digital content placement market is Google. With its recent announcement of time and place based content dispersal on outdoor digital screens, Google is taking its advertising placement technology outdoors. Google has several solar and energy projects underway and as such, could create solar powered outdoor advertising technologies. Google is currently a customer, purchasing EV ARC&#8482; products for their campuses. We intend to pursue the outdoor advertising market with Google as well, but have yet to approach the subject with Google.

The large outdoor advertisers such as ClearChannel, CBS Outdoors, Lamar and JC Decaux have combinations of larger format billboards, digital billboards, screens and street furniture. They use combinations of in house and outsourced resources to acquire hardware. We are not aware that any of them currently have solar powered solutions such as those that we offer, however we have seen each of them pay close attention to sustainable options such as using solar panels adjacent to billboards to power them. We will endeavor, wherever possible to sell products to these companies. Each of them has greater financial and other resources than the Company and could create competing products to ours.

Energy Security 

&#160;

Our focus in energy security is to produce solar powered products which include battery energy storage and which can dispatch power during times of grid or carbon fueled generator failure. There are many companies, both large and small, with solar energy solutions, many with battery storage solutions, and many with combinations of both. As our focus is on the productization of the combination of solar generation and energy, we view the competition from companies producing these types of solutions to be most relevant to our business. Companies in this space range from small startup companies like Green Charge Networks to behemoths like General Electric and NEC. Siemens, Eaton, Schneider and other large electrical component companies are also all working on combined renewables/storage product solutions. We are in contact with all these companies and have not observed that any of them have a product which provides all the same values and differentiators which our EV ARC&#8482; product delivers.

&#160;

While we believe that our proprietary designs and our deployment strategies differentiate us from our competitors in the market, there is no assurance that our business, operating results, and financial condition will not be materially adversely affected by our competitors.

&#160;

Government Regulation 

&#160;

Businesses in general and solar energy companies in particular are subject to extensive regulation at the federal, state, and local level. We are subject to extensive government regulation of employment, health, safety, working conditions, labor relations, and the environment in the course of the conduct of our business. In order for our customers to enable the installation of some of our products, they generally are required to obtain permits from local and other governmental agencies. In order to access the utility grid for the solar power produced by our grid tied products, they must comply with the applicable rules and regulations of the relevant state public utility agencies. In order for our customers to take advantage of available tax and other governmental incentives associated with the installation of solar power production facilities, and the production and use or sale of solar power, they must comply with the applicable regulatory terms and conditions. Government regulation may have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition.

Amendment to Articles of Incorporation 

&#160; 

In order to have a sufficient number of authorized shares of common stock to make this offering, the Company (a) made an agreement (the &#8220;Deferral Agreement&#8221;) with certain holders of outstanding convertible securities of the Company that are convertible into shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock (i.e. outstanding stock options and warrants,) to defer the exercise of those securities until the Company can amend its Articles of Incorporation to increase its authorized common stock and to authorize preferred stock, and (b) agreed to call a special meeting of its shareholders to obtain their authorization to effect an amendment to the Company&#8217;s Articles of Incorporation (the &#8220;Amendment&#8221;) by recording it with the Nevada Secretary of State, to authorize 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock (currently no preferred stock is authorized), and to authorize 495,000,000 shares of common stock (currently 162,500,000 shares of common stock are authorized). Upon recording of the Amendment, the securities subject to the Deferral Agreement will have their reserve shares restored to them and thereby become exercisable in accordance with their original terms, and the Company will have additional capital stock authorized to accommodate its expected growth. Collectively, approximately 33 million potential shares of common stock are subject to and have been made available by the Deferral Agreements.
