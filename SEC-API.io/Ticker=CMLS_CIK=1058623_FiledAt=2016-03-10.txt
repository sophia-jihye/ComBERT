Description of Certain Definitions and Data 

In this annual report on Form 10-K (this &#8220;Form 10-K&#8221; or this &#8220;Report&#8221;) the terms &#8220;Company,&#8221; &#8220;Cumulus,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; and &#8220;our&#8221; refer to Cumulus Media Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. 

We use the term &#8220;local marketing agreement&#8221; (&#8220;LMA&#8221;) in this Report. In a typical LMA, the licensee of a radio station makes available, for a fee and reimbursement of its expenses, airtime on its station to a party which supplies programming to be broadcast during that airtime, and collects revenues from advertising aired during such programming. In addition to entering into LMAs, we from time to time enter into management or consulting agreements that provide us with the ability, as contractually specified, to assist current owners in the management of radio station assets, subject to Federal Communications Commission (&#8220;FCC&#8221;) approval. In such arrangements, we generally receive a contractually specified management fee or consulting fee in exchange for the services provided. 

Unless otherwise indicated, as disclosed herein we: 

&#8226; 

obtained total radio industry listener and revenue levels from the Radio Advertising Bureau; 

&#8226; 

derived historical market revenue statistics and market revenue share percentages from data published by Miller Kaplan, Arase LLP, a public accounting firm that specializes in serving the broadcasting industry and BIA/Kelsey (&#8220;BIA&#8221;), a media and telecommunications advisory services firm; and 

&#8226; 

derived all audience share data and audience rankings, including ranking by population, from surveys of people ages 12 and over, listening Monday through Sunday, 6 a.m. to 12 midnight, and based on the Nielsen Audio Market Report. 

Company Overview 

A leader in the radio broadcasting industry, we combine high-quality local programming with iconic, nationally syndicated media, sports and entertainment brands to deliver premium content choices to the 245 million &#32;people reached each week through our 454 &#32;owned-and-operated stations broadcasting in 90 &#32;US media markets (including eight of the top 10), more than 8,200 &#32;broadcast radio stations affiliated with our Westwood One network and numerous digital channels. Together, the Cumulus/Westwood One platforms make us one of the few media companies that can provide advertisers national reach and local impact. Cumulus/Westwood One is the exclusive radio broadcast partner to the some of the largest brands in sports and entertainment, including the NFL, the NCAA, the Masters, the Olympics, the GRAMMYs, the Academy of Country Music Awards, the American Music Awards, and the Billboard Music Awards. Additionally, we are the nation's leading provider of country music and lifestyle content through our NASH brand, which serves country fans nationwide through radio programming, NASH Country Weekly magazine, video, and live events. 

We believe that our capital structure provides adequate liquidity and scale for us to operate and grow our current business. 

We are a Delaware corporation, organized in 2002, and successor by merger to an Illinois corporation with the same name that was organized in 1997. 

Strategic Overview 

Our initial historical strategic focus was on mid-sized radio markets in the United States, as we believed that the attractive operating characteristics of mid-sized markets, together with the relaxation of radio station ownership limits under the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (the &#8220;Telecom Act&#8221;) and FCC rules, created significant opportunities for growth from the formation of groups of radio stations within these markets. We focused on capitalizing on opportunities to acquire groups of stations in attractive markets at favorable purchase prices, taking advantage of the size and fragmented nature of ownership in those markets and the greater attention historically given to larger markets by radio station acquirers. 

Our strategy has evolved as we have recognized that large radio markets can provide an attractive combination of scale, stability and opportunity for future growth, particularly for emerging digital advertising initiatives. According to BIA, many of these markets typically have per capita and household income, and expected household after-tax effective buying income growth, in excess of the national average, which we believe makes radio broadcasters in these markets attractive to a broad base of advertisers, and allows a radio broadcaster to reduce its dependence on any one economic sector or specific advertiser. Our 

Index to Financial Statements 

operating strategy is based upon the following principles that we expect will continue to position us for future growth and increases in stockholder value: 

&#32;&#32;&#32; Focus on unique brands . 

We view each of our radio stations and content assets as a unique brand that serves a local and distinct community of listeners. Our business model is designed to offer local businesses access to each of our stations&#8217; communities of listeners through the sale of advertising time. To drive sales growth, we structure and incentivize our sales organization to create demand through increased coverage and access to sophisticated productivity tools, such as our proprietary customer relationship management system, market research and listener databases, as well as training and presentation materials and extensive client-focused marketing support. As we continue to seek to grow, we believe this focused model will continue to be scalable, allowing us to continue to provide a high level of customer service and further expand our advertiser base. 

&#32;&#32;&#32; Further leverage our operating efficiencies. 

We utilize a scalable, enterprise-wide, proprietary management system and technology platform to run our business, which we believe is a competitive advantage. Based on the experience of our experienced management team and the benefits derivable from our technology platform, we believe we can to continue to leverage this structural competitive advantage across our business as we seek to drive growth. 

&#32;&#32;&#32; Leverage experience in the application of uniform systems and practices. 

Our success is partly based on adhering to a set of time-proven fundamentals and processes to run and manage our business, which we have standardized throughout our portfolio of stations. We believe that as we continue to seek to grow we will continue to implement our systems and technology platform across our business, and obtain additional benefits from increased purchasing power, scale and supplier relationships. We believe our culture promotes the identification and recognition of best practices in all functional areas, which are then evaluated, tested and, upon acceptance, rolled out across our portfolio of stations. 

&#32;&#32;&#32; Enhance operating performance across our portfolio of radio stations to drive efficiencies through scale . 

Our business is designed to drive local sales growth and reduce costs at each radio station. We believe that in doing so, we are able to provide a higher level of service to the existing customer base at those stations in addition to expanding the advertiser base, which we believe will enable us to continue to grow in those markets. 

&#32;&#32;&#32; Maintain our financial discipline . 

We seek to maintain a strong balance sheet and remain committed to enhancing our free cash flow to further de-leverage. In addition, from time to time, we use derivative financial instruments to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in interest rates. We also continually seek to identify and implement cost savings at each of our stations and the stations to which we provide services. To that end, we believe our overall size benefits each station with respect to negotiating favorable terms with programming suppliers and other vendors. 

&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32; Pursue opportunities to expand and diversify our business . 

As part of our overall strategy, we selectively evaluate opportunities that we believe have synergies with our core business and could add incremental growth opportunities to help further diversify our platform. These opportunities exist in a variety of content verticals both in and out of traditional broadcast radio. We also are focused on creating a comprehensive experience for our listening audience, as well as offering our advertisers greater flexibility and reach. These growth initiatives may arise out of strategic partnerships, joint ventures or targeted investments, and we believe our scale and management expertise will allow us to intelligently develop and execute on expansion opportunities. 

Competitive Strengths 

We believe our prior success is, and our future performance will be, directly related to the following combination of strengths that will enable us to implement our strategies: 

&#32;&#32; &#32;A leader in the radio broadcasting industry with a broad national reach . 

Currently, we offer advertisers access to a broad portfolio of approximately 454 &#32;stations, comprised of 16 large market and 74 small and mid-sized market stations in 90 &#32;United States media markets. Our stations cover a wide variety of programming formats, geographic regions, audience demographics and advertising clients. We believe this scale and diversity allows us to 

Index to Financial Statements 

offer advertisers the ability to customize advertising campaigns on a national, regional and local basis through broadcast, digital and mobile mediums, enabling us to compete effectively with other media and engage listeners whenever, wherever they are. 

We are one of the largest radio advertising and content providers in the United States. With more than 8,200 &#32; radio broadcast affiliations, our radio station platform reaches approximately 65 million listeners a week, and provides a national platform to more effectively and efficiently compete for national advertising dollars. In addition, this national network platform provides access to targeted and more diverse demographics and age groups to better meet our customers&#8217; needs and allow for more focused marketing. Our sales team has the ability to consolidate advertising time across our affiliate network, create an aggregated inventory and divide it into packages focused on specific demographics that can be sold to national advertisers looking to reach specific national or regional audiences across all of the radio network affiliates. 

&#32;&#32;&#32; Diversified customer base and geographic mix . 

We generate substantially all of our revenue from the sale of advertising time to a broad and diverse customer base. We sell our advertising time both nationally and locally through an integrated sales approach that ranges from traditional radio spots to non-traditional sales programs, including on-line couponing and various on-air and Internet-related integrated marketing programs. 

Our advertising exposure is highly diversified across a broad range of industries, which lessens the impact of the economic conditions applicable to any one specific industry or customer group. Our top industry segments by advertising volume include automotive, restaurants, entertainment, financial, and communications. In "even numbered years" in advance of various elections, we derive additional revenue from political candidates, political parties, and special interest groups. Due to the localized nature of our business, we have a broad distribution of advertisers across all of our stations. Our geographic reach extends to 90 &#32;markets nationwide. 

&#32; &#32;Competitive margins. 

We operate as an integrated business and benefit from leveraging costs and relationships across our markets, all of which allow us to generate strong margins. We have developed a proprietary management system and technology platform that creates operating efficiencies through centralized management functions such as strategic planning, finance, corporate development, financial reporting, expense management, information systems, and quality control. This management system consists of web-based applications that were designed to create maximum efficiency while increasing our management&#8217;s level and span of control. 

&#32;&#32;&#32; Leveraging network to create content . 

We believe there continue to be growth opportunities in country, news/talk, sports and traffic content offerings with shared risk and revenue relationships. The content we create is distributed domestically to broadcast and digital platforms, with potential for expansion into other mediums such as television and print, as well as internationally. 

&#32;&#32;&#32; Strong technology platform . 

Our partnerships strategically complement our core terrestrial radio business to help exploit our best-in-class technology platform and operating systems across a much larger platform. Additionally, our in-house technology solutions help to manage costs across our whole network. 

&#32; Industry Overview 

The primary source of revenues for radio broadcasting companies is the sale of advertising time to local, regional and national spot advertisers, and national network advertisers. National advertisers place advertisements on a national show and such advertisements air in each market where the network has an affiliate. Over the past five years, radio advertising revenue has represented approximately 9% of the overall United States advertising market, and has typically followed macroeconomic growth trends. In 2015 , radio advertising revenues were an estimated &#32; $17.4 billion. 

Generally, radio is considered an efficient, cost-effective means of reaching specifically identified demographic groups. Stations are typically classified by their on-air format, such as country, rock, adult contemporary, oldies and news/talk. A station&#8217;s format and style of presentation enables it to target specific segments of listeners sharing certain demographic features. By capturing a specific share of a market&#8217;s radio listening audience with particular concentration in a targeted demographic, a station is able to market its broadcasting time to advertisers seeking to reach a specific audience. Advertisers and stations use data published by audience measuring services, such as Nielsen Audio, to estimate how many people within particular geographical markets and demographics listen to specific stations. 

Index to Financial Statements 

The number of advertisements that can be broadcast by a station without jeopardizing listening levels and the resulting ratings is generally dictated in part by the format of a particular station and the local competitive environment. Although the number of advertisements broadcast during a given time period may vary, the total number of advertisements broadcast on a particular station generally does not vary significantly from year to year. 

A station&#8217;s local sales staff generates the majority of its local and regional advertising sales through direct solicitations of local advertising agencies and businesses. To generate national advertising sales, a station usually will engage a firm that specializes in soliciting radio-advertising sales on a national level. Stations also may engage directly with an internal national sales team that supports the efforts of third-party representatives. National sales representatives obtain advertising principally from advertising agencies located outside the station&#8217;s market and receive commissions based on the revenue from the advertising they obtain. 

Our stations compete for advertising revenue with other broadcast radio stations in their particular market as well as other media, including newspapers, broadcast television, cable television, magazines, direct mail, coupons, and outdoor advertising. In addition, the radio broadcasting industry is subject to competition from services that use new media technologies that have been introduced and are gaining in popularity and acceptance, such as Internet and satellite-based digital radio and music services. Such services are able to reach regional and nationwide audiences with multi-channel, multi-format, digital radio and music services. 

We cannot predict how existing, new or any future generated sources of competition will affect our performance and results of operations. The radio broadcasting industry historically has grown over the long term despite the introduction of new technologies for the delivery of entertainment and information, such as television broadcasting, cable television, audio tapes, compact discs, iPods, and other similar devices. We believe population growth and greater availability of radios, particularly car and portable radios when combined with increased travel and commuting time, have contributed to this growth. There can be no assurance, however, that the development or introduction in the future of any new media technology will not have a material adverse effect on the radio broadcasting industry in general or our stations in particular. 

Advertising Sales 

The primary source of our revenue is generated from the sale of local, regional, and national advertising for broadcast on our radio stations. We also generate revenue from the sale of our network programming and services. In exchange for our network programs and services, and through our advertising sales representation, we primarily receive commercial air time from radio stations and aggregate the air time to sell to national advertisers; to a lesser extent, we receive cash. A majority of our net broadcasting revenue is typically generated from the sale of local and regional advertising. Additional broadcasting revenue is generated from the sale of national advertising. The major categories of our advertisers consist of: 

Amusement and recreation 

&#160; 

Banking and mortgage 

&#160; 

Furniture and home furnishings 

Arts and entertainment 

&#160; 

Food and beverage services 

&#160; 

Healthcare services 

Automotive dealers 

&#160; 

Food and beverage stores 

&#160; 

Telecommunications 

&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;In addition, in "even numbered years" in advance of various elections, we derive additional revenue from political candidates, political parties, and special interest groups. 

Each station&#8217;s local sales staff solicits advertising either directly from a local advertiser or indirectly through an advertising agency. We use a tiered commission structure to focus our sales staff on new business development. Consistent with our operating strategy of dedicated sales forces for each of our stations, we have increased the number of salespeople per station. We believe that we can outperform the traditional growth rates of our markets by (1) expanding our base of advertisers, (2) properly training newly hired sales people and (3) providing a higher level of service to our existing customer base. We further believe that we will accomplish this goal with a larger sales staff than most of our newly-acquired stations employed at the time we acquired them. 

Our national sales are made by a firm specializing in radio advertising sales on the national level, in exchange for a commission that is based on the gross revenue from the advertising generated. Regional sales, which we define as sales in regions surrounding our markets to buyers that advertise in our markets, are generally made by our local sales staff and market managers. Whereas we seek to grow our local sales through larger and more customer-focused sales staffs, we seek to grow our national and regional sales by offering key national and regional advertisers access to groups of stations within specific markets and regions that make us a more attractive platform. Many of these advertisers have previously been reluctant to advertise in certain smaller markets because of the logistics involved in buying advertising from individual stations. Certain of our stations had no national representation before we acquired them. 

Index to Financial Statements 

Each of our stations has a general target level of on-air inventory available for advertising. This target level of advertising inventory may vary at different times of the day but tends to remain stable over time. Our stations strive to maximize revenue by managing their on-air advertising inventory and adjusting prices up or down based on supply and demand. We seek to broaden our advertiser base in each market by providing a wide array of audience demographic segments across each cluster of stations, thereby providing potential advertisers with an effective means to reach a targeted demographic group. Our selling and pricing activity is based on demand for our radio stations&#8217; on-air inventory, and, in general, we respond to this demand by varying prices rather than by varying our target inventory level for a particular station. Most changes in revenue are explained by a combination of demand-driven pricing changes and changes in inventory utilization rather than by changes in available inventory. Advertising rates charged by radio stations, which are generally highest during morning and afternoon commuting hours, are based primarily on: 

&#8226; 

a station&#8217;s share of audiences and the demographic groups targeted by advertisers (as measured by ratings surveys); 

&#8226; 

the supply and demand for radio advertising time and for time targeted at particular demographic groups; and 

&#8226; 

certain additional qualitative factors. 

A station&#8217;s listenership is reflected in ratings surveys that estimate the number of listeners tuned in to the station, and the time they spend listening. Each station&#8217;s ratings are used by its advertisers and advertising representatives to consider advertising with the station and are used by Cumulus to chart audience growth, set advertising rates and adjust programming. 

Competition 

The radio broadcasting industry is very competitive. Our stations compete for listeners and advertising revenues directly with other radio stations within their respective markets, as well as with other advertising media. Additionally, online music and other entertainment services sell advertising locally, creating additional competition for both listeners and advertisers. 

Radio stations compete for listeners primarily on the basis of program content that appeals to a particular demographic group. Factors that affect a radio station&#8217;s competitive position include station brand identity and loyalty, management experience, the station&#8217;s local audience rank in its market, transmitter power and location, assigned frequency, audience characteristics, local program acceptance and the number and characteristics of other radio stations and other advertising media in the market area. We attempt to improve our competitive position in each market by extensively researching and seeking to improve our stations&#8217; programming, by implementing targeted advertising campaigns aimed at the demographic groups for which our stations program and by managing our sales efforts to attract a larger share of advertising dollars for each station individually. We also seek to improve our competitive position by focusing on building a strong brand identity with a targeted listener base consisting of specific demographic groups in each of our markets, which we believe will allow us to better attract advertisers seeking to reach those listeners. 

The success of each of our stations depends largely upon rates it can charge for its advertising, which in turn is affected by the number of local advertising competitors, and the overall demand for advertising within individual markets. These conditions may fluctuate and are highly susceptible to changes in both local markets and more general macroeconomic conditions. Specifically, a radio station&#8217;s competitive position can be enhanced or negatively impacted by a variety of factors, including the changing of, or another station changing, its format to compete directly for a different demographic of listeners and advertisers or an upgrade of the station&#8217;s authorized power through the relocation or upgrade of transmission equipment. Another station&#8217;s decision to convert to a format similar to that of one of our radio stations in the same geographic area, to improve its signal reach through equipment changes or upgrades, or to launch an aggressive promotional campaign may result in lower ratings and advertising revenue for that station. Any adverse change affecting advertising expenditures in a particular market or in the relative market share of our stations located in a particular market could have a material adverse effect on the results of the radio stations located in that market or, possibly, the Company as a whole. There can be no assurance that any one or all of our stations will be able to maintain or increase advertising revenue market share. 

There are also regulations that impact competition within the radio industry. Under federal laws and FCC rules, a single party can own and operate multiple stations in a local market, subject to certain limitations described below. We believe that companies that form groups of commonly owned stations or joint arrangements, such as LMAs, in a particular market may, in certain circumstances, have lower operating costs and may be able to offer advertisers in those markets more attractive rates and services. Although we currently operate multiple stations in most of our markets and intend to pursue the creation of additional multiple station groups in particular markets, our competitors in certain markets include other parties that own and operate as many or more stations than we do. 

Some of these regulations, however, can serve to protect the competitive position of existing radio stations to some extent by creating certain regulatory barriers to new entrants. The ownership of a radio broadcast station requires an FCC license, and 

Index to Financial Statements 

the number of radio stations that an entity can own in a given market is limited under certain FCC rules. The number of radio stations that a party can own in a particular market is dictated largely by whether the station is in a defined &#8220;Nielsen Audio Metro" (a designation designed by a private party for use in advertising matters), and, if so, the number of stations included in that Nielsen Audio Metro. In those markets that are not in a Nielsen Audio Metro, the number of stations a party can own in the particular market is dictated by the number of AM and FM signals that overlap, which constitutes a radio market under FCC rules. These FCC ownership rules may, in some instances, limit the number of stations one or more of our existing competitors can own or operate, or may limit potential new market entrants. However, FCC ownership rules may change in the future to limit any protections they currently provide. We also cannot predict what other matters might be considered in the future by the FCC or Congress, nor can we assess in advance what impact, if any, the implementation of any of these proposals or changes might have on our business. For a discussion of FCC regulation (including recent changes), see &#8220;- Federal Regulation of Radio Broadcasting.&#8221; 

Employees 

At December 31, 2015 , we employed 5,618 people, 3,706 of whom were employed full time. Of these employees, approximately 220 employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements. We have not experienced any material work stoppages by our employees covered by collective bargaining agreements, and overall, we consider our relations with our employees to be satisfactory. 

On occasion, we enter into contracts with various on-air personalities with large loyal audiences in their respective markets to protect our interests in those relationships that we believe to be valuable. The loss of one or more of these personalities could result in a short-term loss of audience share, but we do not believe that any such loss would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations, taken as a whole. 

Seasonality and Cyclicality 

Our operations and revenues tend to be seasonal in nature, with generally lower revenue generated in the first quarter of the year and generally higher revenue generated in the second and fourth quarters of the year. The seasonality of our business reflects the adult orientation of our formats and relationship between advertising purchases on these formats with the retail cycle. This seasonality causes and will likely continue to cause a variation in our quarterly operating results. Such variations could have a material effect on the timing of our cash flows. 

In addition, our revenues tend to fluctuate between years, consistent with, among other things, increased advertising expenditures in even-numbered years by political candidates, political parties and special interest groups. This political spending typically is heaviest during the fourth quarter. 

Inflation 

To date, inflation has not had a material effect on our revenues or results of operations, although no assurances can be provided that material inflation in the future would not materially adversely affect us. 

Federal Regulation of Radio Broadcasting 

General 

The ownership, operation and sale of radio broadcast stations, including those licensed to us, are subject to the jurisdiction of the FCC, which acts under authority of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the &#8220;Communications Act&#8221;). The Telecommunications Act of 1996 (the &#8220;Telecom Act&#8221;) amended the Communications Act and directed the FCC to change certain of its broadcast rules. Among its other regulatory responsibilities, the FCC issues permits and licenses to construct and operate radio stations; assigns broadcast frequencies; determines whether to approve changes in ownership or control of station licenses; regulates transmission equipment, operating power, and other technical parameters of stations; adopts and implements regulations and policies that directly or indirectly affect the ownership, operation and employment practices of stations; regulates the content of some forms of radio broadcast programming; and has the authority under the Communications Act to impose penalties for violations of its rules. 

The following is a brief summary of certain provisions of the Communications Act, the Telecom Act, and related FCC rules and policies (collectively, the &#8220;Communications Laws&#8221;). This description does not purport to be comprehensive, and reference should be made to the Communications Laws, public notices, and decisions issued by the FCC for further information concerning the nature and extent of federal regulation of radio broadcast stations. Failure to observe the provisions of the 

Index to Financial Statements 

Communications Laws can result in the imposition of various sanctions, including monetary forfeitures and the grant of a &#8220;short-term&#8221; (less than the maximum term) license renewal. For particularly egregious violations, the FCC may deny a station&#8217;s license renewal application, revoke a station&#8217;s license, or deny applications in which an applicant seeks to acquire additional broadcast properties. 

License Grant and Renewal 

Radio broadcast licenses are generally granted and renewed for terms of up to eight years at a time. Licenses are renewed by filing an application with the FCC, which is subject to review and approval. The Communications Act expressly provides that a radio station is authorized to continue to operate after the expiration date of its existing license until the FCC acts on a pending renewal application. Petitions to deny license renewal applications may be filed by interested parties, including members of the public. While we are not currently aware of any facts that would prevent the renewal of our licenses to operate our radio stations, there can be no assurance that all of our licenses will be renewed in the future for a full term, or at all. Our inability to renew a significant portion of our radio broadcast licenses could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 

Service Areas 

The area served by an AM station is determined by a combination of frequency, transmitter power, antenna orientation, and soil conductivity. To determine the effective service area of an AM station, the station&#8217;s power, operating frequency, antenna patterns and its day/night operating modes are evaluated. The area served by an FM station is determined by a combination of effective radiated power (&#8220;ERP&#8221;), antenna height and terrain, with stations divided into eight classes according to these technical parameters. 

Each class of FM radio station has the right to broadcast with a certain amount of ERP from an antenna located at a certain height above average terrain. The most powerful FM radio stations, which are generally those with the largest geographic reach, are Class C FM stations, which operate with up to the equivalent of 100 kilowatts (&#8220;kW&#8221;) of ERP at an antenna height of 1,968 feet above average terrain. These stations typically provide service to a large area that covers one or more counties (which may or may not be in the same state). There are also Class C0, C1, C2 and C3 FM radio stations which operate with progressively less power and/or antenna height above average terrain and, thus, less geographic reach. In addition, Class B FM stations operate with the equivalent of up to 50 kW ERP at an antenna height of 492 feet above average terrain. Class B stations can serve large metropolitan areas and their outer suburban areas. Class B1 stations can operate with up to the equivalent of 25 kW ERP at an antenna height of 328 feet above average terrain. Class A FM stations operate with up to the equivalent of 6 kW ERP at an antenna height of 328 feet above average terrain, and often (but not always) serve smaller cities or suburbs of larger cities. 

Index to Financial Statements 

The following table sets forth, as of March 1, 2016 , the market, call letters, city of license, frequency and FCC license expiration date of all our owned and/or operated stations, including stations operated under an LMA, whether or not pending acquisition, and all other announced pending station acquisitions, if any. Stations with a license expiration date prior to March 1, 2016 &#32;represent stations for which a renewal application has been timely filed with the FCC and is currently pending before the FCC. The Communications Act expressly provides that a radio station is authorized to continue to operate after the expiration date of its existing license until the FCC acts on a pending renewal application.

Regulatory Approvals 

The Communications Laws prohibit the assignment or transfer of control of a broadcast license without the prior approval of the FCC. In determining whether to grant an application for assignment or transfer of control of a broadcast license, the Communications Act requires the FCC to find that the assignment or transfer would serve the public interest. The FCC considers a number of factors in making this determination, including (1) compliance with various rules limiting common 

Index to Financial Statements 

ownership or control of media properties, (2) the financial and &#8220;character&#8221; qualifications of the assignee or transferee (including those parties holding an &#8220;attributable&#8221; interest in the assignee or transferee), (3) compliance with the Communications Act&#8217;s foreign ownership restrictions, and (4) compliance with other Communications Laws, including those related to programming and filing requirements. As discussed in greater detail below, the FCC may also review the effect of proposed assignments and transfers of broadcast licenses on economic competition and diversity. See &#8220;- Antitrust and Market Concentration Considerations.&#8221; 

In connection with our 2011 acquisition of Citadel Broadcasting Corporation, we agreed to divest certain stations to comply with FCC ownership limits. These stations were assigned to a trustee under divestiture trusts that comply with FCC rules. The trust agreements stipulate that we must fund any operating shortfalls from the activities of the stations in the trusts, and any excess cash flow generated by such stations will be distributed to us until the stations are sold. In February, 2016, the trustee received a letter from the FCC seeking information on efforts to sell the station assets which remain in the trusts. 

Ownership Matters 

The Communications Act restricts us from having more than 25% of our capital stock owned or voted by non-U.S. persons, foreign governments or non-U.S. corporations. We are required to take steps to monitor the citizenship of our stockholders periodically through representative samplings of stockholder citizenship or other appropriate means to establish a reasonable basis for certifying compliance with the foreign ownership restrictions of the Communications Act. In November 2013, the FCC issued a declaratory ruling in which it stated that it would review requests for companies to exceed the 25% alien ownership threshold in the Communications Act on a case-by-case basis, and in June 2014, Pandora Radio LLC (&#8220;Pandora&#8221;) filed a petition for a declaratory ruling with the FCC requesting that Pandora be allowed to buy a radio station even though it could not certify that its alien ownership was within the 25% threshold of the Communications Act, in large part because much of its stock is held in &#8220;street name&#8221; and Pandora therefore could not determine the scope of alien ownership of its stock. Pandora asked the FCC to allow the company to have up to 100% beneficial ownership by aliens as long as more than 50% of the voting control of the company rested in the hands of US citizens. The FCC issued a public notice in July 2014 inviting public comment on Pandora&#8217;s petition. In May, 2015, the FCC issued a ruling permitting foreign investors to hold up to 49.99% of the voting and/or equity interests in Pandora, provided that a majority of the board of directors continued to consist of U.S. citizens, and subject to certain other conditions. This ruling was based upon the specific facts relating to Pandora, and it is unclear how the FCC would treat any request which might be made to increase alien ownership of our stock in excess of the current threshold. 

The Communications Laws also generally restrict (1) the number of radio stations one person or entity may own, operate or control in a local market, (2) the common ownership, operation or control of radio broadcast stations and television broadcast stations serving the same local market, and (3) the common ownership, operation or control of a radio broadcast station and a daily newspaper serving the same local market. 

To our knowledge, none of these multiple and cross-ownership rules requires any change in our current ownership of radio broadcast stations. The Communications Laws limit the number of additional stations that we may acquire in the future in our existing markets as well as any new markets. 

Because of these multiple and cross-ownership rules, a purchaser of our voting stock who acquires an &#8220;attributable&#8221; interest in us (as discussed below) may violate the Communications Laws if such purchaser also has an attributable interest in other radio or television stations, or in daily newspapers, depending on the number and location of those radio or television stations or daily newspapers. Such a purchaser also may be restricted in the companies in which it may invest to the extent that those investments give rise to an attributable interest. If one of our stockholders with an attributable interest violates any of these ownership rules, we may be unable to obtain from the FCC one or more authorizations needed to conduct our radio station business and may be unable to obtain FCC consents for certain future acquisitions. 

The FCC generally applies its television/radio/newspaper cross-ownership rules and its broadcast multiple ownership rules by considering the &#8220;attributable&#8221; interests held by a person or entity. With some exceptions, a person or entity will be deemed to hold an attributable interest in a radio station, television station or daily newspaper if the person or entity serves as an officer, director, partner, stockholder, member, or, in certain cases, a debt holder of a company that owns that station or newspaper. If an interest is attributable, the FCC treats the person or entity that holds that interest as the &#8220;owner&#8221; of the radio station, television station or daily newspaper in question, and that interest thus counts against the person in determining compliance with the FCC&#8217;s ownership rules. 

With respect to a corporation, officers, directors and persons or entities that directly or indirectly hold 5% or more of the corporation&#8217;s voting stock (20% or more of such stock in the case of insurance companies, investment companies, bank trust departments and certain other &#8220;passive investors&#8221; that hold such stock for investment purposes only) generally are attributed 

Index to Financial Statements 

with ownership of the radio stations, television stations and daily newspapers owned by the corporation. As discussed below, participation in an LMA or a joint sales agreement (&#8220;JSA&#8221;) also may result in an attributable interest. See &#8220;- Local Marketing Agreements.&#8221; 

With respect to a partnership (or limited liability company), the interest of a general partner (or managing member) is attributable. The following interests generally are not attributable: (1) debt instruments, non-voting stock, options and warrants for voting stock, partnership interests, or membership interests that have not yet been exercised; (2) limited partnership or limited liability company membership interests where (a) the limited partner or member is not &#8220;materially involved&#8221; in the media-related activities of the partnership or limited liability company, and (b) the limited partnership agreement or limited liability company agreement expressly &#8220;insulates&#8221; the limited partner or member from such material involvement by inclusion of provisions specified in FCC rules; and (3) holdings of less than 5% of an entity&#8217;s voting stock, non-voting equity and debt interests (unless stock or other equity holdings, whether voting or non-voting and whether insulated or not, and/or debt interests collectively constitute more than 33% of a station&#8217;s &#8220;enterprise value&#8221;, which consists of the total equity and debt capitalization, and the non-voting stockholder or equity-holder/debt holder has an attributable interest in another radio station, television station or newspaper in the same market or supplies more than 15% of the programming of the station owned by the entity in which such holder holds such stock, equity or debt interests). 

In December 2011, the FCC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking &#32;based on its 2010 quadrennial review of broadcast ownership rules (which is required by statute). In March, 2014, the FCC adopted a Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking and Report and Order , which commenced its 2014 quadrennial review, and incorporated into that review the record in the 2010 review. In the 2014 rulemaking notice, the FCC (1) tentatively concluded that the existing limitations on the number of radio stations a party can own in a particular market remain necessary to serve the public interest, (2) tentatively concluded that it should retain the AM/FM subcaps which limit the number of radio stations a single party can own in a particular service (AM or FM) in an individual market, (3) sought comment on whether the existing prohibition on newspaper-radio cross ownership in the same market should be lifted , and (4) sought comment on whether it should repeal the radio-television cross ownership rule which restricts a party&#8217;s ability to own radio and television stations in the same market. In each case, the FCC requested comment on these matters, and, more specifically, whether changes in the competitive landscape- including the advent of satellite radio, the Internet, and radio&#8217;s use of digital technology - warrant changes to its broadcast ownership rules. The FCC also tentatively concluded that it should reinstate a revenue-based definition of an &#8220;eligible entity&#8221; (i.e ., an entity allowed to acquire a group of radio stations which are grandfathered under the earlier more lenient multiple ownership rules) which previously had been remanded to the FCC by the Third Circuit Court of Appeals. The FCC found that such a revenue-based definition would promote diversity in broadcast ownership, and requested comment on that tentative conclusion and on ways generally to expand the participation of women and minorities in the broadcast industry. We cannot predict the timing or outcome of this proceeding or whether any new rules adopted by the FCC will have a material adverse effect on us. 

Programming and Operation 

The Communications Act requires broadcasters to serve the &#8220;public interest.&#8221; To satisfy that obligation broadcasters are required by FCC rules and policies to present programming that is responsive to community problems, needs and interests and to maintain certain records demonstrating such responsiveness. FCC rules require that each radio broadcaster place a list in its public inspection file at the end of each quarter which identifies important community issues and the programs the radio broadcaster used in the prior quarter to address those issues. The FCC adopted rules for television broadcasters in 2008, which require that certain portions of a television station&#8217;s public inspection file be uploaded to the FCC&#8217;s online data base. In January, 2016, the FCC adopted an order requiring that portions of the public inspection files of radio stations likewise be uploaded to the FCC&#8217;s online data base. Those requirements are expected to become effective for commercial radio stations with five or more employees in the top 50 markets later this year. Other stations will have until March 1, 2018 to upload their public inspection files to the FCC&#8217;s online data base. 

Complaints from listeners concerning a station&#8217;s programming may be filed at any time and will be considered by the FCC both at the time they are filed and in connection with a licensee&#8217;s renewal application. FCC rules also require broadcasters to provide equal employment opportunities (&#8220;EEO&#8221;) in the hiring of new personnel, to abide by certain procedures in advertising employment opportunities, to make information available on employment opportunities on their website (if they have one), and maintain certain records concerning their compliance with EEO rules. The FCC will entertain individual complaints concerning a broadcast licensee&#8217;s failure to abide by the EEO rules but also conducts random audits on broadcast licensees&#8217; compliance with EEO rules. We have been subject to numerous EEO audits. To date, none of those audits has disclosed any major violation that would have a material adverse effect on our operations. Stations also must follow provisions in the Communications Laws that regulate a variety of other activities, including political advertising, the broadcast of obscene or indecent programming, sponsorship identification, the broadcast of contests and lotteries, and technical operations (including limits on radio frequency radiation). In September, 2015, the FCC adopted an order revising its rules that require a radio station 

Index to Financial Statements 

to broadcast the material terms and conditions of any on-air contest. Under the new rules, stations may satisfy that disclosure obligation by posting the material terms and conditions of an on-air contest on the station&#8217;s web site or on another publicly-available Internet site instead of broadcasting them over the air. 

In October, 2015, the FCC made changes to certain technical rules regarding the AM radio service, and also adopted procedures designed to make it easier for owners of AM stations to use FM translators to rebroadcast their AM stations&#8217; signals. We cannot predict at this time the extent, if any, to which those rule changes and procedures will affect our operations. 

We are and have been subject to listener complaints from time to time on a variety of matters, and, while none of them has had a material adverse effect our operations as a whole to date, we cannot predict whether any future complaint might have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. 

Local Marketing Agreements 

A number of radio stations, including certain of our stations, have entered into LMAs. In a typical LMA, the licensee of a station makes available, for a fee and reimbursement of its expenses, airtime on its station to a party which supplies programming to be broadcast during that airtime, and collects revenues from advertising aired during such programming. LMAs are subject to compliance with the antitrust laws and the Communications Laws, including the requirement that the licensee must maintain independent control over the station and, in particular, its personnel, programming, and finances. 

A station that brokers more than 15% of the weekly programming hours on another station in its market will be considered to have an attributable ownership interest in the brokered station for purposes of the FCC&#8217;s ownership rules. As a result, a radio station may not enter into an LMA that allows it to program more than 15% of the weekly programming hours of another station in the same market that it could not own under the FCC&#8217;s multiple ownership rules. 

Joint Sales Agreements 

From time to time, radio stations enter into JSAs. A typical JSA authorizes one party or station to sell another station&#8217;s advertising time and retain the revenue from the sale of that airtime in exchange for a periodic payment to the station whose airtime is being sold (which may include a share of the revenue collected from the sale of airtime). Like LMAs, JSAs are subject to compliance with antitrust laws and the Communications Laws, including the requirement that the licensee must maintain independent control over the station and, in particular, its personnel, programming, and finances. 

Under the FCC&#8217;s ownership rules, a radio station that sells more than 15% of the weekly advertising time of another radio station in the same market will be attributed with the ownership of that other station. For that reason, a radio station cannot have a JSA with another radio station in the same market if the FCC&#8217;s ownership rules would otherwise prohibit that common ownership. 

In January 2000, the FCC released a Report and Order &#32;adopting rules for a new Low Power FM (&#8220;LPFM&#8221;) service consisting of two classes of radio stations, one with a maximum power of 100 watts and the other with a maximum power of 10 watts. On December 11, 2007, the FCC released a Report and Order which made changes in the rules and provided further protection for LPFM radio stations and, in certain circumstances, required full power stations (like the ones we own) to provide assistance to LPFM stations in the event they are subject to interference or are required to relocate their facilities to accommodate the inauguration of new or modified service by a full power radio station. The FCC has limited ownership and operation of LPFM stations to persons and entities that do not currently have an attributable interest in any FM station and has required that LPFM stations be operated on a non-commercial educational basis. The FCC has granted numerous construction permits for LPFM stations and many LPFM stations are now operating around the country. To date, LPFM radio stations have not had a material adverse effect on our operations. The Local Radio Community Act of 2010 (the &#8220;LRCA&#8221;), which was signed into law in January 2011, requires the FCC to, among other things, (1) modify its rules to authorize LPFM stations to operate on second-adjacent channels to full-power radio stations, and (2) waive second-adjacent channel separation requirements if the proposed operation of an LPFM station would not cause interference to any authorized full-power station. This law required the FCC to complete a study within one year of enactment to assess the economic impact that LPFM stations have on full-power radio stations like the stations we own. In compliance with this law, the FCC issued several reports in 2012 in which it found that LPFM stations generally serve areas that are substantially smaller in size and population than those served by full-service commercial radio stations, that LPFM stations have less of an Internet presence than full-power stations, that LPFM stations offer program formats different than full-power stations, and that the average LPFM station located in an Nielsen Audio market has negligible ratings and a significantly smaller audience than most full-power stations in the same market. 

The FCC&#8217;s action under the LRCA could increase the number of LPFM stations in markets where we have stations, and that increase could produce interference from LPFM stations to our stations. We cannot predict at this time whether the LRCA 

Index to Financial Statements 

in particular or the advent of LPFM service in general will have a material adverse impact on our operations in the future. Nor can we predict whether LPFM service could increase competition for listeners and revenues and have a material adverse effect on our operations. 

In April 2009, the FCC issued a notice of proposed rulemaking that proposed a number of changes in the FCC&#8217;s policies for allocating radio stations to particular markets and preferences that would be accorded to applicants to implement the command of Section 307(b) of the Communications Act that radio services be distributed fairly throughout the country. 

On March 3, 2011, the FCC issued an order in that rulemaking proceeding which would limit the ability of a broadcaster to move a radio station from one community to another. The FCC created a rebuttable presumption that would apply when a proposed community is located in an urbanized area or when the station could cover more than 50% of an urbanized area through the proposed community. In either of those circumstances, it would be presumed that the broadcaster intends to serve the entire urbanized area rather than the specified community and would not be allowed to change the station&#8217;s community of license unless the broadcaster presented a compelling showing that (1) the proposed community is &#8220;truly&#8221; independent of the urbanized area, (2) the proposed community has a specific need for an outlet for local expression separate from the urbanized area, and (3) the station would be able to serve the community&#8217;s need for a local outlet. The FCC further explained that (1) in no event would it approve any proposal that would create an area that had no access to radio services or access to only one radio service, and (2) the FCC would &#8220;strongly disfavor&#8221; any community change that would result in the loss of third, fourth or fifth radio service to more than 15% of the population within a station&#8217;s existing service area or that would deprive any community of &#8220;substantial size&#8221; (meaning a community with a population of 7,500 or greater) of its second local service. In subsequent decisions, the FCC explained that its policy does not apply to situations where a station is moving its community of license from one urbanized area to another urbanized area or from a community inside an urbanized area to another community in the same urbanized area. The FCC&#8217;s policy could nonetheless limit our options in relocating or acquiring radio stations and, to that extent, may have a material adverse impact on our operations. 

Antitrust and Market Concentration Considerations 

In addition, from time to time Congress and the FCC have considered, and may in the future consider and adopt, new laws, regulations and policies regarding a wide variety of matters that could, directly or indirectly, affect the operation, ownership or profitability of our radio stations, result in the loss of audience share and advertising revenues for our radio stations, and affect our ability to acquire additional radio stations or finance such acquisitions. 

Potential future acquisitions, to the extent they meet specified size thresholds, will be subject to applicable waiting periods and possible review under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act (&#8220;HSR Act&#8221;), by the Department of Justice (&#8220;the DOJ&#8221;) or the Federal Trade Commission (the &#8220;FTC&#8221;), either of whom can be required to, or can otherwise determine to, evaluate a transaction to determine whether that transaction should be challenged under the federal antitrust laws. Transactions are subject to the HSR Act only if the acquisition price or fair market value of the stations to be acquired is $78.2 million or more. Acquisitions that are not required to be reported under the HSR Act may still be investigated by the DOJ or the FTC under the antitrust laws before or after consummation. At any time before or after the consummation of a proposed acquisition, the DOJ or the FTC could take such action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary, including seeking to enjoin the acquisition or seeking divestiture of the business acquired or certain of our other assets. The DOJ has reviewed numerous potential radio station acquisitions where an operator proposed to acquire additional stations in its existing markets or multiple stations in new markets, and has challenged a number of such transactions. Some of these challenges have resulted in consent decrees requiring the sale of certain stations, the termination of LMAs or other relief. In general, the DOJ has more closely scrutinized radio mergers and acquisitions resulting in local market shares in excess of 35% of local radio advertising revenues, depending on format, signal strength and other factors. There is no precise numerical rule, however, and certain transactions resulting in more than 35% revenue shares have not been challenged, while certain other transactions may be challenged based on other criteria such as audience shares in one or more demographic groups as well as the percentage of revenue share. We estimate that we have more than a 35% share of radio advertising revenues in many of our markets. 

We are aware that the DOJ commenced, and subsequently discontinued, investigations of several of our prior acquisitions. The DOJ can be expected to continue to enforce the antitrust laws in this manner, and there can be no assurance that future acquisitions will not be the subject of an investigation or enforcement action by the DOJ or the FTC. Similarly, there can be no assurance that the DOJ, the FTC or the FCC will not prohibit such acquisitions, require that they be restructured, or in appropriate cases, require that we divest stations we already own in a particular market or divest specific lines of business. In addition, private parties may under certain circumstances bring legal action to challenge an acquisition under the antitrust laws. 

As part of its review of certain radio station acquisitions, the DOJ has stated publicly that it believes that commencement of operations under LMAs, JSAs and other similar agreements customarily entered into in connection with radio station 

Index to Financial Statements 

ownership assignments and transfers prior to the expiration of the waiting period under the HSR Act could violate the HSR Act. In connection with acquisitions subject to the waiting period under the HSR Act, we will not commence operation of any affected station to be acquired under an LMA, a JSA, or similar agreement until the waiting period has expired or been terminated. 

No assurances can be provided that actual, threatened or possible future DOJ or FTC action in connection with potential transactions would not have a material adverse effect on our ability to enter into or consummate various transactions, or operate any acquired stations at any time in the future.
