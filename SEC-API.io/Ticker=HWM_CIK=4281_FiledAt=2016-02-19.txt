Overview 

Alcoa is a global leader in lightweight metals engineering and manufacturing. Alcoa&#146;s innovative, multi-material products, which include aluminum, titanium, and nickel, are used worldwide in aerospace, automotive, commercial transportation, packaging, building and construction, oil and gas, defense, consumer electronics, and industrial applications. 

&#160; 

Alcoa is also the world leader in the production and management of primary aluminum, fabricated aluminum, and alumina combined, through its active participation in all major aspects of the industry: technology, mining, refining, smelting, fabricating, and recycling. Aluminum is a commodity that is traded on the London Metal Exchange (LME) and priced daily. Sales of primary aluminum and alumina represent approximately 40% of Alcoa&#146;s revenues. The price of aluminum influences the operating results of Alcoa. 

Alcoa is a global company operating in 30 countries. Based upon the country where the point of sale occurred, the United States and Europe generated 55% and 26%, respectively, of Alcoa&#146;s sales in 2015. In addition, Alcoa has investments and operating activities in, among others, Australia, Brazil, China, Guinea, Iceland, Russia, and Saudi Arabia. Governmental policies, laws and regulations, and other economic factors, including inflation and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, affect the results of operations in these countries. 

Alcoa&#146;s operations consist of five worldwide reportable segments: Alumina, Primary Metals, Global Rolled Products, Engineered Products and Solutions, and Transportation and Construction Solutions.

The Alumina segment primarily consists of a series of affiliated operating entities referred to as Alcoa World Alumina and Chemicals (AWAC). Alcoa owns 60% and Alumina Limited owns 40% of these individual entities. For more information on AWAC, see Exhibit Nos. 10(a) through 10(f)(1) to this report. 

Proposed Separation Transaction 

On September 28, 2015, Alcoa announced that its Board of Directors approved a plan to separate into two independent, publicly-traded companies. One company will comprise the Alumina and Primary Metals segments and the other company will comprise the Global Rolled Products, Engineered Products and Solutions, and Transportation and Construction Solutions segments. Alcoa is targeting to complete the separation in the second half of 2016. The 

&#160; 

transaction is subject to a number of conditions, including, but not limited to, final approval by Alcoa&#146;s Board of Directors, receipt of a favorable opinion of legal counsel with respect to the tax-free nature of the transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes, completed financing, and the effectiveness of a Form 10 registration statement to be filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Upon completion of the separation, Alcoa shareholders will own all of the outstanding shares of both companies. Alcoa may, at any time and for any reason until the proposed transaction is complete, abandon the separation plan or modify or change its terms. 

Bauxite Interests 

This Bauxite Interests section explains the Company&#146;s interests in various bauxite mines throughout the world. Bauxite is one of the Company&#146;s basic raw materials and is also a product sold into the third-party marketplace. This section provides mine description and reserve and annual production figures in respect of the Company&#146;s interests. 

Aluminum is one of the most abundant elements in the earth&#146;s crust. Aluminum metal is produced by smelting alumina. Alumina is produced primarily from refining bauxite. Bauxite contains various aluminum hydroxide minerals, the most important of which are gibbsite and boehmite. Alcoa processes most of the bauxite that it mines into alumina. The Company obtains bauxite from its own resources and from those belonging to the AWAC enterprise, located in the countries listed in the table below, as well as pursuant to both long-term and short-term contracts and mining leases. Tons of bauxite are reported as bone dry metric tons (bdmt) unless otherwise stated. See the glossary of bauxite mining related terms at the end of this section. 

During 2015, mines operated by Alcoa (owned by Alcoa and AWAC) produced 38.3 million bdmt and separately mines operated by third parties (with Alcoa and AWAC equity interests) produced 7.0 million bdmt on a proportional equity basis for a total bauxite production of 45.3 million bdmt. 

Based on the terms of its bauxite supply contracts, AWAC bauxite purchases from Minera&#231;&#227;o Rio do Norte S.A. (MRN) and Compagnie des Bauxites de Guin&#233;e (CBG) differ from its proportional equity in those mines. Therefore during 2015, AWAC had access to 47.8 million bdmt of production from its portfolio of mines. 

During 2015, AWAC sold 2.0 million bdmt of bauxite to third parties and purchased 1.1 million bdmt from third parties. The bauxite delivered to Alcoa and AWAC refineries amounted to 46.8 million bdmt during 2015. 

The Company is growing its third-party bauxite sales business. During the third quarter of 2015, Alcoa received permission from the Government of Western Australia to export trial shipments from its Western Australia mines. 

The Company has access to large bauxite deposit areas with mining rights that extend in most cases more than 20 years from the date of this report. For purposes of evaluating the amount of bauxite that will be available to supply as feedstock to its refineries, the Company considers both estimates of bauxite resources as well as calculated bauxite reserves. Bauxite resources represent deposits for which tonnage, densities, shape, physical characteristics, grade and mineral content can be estimated with a reasonable level of confidence based on the amount of exploration sampling and testing information gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes. Bauxite reserves represent the economically mineable part of resource deposits, and include diluting materials and allowances for losses, which may occur when the material is mined. Appropriate assessments and studies have been carried out to define the reserves, and include consideration of and modification by realistically assumed mining, metallurgical, economic, marketing, legal, environmental, social and governmental factors. Alcoa employs a conventional approach (including additional drilling with successive tightening of the drill grid) with customized techniques to define and characterize its various bauxite deposit types allowing Alcoa to confidently establish the extent of its bauxite resources and their ultimate conversion to reserves. 

The table below only includes the amount of proven and probable reserves controlled by the Company. While the level of reserves may appear low in relation to annual production levels, they are consistent with historical levels of reserves for the Company&#146;s mining locations. Given the Company&#146;s extensive bauxite resources, the abundant supply of bauxite 

&#160; 

globally and the length of the Company&#146;s rights to bauxite, it is not cost-effective to invest the significant funds and efforts necessary to establish bauxite reserves that reflect the total size of the bauxite resources available to the Company. Rather, bauxite resources are upgraded annually to reserves as needed by the location. Detailed assessments are progressively undertaken within a proposed mining area and mine activity is then planned to achieve a uniform quality in the supply of blended feedstock to the relevant refinery. Alcoa believes its present sources of bauxite on a global basis are sufficient to meet the forecasted requirements of its alumina refining operations for the foreseeable future. 

Bauxite Resource Development Guidelines 

Alcoa has developed best practice guidelines for bauxite reserve and resource classification at its operating bauxite mines. Alcoa&#146;s reserves are declared in accordance with Alcoa&#146;s internal guidelines as administered by the Alcoa Ore Reserves Committee (AORC). The reported ore reserves set forth in the table below are those that Alcoa estimates could be extracted economically with current technology and in current market conditions. Alcoa does not use a price for bauxite, alumina, or aluminum to determine its bauxite reserves. The primary criteria for determining bauxite reserves are the feed specifications required by the customer alumina refinery. In addition to these specifications, a number of modifying factors have been applied to differentiate bauxite reserves from other mineralized material. Alcoa mining locations have annual in-fill drilling programs designed to progressively upgrade the reserve and resource classification of their bauxite.

Qualifying statements relating to the table above: 

Australia&#151;Darling Range Mines: Huntly and Willowdale are the two AWAC active mines in the Darling Range of Western Australia. The mineral lease issued by the State of Western Australia to AofA is known as ML1SA and its term extends to 2024. The lease can be renewed for an additional twenty-one year period to 2045. The declared reserves are as for December 31, 2015. The amount of reserves reflects the total AWAC share. Additional resources are routinely upgraded by additional exploration and development drilling to reserve status. The Huntly and Willowdale mines supply bauxite to three local AWAC alumina refineries. 

Brazil&#151;Po&#231;os de Caldas: Declared reserves are as for December 31, 2015. Tonnage is total Alcoa share. Additional resources are being upgraded to reserves as needed. 

Brazil&#151;Juruti RN101, RN102, RN103, RN104, #34: Declared reserves are as for December 31, 2015. All reserves are on Capiranga Plateau. Declared reserves are total AWAC share. Declared reserve tonnages and the annual production tonnage are washed product tonnages. The Juruti mine&#146;s operating license is periodically renewed. 

&#160; 

Suriname&#151;Suralco: The AWAC mines in Suriname were curtailed in the fourth quarter of 2015. AWAC has no plans to restart these mines and there are no reserves to declare. 

Brazil&#151;Trombetas-MRN: Declared reserves have been estimated by MRN as for December 31, 2015. The CP Report for December 31, 2015 reserves is expected to be issued on or about February 29, 2016. Declared and annual production tonnages reflect the total for Alum&#237;nio and AWAC shares (18.2%). Declared tonnages are washed product tonnages. 

Guinea&#151;Bok&#233;-CBG: Declared reserves are based on export quality bauxite and have been estimated by CBG as for December 31, 2015. The CP Report for December 31, 2015 reserves is expected to be issued in March 2016. Declared tonnages reflect only the AWAC share of CBG&#146;s reserves. Annual production tonnage is reported based on AWAC&#146;s 22.95% share. Declared reserves quality is reported based on total alumina (TAl 2 O 3 ) and total silica (TSiO 2 ) because CBG export bauxite is sold on this basis. Additional resources are being routinely drilled and modeled to upgrade to reserves as needed. 

Kingdom of Saudi Arabia&#151;Al Ba&#146;itha: The Al Ba&#146;itha Mine began production during 2014 and production was increased in 2015. Declared reserves are as for December 31, 2015.

Ore is delivered to the refinery by road from the Onverdacht area and by river barge from the Coermotibo area. &#160; Alcoa &#160; Brokopondo Concession from the Government of Suriname. Concessions formerly owned by a BHP Billiton (BHP) subsidiary that was a 45% joint venture partner in the Surinamese bauxite mining and alumina refining joint ventures. AWA LLC acquired that subsidiary in 2009. After the acquisition of the subsidiary, its name was changed to N.V. Alcoa Minerals of Suriname. &#160;

Expires in 2033. 

&#160; Alcoa became active in Suriname in 1916 with the founding of the Suriname Bauxite Company. Bauxite was first exported in 1922. The Brokopondo Agreement was signed in 1958. 

As noted, Suralco bought the bauxite and alumina interests of a BHP subsidiary from BHP in 2009. 

&#160; Open-cut mines. At one of the mines, the overburden is dredged and mining progresses with conventional open-cut methods. The protoliths of the bauxite have been completely weathered. The bauxite deposits are mostly derived from the weathering of Tertiary Paleogene arkosic sediments. In some places, the bauxite overlies Precambrian granitic and gneissic rocks which have been deeply weathered to saprolite. Bauxitization likely occurred during the middle to late Eocene Epoch. 

&#160; Commercial grid power. &#160; In the Onverdacht mining areas, the bauxite is mined and transported to the refinery by truck. In the Coermotibo mining areas, the bauxite is mined, stockpiled and then transported to the refinery by barge. Some of the ore is washed in a small beneficiation plant located in the Coermotibo area. The main mining administrative offices, services, workshops and laboratory are located at the refinery in Paranam. The ore is crushed at Paranam and fed into the refining process. 

&#160;

The Suralco mines were curtailed in the fourth quarter of 2015. There are no plans for AWAC to restart these mines.

Kingdom of Saudi Arabia Joint Venture 

In December 2009, Alcoa and Saudi Arabian Mining Company (Ma&#146;aden) entered into a joint venture to develop a fully integrated aluminum complex in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. In its initial phases, the complex includes a bauxite mine with an initial capacity of 4 million bdmt per year; an alumina refinery with an initial capacity of 1.8 million mt per year (mtpy); an aluminum smelter with an initial capacity of ingot, slab and billet of 740,000 mtpy; and a rolling mill with initial capacity of 380,000 mtpy. The mill will produce a variety of sheet products. 

The refinery, smelter and rolling mill are located within the Ras Al Khair industrial zone on the east coast of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. 

The smelter and refinery are fully operational. The mine construction was completed in the second quarter of 2015 and ramp up of operations is proceeding as planned. 

Total capital investment is expected to be approximately $10.8 billion (SAR 40.5 billion). Ma&#146;aden owns a 74.9% interest in the joint venture. Alcoa owns a 25.1% interest in the smelter and rolling mill, with AWAC holding a 25.1% interest in the mine and refinery.

As of December 31, 2015, Alcoa had approximately 2,801,000 mtpy of idle capacity against total Alcoa Consolidated Capacity of 17,271,000 mtpy. 

In March 2015, the Company initiated a 12-month review of 2,800,000 mtpy in refining capacity for possible curtailment (partial or full), permanent closure or divestiture. This review is part of the Company&#146;s target to lower Alcoa&#146;s refining operations on the global alumina cost curve to the 21st percentile (currently 23 rd ) by the end of 2016. As part of this review, in March 2015, the Company decided to curtail 443,000 mtpy (one digester) of capacity at the Suralco refinery; this action was completed by the end of April 2015. 

Additionally, in September, the Company decided to curtail the remaining capacity (887,000 mtpy&#151;two digesters) at Suralco; the Company completed it by the end of November 2015 (877,000 mtpy of capacity at Suralco had previously been curtailed). The Company is currently in discussions with the Suriname government to determine the best long-term solution for Suralco due to limited bauxite reserves and the absence of a long-term energy alternative. 

During 2015, Alcoa undertook curtailment of the remaining 2,010,000 mtpy of capacity at the Point Comfort, Texas refinery (295,000 mtpy had previously been curtailed). This action is expected to be completed by the end of June 2016 (375,000 mtpy was completed by the end of December 2015). 

As noted above, Alcoa and Ma&#146;aden have developed an alumina refinery in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Initial capacity of the refinery is 1.8 million mtpy. The refinery produced approximately 1.0 million mt in 2015. For additional information regarding the joint venture, see the Equity Investments section of Note I to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. (Financial Statements and Supplementary Data). 

In November 2005, AWA LLC and Rio Tinto Alcan Inc. (RTA) signed a Basic Agreement with the Government of Guinea that sets forth the framework for development of a 1.5 million mtpy alumina refinery in Guinea. In 2006, the 

&#160; 

Basic Agreement was approved by the Guinean National Assembly and was promulgated into law. The Basic Agreement was originally set to expire in November 2008, but was extended several times, most recently to November 2015. Alcoa completed a pre-feasibility study in 2008, further pre-feasibility work in 2012, and concluded its evaluation of the project in 2015. AWA LLC and RTA agreed that current market conditions are unable to support the development of the project as originally conceived and the Basic Agreement expired in November 2015. 

In September 2006, Alcoa received environmental approval from the Government of Western Australia for expansion of the Wagerup alumina refinery to a maximum capacity of 4.7 million mtpy, a potential increase of over 2 million mtpy. This approval had a term of five years and included environmental conditions that must be satisfied before Alcoa could seek construction approval for the project. The project was suspended in November 2008 due to global economic conditions and the unavailability of a secure long-term energy supply in Western Australia. These constraints continue and as such the project remains under suspension. In May 2012, the Government of Western Australia granted Alcoa a 5 year extension of the original environmental approval. In 2015, Alcoa applied for a further five year extension. The extension has not yet been granted and there has been no additional work done on the project. 

In 2015, Alcoa and Vietnam National Coal-Minerals Industries Group began discussions regarding potential cooperation to improve the operational and technical performance of the Tan Rai Refinery which started up in 2014. In January 2016, the parties entered into a non-disclosure agreement to support and further the development of this potential cooperation. The parties continue to discuss a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU).

&#160;

9 &#160; In January 2016, Alcoa announced that it will permanently close the Warrick smelter by the end of the first quarter of 2016 (see below). 

&#160;

10 &#160; The Rockdale smelter has been fully curtailed since the end of 2008. 

&#160;

11 &#160; The Intalco smelter has had approximately 49,000 mtpy of idle capacity. In November 2015, the Company announced that it would idle the remaining 230,000 mtpy capacity by the end of the first quarter of 2016. In January 2016, Alcoa announced that it will delay this further curtailment of the smelter until the end of the second quarter of 2016 (see below). 

&#160;

12 &#160; The Wenatchee smelter has had approximately 41,000 mtpy of idle capacity. The Company idled the remaining 143,000 mtpy of capacity by the end of December 2015. 

As of December 31, 2015, Alcoa had approximately 778,000 mtpy of idle capacity against total Alcoa Consolidated Capacity of 3,401,000 mtpy. 

In March 2015, the Company initiated a 12-month review of 500,000 mtpy of smelting capacity for possible curtailment (partial or full), permanent closure or divestiture. This review is part of the Company&#146;s target to lower Alcoa&#146;s smelting operations on the global aluminum cost curve to the 38th percentile (currently 43 rd ) by 2016. As part of this review, in March 2015, Alcoa decided to curtail the remaining capacity (74,000 mtpy) at the Alumar smelter; this action was completed in April 2015. 

Separate from the smelting capacity review described above, in June 2015, Alcoa decided to permanently close the Po&#231;os de Caldas smelter (96,000 mtpy) in Brazil effective immediately. The Po&#231;os de Caldas smelter had been temporarily idle since May 2014 due to challenging global market conditions for primary aluminum and higher operating costs, which made the smelter uncompetitive. The decision to permanently close the Po&#231;os de Caldas smelter was based on the fact that these underlying conditions had not improved. As a result, the Po&#231;os de Caldas smelter was removed from the table above. 

In November 2015, Alcoa announced that it would curtail 503,000 mtpy of aluminum smelting capacity amid prevailing market conditions by idling capacity at the Massena West (130,000 mtpy), Intalco (230,000 mtpy) and Wenatchee (143,000 mtpy) smelters. The curtailment of the remaining capacity at Wenatchee was completed by the end of December 2015 and the curtailment of the remaining capacity at Intalco was expected to be completed by the end of March 2016. The casthouses at Massena West and Intalco will continue to operate. Later in November 2015, the Company announced that it had entered into a three-and-a-half year agreement with New York State to increase the competitiveness of the Massena West smelter. As a result, the Massena West smelter will continue to operate. 

In January 2016, the Company announced it will delay the curtailment (230,000 mtpy) of its Intalco smelter in Ferndale, Washington until the end of the second quarter of 2016. Recent decreases in energy and raw material costs have made it more cost effective in the near term to keep the smelter operating. 

&#160; 

In January 2016, Alcoa announced that it will permanently close its 269,000 mtpy Warrick Operations smelter in Evansville, Indiana by the end of the first quarter of 2016. The rolling mill and power plant at Warrick Operations will continue to operate. 

As noted above, Alcoa and Ma&#146;aden have developed an aluminum smelter in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The smelter has an initial nameplate capacity of 740,000 mtpy. Since mid-2014, the smelter has been operating at full capacity and it produced 757,833 mt in 2015. 

In 2014, Alcoa and the Brunei Economic Development Board agreed to extend for four years an existing MOU to enable more detailed studies into the feasibility of establishing a modern, gas-powered aluminum smelter in Brunei Darussalam to follow a period of strategic assessment of global market conditions. 

In 2007, Alcoa and the Greenland Government entered into an MOU regarding cooperation on a feasibility study for an aluminum smelter with a 360,000 mtpy capacity in Greenland. The MOU also encompasses a hydroelectric power system and related infrastructure improvements, including a port. Due to unfavorable global market conditions for primary aluminum, Alcoa and the Greenland Government entered into negotiations in 2015 to address, among other subjects, formalizing an extension of estimated dates for Alcoa to achieve certain of its undertakings under the MOU, and providing the Greenland Government latitude to develop hydro resources throughout Greenland. Negotiations between the parties are anticipated to complete in 2016. 

Global Rolled Products 

The Company&#146;s Global Rolled Products segment represents Alcoa&#146;s midstream operations. For a discussion of this segment&#146;s business, see &#147;Results of Operations&#151;Segment Information&#148; in Part II, Item 7. (Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations) and Note Q to the Consolidated Financial Statements&#151;Segment and Geographic Area Information in Part II, Item 8. (Financial Statements and Supplementary Data). 

In March 2015, Alcoa sold its Russia-based aluminum mill in Belaya Kalitva, Alcoa Metallurg Rus, to a subsidiary of Stupino Titanium Co. 

In September 2015, Alcoa announced the completion of an expansion at its Tennessee facility dedicated to supplying aluminum sheet to the automotive industry. The Tennessee plant will provide aluminum sheet to automakers such as Ford Motor Company, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and General Motors. The expansion created approximately 200 full-time jobs. 

In 2014, Alcoa announced a $190 million investment at its Davenport Works facility to expand its product offerings in the aerospace and industrial markets through the installation of technology that will enhance the performance of thick aluminum and aluminum-lithium plate for use in various applications such as wing ribs and fuselage frames for the aerospace market. Construction on this project began in 2015, with first customer production expected in 2017. 

In October 2015, Alcoa entered into an agreement with the Danieli Group, a global supplier of plants and equipment to the metals industry, to license and commercialize its Micromill technology. Under the agreement, Alcoa licenses the patented technology to Danieli that will manufacture and sell Micromill equipment to mill operators that will also be licensed by Alcoa. The Alcoa-patented Micromill process produces metal with a microstructure that is distinct from the microstructure obtained from conventional rolling, allowing the production of an aluminum alloy for automotive applications that has 40 percent greater formability and 30 percent greater strength than the incumbent aluminum used today while meeting stringent automotive surface quality requirements. Additionally, automotive parts made with Micromill material will be twice as formable and at least 30 percent lighter than parts made from high strength steel. The Micromill will enable the next generation of automotive aluminum products, and equip Alcoa to capture growing automotive demand. 

&#160; 

Also in 2014, Alcoa announced a $40 million investment in its Itapissuma, Brazil rolling mill to increase production of specialty foils for aseptic and flexible packages. Initial work for the expansion is underway and commissioning is expected to begin in 2016. 

As noted above, Alcoa and Saudi Arabian Mining Company (Ma&#146;aden) entered into a joint venture to develop a fully integrated aluminum complex in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. It includes among other things the Ma&#146;aden Rolling Company, which owns the rolling mill that has capacity to produce 380,000 mtpy and is 74 acres under roof.

3 &#160; The Texarkana rolling mill facility has been idle since September 2009 due to a continued weak outlook in common alloy markets. In September 2015, the Company announced that it is restarting its Texarkana casthouse to meet demand for aluminum slab for the automotive industry. The aluminum slab that will be cast at Texarkana will be turned into aluminum sheet at Alcoa&#146;s recently expanded automotive facility in Davenport, Iowa and its rolling mill in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. 

Engineered Products and Solutions 

This segment represents a portion of Alcoa&#146;s downstream operations. For a discussion of this segment&#146;s business, see &#147;Results of Operations&#151;Segment Information&#148; in Part II, Item 7. (Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations) and Note Q to the Consolidated Financial Statements&#151;Segment and Geographic Area Information in Part II, Item 8. (Financial Statements and Supplementary Data). In the third quarter 2015, Alcoa realigned its downstream portfolio into two segments (Engineered Products and Solutions and Transportation and Construction Solutions). Following the realignment, Engineered Products and Solutions consists of: Alcoa Titanium &#38; Engineered Products; Alcoa Fastening Systems &#38; Rings; Alcoa Forgings and Extrusions; and Alcoa Power and Propulsion. 

&#160; 

On March 3, 2015, Alcoa completed its acquisition of TITAL, a privately held company based in Germany. TITAL is a leader in titanium and aluminum structural castings for aircraft engines and airframes. In addition, TITAL is a leader in process technology. 

In June 2015, Alcoa announced that it is investing $22 million in Hot Isotopic Pressing technology at its facility in Whitehall, Michigan. The investment will enable Alcoa to capture growing demand for advanced titanium, nickel and additive manufactured parts for the world&#146;s bestselling engines. Alcoa expects that the new technology will be ready for product qualification in 2016. 

On July 23, 2015, Alcoa completed the acquisition of RTI International Metals, Inc. (RTI), a global supplier of titanium and specialty metal products and services for commercial aerospace, defense, energy and medical device markets. Following the acquisition, RTI was renamed Alcoa Titanium &#38; Engineered Products. 

Also in October 2015, Alcoa officially opened its expanded jet engines part facility in La Porte, Indiana. The $100 million expansion of the Indiana facility enables Alcoa to manufacture single piece structural parts that are 60 percent larger than those already produced in La Porte. 

In 2014, Alcoa commenced an expansion of its Hampton, Virginia facility to create the capability to employ a new process technology that improves jet engine blades. The expansion was completed in fourth quarter 2015. The Hampton facility includes technology that cuts the weight of the Company&#146;s highest-volume jet engine blades by 20 percent and significantly improves aerodynamic performance. 

Alcoa and VSMPO-AVISMA Corporation signed a cooperation agreement in October 2013, which allowed the companies to meet growing demand for high-end titanium and aluminum products for aircraft manufacturers worldwide. The new joint venture will focus on manufacturing high-end aerospace products, such as landing gear and forged wing components, at Alcoa&#146;s plant in Samara, Russia. The definitive Shareholders&#146; Agreement was executed by the parties on July 16, 2014, and the deal is expected to close in the second quarter of 2016. The facility is now operational.

In January 2015, Alcoa opened its expanded wheels manufacturing plant in Hungary, doubling Alcoa&#146;s capacity to produce its Dura-Bright &#174; EVO surface-treated wheels compared with 2014 production levels. The $13 million expansion is expected to create 35 new jobs in Hungary once the facility reaches full capacity. 

Alcoa Wheel and Transportation Products has vertically integrated by building a new aluminum casthouse in Mexico for a total cost of $22 million to convert the scrap generated throughout the Mexico wheels flowpaths into ingot. While the first ingot was cast in November 2014, the run rate production was achieved in March 2015.

Because of the number of different types of elements that can be used to produce Alcoa&#146;s various alloys, providing a range of such elements would not be meaningful. With the exception of a very small number of internally used products, Alcoa produces its alloys in adherence to an Aluminum Association standard. The Aluminum Association, of which Alcoa is an active member, uses a specific designation system to identify alloy types. In general, each alloy type has a major alloying element other than aluminum but will also have other constituents as well, but of lesser amounts. 

Energy 

Employing the Bayer Process, Alcoa refines alumina from bauxite ore. Alcoa then produces aluminum from the alumina by an electrolytic process requiring substantial amounts of electric power. Energy accounts for approximately 19% of the Company&#146;s total alumina refining production costs. Electric power accounts for approximately 23% of the Company&#146;s primary aluminum production costs. Alcoa generates approximately 14% of the power used at its smelters worldwide and generally purchases the remainder under long-term arrangements. The paragraphs below summarize the sources of power and natural gas for Alcoa&#146;s smelters and refineries. 

North America &#150; Electricity 

The Deschambault, Baie Comeau, and B&#233;cancour smelters in Qu&#233;bec purchase electricity under long-term contracts with Hydro-Qu&#233;bec executed in 2014, which will expire on December 31, 2029. Upon expiration, Alcoa will have the option of extending the term of the Baie Comeau contract to February 23, 2036. The smelter located in Baie Comeau, Qu&#233;bec purchases approximately 73% of its power needs under the Hydro-Qu&#233;bec contract, and the remainder from a 40% owned hydroelectric generating company, Manicouagan Power Limited Partnership. 

The Company&#146;s wholly-owned subsidiary, Alcoa Power Generating Inc. (APGI) owns and operates the Yadkin hydroelectric project, consisting of four dams in North Carolina, and the Warrick coal-fired power plant located in Indiana. 

For several years, APGI has been pursuing a new long-term license for the Yadkin hydroelectric project from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). In 2007, APGI filed with FERC a Relicensing Settlement Agreement signed by a majority of interested stakeholders that broadly resolved open issues. The National Environmental Policy Act process was complete, and a final environmental impact statement was issued in April 2008. The remaining requirement for relicensing was the issuance by North Carolina of the required water quality certification under Section 401 of the Clean Water Act (401 WQC). North Carolina&#146;s Department of Environment Quality ((DEQ), formally known as Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR)) issued a 401 WQC to APGI on October 23, 2015. The period for appeals has passed with no aggrieved party filing an appeal. FERC has been notified of the final 401 WQC, completing all necessary items required for FERC to process the application. 

&#160; 

On August 2, 2013, the State of North Carolina filed suit in state court seeking a declaratory ruling that it, not APGI, owns the Yadkin riverbed beneath the hydroelectric project as well as a portion of the project dams. APGI removed the riverbed lawsuit to federal court in 2013. On May 6, 2015, U.S. Federal Judge Terrance Boyle declared that the relevant segment of the Yadkin River was not navigable at the time of North Carolina statehood and issued a ruling on September 28, 2015 that APGI owns the riverbed for the 37-mile relevant segment. The State of North Carolina has filed an appeal with the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. 

Pending completion of the relicensing process, APGI received year-to-year license renewals from FERC starting in May 2008, and will continue to operate under annual licenses until FERC issues a new license. Since the permanent closure of the Badin, North Carolina smelter, power generated from APGI&#146;s Yadkin system is largely being sold to an affiliate, Alcoa Power Marketing LLC, and then into the wholesale market. 

APGI generates substantially all of the power used at the Company&#146;s Warrick, Indiana smelter using nearby coal reserves. Since May 2005, Alcoa has owned the nearby Friendsville, Illinois coal reserves, with the Friendsville Mine being operated by Vigo Coal Company, Inc. (Vigo Coal). The Friendsville Mine is producing approximately 900,000 tons of coal per year and is scheduled to cease production at the end of March 2016. Liberty Mine, also owned by Alcoa and operated by Vigo Coal, produces coal and is operating at a level of approximately 1.4 million tons per year. Friendsville and Liberty Mines together supply 99% of the power plant&#146;s needs. The balance of the coal used is royalty coal. 

In the State of Washington, Alcoa&#146;s Wenatchee smelter is served by a contract with Chelan County Public Utility District (Chelan PUD) under which Alcoa receives approximately 26% of the hydropower output of Chelan PUD&#146;s Rocky Reach and Rock Island dams. In November 2015, Alcoa announced the curtailment of the Wenatchee smelter which was completed by the end of December 2015. 

Starting on January 1, 2013, the Intalco smelter began receiving physical power from the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) pursuant to a contract executed between Alcoa and BPA, under which Alcoa receives physical power at the Northwest Power Act mandated industrial firm power (IP) rate through September 30, 2022. In May 2015, the contract was amended to reduce the amount of physical power received from BPA and allow for additional purchases of market power. 

Prior to 2007, power for the Rockdale smelter in Texas was historically supplied from Company-owned generating units and Sandow Unit 4 owned by Luminant Generation Company LLC (formerly TXU Generation Company LP) (Luminant), both of which used lignite supplied by the Company&#146;s Sandow Mine and Three Oaks Mine. Upon completion of lignite mining in the Sandow Mine in 2005, lignite supply transitioned to the formerly Alcoa-owned Three Oaks Mine. The Company retired its three wholly-owned generating units at Rockdale (Sandow Units 1, 2 and 3) in late 2006, and transitioned to an arrangement under which Luminant is to supply all of the Rockdale smelter&#146;s electricity requirements under a long-term power contract that does not expire until at least the end of 2038, with the parties having the right to terminate the contract after 2013 if there has been an unfavorable change in law or after 2025 (by Luminant only) if the cost of the electricity exceeds the market price. In August 2007, Luminant and Alcoa closed on the definitive agreements under which Luminant has constructed and operates a new circulating fluidized bed power plant (Sandow Unit 5) adjacent to the existing Sandow Unit 4 and, in September 2007, on the sale of Three Oaks Mine to Luminant. Concurrent with entering into the agreements under which Luminant constructed and operates Sandow Unit 5, Alcoa and Luminant entered into a power purchase agreement whereby Alcoa purchased power from Luminant. That Sandow Unit 5 power purchase agreement was terminated by Alcoa, effective December 1, 2010. In June 2008, Alcoa temporarily idled half of the capacity at the Rockdale smelter and in November 2008 curtailed the remainder of Rockdale&#146;s smelting capacity. In late 2011, Alcoa announced that it would permanently close two of the six idled potlines at the smelter. Demolition and remediation activities related to these actions were completed in 2013. On April 29, 2014, Luminant Generation LLC, Luminant Mining Company LLC, Sandow Power Company LLC and their affiliated debtors filed petitions under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code with the U.S Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. The Bankruptcy Court has confirmed the debtors&#146; amended plan of reorganization and has 

&#160; 

entered an order approving the debtors&#146; assumption of the Sandow Unit 4 agreement and certain other related agreements with the Company. 

In the Northeast, the Massena West smelter in New York receives physical power from the New York Power Authority (NYPA) pursuant to a contract between Alcoa and NYPA, which expires in 2045. In December 2015, Alcoa and NYPA agreed upon a new power contract that will expire in 2019. Upon final approval of the contract by New York State, which is expected in the first half of 2016, the new power contract for physical power will replace the prior contract. 

Australia &#150; Electricity 

In 2015 Alcoa permanently closed the Anglesea power station and associated coal mine in Victoria. The power station had previously provided electricity to the Point Henry smelter which closed in 2014. Since the Port Henry smelter closure, electricity was sold into the National Electricity Market (NEM); however a combination of low electricity prices and significant future capital expenditure meant the facility was no longer viable. 

The Portland smelter continues to purchase electricity from the State Electricity Commission of Victoria (SECV) under a contract with Alcoa Portland Aluminium Pty Ltd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of AofA, that extends to October 2016. Upon the expiration of this contract, the Portland smelter will purchase power from the NEM variable spot market. In March 2010, AofA and Eastern Aluminium (Portland) Pty Ltd separately entered into fixed for floating swap contracts with Loy Yang (now AGL) in order to manage their exposure to the variable energy rates from the NEM. The fixed for floating swap contract with AGL for the Point Henry smelter was terminated in 2013. The fixed for floating swap contract with AGL for the Portland smelter operates from the date of expiration of the current contract with the SECV and continues until December 2036. 

Brazil &#150; Electricity Alum&#237;nio owns a 25.74% stake in Cons&#243;rcio Machadinho, which is the owner of the Machadinho hydroelectric power plant located in southern Brazil. 

Alum&#237;nio has a 42.18% interest in Energ&#233;tica Barra Grande S.A., which built the Barra Grande hydroelectric power plant in southern Brazil. 

Alum&#237;nio also has a 34.97% share in Serra do Fac&#227;o Energia S.A., which built the Serra do Fac&#227;o hydroelectric power plant in the southeast of Brazil. 

Alum&#237;nio is also participating in the Estreito hydropower project in northern Brazil, through Estreito Energia S.A. (an Alum&#237;nio wholly owned company) holding a 25.49% stake in Cons&#243;rcio Estreito Energia, which is the owner of the hydroelectric power plant. 

A consortium in which Alum&#237;nio participates and that had received concessions for the Pai Quer&#234; hydropower project in southern Brazil (Alum&#237;nio&#146;s share is 35%) decided not to pursue the development of this concession which will be returned to the Federal Government. 

Since May 2015 (after full curtailment of Po&#231;os de Caldas and Alumar smelters), the excess generation capacity of around 460MW has been sold into the market. 

Europe &#150; Electricity 

Alcoa&#146;s smelters at San Cipri&#225;n, La Coru&#241;a and Avil&#233;s, Spain purchase electricity under bilateral power contracts that commenced on January 1, 2013. The contracts for San Cipri&#225;n and Avil&#233;s smelters each have a four-year term (expiring December 31, 2016). The contract for the La Coru&#241;a smelter, which expired on December 31, 2015, has been extended for an additional year (expiring December 31, 2016). 

&#160; 

A competitive bidding mechanism to allocate interruptibility rights in Spain was settled during 2014 to be applied starting from January 1, 2015. The first auction process to allocate rights took place in November 2014, where Alcoa secured 275MW of interruptibility rights for the 2015 period for the San Cipri&#225;n smelter. A second auction process took place in December 2014, where Alcoa secured an additional 100MW of interruptibility rights for the 2015 period for the San Cipri&#225;n smelter (20x5MW), 120MW for the La Coru&#241;a smelter (24x5MW) and 110MW for the Avil&#233;s smelter (22x5MW). The auction process to allocate the rights for the following period took place in the first week of September 2015, where Alcoa secured interruptibility rights for 2016 in the amount of 375MW for San Cipri&#225;n Smelter (3x90MW + 21x5MW), 115MW for Avil&#233;s Smelter (23x5MW) and 120MW for La Coru&#241;a smelter (24x5MW). 

Alcoa owns two smelters in Norway, Lista and Mosj&#248;en, which have long-term power arrangements in place that continue until the end of 2019. Financial compensation of the indirect carbon emissions costs passed through in the electricity bill is received in accordance with EU Commission Guidelines and Norwegian compensation regime. 

Iceland &#150; Electricity 

Alcoa&#146;s Fjar&#240;a&#225;l smelter in eastern Iceland began operation in 2007. Central to those operations is a forty-year power contract under which Landsvirkjun, the Icelandic national power company, built the K&#225;rahnj&#250;kar dam and hydropower project, and supplies competitively priced electricity to the smelter. In late 2009, Iceland imposed two new taxes on power intensive industries, both for a period of three years, from 2010 through 2012. One tax is based on energy consumption; the other is a pre-payment of certain other charges that was recoverable partly in 2014 and will be fully recovered by end of 2018. In 2012, Iceland extended the energy consumption tax through 2015. 

Spain &#150; Natural Gas 

In order to facilitate the full conversion of the San Ciprian, Spain alumina refinery from fuel oil to natural gas, in October 2013, Alumina Espa&#241;ola SA (AE) and Gas Natural Transporte SDG SL (GN) signed a take or pay gas pipeline utilization agreement. Pursuant to that agreement, the ultimate shareholders of AE, Alcoa Inc. and Alumina Limited, agreed to guarantee the payment of AE&#146;s contracted gas pipeline utilization over the four years of the commitment period; in the event AE fails to do so, each shareholder being responsible for its respective proportionate share (i.e., 60/40). Such commitment came into force six months after the gas pipeline was put into operation by GN. The gas pipeline was completed in January 2015 and the refinery has switched to natural gas consumption for 100% of its needs. 

Three supply contracts were signed in 2014 for the supply of natural gas to the San Cipri&#225;n, Spain alumina refinery during the 2015 period with Endesa, Union Fenosa Gas and BP, expiring by April 2016, December 2015 and December 2015, respectively. In 2015, the Endesa supply contract expiring in April 2016 was extended until June 2017, the BP supply contract expiring in December 2015 was extended until December 2016 and a new contract with Gas Natural Fenosa was signed expiring by December 2016. Pursuant to those agreements, Alcoa Inversiones Espa&#241;a, S.L. and Alumina Limited agreed to guarantee the payment of AE&#146;s obligations under the Endesa contract that expires in April 2016, each shareholder being responsible for its respective proportionate share (i.e., 60/40). In the same way, Alcoa Inespal S.A. and Alumina Limited have agreed to guarantee the payment of AE&#146;s obligations under the Gas Natural Fenosa contract over its respective length, with each entity being responsible for its proportionate share (i.e., 60/40). 

North America &#150; Natural Gas 

In order to supply its refinery and smelters in the U.S. and Canada, Alcoa generally procures natural gas on a competitive bid basis from a variety of sources, including producers in the gas production areas and independent gas marketers. For Alcoa&#146;s larger consuming locations in Canada and the U.S., the gas commodity and the interstate pipeline transportation are procured (directly or via the local distribution companies) to provide increased flexibility and reliability. Contract pricing for gas is typically based on a published industry index or New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) price. The Company may choose to reduce its exposure to NYMEX pricing by hedging a portion of required natural gas consumption. 

&#160; 

Australia &#150; Natural Gas 

AofA holds a 20% equity interest in the Dampier-to-Bunbury natural gas pipeline (this interest was purchased in October 2004). This pipeline transports gas from the northwest gas fields to Alcoa&#146;s alumina refineries and other users in the Southwest of Western Australia. Alcoa uses gas to co-generate steam and electricity for its alumina refining processes at the Kwinana, Pinjarra and Wagerup refineries. More than 90% of Alcoa&#146;s gas requirements for the remainder of the decade are secured under long-term contracts. In 2015, AofA entered into a number of long-term gas supply agreements which now means a significant portion of Alcoa&#146;s gas supplies are secured to 2030. Alcoa has remained actively involved with projects aimed at developing cost-based gas supply opportunities.

Patents, Trade Secrets and Trademarks 

The Company believes that its domestic and international patent, trade secret and trademark assets provide it with a significant competitive advantage. The Company&#146;s rights under its patents, as well as the products made and sold under them, are important to the Company as a whole and, to varying degrees, important to each business segment. The patents owned by Alcoa generally concern particular products or manufacturing equipment or techniques. Alcoa&#146;s business as a whole is not, however, materially dependent on any single patent, trade secret or trademark. As a result of product development and technological advancement, the Company continues to pursue patent protection in jurisdictions throughout the world. At the end of 2015, the Company&#146;s worldwide patent portfolio consisted of approximately 986 pending patent applications and 1,923 granted patents. 

The Company has a number of trade secrets, mostly regarding manufacturing processes and material compositions that give many of its businesses important advantages in their markets. The Company continues to strive to improve those processes and generate new material compositions that provide additional benefits. 

The Company also has a number of domestic and international registered trademarks that have significant recognition within the markets that are served. Examples include the name &#147;Alcoa&#148; and the Alcoa symbol for aluminum products, Howmet metal castings, Huck &#174; fasteners, Kawneer &#174; building panels and Dura-Bright &#174; wheels with easy-clean surface treatments. The Company&#146;s rights under its trademarks are important to the Company as a whole and, to varying degrees, important to each business segment. 

&#160; 

Competitive Conditions 

Alcoa is subject to highly competitive conditions in all aspects of its aluminum and non-aluminum businesses. Competitors include a variety of both U.S. and non-U.S. companies in all major markets. Innovation, price, quality, and service are the principal competitive factors in Alcoa&#146;s markets. Where aluminum, titanium and nickel products compete with other materials&#151;such as steel and plastics for automotive and building applications; magnesium, composites, and plastics for aerospace and defense applications&#151;aluminum, titanium and nickel&#146;s diverse characteristics, particularly the strength, light weight, recyclability, and flexibility are also significant factors. Alcoa&#146;s customer intimacy, advanced manufacturing capability, technology, technical expertise, and innovation in multi-materials and in specialized alloys provide Alcoa a competitive advantage in certain markets and/or for certain products. For Alcoa&#146;s segments that market products under Alcoa&#146;s brand names, brand recognition, and brand loyalty also play a role. In addition Alcoa&#146;s competitive position depends, in part, on the Company&#146;s access to an economical power supply to sustain its operations in various countries. 

Research and Development 

Alcoa, a light metals technology leader, engages in research and development programs that include process and product development, and basic and applied research. Expenditures for research and development (R&#38;D) activities were $238 million in 2015, $218 million in 2014, and $192 million in 2013. 

The Company continued to work on new developments in all business segments in 2015. With a focus on multi-materials, the Company integrated acquisitions of TITAL, Firth Rixson and RTI which expanded its reach into aerospace by adding advanced technologies and materials capabilities, particularly in titanium&#151;the world&#146;s fastest-growing aerospace metal. 

The Company continued leveraging new technologies in 2015. Among them, the Company entered into a Joint Development Agreement with Ford to collaborate on next-generation aluminum alloys for automotive parts using Micromill technology. Working with Phinergy on advancing an aluminum air battery technology, the Company will make an equity investment of up to $10 million and will be the exclusive anode provider for applications with auto OEMs and energy utilities. Additionally, the Company completed its jet engine expansion in Hampton, Virginia. This facility includes technology that cuts the weight of the Company&#146;s highest-volume jet engine blades by 20 percent and significantly improves aerodynamic performance. 

The Company has invested $60 million in the expansion of its R&#38;D center designed to accelerate the development of additive manufacturing, with a focus on producing metal powder materials tailored for a range of additive process technologies. Alcoa will further its development of advanced 3D-printing design and manufacturing techniques&#151;such as Alcoa&#146;s Ampliforge&#153; process&#151;to improve production speeds, reduce costs, and achieve geometries not possible through traditional methods. The investment also leverages the Company&#146;s testing and process control expertise to overcome challenges with qualifying new 3D-printed parts, starting with aerospace applications. 

In 2015 several products spanning various industries were brought to market. Notably, Ford began use of Micromill &#174; material, and Alcoa and Danieli Group agreed to license intellectual property associated with advanced Micromill &#174; alloys and process technology. Samsung unveiled its Galaxy S6 Smartphone using 6013 Alcoa Power Plate&#153; product for 70 percent greater strength than standard aluminum. The Company launched four foundry alloys that offer strength, thermal performance, corrosion resistance, and at least 20% better fatigue resistance in automotive applications. In addition, Dura-Bright &#174; EVO, Alcoa&#146;s most durable, easy-to-maintain commercial truck wheel, was brought to the North American market. 

Environmental Matters 

Information relating to environmental matters is included in Note N to the Consolidated Financial Statements under the caption &#147;Environmental Matters&#148; on pages 130-134. Approved capital expenditures for new or expanded facilities for environmental control are approximately $60 million for 2016 and $70 million for 2017. 

&#160; 

&#160;
