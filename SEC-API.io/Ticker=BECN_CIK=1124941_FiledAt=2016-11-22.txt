 ITEM 1. BUSINESS &#160; 

Unless the context suggests otherwise, the terms &#8220;Beacon,&#8221; the &#8220;Company,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;our&#8221; or &#8220;us&#8221; are referring to Beacon Roofing Supply, Inc. 

&#160;

Overview 

&#160;

Beacon is the second largest (and largest publicly traded) distributor of residential and non-residential roofing materials in the United States, with leading positions in key metropolitan markets in both the United States and Canada. We also distribute complementary building products, including siding, windows, specialty exterior building products, insulation, and waterproofing systems for residential and non-residential building exteriors. We purchase products from a large number of manufacturers and then distribute these goods to a customer base consisting of contractors, and to a lesser extent, general contractors, home builders, retailers, and building materials suppliers.

&#160;

As of September 30, 2016, we operated 368 branches in 46 states throughout the United States and 6 provinces in Canada. We stock one of the most extensive assortments of high quality branded products in the industry, with over 46,000 SKUs available across our branch network, enabling us to deliver products to serve nearly 67,000 customers on a timely basis.

&#160;

On October 1, 2015, we acquired Roofing Supply Group, LLC (&#8220;RSG&#8221;), a leading roofing products distributor owned by an investment partnership controlled by Clayton, Dubilier &#38; Rice, LLC and employee stockholders, in a cash and stock transaction valued at approximately $1.17 billion. Headquartered in Dallas, Texas at the time of the acquisition RSG distributed roofing supplies and related materials from 85 locations across 25 states, including the key Western and Southern markets of California, Florida, Texas, as well as the Pacific Northwest market, with branches in Seattle and Spokane.

&#160;

For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 (&#8220;fiscal year 2016&#8221; or &#8220;2016&#8221;), residential roofing products comprised 53.0% of our sales, non-residential roofing products accounted for 32.4% of our sales, and siding, waterproofing systems, windows, and other exterior building products provided the remaining 14.6% of our sales. Approximately 96% of our net sales were to customers located in the United States.

&#160;

We also provide our customers a comprehensive array of value-added services, including:

&#160;

&#160; &#183; Advice and assistance to contractors throughout the construction process, including product identification, specification and technical support; &#160;

&#160; &#183; Job site delivery, rooftop loading and logistical services; &#160;

&#160; &#183; Tapered insulation design and layout services; &#160;

&#160; &#183; Metal fabrication and related metal roofing design and layout services; &#160;

&#160; &#183; Trade credit and online bill pay; and &#160;

&#160; &#183; Marketing support, including project leads for contractors. &#160;

We believe the additional services we provide strengthen our relationships with our customers and distinguish us from our competition, as the vast majority of orders require at least some of these services. Our ability to provide these services efficiently and reliably can save contractors time and money while also enabling us to achieve attractive gross profit margins on our product sales. We have earned a reputation for providing a high level of product availability and high-quality service from our experienced employees who provide timely, accurate and safe delivery of products.

&#160;

Our diverse customer base generally includes a significant portion of the residential and non-residential roofing contractors from the markets in which we operate. These roofing contractors typically are involved on a local basis in the replacement, or re-roofing, component of the roofing industry. We utilize a branch-based operating model that allows branches to maintain local customer relationships and benefit from our centralized infrastructure. This operating model allows us to benefit from the resources and scale efficiencies of being a national distributor while still providing customers with specialized products and personalized local services tailored to their specific geographic region.

&#160;

We have achieved our growth through a combination of 37 strategic and complementary acquisitions since our initial public offering (&#8220;IPO&#8221;) in 2004, opening new branch locations and broadening our product offerings. In fiscal year 2016, we acquired 127 branches and opened 1 new branch. We have grown from $652.9 million in net sales in fiscal year 2004 to $4.13 billion in net sales in fiscal year 2016, which represents a twelve-year compound annual growth rate (&#8220;CAGR&#8221;) of 16.6%. Our organic growth, which includes growth from existing and newly opened branches but excludes growth from acquired branches, averaged 5.3% per annum over the same period. Acquired branches are excluded from organic growth measures until they have been under our ownership for at least four full fiscal quarters at the start of the reporting period. Since our IPO, we have opened 73 new branch locations, and during this same period existing market sales excluding greenfields increased at an average of 2.3% per annum. Existing market sales excluding greenfields are defined as the aggregate sales from branches open for the entire comparable annual periods. Income from operations has increased from $34.7 million in fiscal year 2004 to $205.0 million in fiscal year 2016, which represents an twelve-year CAGR of 16.0%. We believe that our proven business model can continue to deliver industry-leading growth and operating profit margins.

Our Industry 

&#160;

According to a biannual industry study published in August 2016 by the international business research company, The Freedonia Group (&#8216;&#8216;Freedonia&#8217;&#8217;), the total United States roofing market (measured by sales at the manufacturers&#8217; level) was estimated to be valued at approximately $14.4 billion in sales in 2015. Beacon management estimates that the total U.S. roofing market, when measured by sales at the distribution level, was approximately $20 billion in sales in 2014, taking into account Beacon&#8217;s historical gross product sales margin as applied to the Freedonia data.

&#160;

Roofing demand (measured by sales at the manufacturers&#8217; level) in the United States is projected to grow 7.2% annually through 2020 to $19.6 billion, according to Freedonia. This would represent a rebound from the 2009 &#8722; 2014 period, with growth expected to be driven by both residential and non-residential building construction activity. 

&#160;

The United States roofing market can be separated into two categories: the residential roofing market and the non-residential roofing market. The residential roofing market accounted for approximately 54% of the total United States market by unit volume in 2015. Through 2019, residential roofing construction in dollars is expected to grow at 9.3% annually which is faster than Freedonia&#8217;s non-residential roofing demand (in dollars) estimated growth rate of 5.3%, as new residential construction is projected to continue to recover from the low levels experienced from the 2007-2009 recession and its aftermath. Because residential roofing market growth is currently expected to exceed non-residential roofing market growth, demand for steep-slope roofing is expected to rise more rapidly than for low-slope products.

&#160;

Historically, over 75% of expenditures in the United States roofing market are for re-roofing projects, with the balance being for new construction. In 2015 re-roofing projects accounted for approximately 79% of roofing demand (in dollars). According to the National Association of Home Builders, approximately 94% of re-roofing demand in the United States is non-discretionary, with owners forced to invest in repairs to respond to unforeseen circumstances. Re-roofing projects are generally considered maintenance and repair expenditures and are less likely than new construction projects to be postponed during periods of recession or slow economic growth. As a result, demand for roofing products has historically been less volatile than overall demand for construction products.

&#160;

Net sales from re-roofing are also expected to increase as the median age of owner occupied housing has increased from 23 years in 1985 to 38 years in 2013, according to U.S. Census data. As homes age, new and re-roof demand increases as homeowners are forced to replace or repair old, deteriorating roofs. The aging U.S. housing stock, combined with below average roofing shingle volumes, supports a favorable supply/demand dynamic in the residential repair and remodel market in the coming years.

&#160;

Regional variations in economic activity influence the level of demand for roofing products across the United States. Of particular importance are regional differences in the level of new home construction and renovation. Demographic trends, including population growth and migration, contribute to the regional variations through their influence on regional housing starts and existing home sales.

&#160;

In addition to our operations with the United States, we also operate in 6 provinces in Canada, which in total represent approximately 4% of our total net sales. We expect overall demand for operations in Canada to grow at rate similar to our United States operations.

&#160; 

Roofing Distributors 

&#160;

Wholesale distribution is the dominant distribution channel for both residential and nonresidential roofing products. Wholesale roofing product distributors serve the important role of facilitating the purchasing relationships between roofing materials manufacturers and thousands of contractors. Wholesale distributors can maintain localized inventories, extend trade credit, give product advice and provide delivery and logistics services.

&#160;

Despite some recent consolidation, the roofing materials distribution industry remains highly fragmented. The industry is characterized by a large number of small and local regional participants. The vast majority of our competition comes from local and regional roofing supply distributors, and, to a much lesser extent, other building supply distributors and &#8216;&#8216;big box&#8217;&#8217; retailers. Among distributors, we compete against a small number of large distributors and many small and local privately-owned distributors. As a result of their small size, many of these distributors lack the corporate, operating and IT infrastructure required to compete effectively.

&#160;

&#160; 5 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Residential Roofing 

&#160;

Within the residential roofing market, the re-roofing market is currently more than three and a half times the size of the new roofing market, accounting for approximately 78% of the residential roofing unit demand in 2015 compared to a historic long-term rate of about 86%, according to Freedonia

&#160;

Asphalt shingles dominate the residential roofing market, with an approximate 84% share, and historically have had an expected average useful life of 15 to 20 years. Freedonia estimates that residential roofing construction (in dollars) is expected to grow at 9.3% annually through 2020.

&#160;

A number of other factors can also generate re-roofing demand, including one-time weather damage and homeowners looking to upgrade their homes. In addition, sales of existing homes can affect re-roofing demand, as some renovation decisions are made by sellers preparing their houses for sale and others are made by new owners within the first two years of occupancy.

&#160;

Within the new construction portion of the residential roofing market, growth has historically been driven by housing starts, together with larger average roof sizes. Demand for roofing installed in new residential construction and additions to existing structures is forecast to grow over 6.6% annually to 35.0 million squares in 2020. While this was an increase from the depressed 2010 base, demand for roofing in new residential building construction applications in 2015 was still significantly below that of 2005. However, US housing starts (including manufactured housing shipments) marked their fourth consecutive year of robust growth in 2015, advancing 11% to 1.18 million units. Through 2020, housing starts are projected to reach 1.62 million units on growth of 6.4% per year.

&#160;

Non-residential Roofing 

&#160;

Historically, re-roofing projects have accounted for approximately 81% of non-residential roofing demand (in dollars). In 2015, re-roofing projects represented nearly 80% of the total non-residential demand. As with residential re-roofing, non-residential re-roofing activity tends to be less cyclical than new construction and depends, in part, upon the types of materials on existing roofs, their expected lifespan and intervening factors such as wind or water damage.

&#160;

Non-residential roofing construction (in dollars) is forecast by Freedonia to grow 1.6%, per year through 2020. Gains are expected to be driven by non-residential new construction, which is expected to see 6.6% annual gains in unit demand during that time, as non-residential building construction expenditures rebound from their low 2014 level. The office and commercial construction segment are expected to experience the most rapid gains if construction expenditures in that market rise sharply as currently anticipated.

&#160;

The non-residential roofing market includes an office and commercial market, an industrial market, and an institutional market. Office and commercial roofing projects represent the single largest component of the non-residential roofing market in 2015 at 37% of demand (in dollars) in 2015, according to Freedonia. Industrial roofing projects represent 20% of non-residential roofing product sales (in dollars), while institutional projects and others make up the remaining 32% of non-residential roofing demand (in dollars).

&#160;

Complementary Building Products 

&#160;

Demand for complementary building products such as siding, windows and doors for both the residential and non-residential markets has been at historically low levels in recent years, consistent with the downturns in the new construction markets and in the overall economy. Unlike the roofing industry, demand for these products is more discretionary and influenced much greater by the new construction markets.

&#160;

These complementary products are a major component of the overall building products market. The United States siding market was estimated to be approximately $7.5 billion in 2014, while the United States window and door industry was estimated to be approximately $24.4 billion in 2014, according to the most recent information available from Freedonia. Both of these markets have been negatively impacted by the low level of new housing starts in recent years, but are estimated by Freedonia to grow at an annual rate (in dollars) of approximately 7.3% for the siding market and 5% for the window and door industry through 2018.

&#160;

Our Strengths 

&#160;

We believe the sales and earnings growth we have achieved over time has been, and will continue to be, driven by our primary competitive strengths, which include the following:

&#160;

&#183; Leading roofing distribution platform with a national scope combined with regional expertise. We are the second largest (and largest publicly traded) distributor of residential and non-residential roofing materials in the United States, and we maintain leading positions in key metropolitan markets across the United States and Canada. Our geographic footprint is designed to provide advantages in the regional markets we serve. We utilize a branch-based operating model whereby branches cultivate and maintain local customer relationships while benefiting from centralized functions such as information technology, marketing, accounting, financial reporting, credit, purchasing, human resources, legal and tax services. We provide our customers with specialized products and personalized local services tailored to their specific geographic region, with the resources and scale efficiencies of a national distributor. &#160;

&#160; 6 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; Diversified business model in a stable environment. Our business historically has been protected in times of economic downturn because of the non-discretionary nature of most re-roofing demand, the mix of our sales between residential and non-residential products, our geographic and customer diversity, and the financial and operational ability to expand our business and obtain market share. We have a long history of organic sales growth and healthy gross margins through a variety of economic cycles. Over the last twelve fiscal years, our total and existing market net sales have increased by a CAGR of 16.6%, (including growth through acquisitions) and our gross margins in existing markets (i.e., excluding acquisitions) have averaged approximately 24%. &#160;

&#183; Well-positioned in attractive roofing demand markets. We believe that our national distribution platform is strategically positioned to benefit from a North American market recovery, and we expect that improving economic conditions and continued recovery in residential and non-residential construction activity will drive the demand for additional roofing materials and complementary building products. &#160;

&#183; Superior customer service to our well established, long-term customer base . Our diverse customer base consists of contractors, home builders, building owners, and other resellers. A significant number of our customers have relied on us as their vendor of choice for decades, and we believe that these strong customer relationships cannot easily be replicated. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016, no single customer accounted for more than 2% of our net sales. &#160;

We believe that the services provided by our employees improve our customers&#8217; efficiency and profitability, which, in turn, strengthens our customer relationships. We consider customer relations and our employees&#8217; knowledge of roofing and exterior building materials to be very important to our ability to increase customer loyalty and maintain customer satisfaction. We invest significant resources in professional development, management skills, product knowledge and operational proficiency. The in-depth knowledge of the materials we sell and their applications allows our sales personnel to provide technical advice and value-added service to our customers throughout the construction process.

&#160;

We provide a number of value-added services to our customers. In particular, we support our customers with: advice and assistance on product identification, specification and technical support; timely job site delivery, rooftop loading and logistical services; tapered insulation design and related layout services; metal fabrication and related metal roofing design and layout services; trade credit; and marketing support, including project leads for contractors.

&#160;

&#183; Strong platform for growth and acquisition. From the time of our IPO in 2004, we increased net sales at rates well in excess of the overall growth in the roofing materials distribution industry. We have expanded our business through strategic acquisitions, new branch openings, and the diversification of our product offering. We generally have improved the financial and operating performance of our acquired companies and helped them to grow their businesses following acquisition &#160;

&#183; Strong cash flow generation driven by a stable business model. We have increased net sales in eight of the last ten fiscal years. Our track record of growth, combined with limited capital expenditure requirements, has resulted in strong free cash flow across all economic cycles. We have a strong history of managing our debt leverage effectively and we have successfully reduced leverage subsequent to the RSG transaction. &#160;

&#183; Centralized IT platform. We have made a significant investment in our information systems, including the ongoing development of a platform for online sales. All of our locations, except for one fabrication facility, operate on the same management information systems, providing us with a consistent platform to deliver excellent customer service and achieve operating efficiencies in purchasing, pricing and inventory management. Our systems have substantial capacity to handle our future growth plans without requiring significant additional investment. &#160;

&#183; Industry-leading management team with a track record of integration. We believe that our key employees, including branch managers, regional vice presidents and executive officers, are among the most experienced members of the roofing industry and have a track record of achieving strong revenue growth and delivering profitability. Since Beacon became a publicly traded company in 2004, the Beacon management team has successfully completed and integrated 37 acquisitions and opened 73 new greenfield locations. &#160;

Our Growth Strategies 

&#160;

Our objective is to be the preferred supplier of roofing and other exterior building product materials across markets in the United States and Canada while continuing to increase net sales and maximize our profitability. We plan to attain these goals by executing the following strategies:

&#160;

&#160; 7 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; Expand product offering and increase cross-selling activities. Due to the unique characteristics of each geographic region, our local customers typically require market specific product offerings. We believe we have one of the most extensive offerings of high-quality branded products in the industry, with over 46,000 SKUs available across our branch network, however there remain opportunities for branches expand their current product rosters. This will create additional opportunities for our branches to cross-sell more products throughout our existing network. In particular, we seek to expand non-residential roofing sales into markets where we currently sell mostly residential roofing. In addition, we work closely with customers and suppliers to identify new products and services, and continue to expand our product offering to include complementary building materials such as windows, siding, doors, waterproofing systems, insulation and metal fabrication. &#160;

&#183; Continue to provide exceptional customer service and roofing expertise. We provide a comprehensive array of high-quality products and offer value-added services. In fiscal year 2016, we were able to support our customers by fulfilling approximately 97% of warehouse orders through our in-stock inventory as a result of the breadth and depth of the inventory maintained at our local branches. We believe that our focus on providing both value-added services and accurate and rapid order fulfillment enables us to attract and retain customers. &#160;

&#183; Selectively pursue opportunities for organic growth and strategic acquisitions. Acquisitions and greenfield expansion is an important component of our growth strategy. We believe that there will be meaningful opportunities to further expand or intensify our geographic focus in contiguous or existing regions. We intend to continue to pursue our growth strategy while focusing on maintaining a strong balance sheet. &#160;

Since 2004, Beacon has opened 73 new branches through greenfield expansion. Beacon has a disciplined approach to new branch openings and its typical strategy is to open branches: (1) within its existing markets; (2) where existing customers have expanded into new markets; or (3) in areas that have limited or no acquisition candidates and are a good fit with its business model and culture.

&#160;

Since 2004, Beacon has completed 37 acquisitions. We believe that the roofing distribution sector remains fragmented and that there are significant opportunities to further grow our business through disciplined, strategic acquisitions. With only a few large, well-capitalized competitors in the industry, we believe we can continue to build on our distribution platform by successfully acquiring additional roofing materials distributors. Our main acquisition strategy is to target market leaders in geographic areas that we do not service or that complement our existing operations in an area.

&#160;

&#183; Enhance margins and free cash flow generation through continued execution of our growth strategy. We believe that as recent greenfield locations continue to ramp up, and if expected synergies and cost savings from acquisitions are realized, our margins will continue to improve. We also believe that we have an operating model that requires minimal capital, which, when combined with stable re-roofing demand, will position us for strong free cash flow generation. We intend to continue to use cash flows to support deleveraging and our continued platform growth. We have, and will continue to, invest heavily in our branch expansion. Although management estimates that our branch expansion strategy over the past several years has resulted in average upfront operating costs and capital expenditures, we believe these new branches will increase their contribution to our profitability and cash flow as they mature &#160;

Our Products and Services

Our product lines are designed to meet the requirements of both residential and non-residential roofing contractors. The products that we distribute are supplied by the industry&#8217;s leading manufacturers of high-quality roofing materials and related products (See &#8220;Purchasing and Suppliers&#8221;).

&#160;

In the residential market, asphalt shingles comprise the largest share of the products we sell. We distribute products such as high-end shingles, gutters and metal roofing products, and tile roofing. Additionally, we distribute downspouts, tools, nails, vinyl and fiber cement siding, windows, decking and related exterior shelter products to meet the expansive needs of our customers.

&#160;

In the non-residential market, single-ply roofing systems and the associated insulation products comprise the largest share of our product offering. Our single-ply roofing systems consist primarily of Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer (synthetic rubber) or &#8220;EPDM&#8221; and Thermoplastic Olefin or &#8220;TPO&#8221;, along with other roofing materials and related components. In addition to the broad range of single-ply roofing components, we sell asphaltic membranes and the insulation required in most non-residential roofing applications, such as tapered insulation. Our remaining non-residential products include metal roofing and flashings, fasteners, fabrics, coatings, roof drains, modified bitumen, built-up roofing and asphalt.

&#160; 

Services 

&#160;

We emphasize superior value-added services to our customers. We employ a knowledgeable sales force that possesses in-depth knowledge of roofing materials and applications and is capable of providing technical advice and assistance to contractors and other customers throughout the re-roofing and construction process. In particular, we support our customers with the following value-added services:

&#160;

&#160; &#183; advice and assistance on product identification, specification and technical support, and training services; &#160;

&#160; &#183; a large, service ready fleet with a broad footprint supporting timely job site delivery, rooftop loading and logistical services; &#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Our Customers 

&#160;

We serve nearly 67,000 customers, comprised of contractors, home builders, building owners, and other resellers across the continental United States and Canada. Our typical customer base varies by end market, with relatively small contractors in the residential market and small to large-sized contractors in the non-residential market. To a lesser extent, our customer base in a market can include general contractors, retailers and building materials suppliers. As evidenced by the fact that a significant number of our customers have relied on us or our predecessors as their vendor of choice for decades, we believe that we have strong customer relationships that our competitors cannot easily displace or replicate. No single customer accounts for more than 2% of our net sales.

&#160;

Our Culture and Employees 

&#160;

We believe our values based culture is a key differentiator which is critical to our success. We pride ourselves on attracting and retaining highly dedicated and customer focused employees at all levels of the organization. We maintain a safety-first environment and strong relations with our employees.

&#160;

As of September 30, 2016 we had 5,042 employees consisting of 648 in sales and marketing, 655 branch and assistant branch managers, 2,465 drivers, delivery helpers and warehouse workers, 1,242 general and administrative employees and 32 executives. We have 31 employees that are represented by labor unions and there are no outstanding labor disputes.

&#160;

Sales and Marketing 

&#160;

Sales strategy 

&#160;

Our sales strategy is to provide a comprehensive array of high-quality products and superior value-added services to residential and non-residential roofing contractors reliably, accurately and on time. In fiscal year 2016, we were able to support our customers by fulfilling approximately 97% of warehouse orders through our in-stock inventory as a result of the breadth and depth of the inventory maintained at our local branches. We believe that our focus on providing both superior value-added services and accurate and rapid order fulfillment enables us to attract and retain customers.

&#160;

Sales organization 

&#160;

We have attracted and retained an experienced sales force of approximately 616 employees who are responsible for generating sales at the local branch level. The expertise of our salespeople helps us to increase sales to existing customers and add new customers.

&#160;

Each of our branches is led by a branch manager, who also functions as the branch&#8217;s sales manager. In addition, each branch generally employs one to four outside salespeople and one to five inside salespeople who report to their branch manager. Branches that focus primarily on the residential market typically staff a larger number of outside salespeople.

&#160;

The primary objectives of our outside salespeople are to prospect for new customers and to increase sales to existing customers. These activities are supported by utilizing our CRM (Customer Relationship Management) system throughout our selling organization. We continue to use our proprietary LogicTrack software system to extract information on construction projects in our local markets. Once a construction project is identified, our design and estimating team creates job quotes, which, along with pertinent bid and job information, are readily available to our salespeople through LogicTrack. Our outside salespeople then contact potential customers in an effort to solicit their interest in participating with us in the identified project. Throughout this process, LogicTrack maintains a record of quoting activity, due dates, and other data to allow tracking of the projects and efficient follow-up. By seeking a contractor to &#8220;partner with&#8221; on a bid, we increase the likelihood that such contractor will purchase their roofing materials and related products from us in the event that the contractor is selected for the project.

&#160;

To complement our outside sales force, we have built an experienced and technically proficient inside sales staff that provides vital product expertise to our customers. Our inside sales force is responsible for fielding incoming orders, providing pricing quotations and responding to customer inquiries.

&#160;

In addition to our outside and inside sales forces, we employ representatives who act as liaisons for certain roofing materials manufacturers to assist with the promotion of specific products to professional contractors, architects and building owners. These relationships include exclusive geographic territories and we currently have a developed relationship with Carlisle on this basis.

&#160;

&#160; 10 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Marketing 

&#160;

In order to capitalize on established customer relationships and locally developed brands, we have maintained the trade names of most of the businesses that we have acquired. These trade names&#8212;such as Alabama Roofing Supply, Atlantic Building Products, Applicators Sales, Beacon Roofing Supply Canada Company, Beacon Sales, Best Distributing, Cassady Pierce, Coastal Metal Service, Dealers Choice, Enercon Products, Entrepot de la Toiture, Ford Wholesale, Fox Brothers Company, Groupe B&#233;dard, Intermountain Supply, JGA, JGA Beacon, Lyf-Tym Building Products, Lafayette Wood Works, McClure Johnston, Mississippi Roofing Supply, North Coast Roofing Systems, Pacific Supply, Posi-Pentes, Posi-Slope, ProCoat Systems, Quality Roofing Supply, RCI Roofing Supply, RIS Insulation Supply, RIS Roofing Supply, RIS Roofing and Insulation Supply, Roof Depot, Roofing Supply Group, Southern Roof Center, Statewide Wholesale, Structural Materials, The Roof Center, West End Roofing, Siding &#38; Windows, Wholesale Roofing Supply, Woodfeathers &#8212; are well-known in the local markets in which the respective branches compete and are associated with high-quality products and customer service.

&#160;

As a supplement to the efforts of our sales force, each of our branches communicates with residential and non-residential contractors in their local markets through newsletters, direct mail, social media and the Internet. In order to build and strengthen relationships with customers and vendors, we offer exclusive promotions and sponsor our own regional trade shows, which feature general business and roofing seminars for our customers and product demonstrations by our vendors. In addition, we attend numerous industry trade shows throughout the regions in which we compete, and we are an active member of the National Roofing Contractors Association, as well as certain regional contractors&#8217; associations.

&#160;

Purchasing and Suppliers 

&#160;

Our status as a leader in our core geographic markets, as well as our reputation in the industry, has allowed us to forge strong relationships with numerous manufacturers of roofing materials and related products, including Atlas Roofing, Building Products of Canada, Carlisle Syntec, CertainTeed Roofing, CertainTeed Siding, Firestone Building Products, GAF, Iko Manufacturing, James Hardie Building Products, Johns Manville Roofing, Malarkey, Mid-States Asphalt, Owens Corning Roofing, PlyGem, Soprema, and Tamko Building Products.

&#160;

We are viewed by our suppliers as a key distributor due to our industry expertise, past growth and profitability, significant market share, financial strength, and the substantial volume of products that we distribute.

&#160;

We manage the procurement of products through our national headquarters and regional offices, allowing us to take advantage of both our scale and local market conditions. We believe this enables us to purchase products more economically than most of our competitors. Product is shipped directly by the manufacturers to our branches or customers.

&#160;

Operations and Infrastructure 

&#160;

Operations 

&#160;

Our branch-based model provides each location with a significant amount of autonomy to operate within the parameters of our overall business model. Operations at each branch are tailored to meet local customer needs. Branch managers are responsible for sales, pricing and staffing activities, and have full operational control of customer service and deliveries. We provide our branch managers with significant incentives that allow them to share in the profitability of their respective branches as well as in the company as a whole. Employees at our regional and corporate operations assist the branches with, among other things, procurement, credit and safety services, fleet management, information systems support, contract management, accounting, treasury and legal services, human resources, benefits administration and sales and use tax services.

&#160;

Our distribution fulfillment process is initiated upon receiving a request for a contract job order or direct product order from a contractor. Under a contract job order, a contractor typically requests roofing or other construction materials and technical support services. The contractor discusses the project&#8217;s requirements with a salesperson and the salesperson provides a price quotation for the package of products and services. Subsequently, the salesperson processes the order and we deliver the products to the customer&#8217;s job site. In fiscal year 2016, we were able to support our customers by fulfilling approximately 97% of warehouse orders through our in-stock inventory as a result of the breadth and depth of the inventory maintained at our local branches

&#160; 

Facilities 

&#160;

As of September 30, 2016, our network of 368 branches was serving metropolitan areas in 46 states and 6 Canadian provinces. This network has enabled us to effectively and efficiently serve a broad customer base and to achieve a leading market position in each of our core geographic markets.

&#160;

Fleet 

&#160;

For the year ended September 30, 2016, our distribution infrastructure supported approximately one million deliveries. To accomplish this, we maintained a dedicated owned fleet of 1,389 straight trucks, 538 tractors and 993 trailers as of September 30, 2016. Nearly all of our delivery vehicles are equipped with specialized equipment, including 1,656 truck-mounted forklifts, cranes, hydraulic booms and conveyors, which are necessary to deliver products to rooftop job sites in an efficient and safe manner and in accordance with our customers&#8217; requirements.

&#160;

&#160; 11 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Our branches typically focus on providing materials to customers who are located within a two-hour radius of their respective facilities. Our branches generally make deliveries each business day.

&#160; 

Management Information Systems 

&#160;

We have fully integrated management information systems across our locations. Acquired businesses are moved to our IT platform as soon as feasible following acquisition. Our systems support every major internal operational function, except payroll, providing complete integration of purchasing, receiving, order processing, shipping, inventory management, sales analysis and accounting. The same databases are shared within the systems, allowing our branches to easily acquire products from other branches or schedule deliveries by other branches, greatly enhancing our customer service. Our systems also include a pricing matrix which allows us to refine pricing by region, branch, customer and customer type, or even a specific customer project. In addition, our systems allow us to centrally monitor all branch and regional performance as often as daily. We have centralized many functions to leverage our growing size, including accounts payable, insurance, payroll, employee benefits, vendor relations, and banking.

&#160;

All of our branches are connected to a common computer network via secure Internet connections or private data lines. We maintain redundant systems with transactional data getting replicated throughout each business day. We have the capability of electronically switching our operations to the disaster recovery system.

&#160;

We place purchase orders electronically with some of our major vendors. The vendors then transmit their invoices electronically to us. Our system automatically matches these invoices with the related purchase orders and then schedules the associated payment. We retain many financial, credit and other documents for purposes of internal approvals, online viewing and auditing.

&#160;

We have established an Internet portal that allows customers to access their invoice history and make online payments, and we are currently developing a platform that allows for the added capability for customers to place and track orders online.

&#160;

Government Regulations 

&#160;

We are subject to regulation by various federal, state, provincial and local agencies. These agencies include the Environmental Protection Agency, Department of Transportation, Occupational Safety and Health Administration and Department of Labor and Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. We believe we are in compliance in all material respects with existing applicable statutes and regulations affecting environmental issues and our employment, workplace health and workplace safety practices.

&#160;

In 2012, the United States Supreme Court upheld the majority of the provisions in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the &#8220;Act&#8221;). The Act places requirements on employers to provide a minimum level of benefits to employees and assesses penalties on employers if the benefits do not meet the required minimum level or if the cost of coverage to employees exceeds affordability thresholds specified in the Act. The minimum benefits and affordability requirements took effect in 2014. The Act also imposes an excise tax beginning in 2018 on plans whose average cost exceeds specified amounts. We have analyzed the effects on us from the provisions of the Act and we do not currently anticipate a significant financial impact.

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

Although we are one of the two largest roofing materials distributors in the United States and Canada, the United States roofing supply industry is highly competitive. The vast majority of our competition comes from local and regional roofing supply distributors, and, to a much lesser extent, other building supply distributors and &#8220;big box&#8221; retailers. Among distributors, we compete against a small number of large distributors and many small and local privately-owned distributors. The principal competitive factors in our business include, but are not limited to, the availability of materials and supplies; technical product knowledge and expertise; advisory or other service capabilities; pricing of products; and availability of credit and capital. We generally compete on the basis of the quality of our services, product quality and, to a lesser extent, price.

&#160;

Order Backlog 

&#160;

Order backlog is not a material aspect of our business and no material portion of our business is subject to government contracts.

&#160;

Seasonality 

&#160;

In general, sales and net income are highest during our first, third and fourth fiscal quarters, which represent the peak months of construction and re-roofing, especially in our branches in the northern and mid-western regions of the United States and in Canada. Our sales are substantially lower during the second quarter, when we usually incur net losses. These quarterly fluctuations have diminished as we have diversified further into the southern and western regions of the United States.

&#160;

&#160; 12 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

We generally experience our peak working capital needs during the third quarter after we build our inventories following the winter season but before we begin collecting on most of our spring receivables. Our principal source of liquidity is our cash and cash equivalents and borrowings under our revolving credit facility, so our borrowings tend to be highest in the third quarter of our fiscal year.

&#160;
