 ITEM 1. BUSINESS General 

Watsco, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, &#147;Watsco,&#148; or we, us or our ) was incorporated in Florida in 1956 and is the largest distributor of air conditioning, heating and refrigeration equipment and related parts and supplies (&#147;HVAC/R&#148;) in the HVAC/R distribution industry in North America. At December 31, 2015, we operated from 566 locations in 37 U.S. States, Canada, Mexico and Puerto Rico with additional market coverage on an export basis to portions of Latin America and the Caribbean, through which we serve approximately 88,000 active contractors and dealers that service the replacement and new construction markets. Our revenues in HVAC/R distribution have increased from $64.1 million in 1989 to $4.1 billion in 2015, resulting from our strategic acquisition of companies with established market positions and subsequent building of revenues and profit through a combination of additional locations, introduction of new products and other initiatives. 

&#160;

Our principal executive office is located at 2665 South Bayshore Drive, Suite 901, Miami, Florida 33133, and our telephone number is (305) 714-4100. Our website address on the Internet is www.watsco.com and e-mails may be sent to info@watsco.com. Our website address is included in this report only as an inactive textual reference. Information contained on, or available through, our website is not incorporated by reference in, or made a part of, this report. 

Air Conditioning, Heating and Refrigeration Industry 

The HVAC/R distribution industry is highly fragmented with approximately 2,300 distribution companies. The industry in the United States and Canada is well-established, having had its primary period of growth during the post-World War II era with the advent of affordable central air conditioning and heating systems for both residential and commercial applications. The advent of HVAC/R products in Latin America and the Caribbean is also well-established, but has emerged in more recent years as those economies have grown and products have become more affordable and have matured from luxury to necessity. 

Based on data published in the 2015 IBISWorld Industry Report for Heating and Air Conditioning Contractors in the U.S. and other available data, we estimate that the annual market on an installed basis for residential central air conditioning, heating and refrigeration equipment and related parts and supplies is approximately $80.0 billion. Air conditioning and heating equipment is manufactured primarily by seven major companies that together account for approximately 90% of all units shipped in the United States each year. These companies are: Carrier Corporation (&#147;Carrier&#148;), a subsidiary of United Technologies Corporation; Goodman Manufacturing Company, L.P. (&#147;Goodman&#148;), a subsidiary of Daikin Industries, Ltd.; Rheem Manufacturing Company (&#147;Rheem&#148;); Trane Inc. (&#147;Trane&#148;), a subsidiary of Ingersoll-Rand Company Limited; York International Corporation, a subsidiary of Johnson Controls, Inc.; Lennox International, Inc.; and Nordyne Corporation (&#147;Nordyne&#148;), a subsidiary of Nortek Corporation. These manufacturers distribute their products through a combination of factory-owned and independent distributors who, in turn, supply the equipment and related parts and supplies to contractors and dealers nationwide that sell to and install the products for consumers, businesses and other end-users. 

Air conditioning and heating equipment is sold to the replacement and new construction markets for both residential and commercial applications. The residential replacement market has increased in size and importance over the past several years as a result of the aging of the installed base of residential central air conditioners and furnaces, the introduction of new higher energy efficient models, the remodeling and expansion of existing homes, the addition of central air conditioning to homes that previously had only heating products and consumers&#146; overall unwillingness to live without air conditioning or heating products. The mechanical life of central air conditioning and furnaces varies by geographical region due to usage and ranges from approximately 8 to 20 years. According to data published by the Energy Information Administration in 2013, there are approximately 89 million central air conditioning and heating systems installed in the United States that have been in service for more than 10 years. Many installed units are currently reaching the end of their useful lives, which we believe will provide a growing and stable replacement market 

We sell a variety of other non-equipment products representing over 300,000 SKUs including parts, ductwork, air movement products, insulation, tools, installation supplies, thermostats and air quality products. We distribute products manufactured by Honeywell International, Inc. (&#147;Honeywell&#148;), Johns Manville (&#147;Johns Manville&#148;) and Owens Corning Insulating Systems, LLC (&#147;Owens Corning&#148;), among others. 

We also sell products to the refrigeration market. These products include condensing units, compressors, evaporators, valves, refrigerant, walk-in coolers and ice machines for industrial and commercial applications. We distribute products manufactured by Copeland Compressor Corporation, a subsidiary of Emerson Electric Co. (&#147;Emerson&#148;), The Chemours Company (&#147;Chemours&#148;), Mueller Industries, Inc. (&#147;Mueller&#148;) and The Manitowoc Company, Inc. (&#147;Manitowoc&#148;), among others. 

Culture and Business Strategy 

We have built our network of locations using a &#147;buy and build&#148; philosophy, which has produced substantial long-term growth in revenues and profits. The &#147;buy&#148; component of the strategy has focused on acquiring market leaders to either expand into new geographic areas or gain additional market share in existing markets. We have employed a disciplined and conservative approach that seeks opportunities that fit well-defined financial and strategic criteria. The &#147;build&#148; component of the strategy has focused on implementing a growth culture at acquired companies, by adding products and locations to better serve customers, investing in scalable technologies and exchanging ideas and business concepts amongst the executive management teams. Newly acquired businesses have access to our capital resources and established vendor relationships to provide their customers with an expanded array of product lines on favorable terms and conditions with an intensified commitment to service. The Company has also developed a culture whereby leaders, managers and employees are provided 

&#160;

the opportunity to own shares of Watsco through a variety of stock-based equity plans. The Company believes this culture instills a performance-driven, long-term focus on the part of its employees and aligns their interests with the interests of other shareholders of the Company. 

Strategy in Existing Markets 

Our strategy for growth in existing markets focuses on customer service and product expansion to satisfy the needs of the higher growth, higher margin replacement market, in which customers generally demand immediate, convenient and reliable service. We respond to this need by (i) offering a broad range of product lines, including the necessary equipment, parts and supplies to enable a contractor to install or repair a central air conditioner, furnace or refrigeration system, (ii) maintaining a strong density of warehouse locations for increased customer convenience, (iii) maintaining well-stocked inventories to ensure that customer orders are filled in a timely manner, (iv) providing a high degree of technical expertise at the point of sale and (v) developing and implementing technology to further enhance customer service capabilities. We believe these concepts provide a competitive advantage over smaller, less-capitalized competitors that are unable to commit resources to open and maintain additional locations, implement technological business solutions, provide the same range of products, maintain the same inventory levels or attract the wide range of expertise that is required to support a diverse product offering. In some geographic areas, we believe we have a competitive advantage over factory-operated distribution networks, which typically do not maintain inventories of parts and supplies that are as diversified as ours and which have fewer warehouse locations than we do, making it more difficult for these competitors to meet the time-sensitive demands of the replacement market. 

In addition to the replacement market, we sell to the new construction market, including new homes and commercial construction. We believe our reputation for reliable, high-quality service and relationships with contractors, who may serve both the replacement and new construction markets, allow us to compete effectively in these markets. 

Technology Strategy 

We are actively transforming our business into the digital age by investing in scalable platforms to further strengthen our leadership position, accelerate sales and profit growth, increase the speed and convenience of serving customers and extend our reach into new geographies and sales channels. Our technology initiatives include: (i) the development of mobile applications for iOS and Android devices focused on helping our customers operate more efficiently and interact with our locations more easily; (ii) implementing effective point-of-sale systems that allow timely and effective customer service, including up-to-date pricing, credit checks, credit card processing and inventory availability; (iii) enabling connectivity with our suppliers; (iv) enabling e-commerce between our customers and our subsidiaries; (v) the development and implementation of business analytics systems and related data sets, which provide enhanced management tools; (vi) supply chain optimization; (vii) building the largest source of digitized HVAC/R product information; and (viii) maintaining our website, ACDoctor.com, which educates consumers about energy efficient HVAC solutions and financial incentives related to the installation of energy efficient systems and connects them with high quality contractors. 

Performance-Based Compensation &#38; Stock-Based Equity Plans 

We maintain a culture that rewards performance through a variety of performance-based pay, commission programs, cash incentives and stock-based equity programs. Stock-based plans include 401(k) matching contributions to eligible employees, a voluntary employee stock purchase plan and the granting of stock options and non-vested restricted stock based on individual merit and measures of performance. Our equity compensation plans are designed to promote long-term performance, as well as to create long-term employee retention, continuity of leadership and an &#145;ownership culture&#146; whereby management and employees think and act as owners of the Company. We believe that our restricted stock program is particularly unique as an employee&#146;s restricted share grants generally vest entirely at the end of his or her career (age 62 or later) and are subject to significant risks of forfeiture prior thereto. 

Product Line Expansion 

We actively seek new or expanded territories of distribution from our key equipment suppliers. We continually evaluate new parts and supply products to support equipment sales and further enhance service to our customers. This initiative includes increasing the product offering with existing vendors and identifying new product opportunities through traditional and non-traditional supply channels. We have also introduced private-label products as a means to obtain market share and grow revenues. We believe that our private-label branded products complement our existing product offerings at selected locations, based on customer needs and the particular market position and price of these products. 

&#160;

Acquisition Strategy 

We focus on acquiring businesses that either complement our current presence in existing markets or establish a presence in new geographic markets. Since 1989, we have acquired 59 HVAC/R distribution businesses, six of which currently operate as primary operating subsidiaries. The other smaller acquired distributors have been integrated into or are under the management of our primary operating subsidiaries. Through a combination of sales and market share growth, opening of new locations, tuck-in acquisitions, expansion of product lines, improved pricing and programs that have resulted in higher gross profit, performance incentives and a culture of equity value for key leadership, we have produced substantial sales and earnings growth post-acquisition. We continue to pursue additional strategic acquisitions and/or joint ventures to allow further penetration in existing markets and expansion into new geographic markets. 

Operating Philosophy 

We encourage our local leadership to operate in a manner that builds upon the long-term relationships they have established between their suppliers and customers. Typically, we maintain the identity and culture of businesses by retaining their historical trade names, management teams and sales organizations and continuing their product brand-name offerings. We believe this strategy allows us to build on the value of the acquired operations by creating additional sales opportunities while providing an attractive exit strategy for the former owners of these companies. 

We maintain a specialized staff at our corporate headquarters that provides functional support for our subsidiaries&#146; growth strategies in their respective markets. Such functional support staff includes specialists in finance, accounting, product procurement, information technology, treasury and working capital management, tax planning, risk management and safety. Certain general and administrative expenses are targeted for cost savings by leveraging the overall business volume and improving operating efficiencies. 

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS 

Products 

We sell an expansive line of products and maintain a diverse mix of inventory to meet our customers&#146; immediate needs and seek to provide products a contractor would generally require when installing or repairing a central air conditioner, furnace or refrigeration system on short notice. The cooling capacity of air conditioning units is measured in tons. One ton of cooling capacity is equivalent to 12,000 British Thermal Units (&#147;BTUs&#148;) and is generally adequate to air condition approximately 500 square feet of residential space. The products we distribute consist of: (i) equipment, including residential ducted and ductless air conditioners ranging from 1 to 5 tons, gas, electric and oil furnaces ranging from 50,000 to 150,000 BTUs, commercial air conditioning and heating equipment and systems ranging from 1-1/2 to 25 tons and other specialized equipment, (ii) parts, including replacement compressors, evaporator coils, motors and other component parts and (iii) supplies, including thermostats, insulation material, refrigerants, ductwork, grills, registers, sheet metal, tools, copper tubing, concrete pads, tape, adhesives and other ancillary supplies. 

Sales of HVAC equipment accounted for 66% and 64% of our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Sales of other HVAC products (currently sourced from more than 1,300 vendors) comprised 29% and 31% of our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Sales of commercial refrigeration products accounted for 5% of our revenues for both the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. 

Distribution and Sales 

At December 31, 2015, we operated from 566 locations, a vast majority of which are located in regions that we believe have demographic trends favorable to our business. We maintain large inventories at each of our warehouse locations, and either deliver products to customers using one of our trucks or a third party logistics provider, or we make products available for pick-up at the location nearest to the customer. We have approximately 1,000 commissioned salespeople, averaging more than 11 years of experience in the HVAC/R distribution industry.

The largest market we serve is the United States, in which the most significant markets for HVAC/R products are in the Sun Belt States. Accordingly, the majority of our distribution locations are in the Sun Belt, with the highest concentration in Florida and Texas. These markets have been a strategic focus of ours given their size, the reliance by homeowners and businesses on HVAC/R products to maintain a comfortable indoor environment and the population growth in these areas over the last 40 years, which has led to a substantial installed base requiring replacement, a shorter useful life for equipment given the hours of operation and the focus by electrical utilities on consumer incentives designed to promote replacement of HVAC/R equipment in an effort to improve energy efficiency.

Joint Ventures with Carrier Corporation 

In 2009, we formed a joint venture with Carrier, which we refer to as Carrier Enterprise I, in which Carrier contributed 95 of its company-owned locations in 13 Sun Belt states and Puerto Rico and its export division in Miami, Florida, and we contributed 15 locations that distributed Carrier products. In July 2012, we exercised our option to acquire an additional 10% ownership interest in Carrier Enterprise I, which increased our ownership interest to 70%; and, on July 1, 2014, we exercised our last remaining option to acquire an additional 10% ownership interest in Carrier Enterprise I, which increased our controlling interest in Carrier Enterprise I to 80%. Neither we nor Carrier has any remaining options to purchase additional ownership interests in Carrier Enterprise I, or any of our other joint ventures with Carrier, which are described below. 

In 2011, we formed a second joint venture with Carrier and completed two additional transactions. In April 2011, Carrier contributed 28 of its company-owned locations in eight Northeast U.S. states, and we contributed 14 locations in the Northeast United States. In July 2011, we purchased Carrier&#146;s distribution operations in Mexico, which included seven locations. Collectively, the Northeast locations and the Mexico operations are referred to as Carrier Enterprise II. We have a 60% controlling interest in Carrier Enterprise II, and Carrier has a 40% non-controlling interest. 

In 2012, we formed a third joint venture, which we refer to as Carrier Enterprise III, with UTC Canada Corporation, referred to as UTC Canada, an affiliate of Carrier. Carrier contributed 35 of its company-owned locations in Canada to Carrier Enterprise III. We have a 60% controlling interest in Carrier Enterprise III, and UTC Canada has a 40% non-controlling interest. 

Combined, the joint ventures with Carrier represented 62% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015. See Supplier Concentration in &#147;Business Risk Factors&#148; in Item 1A. 

The business and affairs of the joint ventures are controlled, directed and managed exclusively by Carrier Enterprise I&#146;s, Carrier Enterprise II&#146;s and Carrier Enterprise III&#146;s respective boards of directors (the &#147;Boards&#148;) pursuant to related operating agreements. The Boards have full, complete and exclusive authority, power and discretion to manage and control the business, property and affairs of their respective joint ventures and to make all decisions regarding those matters and to perform activities customary or incident to the management of such joint ventures, including approval of distributions to us, Carrier and UTC Canada. Each Board is composed of five directors, of whom three directors represent our controlling interest and two directors represent Carrier&#146;s non-controlling interest. Matters presented to the Boards for vote are considered approved or consented to upon the receipt of the affirmative vote of at least a majority of all directors entitled to vote with the exception of certain governance matters, which require joint approval. 

Customers and Customer Service 

Air conditioning and heating contractors and dealers that install HVAC/R products in homes and businesses must be licensed given the highly-regulated nature of the products, refrigerant, natural gas and building and zoning requirements. We currently serve approximately 88,000 active contractors and dealers who service the replacement and new construction markets for residential and light commercial central air conditioning, heating and refrigeration systems. No single customer in 2015, 2014 or 2013 represented more than 1% of our consolidated revenues. We focus on providing products where and when the customer needs them, technical support by phone or on site as required, and quick and efficient service at our locations. Increased customer convenience is also provided through mobile applications and e-commerce, which allows customers to access information online 24 hours a day, seven days a week to search for desired products, verify inventory availability, obtain pricing, place orders, check order status, schedule pickup or delivery times and make payments. We believe we compete successfully with other distributors primarily on the basis of an experienced sales organization, strong service support, maintenance of well-stocked inventories, density of warehouse locations, high quality reputation, broad product lines and the ability to foresee customer demand for new products. 

Key Supplier Relationships 

Given our leadership position, Watsco represents a strategic business relationship to many of the leading manufacturers in our industry. Significant relationships with HVAC/R equipment manufacturers include Carrier, Rheem, Goodman, Manitowoc, Mitsubishi Electric Corporation, Gree Electric Appliances, Inc., Trane, Midea Group and Nordyne. In addition, we have substantial relationships with manufacturers of non-equipment HVAC/R products, including Chemours, Emerson, Honeywell, Johns Manville, Mueller and Owens Corning. 

We believe the diversity of products that we sell, along with the manufacturers&#146; current product offerings, quality, marketability and brand-name recognition, allow us to operate favorably relative to our competitors. To maintain brand-name recognition, the HVAC/R equipment manufacturers provide national advertising and participate with us in cooperative advertising programs and promotional incentives that are targeted to both dealers and end-users. We estimate that the replacement market for air conditioning products currently accounts for approximately 85% of industry sales in the United States, and we expect this percentage to increase as units installed in the past 20 years wear out or otherwise become practical to replace sooner with newer, more energy-efficient models. 

&#160;

The Company&#146;s top ten suppliers accounted for 84% of our purchases, including 62% from Carrier and 9% from Rheem. Given the significant concentration of our suppliers, particularly with Carrier and Rheem, any significant interruption with these suppliers could temporarily disrupt the operations of certain of our subsidiaries, impact current inventory levels and could adversely affect our financial results. Future financial results are also materially dependent upon the continued market acceptance of these manufacturers&#146; respective products and their ability to continue to manufacture products that comply with laws relating to environmental and efficiency standards. However, the Company believes that alternative or substitute products would be readily available in the event of disruption of current supplier relationships given the Company&#146;s prominence in the marketplace, including the number of locations, sales personnel, support structure, marketing and sales expertise, financial position and established market share. See &#147;Business Risk Factors&#148; in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion. 

Distribution Agreements 

We maintain trade name and distribution agreements with Carrier and Rheem that provide us distribution rights on an exclusive basis in specified territories that are not subject to a stated term or expiration date. We also maintain distribution agreements with various other suppliers, either on an exclusive or non-exclusive basis, for various terms ranging from one to ten years. Certain distribution agreements contain provisions that restrict or limit the sale of competitive products in the locations that sell such branded products. Other than where such location-level restrictions apply, we may distribute the lines of other manufacturer&#146;s air conditioning or heating equipment in other locations in the same territories. 

See Supplier Concentration in &#147;Business Risk Factors&#148; in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Seasonality 

Sales of residential central air conditioners, heating equipment and parts and supplies are seasonal. Furthermore, profitability can be impacted favorably or unfavorably based on the severity or mildness of weather patterns during Summer or Winter selling seasons. Demand related to the residential central air conditioning replacement market is typically highest in the second and third quarters, and demand for heating equipment is usually highest in the fourth quarter. Demand related to the new construction sectors throughout most of the markets is fairly even during the year except for dependence on housing completions and related weather and economic conditions. 

Competition 

We operate in highly competitive environments. We compete with a number of distributors and also with several air conditioning and heating equipment manufacturers that distribute a significant portion of their products through their own distribution organizations in certain markets. Competition within any given geographic market is based upon product availability, customer service, price and quality. Competitive pressures or other factors could cause our products or services to lose market acceptance or result in significant price erosion, all of which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. 

Employees 

We had approximately 5,000 employees as of December 31, 2015, substantially all of whom are non-union employees. Most of these employees are employed on a full-time basis, and our relations with our employees are good. 

Order Backlog 

Order backlog is not a material aspect of our business, and no material portion of our business is subject to government contracts. 

Government Regulations, Environmental and Health and Safety Matters 

Our business is subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the storage, handling, transportation and release of hazardous materials into the environment. These laws and regulations include the Clean Air Act, relating to minimum energy efficiency standards of HVAC systems and the production, servicing and disposal of certain ozone-depleting refrigerants used in such systems, including those established at the Montreal Protocol in 1992 concerning the phase-out of the production of CFC-based refrigerants on January 1, 2010 for use in new equipment. We are also subject to regulations concerning the transport of hazardous materials, including regulations adopted pursuant to the Motor Carrier Safety Act of 1990. Our operations are also subject to health and safety requirements including the Occupational, Safety and Health Act. We believe that we operate our business in compliance with all applicable federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations. 

&#160;

Our industry and business are also subject to a United States Department of Energy (&#147;DOE&#148;) mandate, effective January 1, 2015, that effects changes to the minimum required efficiency of HVAC systems. The DOE has divided the United States into three regions, the North, the Southeast and the Southwest, according to the number of hours that an air conditioner spends cooling a home during the hotter months. Prior to 2015, there was a national minimum standard for energy efficiency of 13 SEER (seasonal energy efficiency rating, the metric used to measure energy efficiency) for all equipment produced in the United States. Beginning in 2015, the new standard increased the minimum allowed efficiency to 14 SEER for the Southeast and Southwest regions. During 2015, the Company began transitioning out of its 13 SEER inventory in these regions while an increasing mix of higher-efficiency 14 SEER inventory was purchased and sold. The transition is expected to be complete by June 2016 in accordance with the timeline required by the mandate. 

Financial Information About Geographic Areas 

Our operations are primarily within the United States, including Puerto Rico, Canada and Mexico. Products are also sold from the United States on an export-only basis to portions of Latin America and the Caribbean Basin. The following tables set forth revenues and long-lived assets by geographic area (in millions):
