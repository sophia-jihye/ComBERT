Description of Historical Operations 

&#160; 

Acacia Diversified Holdings, Inc. (&#8220;we&#8221;, &#8220;us&#8221;, the &#8220;Company&#8221;, or the &#8220;Parent Company&#8221;) was incorporated in Texas on October 1, 1984 as Gibbs Construction, Inc. (&#8220;Gibbs&#8221;). The Company changed its name from Gibbs Construction, Inc. to Acacia Automotive, Inc. effective February 20, 2007. 

At a Special Meeting of the Company&#8217;s Shareholders on February 1, 2007, a majority of the Shareholders of the Company ratified all the actions recommended by the Company&#8217;s board of directors, including, among other matters: (i) effectuating a one for eight reverse stock split; (ii) increasing the number of authorized shares of common stock to 150,000,000 and authorizing a series of preferred stock with 2,000,000 shares; and, (ii) changing the Company&#8217;s name from Gibbs Construction, Inc. to Acacia Automotive, Inc., indicating the Company&#8217;s move into the automotive auction business. 

In July 2007, the Company caused to be formed Acacia Augusta Vehicle Auction, Inc., a South Carolina corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. (&#8220;AAVA&#8221;) for the purposes of acquiring certain assets of the Augusta Auto Auction in Augusta, Georgia, and operating an auction at that same location. This became the Company&#8217;s first operating asset in the automotive auction industry and was the Company&#8217;s only revenue producing business at that time. Later, in 2009, the Company caused to be formed Acacia Chattanooga Vehicle Auction, Inc., a Tennessee corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. (&#8220;ACVA&#8221;) for the purposes of acquiring certain assets of the Chattanooga Vehicle Auction in Chattanooga, Tennessee, and operating an auction at that same location. The latter acquisition represented the Company&#8217;s second, and final, automotive auction acquisition. 

Due to a dispute that arose with the seller of the Chattanooga Vehicle Auction, the Company discontinued operations there effective August 31, 2010, accounting for those operations as discontinued effective that date, and first accounted for those as discontinued operations in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2010. In late 2011, after successfully operating the Augusta auction for more than four years, the Company determined that it was in its best interests to sell the Augusta auction and thereafter entered into a Letter of Intent with two individuals for that purpose. The sale transaction was completed on July 31, 2012. Those events were reported in their entirety by the Company on its Current Report on Form 8-K on August 27, 2012, which in incorporated herein by reference. Following the disposition of the Augusta Vehicle Auction in 2012, the Company lacked significant operations and thereafter sought to become a diversified holding company. 

In accordance therewith, on October 18, 2012, the Company changed its name from Acacia Automotive, Inc. to Acacia Diversified Holdings, Inc. in an effort to exemplify the Company&#8217;s desire to expand into alternative industries as well as more diversified service and product offerings. 

On July 10, 2013 the Company, through its new wholly-owned Citrus Extracts, Inc. (&#8220;CEI&#8221;) subsidiary, entered into a definitive agreement to acquire certain assets and assumed certain liabilities related to those assets from Red Phoenix Extracts, Inc. (&#8220;RPE&#8221;), a corporation located in Fort Pierce, Florida. The assets included, among other things, furnishings, machinery, and equipment. As consideration for the assets, the Company issued to the holders of RPE nine hundred thousand (900,000) restricted shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock. CEI also assumed certain liabilities of RPE, including the lease for RPE&#8217;s Fort Pierce, Florida location. There was no cash consideration in the transaction, which was more particularly described in the Company&#8217;s Current Report on Form 8-K dated July 10, 2013, which is incorporated by reference herein. 

CEI was a business in the food manufacturing industry subsector that transformed livestock and agricultural products into products for intermediate or final consumption. The industry groups are distinguished by the raw materials (generally of animal or vegetable origin) processed into food products. CEI utilized our proprietary chemical-free, 100% natural processes in the manufacturing, sale, and distribution of all-natural, food-grade ingredients from raw, fresh, natural citrus peel resulting from citrus juicing operations. Through those controlled methods, CEI processed and dehydrated orange, lemon, grapefruit and tangerine peel into its &#8220;CitraBlend&#8221; and &#8220;CitraBlend Organic&#8221; products and then milled those products to varying sizes ranging from larger &#8220;cut &#38; sift flakes&#8221; to 40+ mesh powders (or smaller sizes for custom orders). Those ingredients, both organic and non-organic, found their way into many regional and national brand-name products commonly found on America&#8217;s kitchen tables in the form of spices, teas, and otherwise. Our CitraBlend products were also utilized in brewing many local and regional craft beers in addition to nationally-recognized beer brands, and because we had only recently addressed that market it remained largely untapped. At the time the Company sold its CEI subsidiary, CitraBlend was primarily sold through a network of distributors who generally blended our products or sold them as stand alone ingredients included in many well-known consumer products. 

On January 15, 2014 the Company formed Acacia Transport Services, Inc. (&#8220;ATS&#8221;) as another wholly-owned subsidiary, but activity did not begin until July of that year when it acquired several tandem-axle road tractors, tandem-axle aluminum end-dump trailers, and other assets necessary to operate its transport business. 

&#160;

&#160; 

ATS was a business in the transportation industry that hauled fresh, raw, citrus peel resulting from the juice extraction process at juice plants. On July 2, 2014, ATS entered into an Agreement for Citrus Peel Hauling Services with Lambeth Groves Juice Company, a juice extraction company located in Vero Beach, Florida, some 20 miles from CEI. That contract called for ATS to assume all responsibilities for hauling the raw, remediated citrus peel products from Lambeth Groves effective July 30, 2014, with actual transport operations from Lambeth Groves commencing in early August 2014. 

ATS hauled much of that raw peel to CEI for use in its manufacturing processes, and delivered the excess peel to local farmers for use as livestock feed. Acacia Transport Services transported its first load of raw peel from Lambeth Groves on August 7, 2014 and transported subsequent loads going forward from that date. Full-scale transport operations finally began with the onset of the 2015 citrus season at about the beginning of December, 2014, the number of loads transported &#8220;in season&#8221; generally being maximized during the period of December through March or April. 

On March 1, 2014 the Company began performing milling operations using the trade name Acacia Milling Services (&#8220;AMS&#8221;) at the Fort Pierce location for its CEI subsidiary. Milling is the term applied to grinding or refining the finished citrus ingredient products rendered by CEI into smaller, finer particles. These services vary from simple sifting operations that separate the various sizes of materials to creating specific cuts from the original material, such as &#8220;tea bag cut&#8221; size, granulated materials of various sizes, or &#8220;powders&#8221; of various mesh sizes. Generally the greater the mesh size (finer, smaller, particle size) requested by the customer, the higher the milling charges per pound. 

AMS was a developmental stage business in the milling or grinding industry that milled finished citrus ingredient products rendered by Citrus Extracts into smaller, finer particles. Those milling services varied from simple sifting operations that separated the various sizes of materials to creating specific cuts from the original material, such as &#8220;tea bag cut&#8221; size, granulated materials of various sizes, or &#8220;powders&#8221; of various mesh sizes. Generally the greater the mesh size (higher mesh sizes referring to finer, smaller, particle size) requested by the customer, the higher the milling charges per pound. Prior to sale of the assets, the Company did not yet maintain separate accounting functions for its new milling operations, but intended to further segregate those milling operations at a later time and to implement a new system of separate financial reporting for those operations. However, those plans became moot in light of the sale of the Company&#8217;s income-producing operations in June of 2015. 

&#160; 

At a Special Meeting of the Company&#8217;s Shareholders on June 29, 2015, a majority of the Shareholders of the Company ratified all the actions recommended by the Company&#8217;s board of directors, including, among other matters: (i) authorization to sell the assets and related businesses of the Company&#8217;s CEI and ATS subsidiaries; (ii) authorization to employ the proceeds of the sale to extinguish the corporation&#8217;s indebtedness and other current financial obligations; (iii) election of four members to the Corporation&#8217;s board of directors; (iv) authorization to seek new acquisitions or business combinations; (v) authorization to terminate the Corporation&#8217;s 2012 Stock Incentive Plan and to extend the employment agreement of its CEO by two years with all other provisions unchanged; and (vi) authorization to amend Article Eleven of the Corporation&#8217;s Articles of Incorporation and Section 2.10 of its Bylaws. 

The Company sold the assets and related businesses of its CEI and ATS subsidiaries, and its AMS operations, being all of its revenue-producing operations, on June 29, 2015, and accounted for those operations as discontinued effective with the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2015. Those events were reported in their entirety by the Company on its Current Report on Form 8-K on July 16, 2015, which in incorporated herein by reference. 

Following June 29, 2015 the Company was without revenue-producing operations, and began reviewing opportunities for new mergers, acquisitions, or business combinations, including its review of MariJ Agricultural, Inc. and related entities in the Clearwater, Florida area in August of that same year. In November of 2015, the Company entered into a Letter of Intent to acquire the assets and businesses of the MariJ Group of Companies that included MariJ Agricultural, JR Cannabis Industries, LLC; Canna-Cures Research &#38; Development Center, LLC; and, TropiFlora, LLC. An amended Letter of Intent was drafted on December 8, 2015 and the acquisition was consummated on January 15, 2016 with an effective date of January 4, 2015. 

&#160; 

Recent Events and Direction of the Company 

On January 15, 2016 the Company acquired the assets and related businesses of the MariJ Group of companies consisting of four (4) entities, and intends to conduct its future business operations through two (2) newly-created wholly-owned subsidiaries utilizing the majority of those assets. The four acquired entities include: 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

MariJ Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 

&#160; 

On January 15, 2016 the Company acquired the assets and business of MariJ Agricultural, Inc., a Florida corporation. Those assets and business were placed into the Company&#8217;s new subsidiary named MariJ Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (&#8220;MariJ&#8221;). While that entity had only began revenue-producing operations in Q4 of 2015, it is anticipated to expand its operations and revenues substantially in 2016 as an Acacia subsidiary following planned capital expansion based on success in raising the funding necessary to fuel those plans. 

MariJ&#8217;s impetus will be in the extraction and processing of very high quality, high-CBD/low-THC content medical grade cannabis oils from medical cannabis plants. MariJ specializes in organic strains of the plant, setting itself apart from the general producers of non-organic products. In addition, MariJ has the technical expertise and capability to process and formulate the oils and to employ them in its compounding operations. MariJ will seek to become engaged as owner or co-owner of a grow facility in Florida or other location(s) such as to produce its own plants for processing. MariJ has also been preparing for the 2016 rollout of its newly-developed, proprietary Geotraking Technology that is fully compliant with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability standard (&#8220;HIPAA&#8221;) utilizing its &#8220; plant to patient &#8221; solution. This Geotraking Technology is designed to provide a full-channel patient care tracking system that is fully compliant under today&#8217;s strict HIPAA regulations that require privacy and security of the patient&#8217;s information. Beginning with RFID labeling and tracking of every single seed employed in the grow program and continuing through the sale of prescription products in a sophisticated retail PoS delivery system, the GeoTraking Technology will be the most advanced system available. 

MariJ&#8217;s revenues are anticipated to be generated from several activities, including but not limited to the following: 

a. 

Cannabis oil extraction and processing. MariJ has a unique mobile cannabis oil processing and extraction unit designed into a heavy-duty vehicle. That unit has already begun performing extractions and processing of medical organic hemp into oils at various sites, and is currently developing additional contracts for services. 

b. 

Wholesale sale of raw and processed low or zero-THC medical cannabis oils. 

c. 

Laboratory testing and certification services. MariJ has begun construction of a mobile laboratory and testing unit, also on a heavy-duty truck chassis, intended to address the growing demand for these services in the medical cannabis industry. 

d. 

Licensing and support of the Company&#8217;s GeoTraking Technology systems 

e. 

Processing and compounding services for medical grade cannabis oils 

&#160; 

The Company is preparing to seek additional investments and financing to pay the costs of building its second mobile oil extraction and processing unit, to finance final construction of its mobile laboratory and testing unit for the same industry, and to complete the roll-out of its GeoTraking Technology system. There can be no assurance the Company will be successful in its plans to generate the required capital. 

Canna-Cures Research &#38; Development Center, Inc. 

&#160;

The Company acquired the assets and the business of Canna-Cures Research &#38; Development Center, LLC, a Florida organization, on January 15, 2016. The Company intends to utilize this new subsidiary to engage in research and development activities as well as retail and wholesale distribution of medical cannabis products and dietary supplements, depending upon our ability to comply in each instance with FDA rules and other regulations. As a part of its R&#38;D efforts, the new subsidiary will seek to align itself with institutions of higher learning in working to develop new products and to identify and develop additional uses for its medical cannabis products. 

While this subsidiary has not yet implemented revenue-producing operations, it is anticipated to begin generating revenues after mid-2016. Those revenues will be generated from several activities, including the following: 

&#160;

a. 

Canna-Cures will seek to enter into research and development projects with institutions of higher learning in efforts to develop new and better strains of medical cannabis related products for dispensing as medications, nutraceuticals, cosmeceuticals, and probably dietary supplements. Canna-Cures anticipates participating in state and federal grants in conjunction with one or more universities as a means to defray part of its costs in these efforts. 

b. 

Private label packaging services. The Company has obtained a majority of the equipment required to engage in the business of packaging and labeling of medical cannabis oils, oil-infused products, and related items. 

c. 

Retail sales of medical cannabis oils, oil-infused products, and other merchandise through its web-based portal or retail dispensaries planned for that purpose. These activities are dependent in large part upon meeting FDA regulations and criteria relating to the sale and distribution of cannabis-infused products, and the Company is currently in the process of determining the status of those criteria. 

d. 

Retail and wholesale sales of cosmeceutical and nutraceutical products and dietary supplements containing its high-quality cannabis oil extracts, again dependent upon the same FDA regulations and criteria as mentioned in item (c) above. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

The Company will require additional capital to finalize these plans and accommodate the roll-out of its services for this subsidiary, and intends to begin its capital raising activities within the next 60 to 90 days or less. There can be no assurance the Company will be successful in its plans to generate that capital. 

JR Cannabis Industries, LLC 

The third entity acquired in the transactions of January 15, 2016 was JR Cannabis Industries, LLC. That entity was a service business providing management services in coordination with the activities of MariJ Agricultural. Following the acquisition of those entities, Acacia determined that it no longer needed services the same or similar to those of JR Cannabis Industries, and therefore has elected to recreate it as a subsidiary of the Company 

TropiFlora, LLC 

&#160; 

The fourth and final entity acquired in the transactions of January 15, 2016 was TropiFlora, LLC 

&#160;

In the acquisition transactions of January 15, 2016 the Company acquired the non-capital assets and the business of TropiFlora, LLC, but not the goodwill or the capital assets of TropiFlora, as a part of its efforts to engage growing cannabis in Florida. Prior to TropiFlora&#8217;s acquisition by MariJ, and ultimately by Acacia, it was a grower with decades of experience in the nursery industry with the capacity to grow large quantities of plants. MariJ and subsequently Acacia acquired the business of TropiFlora to position itself to be issued a Growers License under the new 2015 Florida cannabis laws, If successful in obtaining a Florida Growers License, TropiFlora, as an Acacia subsidiary, would cultivate and distribute legal medical cannabis products in the state, opening the door to the sale of the non-euphoric strains of cannabis to treat patients with seizure disorders and cancer. However, the State of Florida announced the names of the five applicants that were to be awarded the Growers Licenses, but TropiFlora was not among the winners. Substantial legal objections have arisen as to the Florida license award process, prompting the filing of a number of complaints and spawning litigation with the State. The Company believes that, among other things, TropiFlora was unfairly judged for the licensing opportunity. The legal complaints instituted by TropiFlora while a part of the MariJ Group of companies and before its acquisition by Acacia left many questions that can only be answered as the cases progress through the administrative and judicial systems. As a result of the fact that substantial sums would be required to pursue the reversal of the perceived errors in the licensing process, the Company believes it is not in its best interests to continue on that course. Accordingly, the Company has therefore determined to exercise its option to rescind the TropiFlora acquisition under the certain specific terms and conditions agreed prior to its acquisition. Thus, the Company will take no action to create or operate a subsidiary utilizing the acquired TropiFlora assets. 

&#160;

As such, the Company intends to instead seek one or more other potential new licensing opportunities within Florida in conjunction with the anticipation of future license offerings, or to seek licensing opportunities in other states. 

&#160;

Employees 

&#160; 

The Parent Company had two officers in 2015, being Steven L. Sample, its Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Patricia Ann Arnold, its Secretary. Ms. Arnold served in her capacity as a non-employee, while Mr. Sample served as a full-time employee of the Company. Ms. Arnold spent less than full time on the affairs of the Parent Company. The Parent Company also had one other full time senior accounting employee in 2015. On January 15, 2016 the Company acquired the assets and businesses of the MariJ Group of companies. (See &#8220; Recent Events and Direction of the Company&#8221; for a complete summary of those transactions . As a part of those transactions, the Company&#8217;s CEO, Mr. Sample, and its Secretary, Ms. Arnold, resigned in order to accommodate the appointment of new persons to those positions. Mr. Sample remains an employee and a Director of the Company. 

As of January 15, 2016, the Company&#8217;s new wholly-owned operating subsidiary, MariJ Pharmaceuticals, Inc., its only current revenue-producing subsidiary, had a total of approximately 6 full-time and part-time employees. The other subsidiary of the Company as of that date was in the process of organizing its business plans and had not yet instituted operations under the Company as its new parent. Both subsidiaries anticipate hiring additional personnel as their revenue-producing activities are increased in 2016. 

&#160; 

The Company, should it be successful in executing its business plan, believes that it may be required to expand its staff to implement the controls necessary to manage a larger organization. This would possibly result in the need for a Chief Financial Officer, Corporate Controller or other officers and/or managers and additional basic support personnel. The Company will endeavor to operate with the smallest corporate management staff possible so as to maintain the lowest overhead possible while still effecting sufficient management processes to properly guide the company. 

&#160;

&#160; 

Governmental Regulation 

&#160; 

A majority of the states that have legalized the growing, production, and use of cannabis oil have legislated the use of high-CBD content and low-THC content oils. As a result, and in keeping with regulations and laws in those venues, the Company, through its subsidiaries, intends to concentrate on those products unless and until the laws change to facilitate a wider range of grow and production opportunities. The Company does have the technology and capability of extracting high-THC oils in those venues that do allow it, and will provide services to growers in those areas as contracted. 

The Company, through its new subsidiaries, will operate in the medical cannabis sector. In order to help our shareholders better understand the products it intends to employ in its business plans, we have provided certain explanations and definitions below. 

The Company will initially extract and process a derivative of the cannabis plant known as CBD oil. CBD is one of dozens of compounds found in cannabis plants that belong to a class called cannabinoids. Of these compounds, CBD and THC are usually present in the highest concentrations, and have the most common practical applications in the medical field. The Company&#8217;s subsidiaries currently give most attention to high-CBD/low-THC products. Marijuana, unlike most modern day medicine, contains a wide range of chemical compounds. Scientists have identified over 60 unique molecules in cannabis known as cannabinoids, which include THC and CBD. Many other non-cannabinoid compounds are produced by the plant, but these are the compounds are most addressed as having a use by the medical community. 

&#160;

Terpenes, the molecules responsible for marijuana&#8217;s smell, have been shown to block some cannabinoid receptor sites in the brain while promoting cannabinoid binding in others. As a result, terpenes are believed to affect many aspects of how the brain takes in THC or CBD, while offering various therapeutic benefits of their own. In fact, while THC has gotten most of the attention, studies suggest many of the compounds in marijuana work together to produce a synergy of effects. This is known as the &#8220;entourage effect.&#8221; 

&#160;

CBD and THC levels tend to vary between different strains and varieties of cannabis. By using selective breeding techniques, certain growers have managed to create varieties with high levels of CBD and THC, being the varieties currently employed for oil production by the Company&#8217;s MariJ Pharmaceuticals subsidiary. That subsidiary also specialized in extracting oil from certified organic plants, rather than the standard non-organic varieties. 

Unlike THC, CBD does not cause a high or hallucinogenic effect. The reason why CBD is non-psychoactive is due to its lack of affinity for CB1 receptors, such as are found in high concentrations in the brain, and which become the channels through which THC is able to port its psychoactive effects. 

The Company, as with most other companies, is subject to various business regulations, permits and licenses. The Company, through its new subsidiaries, has enter a new business realm that may entail considerably more regulation than its previous endeavors, and faces uncertainties related to federal laws that are in conflict with state laws in which the Company&#8217;s subsidiaries now operate or may operate in the future. It is possible that the federal government will ease its regulations relating to the cannabis industry, or even legalize the operation of and transporting of products resulting from business operations in that sector. However, it is also possible that the government may decide to harden its stance against cannabis related products. In the event the federal government takes a harder stance against cannabis-related products, the Company could suffer impairment of its operations and could sustain substantial losses. The Company cannot foresee what direction the federal government may take in these matters, if any, but sees a continuing evidence that various states are legalizing cannabis products, both high-CBD/low-THC compounds as well as compounds containing high levels of THC. The Company believes that it has complied with appropriate state requirements for operations and believes it has obtained all permits necessary to function under the current state regulations.
