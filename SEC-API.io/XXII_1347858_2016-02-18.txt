 Item 1. Business. &#160;

Background 

&#160;

22nd Century Group, Inc. was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on September 12, 2005 under the name Touchstone Mining Limited. On January 25, 2011, we entered into a reverse merger transaction with 22nd Century Limited, LLC, which we refer to herein as the &#8220;merger.&#8221; Upon the closing of the merger, 22nd Century Limited, LLC became our wholly-owned subsidiary. After the merger, we succeeded to the business of 22nd Century Limited, LLC as our sole line of business.

&#160;

22nd Century Limited, LLC was originally formed as a New York limited liability company on February 20, 1998 as 21st Century Limited, LLC and subsequently merged with a newly-formed Delaware limited liability company, 22nd Century Limited, LLC, on November 29, 1999. Since inception, 22nd Century Limited, LLC has sponsored research and subsequently used biotechnology to regulate the nicotine content in tobacco plants.

&#160; 

Overview 

&#160;

We are a plant biotechnology company focused on technology that allows us to increase or decrease the level of nicotine and other nicotinic alkaloids in tobacco plants and levels of cannabinoids in cannabis plants through genetic engineering and plant breeding. Our primary mission is to reduce the harm caused by smoking. We own or exclusively control more than 200 issued patents plus more than 50 pending patent applications.

&#160;

We are in the process of transitioning from researching and developing our proprietary technology and tobaccos to commercializing our technology and products. We initiated the commercialization of our technology and products in the year 2015. According to Euromonitor International annual worldwide tobacco product sales, including cigarettes and smokeless products, are approximately $800 billion, most of which are cigarette sales. If we capture a small fraction of this market, we believe our value will increase tremendously. 

&#160;

We are primarily involved in the following activities:

&#160;

&#183; The research and development of potentially less harmful or modified risk tobacco products and novel tobacco plant varieties; &#183; The pursuit of necessary regulatory approvals and clearances from the FDA to market BRAND A in the U.S. as an over-the-counter product labeled as reduced exposure to nicotine as BRAND A has 95% less nicotine than conventional tobacco cigarettes; &#183; The development of X-22 , a prescription-based smoking cessation aid consisting of very low nicotine (&#8220;VLN&#8221;) cigarettes, and the pursuit of regulatory approvals and clearances from the FDA to market X-22 as a prescription smoking cessation aid; &#183; The pursuit of necessary regulatory approvals and clearances from the FDA to market BRAND B as a modified risk cigarette with an extremely low tar-to-nicotine ratio; &#183; The manufacture, marketing and distribution of RED SUN and MAGIC proprietary cigarettes; &#183; The production of SPECTRUM research cigarettes for the National Institute on Drug Abuse (&#8220;NIDA&#8221;), a part of the National Institutes of Health (&#8220;NIH&#8221;); &#183; The international licensing of our technology, proprietary tobaccos, and trademarks; &#183; The international sale of our branded proprietary tobaccos; &#183; The contract manufacturing of third-party branded tobacco products; and &#183; The research and development in Canada of unique plant varieties of hemp/cannabis, such as (i) plants with low to no amounts of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, for the legal hemp industry, and (ii) plants with high levels of cannabidiol, or CBD, and other non-THC cannabinoids for the legal medical marijuana markets. &#160;

Our prospects depend on our ability to generate and sustain revenues from (i) licensing and/or sale of our proprietary tobacco, technology and products; (ii) domestic and international sales of our brands, including RED SUN and MAGIC ; (iii) further development of our potential modified risk tobacco products and our X-22 smoking cessation aid; and (iv) the manufacture of the filtered cigar and cigarette brands of third-parties at our manufacturing facility in North Carolina. Our ability to generate meaningful revenue from our potential modified risk tobacco products in the United States depends on obtaining FDA authorization to market these products as modified risk or reduced exposure; and our ability to generate meaningful revenue in the United States from X-22 depends on FDA approval. If these products are authorized and approved by the FDA, we must still meet the challenges of successful marketing, distribution and consumer acceptance.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

We believe our products address unmet needs of smokers; for those who desire to quit, an innovative smoking cessation aid, and for those who are unable or unwilling to quit smoking, cigarettes that may reduce the level of exposure to tobacco toxins and/or nicotine.

&#160;

We believe our proprietary technology, tobaccos and products will generate multiple significant revenue streams from licensing of our technology and tobacco and from the sales of our products.

&#160;

Intellectual Property 

&#160;

Our intellectual property enables us to decrease or increase the level of nicotine and other nicotinic alkaloids in tobacco plants by decreasing or increasing the expression of gene(s) responsible for nicotine production in the tobacco plant using genetic engineering. The basic techniques include, but are not limited to, those that are used in the production of genetically modified (&#8220;GM&#8221;) varieties of other crops, which are also known as &#8220;biotech crops.&#8221;

&#160;

We own or exclusively control more than 200 issued patents plus more than 50 pending patent applications. A &#8220;patent family&#8221; is a set of patents granted in various countries to protect a single invention. Our patent coverage in the United States and China, two of the most valuable smoking cessation and cigarette markets in the world, consists of 27 issued patents and 21 pending applications and 6 issued patents and 6 pending patent applications, respectively. We have exclusive rights to all uses of the following genes responsible for nicotine content in tobacco plants: NBB , QPT , A622 , MPO and several transcription factor genes. We have exclusive rights to plants with altered nicotine content produced from modifying expression of these genes and tobacco products produced from these plants. We also have the exclusive right to license and sublicense these patent rights. With the exception of two patent families, which will expire in 2016 and 2018, the majority of the patent families related to nicotine biosynthesis will expire between 2021 and 2034, with certain extensions of terms in the U.S. applications resulting from patent term adjustments at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.

&#160;

In September 2014, we entered into a Sublicense Agreement with Anandia Laboratories, Inc. (the &#8220;Anandia Sublicense&#8221;). Under the terms of the Anandia Sublicense, we were granted an exclusive sublicense in the United States and a co-exclusive sublicense in the remainder of the world, excluding Canada, to 1 U.S. patent and 20 patent applications relating to four genes in the cannabis plant that are required for the production of cannabinoids, the active ingredients in the cannabis plant. The Anandia Sublicense continues through the life of the last-to-expire patent, which is expected to be in 2035. As a plant biotechnology company, our entry into the legal hemp/cannabis markets is a natural evolution of our activities in a plant that has important research and commercial value and applications. We intend to engage in research and development activities in Canada to create unique plant varieties of hemp/cannabis, such as (i) plants with low to no amounts of THC for the legal hemp industry, and (ii) plants with high levels of CBD and other non-THC cannabinoids for the legal medical marijuana markets.

&#160;

We own various registered trademarks in the United States. We also have exclusive plant variety rights in the United States (plant variety protection certificates are issued by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (&#8220;PVP&#8221;)) and Canada. A PVP certificate prevents anyone other than the owner/licensee from planting, propagating, selling, importing and exporting a plant variety for twenty (20) years in the U.S. and generally for twenty (20) years in other member countries of the International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants, known as UPOV, an international treaty concerning plant breeders&#8217; rights. There are currently more than 70 countries that are members of UPOV.

&#160;

Licensing our technology and tobacco 

&#160;

We have been in negotiations with various parties in the tobacco and pharmaceutical industries for licensing our technology and products. On October 1, 2013, our subsidiary, 22nd Century Limited, LLC (&#8220;22nd Century Ltd.&#8221;), entered into a Research License and Commercial Option Agreement (the &#8220;BAT Research Agreement&#8221;) with British American Tobacco (Investments) Limited (&#8220;BAT&#8221;), a subsidiary of British American Tobacco plc.

&#160;

Under the terms of the BAT Research Agreement, BAT receives an exclusive worldwide license to certain patent rights (subject to worldwide rights retained by 22nd Century Ltd. for use in its own brands and products) and licensed intellectual property rights (as such terms are defined in the BAT Research Agreement) of 22nd Century Ltd. within the field of use (as defined in the BAT Research Agreement) for a period of up to four (4) years (the &#8220;Research Term&#8221;). During the Research Term, BAT also has an option, which can be exercised by BAT at any time during the Research Term, to obtain an exclusive worldwide license (subject to worldwide rights retained by 22nd Century Ltd. for use in its own products and brands) to commercialize certain products derived from utilizing the patent rights and licensed intellectual property rights under the terms of a commercial license agreement (the &#8220;Commercial License&#8221;).

&#160;

Simultaneous with the signing of the BAT Research Agreement, BAT paid 22nd Century Ltd. a non-refundable fee of $7.0 million. Further, 22nd Century Ltd. may receive payments from BAT of up to an additional $7.0 million during the Research Term in the event certain milestones are met by BAT with respect to its research and development of the patent rights and licensed intellectual property rights licensed by 22nd Century Ltd. to BAT. There are four separate milestones, two of which BAT would pay 22nd Century Ltd. $2.0 million for each milestone achieved, and two of which BAT would pay 22nd Century Ltd. $1.5 million for each milestone achieved. BAT may terminate the BAT Research Agreement at any time, subject to the requirements for certain payments to 22nd Century Ltd. by BAT upon termination as set forth therein. 22nd Century Ltd. may also terminate the BAT Research Agreement in the event of certain uncured breaches of the BAT Research Agreement as set forth therein.

&#160;

&#160; 5 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

BAT also granted to 22nd Century Ltd. a worldwide license to any and all registered research results (as such term is defined in the BAT Research Agreement) developed and owned by BAT which results or arises from any research, development or other activities of BAT under the BAT Research Agreement, with the terms of such license from BAT to 22nd Century Ltd. (i) to be on commercially reasonable terms to be negotiated in good faith between the parties, but in any event on terms which are no more onerous than the terms of the Commercial License, if any, and (ii) to be dependent on what, if any, research results the Company elects to license.

&#160;

If BAT exercises the option for a worldwide Commercial License, BAT is required to pay 22nd Century Ltd. $3.0 million in aggregate annual license fees over a 2-year ramp-up period, and thereafter a royalty, subject to annual minimums and maximums contained in the Commercial License, of (i) $100 per metric ton of licensed tobacco that is supplied to, or grown and ready for shipment to, BAT and its affiliates (other than Reynolds American, Inc. and Reynolds&#8217; affiliates) and all other third parties; and (ii) $200 per metric ton of licensed tobacco supplied to, or grown and processed by, BAT&#8217;s affiliate Reynolds American, Inc.

&#160;

Beginning three years from the start of the Commercial License, both 22nd Century Ltd. and BAT may license/sublicense rights to any unaffiliated third party for use of the technology outside the United States and 22nd Century Ltd. and BAT will equally share all profit from all such licensees/sublicensees. Inside the United States, BAT may only sublicense BAT&#8217;s commercial rights to Reynolds American Inc. 22nd Century Ltd. may sublicense any party in the United States.

&#160; 

RED SUN and MAGIC Cigarettes 

&#160; 

Our subsidiary, Goodrich Tobacco Company, LLC (&#8220;Goodrich Tobacco&#8221;), introduced in a limited capacity two super-premium priced cigarette brands, RED SUN and MAGIC , into the U.S. market in the first quarter 2011. From the year 2011 through the year 2014, there were de minimis sales of these brands since we intentionally did not expand the marketing and distribution of these brands until after the Company became a subsequent participating manufacturer under the Master Settlement Agreement (&#8220;MSA&#8221;) which occurred on August 29, 2014, when the 46 Settling States under the MSA approved the Company to acquire NASCO Products, LLC (&#8220;NASCO&#8221;) and become a subsequent participating manufacturer under the MSA. During the remainder of 2014, the Company worked to obtain approvals from regulatory agencies in all 50 States to have our RED SUN super-premium brand listed on the state directories of tobacco products approved for sale in each such state. During 2014, we also worked with Orion, a cigarette manufacturer in Poland, to contract manufacture the Company&#8217;s proprietary tobacco products for distribution in the European Union, starting with our MAGIC super-premium brand. Both of the RED SUN and MAGIC brands are available in regular and menthol and all brand styles are king size and packaged in hinge-lid hard packs. In 2015, we focused our marketing efforts for RED SUN on national and regional distributors, tobacconists, smokeshops and other tobacco outlets in the U.S. In 2015, we also introduced our MAGIC cigarettes to distributors and retailers in Spain, as explained in greater detail below under &#8220;International Sales.&#8221;

&#160;

MSA Membership 

&#160;

In September 2013, the Company entered into a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement to purchase all of the issued and outstanding membership interests of NASCO, a federally licensed tobacco product manufacturer and subsequent participating manufacturer under the MSA (the &#8220;NASCO Acquisition&#8221;). On August 29, 2014, the Company entered into an Amended Adherence Agreement with the 46 Settling States under the MSA pursuant to which the Company was approved to acquire NASCO and become a subsequent participating manufacturer under the MSA. On that same date, the Company closed the NASCO Acquisition and became a subsequent participating manufacturer under the MSA. NASCO is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Manufacturing 

&#160;

In December 2013, Goodrich Tobacco purchased certain (i) cigarette manufacturing equipment, and (ii) equipment parts, factory items, office furniture and fixtures, vehicles and computers from the bankruptcy estate of PTM Technologies, Inc. (&#8220;PTM&#8221;) for $3.22 million. In January 2014, Goodrich Tobacco purchased additional miscellaneous equipment, factory items, office furniture and fixtures, vehicles and computers from the bankruptcy estate of Renegade Tobacco Co. (&#8220;Renegade&#8221;) for $210,000. PTM and Renegade were related companies located in North Carolina undergoing Chapter 7 liquidation proceedings in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Middle District of North Carolina. Goodrich Tobacco subsequently received $631,484 in net proceeds from auctioning off certain cigarette manufacturing equipment and other items not required for operations at the Company&#8217;s factory in Mocksville, North Carolina.

&#160;

The warehouse and cigarette manufacturing facility were primarily in a pre-manufacturing stage during 2014 as we sought approval during that time for the Company and its factory to become a subsequent participating manufacturer under the MSA. On August 29, 2014, the Company closed its acquisition of NASCO and became a subsequent participating manufacturer under the MSA. The Company is now manufacturing its cigarette brands in the United States through its wholly-owned subsidiary, NASCO, at the Company&#8217;s factory in North Carolina. In 2015, we manufactured and sold our RED SUN super-premium brand, together with a third-party MSA cigarette brand and third-party filtered cigars, at our factory.

&#160;

International Sales 

&#160;

The Company makes its MAGIC super-premium brand at Orion, a cigarette manufacturer in Poland that contract manufactures MAGIC cigarettes for the Company for distribution in the European Union. Orion is a manufacturer and distributor of smoking tobaccos, cigarettes, filter tubes, and smoking accessories with distribution in more than 20 countries. Distribution of MAGIC brand cigarettes commenced in Spain in 2015. In 2015, the Company also entered into new distribution agreements with European partners for the launch of the Company&#8217;s products in additional European countries. The Company is also evaluating the sale and distribution of its products in Asia.

&#160;

The Tobacco Control Act and Our Potentially Modified Risk Cigarettes - BRAND A and BRAND B 

&#160;

In a 2005 analyst report, The Third Innovation, Potentially Reduced Exposure Cigarettes , JP Morgan examined the effects of regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (&#8220;FDA&#8221;) of tobacco, including the market for safer cigarettes. JP Morgan&#8217;s proprietary survey of over 600 smokers found that 90% of smokers are willing to try a safer cigarette. Among JP Morgan&#8217;s other conclusions, it stated: &#8220;FDA oversight would imbue PREPS [&#8216;potential reduced exposure products&#8217; which essentially equate to potential modified risk tobacco products] with a regulatory &#8216;stamp of approval&#8217; and allow for more explicit comparative health claims with conventional cigarettes. Consumers should trust the FDA more than industry health claims.&#8221; Prior to the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (&#8220;Tobacco Control Act&#8221;) becoming law in 2009, no regulatory agency or body had the authority to assess potentially modified risk tobacco products.

&#160;

The Tobacco Control Act granted the FDA authority over the regulation of all tobacco products. While the Tobacco Control Act prohibits the FDA from banning cigarettes outright, it allows the FDA to require the reduction of nicotine or any other compound in tobacco and cigarette smoke. The Tobacco Control Act also banned all sales in the U.S. of cigarettes with characterizing flavors (other than menthol). As of June 2010, all cigarette companies were required to cease the use of the terms &#8220;low tar,&#8221; &#8220;light&#8221; and &#8220;ultra light&#8221; in describing cigarettes sold in the U.S. Besides numerous other regulations, including certain marketing restrictions, for the first time in history, a U.S. regulatory agency now scientifically evaluates cigarettes that may pose lower health risks as compared to conventional cigarettes.

&#160;

The Tobacco Control Act establishes procedures for the FDA to regulate the labeling and marketing of modified risk tobacco products, which includes cigarettes that (i) reduce exposure to tobacco toxins and (ii) are reasonably likely to pose lower health risks, as compared to conventional cigarettes (&#8220;Modified Risk Cigarettes&#8221;). The Tobacco Control Act requires the FDA to issue specific regulations and guidance regarding applications submitted to the FDA for the authorization to label and market Modified Risk Cigarettes. On March 30, 2012, the FDA issued Modified Risk Tobacco Product Applications Draft Guidance. We believe that two types of our cigarettes in development, which we refer to as BRAND A and BRAND B , may qualify as Modified Risk Cigarettes. In addition, the Tobacco Control Act allows the FDA to mandate the use of reduced risk technologies in conventional tobacco products and cigarettes (e.g., Marlboro &#174; , Camel &#174; , Newport &#174; , Natural American Spirit &#174; ), which could create opportunities for us to license our proprietary technology and/or our tobaccos to larger competitors.

&#160;

&#160; 7 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

We believe that our BRAND A and BRAND B cigarettes will benefit smokers who are unable or unwilling to quit smoking and who may be interested in cigarettes which reduce exposure to nicotine or to certain tobacco smoke toxins and/or pose a lower health risk than conventional cigarettes. This includes approximately one-half of the 42 million adult smokers in the United States who do not attempt to quit in a given year. Compared to commercial cigarettes, the tobacco in BRAND A has approximately 95% less nicotine than tobacco in cigarettes previously marketed as &#8220;light&#8221; cigarettes and BRAND B &#8217;s smoke contains an extraordinarily low amount of &#8220;tar&#8221; per milligram of nicotine. We believe that BRAND A and BRAND B will achieve market share in the global cigarette market among smokers who will not quit but are interested in reducing the harmful effects of smoking. We believe this new regulatory environment represents a paradigm shift for the tobacco industry. There is no guarantee, however, that we will (i) have sufficient capital to complete the FDA authorization process for our potential Modified Risk Cigarettes, (ii) obtain FDA authorization to market BRAND A or &#160; BRAND B as Modified Risk Cigarettes, or (iii) achieve significant share of the market even with FDA authorization to market our products as Modified Risk Cigarettes.

&#160;

On December 31, 2015, we submitted to the FDA a Modified Risk Tobacco Product application requesting a reduced exposure marketing authorization from the FDA to market BRAND A as a Modified Risk Cigarette with product labeling and advertising that states that BRAND A has 95% less nicotine than conventional cigarettes. We intend to work diligently with the FDA to obtain a reduced exposure marketing authorization for BRAND A to be marketed in the U.S. We also intend to seek FDA authorization in the future to (i) market BRAND B as a Modified Risk Cigarette with an extraordinarily low amount of &#8220;tar&#8221; per milligram of nicotine and (ii) market X-22 as a prescription smoking cessation product.

&#160;

&#160; BRAND A Cigarettes 

&#160;

Compared to commercial tobacco cigarettes, BRAND A has the lowest nicotine content. The tobacco in BRAND A contains approximately 95% less nicotine than conventional cigarette brands. Clinical studies have demonstrated that smokers who smoke very low nicotine (&#8220;VLN&#8221;) cigarettes containing our proprietary tobacco smoke fewer cigarettes per day resulting in significant reductions in smoke exposure, including &#8220;tar,&#8221; nicotine and carbon monoxide. Due to the very low nicotine levels, compensatory smoking does not occur with VLN cigarettes containing our proprietary tobacco (Hatsukami et al . 2010).

&#160;

In a June 16, 2010 press release, Dr. David Kessler, the former FDA Commissioner, recommended that &#8220;[t]he FDA should quickly move to reduce nicotine levels in cigarettes to non-addictive levels. If we reduce the level of the stimulus, we reduce the craving. It is the ultimate harm reduction strategy.&#8221; Shortly thereafter in a Washington Post newspaper article, Dr. Kessler said that the amount of nicotine in a cigarette should drop from about 10 milligrams to less than 1 milligram. BRAND A cigarettes contain approximately 0.7 milligrams of nicotine in the tobacco contained in the cigarette and a machine smoking yield of less than 0.05 mg of nicotine per cigarette.

&#160;

There have been seven (7) independent, scientific clinical studies utilizing our proprietary VLN tobacco cigarettes, with each study showing the efficacy of our VLN tobacco cigarettes when used alone and/or when used in conjunction with existing nicotine replacement therapies (&#8220;NRTs&#8221;), such as the nicotine patch, gum or lozenge, or Pfizer&#8217;s Chantix/Champix product. These seven (7) clinical studies are all summarized below under &#8220;Business &#8211; Products &#8211; X-22 Smoking Cessation Aid.&#8221; The results of such clinical studies using cigarettes made from our Company&#8217;s proprietary VLN tobacco have demonstrated many desirable outcomes, including reduced smoking, reduced nicotine exposure, reduce nicotine dependence, increased abstinence, reduced exposure to toxicants and few adverse events with little evidence of withdrawal-related discomfort or safety concerns. Unlike &#8220;light&#8221; cigarettes (as previously labeled and marketed by conventional tobacco companies) which reduce machine-smoking nicotine yields by diluting the smoke rather than by reducing the nicotine content of the tobacco itself, VLN cigarettes do not result in compensatory smoking.

&#160;

The most recent clinical trial utilizing our proprietary VLN tobacco was reported on in the October 2015 issue of The New England Journal of Medicine (N Engl J Med 2015; 373:1340-1349), which was funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (&#8220;NIDA&#8221;) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Center for Tobacco Products. The Center for the Evaluation of Nicotine in Cigarettes led the double-blind, parallel, randomized clinical trial involving 840 smokers at ten locations. The authors concluded that data from the study suggests, as compared with cigarettes of conventional nicotine content, 22nd Century&#8217;s proprietary VLN cigarettes were &#8220;associated with reductions in smoking, nicotine exposure, and nicotine dependence, with minimal evidence of nicotine withdrawal, compensatory smoking, or serious adverse events.&#8221; The study&#8217;s lead author, Dr. Eric Donny, explained that &#34;The evidence is getting stronger that reducing nicotine reduces smoking and makes people less addicted to cigarettes and, in doing so, might make them more likely to quit.&#34;

&#160;

Utilizing the results of these and other independent clinical trials, on December 31, 2015, we submitted to the Center for Tobacco Products (&#34;CTP&#34;) of the FDA an application for BRAND A to receive a marketing order from the FDA to allow BRAND A to be marketed and sold in the U.S. as a reduced exposure product that exposes a user to 95% less nicotine than conventional cigarettes . 

&#160;

We believe these and other results and future exposure studies the FDA may require will result in a reduced exposure marketing order to be granted by the FDA for BRAND A . We further believe smokers who desire to smoke fewer cigarettes per day while also satisfying cravings and reducing exposure to nicotine will find BRAND A beneficial.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

BRAND B Cigarettes 

&#160;

Using a proprietary high nicotine tobacco blend in conjunction with specialty cigarette components, BRAND B allows the smoker to achieve a satisfactory amount of nicotine per cigarette while inhaling less &#8220;tar&#8221; and carbon monoxide. At the same time, we do not expect exposure to nicotine from BRAND B to be significantly higher than some commercially available full flavor cigarette brands. We believe smokers who desire to reduce smoke exposure, but are less concerned about nicotine, will find BRAND B beneficial. BRAND B has a &#8220;tar&#8221; yield between typical &#8220;light&#8221; and &#8220;ultra-light&#8221; cigarettes, but a nicotine yield of typical full flavor cigarettes.

&#160;

In a 2001 report, entitled Clearing the Smoke, Assessing the Science Base for Tobacco Harm Reduction , the Institute of Medicine notes that a low &#8220;tar&#8221;/moderate nicotine cigarette is a viable strategy for reducing the harm caused by smoking. The report states: &#8220;Retaining nicotine at pleasurable or addictive levels while reducing the more toxic components of tobacco is another general strategy for harm reduction.&#8221; We believe that evaluation of BRAND B in short-term human exposure studies will confirm that exposure to smoke, including certain tobacco smoke toxins and carbon monoxide, is significantly reduced when smoking BRAND B as compared to smoking the leading brands of cigarettes.

&#160;

Our Company has engaged a major contract research organization (&#8220;CRO&#8221;) with extensive experience in tobacco exposure studies to assist us in certain regulatory activities at the CTP related to the Company&#8217;s research to support the development of potentially less harmful or modified risk cigarettes. The Company and the CRO met with the CTP on November 12, 2014 to discuss the development plan and proof of concept study for BRAND B , a cigarette that produces smoke containing an extraordinarily low amount of &#8220;tar&#8221; per milligram of nicotine.

&#160;

We believe results from this and other exposure studies will warrant a modified risk claim for BRAND B .

&#160; 

X-22 Smoking Cessation Aid 

&#160;

X-22 is a tobacco-based botanical medical product for use as an aid to smoking cessation. The X-22 therapy protocol utilized in our sponsored Phase IIb clinical trial calls for the patient to smoke our VLN cigarettes over a six-week treatment period to facilitate the goal of the patient quitting smoking by the end of the treatment period. We believe this therapy protocol has been successful in independent clinical trials because VLN cigarettes made from our proprietary tobacco satisfy smokers&#8217; cravings for cigarettes while (i) greatly reducing nicotine exposure and nicotine dependence and (ii) extinguishing the association between the act of smoking and the rapid delivery of nicotine. X-22 involves the same smoking behavior as conventional cigarettes and because patients are simply switching to VLN cigarettes for 6 weeks, X-22 does not expose the smoker to any new drugs or new side effects.

&#160;

Approximately 50% of U.S. smokers attempt to quit smoking each year, but only 2% to 5% actually quit smoking in a given year. It takes smokers an average of 8 to 11 &#8220;quit attempts&#8221; before achieving long-term success. Approximately 95% of &#8220;self-quitters&#8221; (i.e., those who attempt to quit smoking without any treatment) relapse and resume smoking. The Institute of Medicine, the health arm of the National Academy of Sciences, in a 2007 report concludes: &#8220;There is an enormous opportunity to increase population prevalence of smoking cessation by reaching and motivating the 57 percent of smokers who currently make no quit attempt per year.&#8221; We believe that our X-22 smoking cessation aid will be attractive to smokers who have been frustrated in their previous attempts to quit smoking using other therapies.

&#160;

Use of existing smoking cessation aids results in relapse rates that can be as high as 90% in the first year after a smoker initially &#8220;quits.&#8221; Smokers currently have the following limited choices of FDA-approved products to help them quit smoking:

&#160;

&#160; &#183; varenicline (Chantix &#174; /Champix &#174; outside the U.S.), manufactured by Pfizer, Inc., &#160; &#183; bupropion (Zyban &#174; ), manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline plc, and &#160; &#183; nicotine replacement therapy, or &#8220;NRT,&#8221; which is available in the U.S. in several forms: gums, patches, nasal sprays, inhalers and lozenges. &#160;

Chantix &#174; and Zyban &#174; are pills and are nicotine free. Chantix &#174; , Zyban &#174; , the nicotine nasal spray and the nicotine inhaler are available by prescription only in the U.S. Nicotine gums, nicotine patches, and nicotine lozenges are available over-the-counter in the U.S.

&#160;

&#160; 9 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Chantix &#174; was introduced in the U.S. market in the fourth quarter 2006. Since 2007, Chantix &#174; has been the best-selling smoking cessation aid in the United States, with sales, according to Pfizer Inc., of approximately $701 million in 2007, $489 million in 2008, $386 million in 2009, $330 million in 2010, $326 million in 2011, $313 million in 2012, $343 million in 2013 and $377 million in 2014. In July 2009, the FDA required a &#8220;Boxed Warning,&#8221; the most serious type of warning in prescription drug labeling, for both Chantix &#174; and Zyban &#174; based on the potential side effects of these drugs. Despite this Boxed Warning, worldwide sales of Chantix &#174; in 2009 to 2014 were approximately $700 million, $755 million, $720 million, $670 million, $648 million and $647 million, respectively.

&#160;

Other than Chantix &#174; and Zyban &#174; , the only FDA-approved smoking cessation therapy in the United States is nicotine replacement therapy (&#8220;NRT&#8221;). These products consist of gums, patches, nasal sprays, inhalers and lozenges. Nicotine gums and nicotine patches have been sold in the U.S. for approximately 31 years and 23 years, respectively, and millions of smokers have already tried NRT products and failed to stop smoking due to the limited effectiveness of these products. According to Perrigo Company plc, a pharmaceutical company that sells NRT products, retail sales of NRT products in the United States were approximately $900 million in its fiscal year ended June 30, 2014.

&#160;

Research and Development 

&#160;

Since our inception, the majority of our research and development (&#8220;R&#38;D&#8221;) efforts have been outsourced to highly qualified groups in their respective fields. Since 1998, we have had multiple R&#38;D agreements with North Carolina State University (&#8220;NCSU&#8221;) resulting in exclusive worldwide licenses to various patented technologies. We have utilized the same model employed by many public-sector research organizations which entails obtaining an exclusive option or license agreement to any invention arising out of funded research. In all cases, we fund and control all patent filings as the exclusive licensee. This model of contracting with public-sector researchers has enabled the Company to control R&#38;D costs while achieving our desired results, including obtaining exclusive intellectual property rights relating to our outsourced R&#38;D.

&#160;

Other R&#38;D partners with the same arrangement have included the National Research Council of Canada, Plant Biotechnology Institute in Saskatoon, Canada (&#8220;NRC&#8221;), and the Nara Institute of Science and Technology in Nara, Japan (&#8220;NAIST&#8221;). The majority of this R&#38;D has involved the biosynthesis of nicotine in plants. Our R&#38;D agreements with NCSU, NRC and NAIST expired in 2009. In 2010, NAIST assigned to us all of their worldwide patents and patent applications that were previously licensed to us on an exclusive basis. These patents and patent applications were a result of our R&#38;D at NAIST. On December 23, 2014, we purchased from NRC all the patents and patent applications that were previously licensed to us on an exclusive basis.

&#160;

In November 2011, we entered into an R&#38;D agreement with the University of Virginia (&#8220;UVA&#8221;) relating to nicotine biosynthesis in tobacco plants with a total budget of $500,000 for the period from November 2011 through December 31, 2013. The term of the R&#38;D agreement with UVA was subsequently extended to May 31, 2016, with a total budget of $972,727. In 2015, we incurred approximately $224,000 of expenses for the R&#38;D agreement at UVA and anticipate spending an additional amount of approximately $94,000 through May 31, 2016. We also plan to extent the agreement for an additional year to May 31, 2017 at an expected cost of approximately $225,000.

&#160;

We have committed to an R&#38;D agreement with NCSU relating to nicotine biosynthesis in tobacco plants with a total budget of approximately $163,000 for the period from February 2014 through January 2016. Upon identifying a suitable joint venture partner or licensee to fund further X-22 clinical trials, we plan to carry out additional X-22 clinical trials.

&#160;

During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we incurred total R&#38;D expenses of $1,669,387, $1,249,007 and $744,230, respectively.

&#160;

Sources of Raw Materials 

&#160; 

We obtain a large portion of our tobacco leaf requirements from farmers in multiple U.S. states that are under direct contracts with us. The contracts prohibit the transfer of our proprietary seedlings and plant materials to other parties. We purchase the balance of our tobacco requirements through third parties. As we expand our sales and distribution of our current commercial brands and proceed to market with our X-22 smoking cessation aid and BRAND A and BRAND B cigarettes, we plan to increase the amount of tobacco leaf we obtain directly from farmers under contract, both in the United States and in foreign countries.

Products 

&#160;

RED SUN and MAGIC Cigarettes 

&#160; 

Goodrich Tobacco introduced two super-premium priced cigarette brands, RED SUN and MAGIC , into the U.S. market. Both brands are available in regular and menthol and all brand styles are king size and packaged in hinge-lid hard packs. In 2015, we focused our marketing and sales efforts for RED SUN on independent retailers, tobacconists, smokeshops and other tobacco outlets in the U.S. The ban in 2009 by the FDA of all cigarettes with characterizing flavors (with the exception of menthol) has resulted in a product void in these tobacco channels for highly differentiated, super-premium priced products. We believe that certain U.S. cigarette wholesalers and retailers will carry our brands, among other reasons, to increase their margins. RED SUN is produced by our NASCO subsidiary at our factory in North Carolina, which is now a subsequent participating manufacturer under the MSA, and MAGIC is produced for us by Orion, our contract manufacturer in Poland, for distribution in the European Union.

&#160;

SPECTRUM Government Research Cigarettes 

&#160;

NIDA, a part of NIH, provides the scientific community with controlled and uncontrolled research chemicals and drug compounds in its Drug Supply Program. NIDA included an option to develop and produce research cigarettes with various levels of nicotine (from very low to high), or Research Cigarette Option, in its request for proposals for a five-year contract for Preparation and Distribution of Research and Drug Products. We agreed, as a subcontractor to RTI International (&#8220;RTI&#8221;) in RTI&#8217;s contract with NIDA for the Research Cigarette Option, to supply modified nicotine (from very low to high) cigarettes to NIDA. In August 2010, we met with officials from NIDA, FDA, RTI, the National Cancer Institute and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to finalize certain aspects of the design of these research cigarettes. These government research cigarettes produced by us under the mark SPECTRUM were distributed by NIDA to researchers free of charge. Goodrich Tobacco has thus far delivered approximately 22 million SPECTRUM research cigarettes. On July 7, 2014, Goodrich Tobacco entered into a Teaming Agreement with RTI to work together to respond to a new request from NIDA for the potential purchase by NIDA from RTI of additional SPECTRUM research cigarettes to be produced and sold by Goodrich Tobacco to RTI. In 2015, NIDA ordered from RTI approximately 5 million SPECTRUM research cigarettes as made and sold by Goodrich Tobacco.

&#160;

BRAND A and BRAND B 

&#160;

The Tobacco Control Act establishes procedures for the FDA to regulate the labeling and marketing of cigarettes that (i) reduce exposure to tobacco toxins and (ii) are reasonably likely to pose lower health risks as compared to conventional cigarettes (&#8220;Modified Risk Cigarettes&#8221;). The Tobacco Control Act requires the FDA to issue specific regulations and guidance regarding applications submitted to the FDA for the authorization to label and market modified risk tobacco products, including Modified Risk Cigarettes. On March 30, 2012, the FDA issued Modified Risk Tobacco Product Applications Draft Guidance. We believe that two types of our cigarettes in development, which we refer to as BRAND A and BRAND B , may qualify as Modified Risk Cigarettes. In addition, the Tobacco Control Act allows the FDA to mandate the use of reduced risk technologies in conventional tobacco products and cigarettes (e.g., Marlboro &#174; , Camel &#174; , Newport &#174; , Natural American Spirit &#174; ), which could create opportunities for us to license our proprietary technology and/or our tobaccos to larger competitors.

&#160;

Compared to commercial tobacco cigarettes, BRAND A has the lowest nicotine content. The tobacco in BRAND A contains approximately 95% less nicotine than conventional cigarette brands. Clinical studies have demonstrated that smokers who smoke VLN cigarettes containing our proprietary tobacco smoke fewer cigarettes per day resulting in significant reductions in smoke exposure, including &#8220;tar,&#8221; nicotine and carbon monoxide. Due to the very low nicotine levels, compensatory smoking does not occur with VLN cigarettes containing our proprietary tobacco (Hatsukami et al . 2010).

&#160;

Utilizing the results of previously conducted independent clinical trials (see below under &#8220;X-22 Smoking Cessation Aid&#8221;), on December 31, 2015, we submitted to the Center for Tobacco Products (&#8220;CTP&#8221;) of the FDA an application for BRAND A as a Modified Risk Cigarette.

&#160;

Using a proprietary high nicotine tobacco blend in conjunction with specialty cigarette components, BRAND B allows the smoker to achieve a satisfactory amount of nicotine per cigarette while inhaling less &#8220;tar&#8221; and carbon monoxide. At the same time, we do not expect exposure to nicotine from BRAND B to be significantly higher than some commercially available full flavor cigarette brands. We believe smokers who desire to reduce smoke exposure, but are less concerned about nicotine, will find BRAND B beneficial. BRAND B has a &#8220;tar&#8221; yield between typical &#8220;light&#8221; and &#8220;ultra-light&#8221; cigarettes, but a nicotine yield of typical full flavor cigarettes.

&#160;

&#160; 11 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Our Company has engaged a major contract research organization (&#8220;CRO&#8221;) with extensive experience in tobacco exposure studies to assist us in certain regulatory activities at the CTP related to the Company&#8217;s research to support the development of potentially less harmful or modified risk cigarettes. The Company and the CRO met with the CTP on November 12, 2014 to discuss the development plan and proof of concept study for BRAND B , a cigarette that produces smoke containing an extraordinarily low amount of &#8220;tar&#8221; per milligram of nicotine.

&#160;

We believe that these two cigarette products in development, which we refer to as BRAND A and BRAND B , will qualify as Modified Risk Cigarettes. Compared to commercial cigarettes, the tobacco in BRAND A has approximately 95% less nicotine than tobacco in cigarettes previously marketed as &#8220;light&#8221; cigarettes, and BRAND B s smoke contains an extraordinarily low amount of &#8220;tar&#8221; per milligram of nicotine.

&#160;

X-22 Smoking Cessation Aid 

&#160;

X-22 is a tobacco-based botanical medical product for use as an aid to smoking cessation. The X-22 therapy protocol utilized in our sponsored Phase IIb clinical trial calls for the patient to smoke our VLN cigarettes over a six-week treatment period to facilitate the goal of the patient quitting smoking by the end of the treatment period. We believe this therapy protocol has been successful in independent clinical trials because VLN cigarettes made from our proprietary tobacco satisfy smokers&#8217; cravings for cigarettes while (i) greatly reducing nicotine exposure and nicotine dependence and (ii) extinguishing the association between the act of smoking and the rapid delivery of nicotine. X-22 involves the same smoking behavior as conventional cigarettes and because patients are simply switching to VLN cigarettes for 6 weeks, X-22 does not expose the smoker to any new drugs or new side effects. Our Investigational New Drug Application for X-22 , a kit of VLN cigarettes, was cleared by the FDA in July 2011 and has been updated annually. Our X-22 Phase IIb clinical trial was completed in the first quarter of 2012 but did not demonstrate a statistically significant difference in quitting between X-22 and the active control, a cigarette containing conventional nicotine levels. However, the median number of X-22 cigarettes smoked during the trial was significantly reduced compared to patients&#8217; baseline of usual brand of cigarettes. In evaluating the results of this trial, we believe we may have reduced the nicotine content of X-22 by too great a percentage, to a level less than half the nicotine content of VLN cigarettes used in various independent smoking-cessation clinical trials that have demonstrated that use of VLN cigarettes increases quit rates.

&#160;

Due to the limited effectiveness and/or serious side effects of existing FDA-approved smoking cessation products (all of which have been on the market for approximately between 8 and 30 years), we believe that if additional clinical trials demonstrate increased smoking cessation rates, then X-22 can capture a share of this market by replacing sales and market share from existing smoking cessation aids and by expanding the smoking cessation market by encouraging more smokers to attempt to quit smoking. In contrast to the results of our Phase IIb trial results, the seven (7) independent studies listed below have demonstrated that VLN cigarettes increase quit rates, whether used alone, in conjunction with Chantix &#174; (varenicline) or in conjunction with nicotine replacement therapy (&#8220;NRT&#8221;) such as nicotine patches, gums or lozenges. The seven (7) independent studies listed below are indeed remarkable for their results, but were not conducted or monitored by us and are included herein for informational purposes only. We assume no obligation to review any of these independent studies for errors, omissions or other factors.

&#160;

&#183; Phase II clinical trial 

&#160;

FDA approval must be obtained, as has been the case for decades, before a product can be marketed for quitting smoking. The Tobacco Control Act provides that products for quitting smoking or smoking cessation, such as X-22 , be considered for &#8220;Fast Track&#8221; designation by the FDA. The &#8220;Fast Track&#8221; programs of the FDA are intended to facilitate development and to expedite review of drugs to treat serious and life-threatening conditions so that an approved product can reach the market expeditiously. We believe that upon completion of a company-sponsored clinical trial demonstrating efficacy, X-22 will qualify for &#8220;Fast Track&#8221; designation by the FDA.

&#160;

We believe that our VLN cigarettes are an effective aid to smoking cessation. We are currently in the process of identifying potential joint venture partners or licensees to fund the remaining X-22 clinical trials. Upon identifying a suitable joint venture partner or licensee, we will then request a meeting with the FDA, and thereafter we plan to resume our own sponsored X-22 clinical trials.

Government Regulation 

&#160;

Smoking Cessation Aids 

&#160;

Government authorities in the U.S. and foreign countries extensively regulate the research, development, testing, manufacture, labeling, promotion, advertising, distribution, sampling, marketing and import and export of pharmaceutical products. FDA approval must be obtained, as has been the case for decades, before a product can be marketed for quitting smoking or reducing withdrawal symptoms. In addition, as with all FDA-approved prescription drugs, the FDA must approve the brand name of our X-22 smoking cessation aid. The FDA approval process for smoking cessation aids is similar to that required by the FDA for new drug approvals, although the cost to complete clinical trials for a smoking cessation aid such as X-22 are generally far less than clinical trials for drugs. The primary endpoint of the clinical trial for smoking cessation aids is smoking abstinence, which is generally confirmed by inexpensive, noninvasive biomarker tests. Since potential quitters are already smokers, X-22 will not expose participants in the clinical trials to any new compounds, unlike a new chemical entity, such as Chantix &#174; .

&#160;

The process of obtaining governmental approvals and complying with ongoing regulatory requirements requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. In addition, statutes, rules, regulations and policies may change and new legislation or regulations may be issued that could delay such approvals. If we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process, or after approval, we may become subject to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDA&#8217;s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawals of approvals, clinical holds, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of our operations, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. Any agency enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.

&#160;

The Affordable Care Act and other government and private sector initiatives targeted to potentially limit the growth of healthcare costs are continuing in the U.S. and many other countries where we intend to sell our products, including our X-22 smoking cessation aid. These changes are causing the marketplace to put increased emphasis on the delivery of more cost-effective medical products.

&#160;

Government healthcare programs in the United States, including Medicare and Medicaid, private healthcare insurance and managed-care plans have attempted to control costs by limiting the amount of reimbursement for which they will pay for particular procedures or treatments. This may create price sensitivity among potential customers for our X-22 smoking cessation aid, even if we obtain FDA approval for it. Some third-party payers must also approve coverage for new or innovative devices or therapies before they will reimburse healthcare providers who use the medical devices or therapies. Even though a new medical product may have been cleared for commercial distribution, we may find limited demand for X-22 until reimbursement approval has been obtained from governmental and private third-party payers.

&#160;

Modified Risk Cigarettes 

&#160;

The Tobacco Control Act, which became law in June 2009, prohibits the FDA from banning cigarettes outright or mandating that nicotine levels be reduced to zero. However, among other things, it allows the FDA to require the reduction of nicotine or any other compound in cigarettes. In 2009, the Tobacco Control Act banned all sales in the United States of cigarettes with flavored tobacco (other than menthol). As of June 2010, all cigarette companies were required to cease using the terms &#8220;low tar,&#8221; &#8220;light&#8221; and &#8220;ultra light&#8221; in describing cigarettes sold in the United States. We believe this new regulatory environment represents a paradigm shift for the tobacco industry and will create opportunities for us in marketing BRAND A and BRAND B and in licensing our proprietary technology and/or tobaccos to larger competitors.

&#160;

For the first time in history, a U.S. regulatory agency will scientifically evaluate cigarettes that may pose lower health risks as compared to conventional cigarettes. The Tobacco Control Act establishes procedures for the FDA to regulate the labeling and marketing of modified risk tobacco products, which includes cigarettes that (i) reduce exposure to tobacco smoke toxins and/or (ii) pose lower health risks, as compared to conventional cigarettes (&#8220;Modified Risk Cigarettes&#8221;). The Tobacco Control Act requires the FDA to issue specific regulations and guidance regarding applications that must be submitted to the FDA for the authorization to label and market Modified Risk Cigarettes. We believe that BRAND A and BRAND B will qualify as Modified Risk Cigarettes. In addition, the Tobacco Control Act allows the FDA to mandate the use of reduced risk technologies in conventional tobacco products and cigarettes (e.g., Marlboro &#174; , Camel &#174; , Newport &#174; , Native American Spirit &#174; ) which could create opportunities for us to license our proprietary technology and/or our tobaccos to larger competitors.

&#160;

In addition to providing our SPECTRUM cigarettes to NIDA for researchers, we have been directly supplying our proprietary cigarettes to independent researchers so that additional studies can be conducted to obtain additional information on our products. We expect this information will assist us, along with our own funded studies, in obtaining the necessary FDA authorizations to market BRAND A and BRAND B as Modified Risk Cigarettes and to obtain FDA approval for X-22 as a prescription smoking cessation aid.

&#160;

&#160; 14 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

In the market for FDA-approved smoking cessation aids, our principal competitors include Pfizer Inc., GlaxoSmithKline plc, Novartis International AG, and Perrigo Company plc. The industry consists of major domestic and international companies, most of which have existing relationships in the markets into which we plan to sell, as well as financial, technical, marketing, sales, manufacturing, scaling capacity, distribution and other resources, and name recognition substantially greater than ours.

&#160;

Cigarette companies compete primarily on the basis of product quality, brand recognition, brand loyalty, taste, innovation, packaging, service, marketing, advertising, retail shelf space and price. Cigarette sales can be significantly influenced by weak economic conditions, erosion of consumer confidence, competitors&#8217; introduction of low-price products or innovative products, higher cigarette taxes, higher absolute prices and larger gaps between price categories, and product regulation that diminishes the ability to differentiate tobacco products. Domestic competitors include Philip Morris USA, Reynolds American Inc., Commonwealth Brands, Inc., Liggett Group LLC and Vector Tobacco Inc. International competitors include Philip Morris International, Inc., Japan Tobacco Inc., Imperial Tobacco Group plc, and regional and local tobacco companies.

&#160;

Biomass Products 

&#160;

Biomass products are products such as ethanol made from the organic material, usually plants densely grown over a given area. We have funded extensive biomass field trials conducted by NCSU and work on feedstock digestibility and bioconversion at the National Renewable Energy Lab. Bioconversion is the conversion of organic matter into a source of energy, such as ethanol in our own research, through the action of microorganisms. Tobacco has a number of advantages as a starting point for development of novel bioproduct crop systems. Because tobacco is a widely cultivated crop, grown in over 100 countries throughout the world, tobacco agronomy is highly understood. For decades tobacco has been used as a model system for plant biology, and recently the tobacco genome has been mapped. Tobacco plants rapidly sprout back after each harvest and produce large amounts of leaf and total biomass. Tobacco grown for cigarettes yields about 3,000 pounds of cured leaf per acre (~20% moisture) per year from 7,500 tobacco plants. In our field trials in North Carolina, nicotine-free tobacco grown for biomass yields about 100,000 pounds of fresh weight per acre (which equals 10,000 pounds of dry weight) per year with multiple machine harvests from about 80,000 tobacco plants. The results of our biomass studies have been summarized in a comprehensive feasibility study relating to our nicotine-free tobacco biomass crop ( Verfola ) to produce a variety of bioproducts. First, protein and other plant fractions are extracted, and then biofuels and other products are produced from the remaining cellulosic residue.

&#160;

In 2009, we put our biomass development projects on hold so that our management could focus its attention and resources on our modified risk cigarette business and our X-22 smoking cessation business. We do not plan to move forward with potential biomass business activities until some period of time after FDA approval of X-22 or FDA authorization to market Brand A or Brand B as a Modified Risk Cigarette. We currently are not spending any capital for such potential biomass business activities nor do we have any current plans to do so in the foreseeable future.

Cannabis Research in Canada 

&#160;

Botanical Genetics is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and was incorporated to facilitate an equity investment in Anandia Laboratories, Inc. (&#8220;Anandia&#8221;), a plant biotechnology company based in Vancouver, Canada, that closed on April 14, 2014. On September 15, 2014, Botanical Genetics was granted a sublicense by Anandia to 23 patent applications relating to four genes in the cannabis plant that are required for the production of cannabinoids, the active ingredients in the cannabis plant, with such sublicense being exclusive in the United States and co-exclusive with Anandia everywhere else in the world, except Canada where Anandia has retained exclusive rights. The Anandia sublicense continues through the life of the last-to-expire patent, which is expected to be in 2035.

&#160;

We do not conduct any activities related to cannabis in the United States. Our research facilities for cannabis are located exclusively in Canada. Through licenses granted by the Canadian government to Anandia, we conduct research and development in Canada with Anandia of unique plant varieties of hemp/cannabis, such as (i) plants with low to no amounts of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, for the legal hemp industry, and (ii) plants with high levels of cannabidiol, or CBD, and other non-THC cannabinoids for the legal medical marijuana markets. In Canada, licenses to cultivate, possess and supply cannabis for medical research are granted by agencies of the Canadian federal government. In order to carry out research in other countries, similar licenses are required to be issued by the relevant authority in each country.

&#160;

&#160; 15 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015, there are 23 states in the United States plus the District of Columbia that have laws and/or regulations that recognize, in one form or another, legitimate medical uses for cannabis and consumer use of cannabis in connection with medical treatment. Additionally, the states of Alaska, Colorado, Oregon and Washington have legalized cannabis for adult use. Many other states are considering similar legislation. Conversely, under the federal Controlled Substance Act (the &#8220;CSA&#8221;), the policies and regulations of the federal government and its agencies are that cannabis has no medical benefit and a range of activities are prohibited, including cultivation, possession, personal use and interstate distribution of cannabis. In the event the U.S. Department of Justice (the &#8220;DOJ&#8221;) begins strict enforcement of the CSA in states that have laws legalizing medical marijuana and recreational marijuana in small amounts, there may be a direct and adverse impact to any future business or prospects that we have in the cannabis business.
