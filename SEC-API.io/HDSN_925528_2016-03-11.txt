&#160;

Industry Background

&#160;

The Company participates in an industry that is highly regulated, and changes in the regulations affecting our business could affect our operating results. Currently the Company purchases virgin, hydro chlorofluorocarbon (&#8220;HCFC&#8221;) and hydro fluorocarbon (&#8220;HFC&#8221;) refrigerants and reclaimable, primarily HCFC, HFC and chlorofluorocarbon (&#8220;CFC&#8221;) refrigerants from suppliers and its customers. Effective January 1, 1996, the Clean Air Act, as amended (the &#8220;Act&#8221;) prohibited the production of virgin CFC refrigerants and limited the production of virgin HCFC refrigerants. Effective January 2004, the Act further limited the production of virgin HCFC refrigerants and federal regulations were enacted which established production and consumption allowances for HCFC refrigerants and which imposed limitations on the importation of certain virgin HCFC refrigerants. Under the Act, production of certain virgin HCFC refrigerants is scheduled to be phased out during the period 2010 through 2020, and production of all virgin HCFC refrigerants is scheduled to be phased out by 2030. In April 2013, the Environmental Protection Agency (&#8220;EPA&#8221;) published a final rule providing for the production or importation of 63 million and 51 million pounds of HCFC-22 in 2013 and 2014, respectively. In October 2014, the EPA published a final rule providing further reductions in the production and consumption allowances for virgin HCFC refrigerants for the years 2015 through 2019 (the &#8220;Final Rule&#8221;). In the Final Rule, the EPA has established a linear annual phase down schedule for the production or importation of virgin HCFC-22 that started at approximately 22 million pounds in 2015 and reduces by approximately 4.5 million pounds each year and ends at zero in 2020.

&#160;

HFC refrigerants are used as substitutes for CFC and HCFC refrigerants in certain applications. As a result of the increasing restrictions and limitations on the production and use of CFC and HCFC refrigerants, various segments of the air conditioning and refrigeration industry have been replacing or modifying equipment that utilize CFC and HCFC refrigerants and have been transitioning to equipment that utilize HFC refrigerants and hydrofluoro-olefins (&#8220;HFO&#8221;). HFC refrigerants are not ozone depleting chemicals and are not currently regulated under the Act. However, certain HFC refrigerants are highly weighted greenhouse gases that are believed to contribute to global warming and climate change and, as a result, are now subject to various state and federal regulations relating to the sale, use and emissions of HFC refrigerants. In addition, federal legislation has been proposed that, if enacted, would impose limitations on the production and importation of certain virgin HFC refrigerants. The Company expects that HFC refrigerants eventually will be replaced by HFOs or other types of products with lower global warming potentials.

&#160;

The Act, and the federal regulations enacted under authority of the Act, have mandated and/or promoted responsible use practices in the air conditioning and refrigeration industry, which are intended to minimize the release of refrigerants into the atmosphere and encourage the recovery and re-use of refrigerants. The Act prohibits the venting of CFC, HFC and HCFC refrigerants, and prohibits and/or phases down the production of CFC and HCFC refrigerants.

&#160;

The Act also mandates the recovery of CFC and HCFC refrigerants and also promotes and encourages re-use and reclamation of CFC and HCFC refrigerants. Under the Act, owners, operators and companies servicing cooling equipment utilizing CFC and HCFC refrigerants are responsible for the integrity of the systems regardless of the refrigerant being used. In November 2015, the EPA published a proposed rule that, if enacted, will extend these requirements to HFCs and to certain other refrigerants that are approved by the EPA as alternatives for CFC and HCFC refrigerants.

&#160;

Products and Services

&#160;

From its inception, the Company has sold refrigerants, and has provided refrigerant reclamation and refrigerant management services that are designed to recover and reuse refrigerants, thereby protecting the environment from release to the atmosphere and the corresponding ozone depletion and global warming impact. The reclamation process allows the refrigerant to be re-used thereby eliminating the need to destroy or manufacture additional refrigerant and eliminating the corresponding impact to the environment associated with the destruction and manufacturing. The Company believes it is the largest refrigerant reclaimer in the United States. Additionally, the Company has created alternative solutions to reactive and preventative maintenance procedures that are performed on commercial and industrial refrigeration systems. These services, known as RefrigerantSide&#174; Services, complement the Company&#8217;s refrigerant sales and refrigerant reclamation and management services. The Company has also developed SmartEnergy OPS TM that identify inefficiencies in the operation of air conditioning and refrigeration systems and assists companies to improve the energy efficiency of their systems and save operating costs and improve system reliability. In addition, the Company is pursuing potential opportunities for the creation and monetization of verified emission reductions.

&#160;

Refrigerant and Industrial Gas Sales

&#160;

The Company sells reclaimed and virgin (new) refrigerants to a variety of customers in various segments of the air conditioning and refrigeration industry, and sells industrial gases to a variety of industry segments. The Company continues to sell reclaimed CFC based refrigerants, which are no longer manufactured. Virgin, non-CFC refrigerants, including HCFC and HFC refrigerants, are purchased by the Company from several suppliers and resold by the Company, typically at wholesale. Additionally, the Company regularly purchases used or contaminated refrigerants, some of which are CFC based, from many different sources, which refrigerants are then reclaimed using the Company's high speed proprietary reclamation equipment, its proprietary Zugibeast&#174; system, and then are resold by the Company.

&#160;

Refrigerant Management Services

&#160;

The Company provides a complete offering of refrigerant management services, which primarily include reclamation of refrigerants, laboratory testing through the Company&#8217;s laboratory, which has been certified by the Air Conditioning, Heating and Refrigeration Institute (&#8220;AHRI&#8221;), and banking (storage) services tailored to individual customer requirements. Hudson also separates &#8220;crossed&#8221; (i.e. commingled) refrigerants and provides re-usable cylinder refurbishment and hydrostatic testing services.

&#160;

RefrigerantSide&#174; Services

&#160;

The Company provides decontamination and recovery services that are performed at a customer's site through the use of portable, high volume, high-speed proprietary equipment, including the patented Zugibeast&#174; system. Certain of these RefrigerantSide&#174; Services, which encompass system decontamination, and refrigerant recovery and reclamation are also proprietary and are covered by process patents.

&#160;

In addition to the decontamination and recovery services previously described, the Company also provides predictive and diagnostic services for its customers. The Company offers diagnostic services that are intended to predict potential problems in air conditioning and refrigeration systems before they occur. The Company&#8217;s Chiller Chemistry&#174; offering integrates several fluid tests of an operating system and the corresponding laboratory results into an engineering report providing its customers with an understanding of the current condition of the fluids, the cause for any abnormal findings and the potential consequences if the abnormal findings are not remediated. Fluid Chemistry&#174;, an abbreviated version of the Company&#8217;s Chiller Chemistry&#174; offering, is designed to quickly identify systems that require further examination.

&#160; 

The Company has also been awarded several US patents for its SmartEnergy OPS TM , which is a system for measuring, modifying and improving the efficiency of energy systems, including air conditioning and refrigeration systems, in industrial and commercial applications. This service is a web-based real time continuous monitoring service applicable to a facility&#8217;s chiller plant systems. The SmartEnergy OPS TM offering enables customers to monitor and improve their chiller plant performance and proactively identify and correct system inefficiencies. SmartEnergy OPS TM is able to identify specific inefficiencies in the operation of chiller plant systems and, when used with Hudson&#8217;s RefrigerantSide &#174; Services, can increase the efficiency of the operating systems thereby reducing energy usage and costs. Improving the system efficiency reduces power consumption thereby directly reducing CO 2 emissions at the power plants or onsite. Lastly, the Company&#8217;s ChillSmart &#174; offering, which combines the system optimization with the Company&#8217;s Chiller Chemistry &#174; offering, provides a snapshot of a packaged chiller&#8217;s operating efficiency and health. ChillSmart&#174; provides a very effective predictive maintenance tool and helps our customers to identify the operating chillers that cause higher operating costs.

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s engineers who developed and support Smart Energy OPS TM are recognized as Energy Experts and Qualified Best Practices Specialists by the United States Department of Energy (&#8220;DOE&#8221;) in the areas of Steam and Process Heating under the DOE &#8220;Best Practices&#8221; program, and are the Lead International Energy Experts for steam, chillers and refrigeration systems for the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (&#8220;UNIDO&#8221;). The Company&#8217;s staff have trained more than 4,000 industrial plant personnel in the US and internationally, and have developed and are currently delivering training curriculums in 12 different countries. The Company&#8217;s staff have completed more than 200 industrial ESAs in the US and internationally.

Carbon Offset Projects 

&#160; 

CFC refrigerants are ozone depleting substances and are also highly weighted greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming and climate change. The destruction of CFC refrigerants may be eligible for verified emission reductions that can be converted and monetized into carbon offset credits that may be traded in the emerging carbon offset markets. The Company is pursuing opportunities to acquire CFC refrigerants and is developing relationships within the emerging environmental markets in order to develop opportunities for the creation and monetization of verified emission reductions from the destruction of CFC refrigerants.

&#160;

In October 2015, the American Carbon Registry (&#8220;ACR&#8221;) established a methodology to provide, among other things, a quantification framework for the creation of carbon offset credits for the use of certified reclaimed HFC refrigerants. The Company is pursuing opportunities to acquire HFC refrigerants and is developing relationships within the emerging environmental markets in order to develop opportunities for the creation and monetization of verified emission reductions from the reclamation of HFC refrigerants.

Strategic Alliances

&#160;

The Company believes that the international market for refrigerant reclamation, sales and services is equal in size to the United States market for those sales and services. The Company has Alliances in Europe and South Africa, and over time, the Company expects to introduce its technology and offerings to several other markets around the world.

&#160;

Suppliers

&#160;

The Company's financial performance and its ability to sell refrigerants is in part dependent on its ability to obtain sufficient quantities of virgin, non-CFC based refrigerants, and of reclaimable CFC and non-CFC based, refrigerants from manufacturers, wholesalers, distributors, bulk gas brokers and from other sources within the air conditioning, refrigeration and automotive aftermarket industries, and on corresponding demand for refrigerants. The Company's refrigerant sales include CFC based refrigerants, which are no longer manufactured. Additionally, the Company's refrigerant sales include non-CFC based refrigerants, including HCFC and HFC refrigerants, which are the most-widely used refrigerants. Effective January 1, 1996, the Act limited the production of virgin HCFC refrigerants, which production was further limited in January 2004. Federal regulations enacted in January 2004 established production and consumption allowances for HCFCs and imposed limitations on the importation of certain virgin HCFC refrigerants. Under the Act, production of certain virgin HCFC refrigerants is scheduled to be phased out during the period 2010 through 2020 and production of all virgin HCFC refrigerants is scheduled to be phased out by 2030. In October 2014, the EPA published the Final Rule providing further reductions in the production and consumption allowances for virgin HCFC refrigerants for the years 2015 through 2019. In the Final Rule, the EPA has established a linear annual phase down schedule for the production or importation of virgin HCFC-22 that will start at approximately 22 million pounds in 2015 and reduce by approximately 4.5 million pounds each year and end at zero in 2020.

&#160;

Marketing

&#160;

Marketing programs are conducted through the efforts of the Company's executive officers, Company sales personnel, and third parties. Hudson employs various marketing methods, including direct mailings, technical bulletins, in-person solicitation, print advertising, response to quotation requests and the internet through the Company&#8217;s website ( www.hudsontech.com ). Information on the Company's website is not part of this report.

&#160;

The Company's sales personnel are compensated on a combination of a base salary and commission. The Company's executive officers devote significant time and effort to customer relationships.

&#160;

Competition

&#160;

The Company competes primarily on the basis of the performance of its proprietary high volume, high-speed equipment used in its operations, the breadth of services offered by the Company, including proprietary RefrigerantSide&#174; Services and other on-site services, and price, particularly with respect to refrigerant sales.

&#160;

The Company competes with numerous regional and national companies that market reclaimed and virgin refrigerants and provide refrigerant reclamation services. Certain of these competitors possess greater financial, marketing, distribution and other resources for the sale and distribution of refrigerants than the Company and, in some instances, serve a more extensive geographic area than the Company.

&#160;

Hudson's RefrigerantSide&#174; Services provide new and innovative solutions to certain problems within the refrigeration industry and, as such, the demand and market acceptance for these services are subject to uncertainty. Competition for these services primarily consists of traditional methods of solving the industry's problems. The Company&#8217;s marketing strategy is to educate the marketplace that its alternative solutions are available and that RefrigerantSide&#174; Services are superior to traditional methods.

&#160;

Insurance

&#160;

The Company carries insurance coverage that it considers sufficient to protect the Company's assets and operations. The Company currently maintains general commercial liability insurance and excess liability coverage for claims up to $11,000,000 per occurrence and $12,000,000 in the aggregate. The Company attempts to operate in a professional and prudent manner and to reduce potential liability risks through specific risk management efforts, including ongoing employee training.

&#160;

The refrigerant industry involves potentially significant risks of statutory and common law liability for environmental damage and personal injury. The Company, and in certain instances, its officers, directors and employees, may be subject to claims arising from the Company's on-site or off-site services, including the improper release, spillage, misuse or mishandling of refrigerants classified as hazardous or non-hazardous substances or materials. The Company may be held strictly liable for damages, which could be substantial, regardless of whether it exercised due care and complied with all relevant laws and regulations.

&#160;

Hudson maintains environmental impairment insurance of $10,000,000 per occurrence, and $10,000,000 annual aggregate, for events occurring subsequent to November 1996.

&#160;

Government Regulation

&#160;

The business of refrigerant sales, reclamation and management is subject to extensive, stringent and frequently changing federal, state and local laws and substantial regulation under these laws by governmental agencies, including the EPA, the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration (&#8220;OSHA&#8221;) and the United States Department of Transportation (&#8220;DOT&#8221;).

&#160;

&#160; 6 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Among other things, these regulatory authorities impose requirements which regulate the handling, packaging, labeling, transportation and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous materials and the health and safety of workers, and require the Company and, in certain instances, its employees, to obtain and maintain licenses in connection with its operations. This extensive regulatory framework imposes significant compliance burdens and risks on the Company.

&#160;

Hudson and its customers are subject to the requirements of the Act, and the regulations promulgated thereunder by the EPA, which make it unlawful for any person in the course of maintaining, servicing, repairing, and disposing of air conditioning or refrigeration equipment, to knowingly vent or otherwise release or dispose of ozone depleting substances, and non-ozone depleting substitutes, used as refrigerants.

&#160;

Pursuant to the Act, reclaimed refrigerant must satisfy the same purity standards as newly manufactured, virgin refrigerants in accordance with standards established by AHRI prior to resale to a person other than the owner of the equipment from which it was recovered. The EPA administers a certification program pursuant to which applicants certify to reclaim refrigerants in compliance with AHRI standards. The Company is one of only three certified refrigerant testing laboratories in the United States under AHRI&#8217;s laboratory certification program, which is a voluntary program that certifies the ability of a laboratory to test refrigerant in accordance with the AHRI 700 standard.

&#160;

In addition, the EPA has established a mandatory certification program for air conditioning and refrigeration technicians. Hudson's technicians have applied for or obtained such certification.

&#160;

The Company may also be subject to regulations adopted by the EPA which impose certain reporting requirements arising out of the importation of certain HCFCs, and arising out of the importation, purchase, production, use and/or emissions of certain greenhouse gases, including HFCs.

&#160;

The Company is also subject to regulations adopted by the DOT which classify most refrigerants handled by the Company as hazardous materials or substances and imposes requirements for handling, packaging, labeling and transporting refrigerants and which regulate the use and operation of the Company&#8217;s commercial motor vehicles used in the Company&#8217;s business.

&#160;

The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, as amended (&#34;RCRA&#34;), requires facilities that treat, store or dispose of hazardous wastes to comply with certain operating standards. Before transportation and disposal of hazardous wastes off-site, generators of such waste must package and label their shipments consistent with detailed regulations and prepare a manifest identifying the material and stating its destination. The transporter must deliver the hazardous waste in accordance with the manifest to a facility with an appropriate RCRA permit. Under RCRA, impurities removed from refrigerants consisting of oils mixed with water and other contaminants are not presumed to be hazardous waste.

&#160;

The Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act of 1986, as amended, requires the annual reporting by the Company of Emergency and Hazardous Chemical Inventories (Tier II reports) to the various states in which the Company operates and requires the Company to file annual Toxic Chemical Release Inventory Forms with the EPA.

&#160;

The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (&#8220;CERCLA&#8221;), establishes liability for clean-up costs and environmental damages to current and former facility owners and operators, as well as persons who transport or arrange for transportation of hazardous substances. Almost all states have similar statutes regulating the handling and storage of hazardous substances, hazardous wastes and non-hazardous wastes. Many such statutes impose requirements that are more stringent than their federal counterparts. The Company could be subject to substantial liability under these statutes to private parties and government entities, in some instances without any fault, for fines, remediation costs and environmental damage, as a result of the mishandling, release, or existence of any hazardous substances at any of its facilities.

&#160;

The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, as amended mandates requirements for a safe work place for employees and special procedures and measures for the handling of certain hazardous and toxic substances. State laws, in certain circumstances, mandate additional measures for facilities handling specified materials.

&#160;

The Company is also subject to regulations adopted by the California Air Resources Board which impose certain reporting requirements arising out of the reclamation and sale of refrigerants that takes place within the State of California.

&#160;

The Company believes that it is in material compliance with all applicable regulations material to its business operations.

&#160;

Quality Assurance &#38; Environmental Compliance

&#160;

The Company utilizes in-house quality and regulatory compliance control procedures. Hudson maintains its own analytical testing laboratory, which is AHRI certified, to assure that reclaimed refrigerants comply with AHRI purity standards and employs portable testing equipment when performing on-site services to verify certain quality specifications. The Company employs ten persons engaged full-time in quality control and to monitor the Company's operations for regulatory compliance.

&#160;

&#160; 7 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Employees

&#160;

On December 31, 2015, the Company had 133 full and 3 part time employees including air conditioning and refrigeration technicians, chemists, engineers, sales and administrative personnel. None of the Company's employees are represented by a union. The Company believes that its employee relations are good.

&#160;

Patents and Proprietary Information

&#160;

The Company holds several U.S. and foreign patents, as well as pending patent applications, related to certain RefrigerantSide&#174; Services and supporting systems developed by the Company for systems and processes for measuring and improving the efficiency of refrigeration systems, and for certain refrigerant recycling and reclamation technologies. These patents will expire between February 2017 and April 2032.

&#160;

The Company believes that patent protection is important to its business. There can be no assurance as to the breadth or degree of protection that patents may afford the Company, that any patent applications will result in issued patents or that patents will not be circumvented or invalidated. Technological development in the refrigerant industry may result in extensive patent filings and a rapid rate of issuance of new patents. Although the Company believes that its existing patents and the Company's equipment do not and will not infringe upon existing patents or violate proprietary rights of others, it is possible that the Company's existing patent rights may not be valid or that infringement of existing or future patents or violations of proprietary rights of others may occur. In the event the Company's equipment or processes infringe, or are alleged to infringe, patents or other proprietary rights of others, the Company may be required to modify the design of its equipment or processes, obtain a license or defend a possible patent infringement action. There can be no assurance that the Company will have the financial or other resources necessary to enforce or defend a patent infringement or proprietary rights violation action or that the Company will not become liable for damages.

&#160;

The Company also relies on trade secrets and proprietary know-how, and employs various methods to protect its technology. However, such methods may not afford complete protection and there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop such know-how or obtain access to the Company's know-how, concepts, ideas and documentation. Failure to protect its trade secrets could have a material adverse effect on the Company.
