 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

&#160; 

Overview 

&#160; 

We are a self-administered and self-managed real estate company focused primarily on the ownership, operation, management, acquisition, and development of self-storage facilities in the United States. 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015 , we owned 445 self-storage facilities located in 22 states and in the District of Columbia containing an aggregate of approximately 30.4 million rentable square feet. As of December 31, 2015 , approximately 90.2% of the rentable square footage at our owned facilities was leased to approximately 264,000 customers, and no single customer represented a significant concentration of our revenues. As of December 31, 2015, we owned facilities in the District of Columbia and the following 22 states: Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, and Virginia. In addition, as of December 31, 2015 , we managed 227 facilities for third parties ( including 35 facilities containing an aggregate of approximately 2.4 million rentable square feet as part of an unconsolidated real estate venture in which we own a 50% interest, and 30 facilities containing an aggregate of approximately 1.8 million rentable square feet as part of a separate unconsolidated real estate venture in which we own a 10% interest) bringing the total number of facilities we owned and/or managed to 672 . As of December 31, 2015 , we managed facilities for third parties in the District of Columbia and the following 23 states: Alabama, Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia. 

&#160; 

Our self-storage facilities are designed to offer affordable and easily-accessible storage space for our residential and commercial customers. Our customers rent storage cubes for their exclusive use, typically on a month-to-month basis. Additionally, some of our facilities offer outside storage areas for vehicles and boats. Our facilities are designed to accommodate both residential and commercial customers, with features such as wide aisles and load-bearing capabilities for large truck access. All of our facilities have an on-site manager during business hours, and 271, or approximately 60.9%, of our owned facilities have a manager who resides in an apartment at the facility. Our customers can access their storage cubes during business hours, and some of our facilities provide customers with 24-hour access through computer-controlled access systems. Our goal is to provide customers with the highest standard of facilities and service in the industry. To that end , 372, or approximately 83.6%, of our owned facilities include climate-controlled cubes. 

&#160; 

The Parent Company was formed in July 2004 as a Maryland REIT. The Parent Company owns its assets and conducts its business through the Operating Partnership, and its subsidiaries. The Parent Company controls the Operating Partnership as its sole general partner and, as of December 31, 2015 , owned an approximately 98.8% interest in the Operating Partnership. The Operating Partnership was formed in July 2004 as a Delaware limited partnership and has been engaged in virtually all aspects of the self-storage business, including the development, acquisition, management, ownership and operation of self-storage facilities. 

&#160; 

Acquisition and Disposition Activity 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015 and 2014 , we owned 445 &#160; and 421 facilities, respectively, that contained an aggregate of 30.4 million and 28.6 million rentable square feet with occupancy rates of 90.2% and 89.1%, respectively. 

&#160;

Financing and Investing Activities 

&#160; 

The following summarizes certain financing and investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2015 : 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Facility Acquisitions. During 2015, we acquired 29 self-storage facilities &#160; located throughout the United States for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $292.4 million. Included in the 29 acquired self-storage facilities are 12 facilities (the &#8220;PSI Assets&#8217;) acquired in conjunction with the purchase of common stock of a privately held self-storage REIT . In connection with these acquisitions, we allocated a portion of the purchase price paid for each facility to the intangible value of in-place leases which aggregated to $20.0 million. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Facility Development. During 2015, we completed construction and opened for operation three self-storage facilities developed through joint ventures. Two of the self-storage facilities are located in New York and one is located in Virginia. We invested a total of $4 9 . 3 million in the development of these three facilities. As of December 31, 2015, we had four joint venture development facilities and one wholly-owned development facility under construction. We anticipate investing a total of $148.7 million related to these five projects, and construction for all projects is expected to be completed by the fourth quarter of 2017. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Development Commitments. During 2015, we acquired one self-storage facility in Texas for $15.8 million after the completion of construction and the issuance of the certificate of occupancy. During 2015, we also entered into contracts to purchase one facility in Florida and one facility in Illinois after the completion of construction and the issuance of the certificate of occupancy. As of December 31, 2015, we had five facilities under contract, including three facilities that went under contract in 2014, for a total acquisition price of $101.4 million. These five facility acquisitions are subject to due diligence and other customary closing conditions and no assurance can be provided that these acquisitions will be completed on the terms described, or at all. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Facility Dispositions. On October 8, 2015, we sold seven assets in Texas and one asset in Florida for an aggregate sales price of $37.8 million. Net proceeds of $36.4 million were held in escrow to fund future acquisitions. We recorded an aggregate gain of $14.4 million on the dispositions. Additionally, on October 2, 2015 , USIFB, LLP (&#8220;USIFB&#8221;), a consolidated real estate joint venture in which we owned a 97% interest, sold its remaining asset in London, England for an aggregate sales price of &#163;6.5 million (approximately $9.9 million). We received net proceeds of $9.2 million and recorded a gain on the sale of real estate of $3.0 million, net of a foreign currency translation loss of $1.2 million, as a result of the transaction. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

At-The-Market Equity Program. During 2015, under our at-the-market equity program , we sold a total of 9.0 million common shares at an average sales price of $26.35 per share, resulting in net proceeds under the program of $234.1 million, after deducting offering costs. On December 30, 2015, we increased the number of common shares under our program to 

&#160;

40.0 million common shares and, as of December 31, 2015, 10.2 million common shares remained available for sale under the program. The proceeds from the sales conducted during the year ended December 31, 2015 were used to fund acquisitions of self-storage facilities and for general corporate purposes. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Credit Facility Amendment . On April 22, 2015, we amended our Credit Facility to increase the aggregate amount under the revolving portion of our Credit Facility (the &#8220;Revolver&#8221;) from $300.0 million to $500.0 million, decrease the facility fee from 0.20% to 0.15% and extend the maturity date from June 18, 2017 to April 22, 2020. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Debt Offering. O n October 26, 2015, we completed the issuance and sale of $250.0 million in aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes due November 15, 2025 which bear interest at a rate of 4.00% per annum. Net proceeds from the offering were used to repay outstanding indebtedness under our Revolver and for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions, investments in joint ventures, and repayment or repurchase of other indebtedness. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Mortgage Loans. During 2015, we repaid four mortgage loans aggregating $82.6 million and assumed one mortgage loan with an outstanding principal balance of $2.5 million as of December 31, 2015. 

&#160; 

Business Strategy 

&#160; 

Our business strategy consists of several elements: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Maximize cash flow from our facilities &#160;&#8212; Our operating strategy focuses on maximizing sustainable rents at our facilities while achieving and sustaining occupancy targets. We utilize our operating systems and experienced personnel to manage the balance between rental rates, discounts, and physical occupancy with an objective of maximizing our rental revenue. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Acquire facilities within targeted markets &#160;&#8212; During 2016, we intend to pursue selective acquisitions in markets that we believe have high barriers to entry, strong demographic fundamentals, and demand for storage in excess of storage capacity. We believe the self-storage industry will continue to afford us opportunities for growth through acquisitions due to the highly fragmented composition of the industry. In the past, we have formed joint ventures with unaffiliated third parties, and in the future we may form additional joint ventures to facilitate the funding of future developments or acquisitions. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Dispose of facilities &#8212; During 2016, we intend to continue to evaluate opportunities to reduce exposure in slower growth, lower barrier-to-entry markets. We intend to use proceeds from these transactions to fund acquisitions within target markets. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Grow our third-party management business &#160;&#8212; We intend to pursue additional third-party management opportunities. We intend to leverage our current platform to take advantage of consolidation in the industry. We plan to utilize our relationships with third-party owners to help source future acquisitions. 

&#160; 

Investment and Market Selection Process 

&#160; 

We maintain a disciplined and focused process in the acquisition and development of self-storage facilities. Our investment committee, comprised of five senior officers and led by Christopher P. Marr, our Chief Executive Officer, oversees our investment process. Our investment process involves six stages &#8212; identification, initial due diligence, economic assessment, investment committee approval (and when required, the approval of our Board of Trustees [the &#8220;Board&#8221;]), final due diligence, and documentation. Through our investment committee, we intend to focus on the following criteria: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Targeted markets &#160;&#8212; Our targeted markets include areas where we currently maintain management that can be extended to additional facilities, or where we believe that we can acquire a significant number of facilities efficiently and within a short period of time. We evaluate both the broader market and the immediate area, typically three miles around the facility, for its ability to support above-average demographic growth. We seek to increase our presence primarily in areas that we expect will experience growth, including the Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic areas of the United States and areas within Georgia, Florida, Texas, Illinois, and California, and to enter additional markets should suitable opportunities arise. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Quality of facility &#160;&#8212; We focus on self-storage facilities that have good visibility and are located near retail centers, which typically provide high traffic corridors and are generally located near residential communities and commercial customers. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Growth potential &#160;&#8212; We target acquisitions that offer growth potential through increased operating efficiencies and, in some cases, through additional leasing efforts, renovations, or expansions. In addition to acquiring single facilities, we seek to invest in 

&#160;

portfolio acquisitions, including those offering significant potential for increased operating efficiency and the ability to spread our fixed costs across a large base of facilities. 

&#160; 

Segment 

&#160; 

We have one reportable segment: we own, operate, develop, manage, and acquire self-storage facilities. 

&#160; 

Concentration 

&#160; 

Our self-storage facilities are located in major metropolitan areas as well as suburban areas and have numerous customers per facility. No single customer represented a significant concentration of our 2015 revenues. Our facilities in Florida, New York, Texas, and California provided approximately 18%, 16%, 10% and 8%, respectively , of our total 2015 revenues and approximately 17%, 17%, 10%, and 8%, respectively, of our total 2014 revenues. 

&#160; 

Seasonality 

&#160; 

We typically experience seasonal fluctuations in occupancy levels at our facilities, with the levels generally slightly higher during the summer months due to increased moving activity. 

&#160; 

Financing Strategy 

&#160; 

We maintain a capital structure that we believe is reasonable and prudent and that will enable us to have ample cash flow to cover debt service and make distributions to our shareholders. As of December 31, 2015 , our debt to total capitalization ratio (determined by dividing the carrying value of our total indebtedness by the sum of (a) the market value of the Parent Company&#8217;s outstanding common shares, preferred shares and units of the Operating Partnership held by third parties and (b) the carrying value of our total indebtedness) was approximately 18.7% compared to approximately 23.9% as of December 31, 2014 . Our ratio of debt to the undepreciated cost of our total assets as of December 31, 2015 was approximately 34 . 0 % compared to approximately 35.8% as of December 31, 2014 . We expect to finance additional investments in self-storage facilities through the most attractive sources of capital available at the time of the transaction, in a manner consistent with maintaining a strong financial position and future financial flexibility, subject to limitations on incurrence of indebtedness in our unsecured credit facilities and the indenture that governs our unsecured notes. These capital sources may include existing cash, borrowings under the Revolver, additional secured or unsecured financings, sales of common or preferred shares of the Parent Company in public offerings or private placements, additional issuances of debt securities, issuances of common or preferred units in our Operating Partnership in exchange for contributed facilities, and formations of joint ventures. We also may sell facilities that we no longer view as core assets and use the sales proceeds to fund other acquisitions. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

Self-storage facilities compete based on a number of factors, including location, rental rates, security, suitability of the facility&#8217;s design to prospective customers&#8217; needs, and the manner in which the facility is operated and marketed. In particular, the number of competing self-storage facilities in a market could have a material effect on our occupancy levels, rental rates and on the overall operating performance of our facilities. We believe that the primary competition for potential customers of any of our self-storage facilities comes from other self-storage facilities within a three-mile radius of that facility. We believe our facilities are well-positioned within their respective markets, and we emphasize customer service, convenience, security and professionalism. 

&#160; 

Our key competitors include local and regional operators as well as the other public self-storage REITS, including Public Storage, Sovran Self Storage, Inc., and Extra Space Storage Inc. These companies, some of which operate significantly more facilities than we do and have greater resources than we have, and other entities may be able to accept more risk than we determine is prudent for us, including risks with respect to the geographic proximity of facility investments and the payment of higher facility acquisition prices. This competition may reduce the number of suitable acquisition opportunities available to us, increase the price required to acquire facilities, and reduce the demand for self-storage space at our facilities. Nevertheless, we believe that our experience in operating, managing, acquiring, developing, and obtaining financing for self-storage facilities should enable us to compete effectively. 

&#160; 

Government Regulation 

&#160; 

We are subject to various laws, ordinances and regulations, including regulations relating to lien sale rights and procedures and various federal, state, and local regulations that apply generally to the ownership of real property and the operation of self-storage facilities. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and applicable state accessibility act laws (collectively, the &#8220;ADA&#8221;), all places of public accommodation are required to meet federal requirements related to physical access and use by disabled persons. A number of other federal, state, and local laws may also impose access and other similar requirements at our facilities. A failure to comply with the ADA or similar state or local requirements could result in the governmental imposition of fines or the award of damages to private litigants affected by the noncompliance. Although we believe that our facilities comply in all material respects with these requirements (or would be eligible for applicable exemptions from material requirements because of adaptive assistance provided), a determination that one or more of our facilities is not in compliance with the ADA or similar state or local requirements would result in the incurrence of additional costs associated with bringing the facilities into compliance. 

&#160; 

Under various federal, state, and local laws, ordinances and regulations, an owner or operator of real property may become liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous substances released on or in its property. These laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the release of such hazardous substances. The presence of hazardous substances, or the failure to properly remediate such substances, when released, may adversely affect the property owner&#8217;s ability to sell the real estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral, and may cause the property owner to incur substantial remediation costs. In addition to claims for cleanup costs, the presence of hazardous substances on a property could result in a claim by a private party for personal injury or a claim by an adjacent property owner or user for property damage. We may also become liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous substances stored at the facilities by a customer even though storage of hazardous substances would be without our knowledge or approval and in violation of the customer&#8217;s storage lease agreement with us. 

&#160; 

Our practice is to conduct or obtain environmental assessments in connection with the acquisition or development of facilities. Whenever the environmental assessment for one of our facilities indicates that a facility is impacted by soil or groundwater contamination from prior owners/operators or other sources, we work with our environmental consultants and, where appropriate, state governmental agencies, to ensure that the facility is either cleaned up, that no cleanup is necessary because the low level of contamination poses no significant risk to public health or the environment, or that the responsibility for cleanup rests with a third party. In certain cases, we have purchased environmental liability insurance coverage to indemnify us against claims for contamination or other adverse environmental conditions that may affect a property. 

&#160; 

We are not aware of any environmental cleanup liability that we believe will have a material adverse effect on us. We cannot provide assurance, however, that these environmental assessments and investigations have revealed or will reveal all potential environmental liabilities, that no prior owner created any material environmental condition not known to us or the independent consultant or that future events or changes in environmental laws will not result in the imposition of environmental liability on us. 

&#160; 

We have not received notice from any governmental authority of any material noncompliance, claim, or liability in connection with any of our facilities, nor have we been notified of a claim for personal injury or property damage by a private party in connection with any of our facilities relating to environmental conditions. 

&#160; 

We are not aware of any environmental condition with respect to any of our facilities that could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations, and we do not expect that the cost of compliance with environmental regulations will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. We cannot provide assurance, however, that this will continue to be the case. 

&#160; 

Insurance 

&#160; 

We carry comprehensive liability, fire, extended coverage, and rental loss insurance covering all of the facilities in our portfolio. We carry environmental insurance coverage on certain facilities in our portfolio. We believe the policy specifications and insured limits are appropriate and adequate given the relative risk of loss, the cost of the coverage, and industry practice. We do not carry insurance for losses such as loss from riots, war or acts of God, and, in some cases, environmental hazards, because such coverage is either not available or not available at commercially reasonable rates. Some of our policies, such as those covering losses due to terrorist activities, hurricanes, floods and earthquakes, are insured subject to limitations involving large deductibles or co-payments and policy limits that may not be sufficient to cover losses. We also carry liability insurance to insure against personal injuries that might be sustained at our facilities and director and officer liability insurance.
