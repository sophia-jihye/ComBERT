What is the Trust and the Trust Series? 

&#160;

The United States Commodity Index Funds Trust (the &#8220;Trust&#8221;) is a Delaware statutory trust formed on December 21, 2009. The Trust is a series trust formed pursuant to the Delaware Statutory Trust Act and is organized into three separate series (each series, a &#8220;Trust Series&#8221; and collectively, the &#8220;Trust Series&#8221;). As of December 31, 2015, the Trust includes the United States Commodity Index Fund (&#8220;USCI&#8221;), a commodity pool formed on April 1, 2010 and first made available to the public on August 10, 2010, the United States Copper Index Fund (&#8220;CPER&#8221;), a commodity pool formed on November 26, 2010 and first made available to the public on November 15, 2011 and the United States Agriculture Index Fund (&#8220;USAG&#8221;), a commodity pool formed on November 26, 2010 and first made available to the public on April 13, 2012.

&#160;

The Trust and Trust Series maintain their main business offices at 1999 Harrison Street, Suite 1530, Oakland, CA 94612. USCI, CPER and USAG each issues shares (&#8220;shares&#8221;) that may be purchased and sold on the NYSE Arca, Inc. (&#8220;NYSE Arca&#8221;). The Trust and each Trust Series operate pursuant to the terms of the Trust&#8217;s Third Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust and Trust Agreement dated as of March 22, 2013, as amended from time to time, (the &#8220;Trust Agreement&#8221;), which grants full management control to their sponsor, United States Commodity Funds LLC (&#8220;USCF&#8221;).

&#160; 

USCI&#8217;s Investment Objective 

&#160;

USCI invests in futures contracts for commodities that are currently traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange (the &#8220;NYMEX&#8221;), ICE Futures (&#8220;ICE Futures&#8221;), Chicago Board of Trade (&#8220;CBOT&#8221;), Chicago Mercantile Exchange (&#8220;CME&#8221;), London Metal Exchange (&#8220;LME&#8221;), Commodity Exchange, Inc. (&#8220;COMEX&#8221;) or on other foreign exchanges (the NYMEX, ICE Futures, CBOT, CME, LME, Comex and other foreign exchanges, collectively, the &#8220;Futures Exchanges&#8221;) (such futures contracts, collectively, &#8220;Futures Contracts&#8221;) and, to a lesser extent, in order to comply with regulatory requirements or in view of market conditions, other commodity-based contracts and instruments such as cash-settled options on Futures Contracts, forward contracts relating to commodities, cleared swap contracts and other nonexchange traded over-the-counter (&#8220;OTC&#8221;) transactions that are based on the price of commodities and Futures Contracts (collectively, &#8220;Other Commodity-Related Investments&#8221;). Market conditions that USCF currently anticipates could cause USCI to invest in Other Commodity Related Investments would be those allowing USCI to obtain greater liquidity or to execute transactions with more favorable pricing. Futures Contracts and Other Commodity-Related Investments collectively are referred to as &#8220;Commodity Interests.&#8221;

&#160;

The investment objective of USCI is for the daily changes in percentage terms of its shares&#8217; per share net asset value (&#8220;NAV&#8221;) to reflect the daily changes in percentage terms of the SummerHaven Dynamic Commodity Index Total Return SM (the &#8220;SDCI&#8221;), less USCI&#8217;s expenses. USCF does not intend to operate USCI in a fashion such that its per share NAV will equal, in dollar terms, the spot prices of the commodities underlying the Benchmark Component Futures Contracts (as defined below) that comprise the SDCI or the prices of any particular group of Futures Contracts. USCI will not seek to achieve its stated investment objective over a period of time greater than one day. USCI believes that it is not practical to manage the portfolio to achieve such an investment goal when investing in Futures Contracts and Other Commodity-Related Investments. The SDCI is designed to reflect the performance of a diversified group of commodities. The SDCI is comprised of 14 Futures Contracts that are selected on a monthly basis from a list of 27 possible Futures Contracts. The Futures Contracts that at any given time make up the SDCI are referred to herein as &#8220;Benchmark Component Futures Contracts.&#8221; The SDCI is owned and maintained by SummerHaven Index Management, LLC (&#8220;SHIM&#8221;) and calculated and published by Bloomberg, L.P. (&#8220;Bloomberg&#8221;). USCI invests first in the current Benchmark Component Futures Contracts and other Futures Contracts intended to replicate the return on the current Benchmark Component Futures Contracts and, thereafter may hold Futures Contracts in a particular commodity other than one specified as the Benchmark Component Futures Contract, or may hold Other Commodity-Related Investments that are intended to replicate the return on the Benchmark Futures Contracts, but may fail to closely track the SDCI&#8217;s total return movements. If USCI increases in size, and due to its obligations to comply with regulatory limits or due to other market pricing or liquidity factors, USCI may invest in Futures Contract months other than the designated month specified as the Benchmark Component Futures Contract, or in Other Commodity-Related Investments, which may have the effect of increasing transaction related expenses and may result in increased tracking error.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

USCI&#8217;s shares began trading on August 10, 2010. As of December 31, 2015, USCI held 723 Futures Contracts on the NYMEX, 4,650 Futures Contracts on the ICE Futures, 4,949 Futures Contracts on the CBOT, 1,148 Futures Contracts on the CME, 5,889 Futures Contracts on the LME and 886 Futures Contracts on the COMEX.

&#160; 

CPER&#8217;s Investment Objective 

&#160;

The investment objective of CPER is for the daily changes in percentage terms of its shares&#8217; per share NAV to reflect the daily changes in percentage terms of the SummerHaven Copper Index Total Return SM (the &#8220;SCI&#8221;), less CPER&#8217;s expenses. USCF does not intend to operate CPER in a fashion such that its per share NAV will equal, in dollar terms, the spot prices of the commodities underlying the Benchmark Component Copper Futures Contracts (as defined below) that comprise the SCI or the prices of any particular group of Futures Contracts. CPER will not seek to achieve a stated investment objective over a period of time greater than one day. USCF believes that it is not practical to manage the portfolio to achieve such an investment goal when investing in Futures Contracts and Other Copper-Related Investments (as defined below). The SCI is designed to reflect the performance of the investment returns from a portfolio of copper futures contracts. The SCI is owned and maintained by SHIM and calculated and published by the NYSE Arca. The SCI is comprised of either two or three Eligible Copper Futures Contracts that are selected on a monthly basis based on quantitative formulas relating to the prices of the Eligible Copper Futures Contracts developed by SHIM. The Eligible Copper Futures Contracts that at any given time make up the SCI are referred to herein as &#8220;Benchmark Component Copper Futures Contracts.&#8221;

&#160;

CPER seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing to the fullest extent possible in the Benchmark Component Copper Futures Contracts. Then, if constrained by regulatory requirements or in view of market conditions, CPER will invest next in other Eligible Copper Futures Contracts, and finally to a lesser extent, in other exchange traded futures contracts that are economically identical or substantially similar to the Benchmark Component Copper Futures Contracts if one or more other Eligible Copper Futures Contracts is not available. When CPER has invested to the fullest extent possible in exchange-traded futures contracts, CPER may then invest in other contracts and instruments based on the Benchmark Component Copper Futures Contracts, other Eligible Copper Futures Contracts or copper, such as cash-settled options, forward contracts, cleared swap contracts and swap contracts other than cleared swap contracts. Other exchange-traded futures contracts that are economically identical or substantially similar to the Benchmark Component Copper Futures Contracts and other contracts and instruments based on the Benchmark Component Copper Futures Contracts, are collectively referred to collectively as &#8220;Other Copper-Related Investments,&#8221; and together with Benchmark Component Copper Futures Contracts and other Eligible Copper Futures Contracts, &#8220;Copper Interests.&#8221;

&#160;

CPER&#8217;s shares began trading on November 15, 2011. As of December 31, 2015, CPER held 40 Futures Contracts on the COMEX.

&#160; 

USAG&#8217;s Investment Objective 

&#160;

The investment objective of USAG is for the daily changes in percentage terms of its shares&#8217; per share NAV to reflect the daily changes in percentage terms of the SummerHaven Dynamic Agriculture Index Total Return SM (the &#8220;SDAI&#8221;), less USAG&#8217;s expenses. USCF does not intend to operate USAG in a fashion such that its per share NAV will equal, in dollar terms, the spot prices of the commodities underlying the Benchmark Component Agriculture Futures Contracts (as defined below) that comprise the SDAI or the prices of any particular group of Futures Contracts. USAG will not seek to achieve its stated investment objective over a period of time greater than one day. USCF believes that it is not practical to manage the portfolio to achieve such an investment goal when investing in Futures Contracts and Other Agriculture-Related Investments (as defined below). The SDAI is designed to reflect the performance of a diversified group of agricultural commodities. The SDAI is owned and maintained by SHIM and calculated and published by the NYSE Arca. Futures contracts for the agricultural commodities comprising the SDAI are traded on ICE Future US, ICE Futures Canada, the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade (&#8220;KCBT&#8221;) and the CME and are collectively referred to herein as &#8220;Eligible Agriculture Futures Contracts.&#8221; The SDAI is comprised of 14 Eligible Agriculture Futures Contracts that are selected on a monthly basis based on quantitative formulas developed by SHIM. The Eligible Agriculture Futures Contracts that at any given time make up the SDAI are referred to herein as &#8220;Benchmark Component Agriculture Futures Contracts.&#8221; The relative weighting of the Benchmark Component Agriculture Futures Contracts will change on a monthly basis, based on quantitative formulas relating to the prices of the Benchmark Component Agriculture Futures Contracts developed by SHIM.

&#160;

&#160; 2 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

USAG seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing to the fullest extent possible in the Benchmark Component Agriculture Futures Contracts. Then, if constrained by regulatory requirements or in view of market conditions, USAG will invest next in other Eligible Agriculture Futures Contracts based on the same agricultural commodity as the futures contracts subject to such regulatory constraints or market conditions, and finally, to a lesser extent, in other exchange traded futures contracts that are economically identical or substantially similar to the Benchmark Component Agriculture Futures Contracts if one or more other Eligible Agriculture Futures Contracts is not available. When USAG has invested to the fullest extent possible in exchange-traded futures contracts, USAG may then invest in other contracts and instruments based on the Benchmark Component Agriculture Futures Contracts, other Eligible Agriculture Futures Contracts or the agricultural commodities included in the SDAI, such as cash-settled options, forward contracts, cleared swap contracts and swap contracts other than cleared swap contracts. Other exchange-traded futures contracts that are economically identical or substantially similar to the Benchmark Component Agriculture Futures Contracts and other contracts and instruments based on the Benchmark Component Agriculture Futures Contracts, as well as metals included in the SDAI, are collectively referred to as &#8220;Other Agriculture-Related Investments,&#8221; and together with Benchmark Component Agriculture Futures Contracts and other Eligible Agriculture Futures Contracts, &#8220;Agriculture Interests.&#8221;

&#160;

USAG&#8217;s shares began trading on April 13, 2012. As of December 31, 2015, USAG held 31 Futures Contracts on the ICE Futures, 35 Futures Contracts on the CBOT , 7 Futures Contracts on the CME and 2 Futures Contract on the KCBT.

USCF also pays the fees of ALPS Distributors, Inc., which serves as the marketing agent for each Trust Series (the &#8220;Marketing Agent&#8221; or &#8220;ALPS Distributors&#8221;), Brown Brothers Harriman &#38; Co. (&#8220;BBH&#38;Co.&#8221;), which serves as the administrator (the &#8220;Administrator&#8221;) and the custodian (the &#8220;Custodian&#8221;) for each Trust Series, and SummerHaven Investment Management, LLC (&#8220;SummerHaven&#8221;), which serves as the commodity trading advisor for USCI, CPER and USAG.

Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance &#8211; Audit Committee&#8221; in this annual report on Form 10-K.

&#160;

How Does Each Trust Series Operate? 

&#160;

An investment in the shares provides a means for diversifying an investor&#8217;s portfolio or hedging exposure to changes in commodities prices. An investment in the shares allows both retail and institutional investors to easily gain this exposure to the commodities market in a transparent, cost-effective manner.

&#160;

The investment objective of each Trust Series is for the daily changes in percentage terms of its per share NAV to reflect the daily changes in percentage terms of the Applicable Index, less each Trust Series expenses. USCF does not intend to operate any Trust Series in a fashion such that its per share NAV will equal, in dollar terms, the price of the Applicable Index or the price of any particular Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contract. USCF believes that it is not practical to manage each Trust Series&#8217; portfolio to achieve such an investment goal when investing in the Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contracts and Other Related Investments.

&#160; 

How USCI Seeks to Achieve Its Investment Objective. USCI seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing in a mix of Commodity Interests such that the daily changes in its&#8217; per share NAV will closely track the daily changes in the SDCI. USCI&#8217;s positions in Commodity Interests are rebalanced on a monthly basis in order to track the changing nature of the SDCI. The portfolio rebalancing takes place during the last four business days of the month (&#8220;Rebalancing Period&#8221;). At the end of each of the days in the Rebalancing Period, one fourth of the prior month portfolio positions are replaced by equally-weighted positions reflecting the particular Benchmark Component Futures Contracts determined on the selection date, which is the fifth business day before the end of the month (&#8220;USCI&#8217;s Selection Date&#8221;). At the end of the Rebalancing Period, the SDCI will have an equal-weight position of approximately 7.14% in each of the selected Benchmark Component Futures Contracts which will be reflected in the rebalanced portfolio. After fulfilling the collateral requirements with respect to its Commodity Interests, USCI invests the remainder of its proceeds from the sale of creation baskets in short-term obligations of the United States of two years or less (&#8220;Treasuries&#8221;) or cash equivalents, and/or merely holds such assets in cash (generally in interest-bearing accounts).

&#160; 

&#160; 4 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

How CPER Seeks to Achieve Its Investment Objective. &#160; CPER seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing to the fullest extent possible in the Benchmark Component Copper Futures Contracts. Then, if constrained by regulatory requirements or in view of market conditions, CPER will invest next in other Eligible Copper Futures Contracts, and finally to a lesser extent, in other exchange traded futures contracts that are economically identical or substantially similar to the Benchmark Component Copper Futures Contracts if one or more other Eligible Copper Futures Contracts is not available. When CPER has invested to the fullest extent possible in exchange-traded futures contracts, it may then invest in Other Copper-Related Investments. After fulfilling the collateral requirements with respect to its Copper Interests, CPER invests the remainder of its proceeds from the sale of creation baskets in Treasuries or cash equivalents, and/or merely holds such assets in cash (generally in interest-bearing accounts).

&#160; 

How USAG Seeks to Achieve Its Investment Objective. &#160; USAG seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing to the fullest extent possible in the Benchmark Component Agriculture Futures Contracts. Then, if constrained by regulatory requirements or in view of market conditions, USAG will invest next in other Eligible Agriculture Futures Contracts, and finally to a lesser extent, in other exchange traded futures contracts that are economically identical or substantially similar to the Benchmark Component Agriculture Futures Contracts if one or more other Eligible Agriculture Futures Contracts is not available. When USAG has invested to the fullest extent possible in exchange-traded futures contracts, it may then invest in Other Agriculture-Related Investments. After fulfilling the collateral requirements with respect to its Agriculture Interests, USAG will invest the remainder of its proceeds from the sale of creation baskets in Treasuries or cash equivalents, and/or merely hold such assets in cash (generally in interest-bearing accounts).

&#160;

The anticipated dates on which USCI, USAG and CPER&#8217;s positions in Applicable Interests will be rebalanced on a monthly basis are posted on such Trust Series&#8217; website www.unitedstatescommodityfunds.com, and are subject to change without notice.

&#160;

USCF employs a &#8220;neutral&#8221; investment strategy in order to track changes in the Applicable Index regardless of whether the Applicable Index goes up or goes down. A Trust Series&#8217; &#8220;neutral&#8221; investment strategy is designed to permit investors generally to purchase and sell a Trust Series&#8217; shares for the purpose of investing indirectly in the applicable commodities market in a cost-effective manner, and/or to permit participants in the applicable commodities or other industries to hedge the risk of losses in their applicable commodity-related transactions. Accordingly, depending on the investment objective of an individual investor, the risks generally associated with investing in the commodities market and/or the risks involved in hedging may exist. In addition, an investment in a Trust Series involves the risks that the daily changes in the price of the Trust Series&#8217; shares, in percentage terms, will not accurately track the daily changes in the Applicable Index, in percentage terms, and that daily changes in the Applicable Index, in percentage terms, will not closely correlate with daily changes in the spot prices of the applicable commodities underlying the Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contracts, in percentage terms.

&#160;

Each Trust Series&#8217; investment objective is for the daily changes in percentage terms of its per share NAV to reflect the daily changes in percentage terms of the Applicable Index, not to have the market price of its shares match, dollar for dollar, changes in the price of the Applicable Index or the applicable commodities underlying the Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contracts that make up the Applicable Index. Contango and backwardation may impact the total return on investment in shares of a Trust Series relative to a hypothetical direct investment in the commodities underlying the Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contracts that make up the Applicable Index and, in the future, it is likely that the relationship between the market prices of a Trust Series&#8217; shares and changes in the spot prices of the commodities underlying the Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contracts that make up the Applicable Index could be impacted by contango and backwardation. It is important to note that this comparison ignores the potential costs associated with physically owning and storing commodities, which could be substantial. For a more in-depth discussion of the impact of contango and backwardation, see &#8220; Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8221; in this annual report on Form 10-K.

&#160;

Furthermore, each Trust Series also purchases Treasuries and holds cash and/or cash equivalents to meet its current or potential margin or collateral requirements with respect to its investments in Applicable Interests and to hold cash not required to be used as margin or collateral. There is not expected to be any meaningful correlation between the performance of a Trust Series&#8217; investments in Treasuries, cash or cash equivalents and the changes in the prices of commodities or Applicable Interests. While the level of interest earned on or the market price of these investments may in some respect correlate to changes in the prices of commodities, this correlation is not anticipated as part of the Trust Series&#8217; efforts to meet its objective.

&#160;

&#160; 5 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

A Trust Series&#8217; total portfolio composition is disclosed on the applicable Trust Series&#8217; website on each business day that the NYSE Arca is open for trading. For a list of each of USCI&#8217;s, CPER&#8217;s and USAG&#8217;s current holdings, please see www.unitedstatescommodityfunds.com. The website disclosure of portfolio holdings for each Trust Series is made daily and includes, as applicable, the name and value of each Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contract, the specific types and values of Other Related Investments and characteristics of such Other Related Investments, the name and value of each Treasury and cash equivalent, and the amount of cash held in each Trust Series, as applicable. Each Trust Series&#8217; website is publicly accessible at no charge. Each Trust Series&#8217; assets used for margin and collateral are held in segregated accounts pursuant to the Commodity Exchange Act (the &#8220;CEA&#8221;) and CFTC regulations.

&#160;

The shares issued by a Trust Series may only be purchased by Authorized Participants and only in blocks of 50,000 shares called Creation Baskets through the Marketing Agent. The amount of the purchase payment for a Creation Basket is equal to the aggregate NAV of the shares in the Creation Basket. Similarly, only Authorized Participants may redeem shares and only in blocks of 50,000 shares called Redemption Baskets. The amount of the redemption proceeds for a Redemption Basket is equal to the aggregate NAV of shares in the Redemption Basket. The purchase price for Creation Baskets and the redemption price for Redemption Baskets are the actual per share NAV calculated at the end of the business day when a request for a purchase or redemption is received by the applicable Trust Series. The NYSE Arca publishes an approximate per share NAV intra-day based on the prior day&#8217;s per share NAV and the current price of the Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contracts, but the price of Creation Baskets and Redemption Baskets is determined based on the actual per share NAV calculated at the end of each trading day.

&#160;

While each Trust Series only issues shares in Creation Baskets, shares are listed on the NYSE Arca and investors may purchase and sell shares at market prices like any security.

&#160; 

What is the Investment Strategy for each Trust Series? 

&#160;

In managing a Trust Series&#8217; assets, USCF does not use a technical trading system that automatically issues buy and sell orders, other than to address monthly changes in the Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contracts, on a percentage basis. Instead, each time one or more baskets are purchased or redeemed, USCF will purchase or sell Applicable Interests with an aggregate market value that approximates the amount of Treasuries and/or cash received or paid upon the purchase or redemption of the basket(s).

&#160;

Each Trust Series endeavors to place trades in Applicable Interests and otherwise manage its investments so that &#8220;A&#8221; will be within plus/minus ten percent (10%) of &#8220;B&#8221;, where:

&#160;

&#160; &#8226; &#160; A is the average daily percentage change in such Trust Series&#8217; per share NAV for any period of 30 successive valuation days; i.e. , any NYSE Arca trading day as of which the Trust Series calculates its per share NAV; and 

&#160; &#8226; &#160; B is the average daily percentage change in the price of the Applicable Index over the same period. 

USCF believes that market arbitrage opportunities will cause the daily changes in each Trust Series&#8217; share price on the NYSE Arca on a percentage basis to closely track the daily changes in such Trust Series&#8217; per share NAV on a percentage basis. USCF believes that the net effect of this expected relationship and the expected relationship described above between a Trust Series&#8217; per share NAV and the Applicable Index will be that the daily changes in the price of a Trust Series&#8217; shares on the NYSE Arca on a percentage basis will closely track the daily changes in the Applicable Index on a percentage basis, less such Trust Series&#8217; expenses. While the Applicable Index is composed of Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contracts and is therefore a measure of the prices of the applicable commodities comprising the Applicable Index for future delivery, there is nonetheless expected to be a reasonable degree of correlation between the Applicable Index and the cash or spot prices of the commodities underlying the Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contracts.

&#160; 

&#160; 6 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Commodity Interests. &#160; The specific Commodity Interests purchased depend on various factors, including a judgment by USCF as to the appropriate diversification of USCI&#8217;s investments. While USCF has made significant investments in Benchmark Component Futures Contracts on the Futures Exchanges, for various reasons, including the ability to enter into the precise amount of exposure to the commodities market and position limits on Futures Contracts, it may also invest in economically equivalent Futures Contracts other than those that compose the Benchmark Component Futures Contracts and Other Commodity-Related Investments. To the extent that USCI invests in Other Related Investments, it would prioritize investments in contracts and instruments that are economically equivalent to the Benchmark Component Futures Contracts, including cleared swaps that satisfy such criteria, and then to a lesser extent, it would invest in other types of cleared swaps and other contracts, instruments and non-cleared swaps, such as swaps in the OTC market. If USCI is required by law or regulation, or by one of its regulators, including a Futures Exchange, to reduce its position in one or more Benchmark Component Futures Contracts to the applicable position limit or to a specified accountability level, a substantial portion of USCI&#8217;s assets could be invested in Other Commodity-Related Investments that are intended to replicate the return on the SDCI or particular Benchmark Component Futures Contracts. As USCI&#8217;s assets reach higher levels, USCI is more likely to exceed position limits, accountability levels or other regulatory limits and, as a result, it is more likely that it will invest in Other Commodity-Related Investments at such higher levels. In addition, market conditions that USCF currently anticipates could cause USCI to invest in Other Commodity-Related Investments include those allowing USCI to obtain greater liquidity or to execute transactions with more favorable pricing. See &#8220;Item 1. Business &#8211; Regulation&#8221; in this annual report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the potential impact of regulation on USCI&#8217;s ability to invest in OTC transactions and cleared swaps.

&#160;

Copper Interests. The specific Copper Interests purchased will depend on various factors, including a judgment by USCF as to the appropriate diversification of CPER&#8217;s investments. USCF anticipates, particularly while CPER has lesser amounts of assets, that it will make significant investments in Benchmark Component Copper Futures Contracts on the COMEX. In addition, for various reasons, including the ability to enter into the precise amount of exposure to the copper market or due to market conditions regarding liquidity or pricing of differing futures contracts, it may invest in other exchange-traded futures contracts that are economically identical or substantially similar to, the Benchmark Component Copper Futures Contracts. USCF further anticipates that as CPER grows larger, due to position limits on futures contracts or other regulatory requirements limiting CPER&#8217;s holdings, and market conditions, it may also invest in Other Copper-Related Investments. To the extent that CPER invests in Other Copper-Related Investments, it would prioritize investments in contracts and instruments that are economically equivalent to the Benchmark Component Copper Futures Contracts. In considering the use of Other Copper-Related Investments, USCF anticipates that it would first make use of swaps that clear through derivatives clearing organizations that satisfy CPER&#8217;s criteria if such swaps are available with respect to the Benchmark Component Copper Futures Contracts or the copper futures contracts included in the SCI. Then, and to a lesser extent, it would invest in other types of contracts, instruments and swaps, including uncleared swaps in the OTC market. If CPER is required by law or regulation, or by one of its regulators, including the COMEX, to reduce its position in one or more Benchmark Component Copper Futures Contracts to the applicable position limit or to a specified accountability level or if market conditions dictate it would be more appropriate to invest in Other Copper-Related Investments, a substantial portion of CPER&#8217;s assets could be invested in accordance with such priority in Other Copper-Related Investments that are intended to replicate the return on the SCI or particular Benchmark Component Copper Futures Contracts. As CPER&#8217;s assets reach higher levels, CPER is more likely to exceed position limits, accountability levels or other regulatory limits and, as a result, it is more likely that it will invest in accordance with such priority in Other Copper-Related Investments at such higher levels. In addition, market conditions that USCF currently anticipates could cause CPER to invest in Other Copper-Related Investments include those allowing CPER to obtain greater liquidity or to execute transactions with more favorable pricing. See &#8220;Item 1. Business &#8211; Regulation&#8221; in this annual report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the potential impact of regulation on CPER&#8217;s ability to invest in OTC transactions and cleared swaps.

&#160; 

Agriculture Interests. &#160; The specific Agriculture Interests purchased will depend on various factors, including a judgment by USCF as to the appropriate diversification of USAG&#8217;s investments. USCF anticipates, particularly while USAG has lesser amounts of assets, that it will make significant investments in Benchmark Component Agriculture Futures Contracts on ICE Futures US, ICE Futures Canada, CBOT, KCBT and the CME. In addition, for various reasons, including the ability to enter into the precise amount of exposure to the agricultural commodities market or due to market conditions regarding liquidity or pricing of differing futures contracts, it may invest in other exchange-traded futures contracts that are economically identical or substantially similar to, the Benchmark Component Agriculture Futures Contracts. USCF further anticipates that as USAG grows larger, due to position limits on futures contracts or other regulatory requirements limiting USAG&#8217;s holdings, and market conditions, it may also invest in Other Agriculture-Related Investments. To the extent that USAG invests in Other Agriculture-Related Investments, it would prioritize investments in contracts and instruments that are economically equivalent to the Benchmark Component Agriculture Futures Contracts. In considering the use of Other Agriculture-Related Investments, USCF anticipates that it would first make use of swaps that clear through derivatives clearing organizations that satisfy USAG&#8217;s criteria if such swaps are available with respect to the Benchmark Component Agriculture Futures Contracts or the agricultural commodity futures contracts included in the SDAI. Then, and to a lesser extent, it would invest in other types of contracts, instruments and swaps, including uncleared swaps in the OTC market. If USAG is required by law or regulation, or by one of its regulators, including ICE Futures US, ICE Futures Canada, CBOT, KCBT or the CME, to reduce its position in one or more Benchmark Component Agriculture Futures Contracts to the applicable position limit or to a specified accountability level or if market conditions dictate it would be more appropriate to invest in Other Agriculture-Related Investments, a substantial portion of the USAG&#8217;s assets could be invested in accordance with such priority in Other Agriculture-Related Investments that are intended to replicate the return on the SDAI or particular Benchmark Component Agriculture Futures Contracts. As the USAG&#8217;s assets reach higher levels, USAG is more likely to exceed position limits, accountability levels or other regulatory limits and, as a result, it is more likely that it will invest in accordance with such priority in Other Agriculture-Related Investments at such higher levels. In addition, market conditions that USCF currently anticipates could cause USAG to invest in Other Agriculture-Related Investments include those allowing USAG to obtain greater liquidity or to execute transactions with more favorable pricing. See &#8220;Item 1. Regulation&#8221; in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the potential impact of regulation on USAG&#8217;s ability to invest in OTC transactions and cleared swaps.

&#160;

USCF may not be able to fully invest a Trust Series&#8217; assets in Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contracts having an aggregate notional amount exactly equal to that Trust Series&#8217; NAV. For example, as standardized contracts, the Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contracts included in an Applicable Index are for a specified amount of a particular commodity, and the applicable Trust Series&#8217; NAV and the proceeds from the sale of a Creation Basket in a particular Trust Series is unlikely to be an exact multiple of the amounts of those contracts. As a result, in such circumstances, a Trust Series may be better able to achieve the exact amount of exposure to changes in price of the Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contracts through the use of Other Related Investments, such as OTC contracts that have better correlation with changes in price of the Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contracts.

&#160;

Each Trust Series anticipates that, to the extent it invests in Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contracts other than the Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contracts and Other Related Investments that are not economically equivalent to the Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contracts, it will enter into various non-exchange-traded derivative contracts to hedge the short-term price movements of such Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contracts and Other Related Investments against the current Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contracts.

&#160;

USCF does not anticipate letting its Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contracts expire and taking delivery of any commodities. Instead, USCF closes existing positions, e.g. , in response to ongoing changes in the Applicable Index or if it otherwise determines it would be appropriate to do so and reinvests the proceeds in new Applicable Interests. Positions may also be closed out to meet orders for Redemption Baskets, in which case the proceeds from closing the positions will not be reinvested.

&#160;

The Trust Agreement contains no restrictions on the ability of USCF to change the investment objective of any Trust Series. Notwithstanding this, USCF has no intention of changing the investment objective of any Trust Series or the manner in which it intends to achieve its investment objective. Should USCF seek to change the investment objective of a Trust Series, such change would be reflected in an amended prospectus and would provide advance notice to investors.

&#160;

What are Futures Contracts? 

&#160;

Futures contracts are agreements between two parties. One party agrees to buy a commodity such as natural gas or copper from the other party at a later date at a price and quantity agreed-upon when the contract is made. Generally, futures contracts traded on the NYMEX and the COMEX are priced by floor brokers and other exchange members both through an &#8220;open outcry&#8221; of offers to purchase or sell the contracts and through an electronic, screen-based system that determines the price by matching electronically offers to purchase and sell. Futures contracts may also be based on commodity indices, in that they call for a cash payment based on the change in the value of the specified index during a specified period. Additional risks of investing in futures contracts are included in &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8221; in this annual report on Form 10-K.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Impact of Accountability Levels, Position Limits and Price Fluctuation Limits . Futures contracts include typical and significant characteristics. Most significantly, the CFTC and U.S. designated contract markets such as the NYMEX, COMEX, CME, and CBOT have established accountability levels and position limits on the maximum net long or net short futures contracts in commodity interests that any person or group of persons under common trading control (other than as a hedge, which is not applicable to the Trust Series&#8217; investments) may hold, own or control. The net position is the difference between an individual or firm&#8217;s open long contracts and open short contracts in any one commodity. In addition, most U.S.-based futures exchanges limit the daily price fluctuation for futures contracts. Currently, the ICE Futures imposes position and accountability limits that are similar to those imposed by U.S.-based futures exchanges and also limits the maximum daily price fluctuation, while some other non-U.S. futures exchanges have not adopted such limits.

&#160;

The accountability levels for the commodities comprising an Applicable Index and other futures contracts traded on U.S.-based futures exchanges are not a fixed ceiling, but rather a threshold above which such exchanges may exercise greater scrutiny and control over an investor&#8217;s positions. As of December 31, 2015, USCI held 723 Futures Contracts on the NYMEX, 4,650 Futures Contracts on the ICE Futures, 4,949 Futures Contracts on the CBOT, 1,148 Futures Contracts on the CME, 5,889 Futures Contracts on the LME and 886 Futures Contracts on the COMEX. CPER held 40 Futures Contracts on the COMEX. USAG held 31 Futures Contracts on the ICE Futures, 35 Futures Contracts on the CBOT, 7 Futures Contracts on the CME and 2 Futures Contract on the KCBT. No Trust Series exceeded accountability levels imposed by the NYMEX, COMEX, CME, CBOT, KCBT or ICE Futures.

&#160;

Position limits differ from accountability levels in that they represent fixed limits on the maximum number of futures contracts that any person may hold and cannot allow such limits to be exceeded without express CFTC authority to do so. In addition to accountability levels and position limits that may apply at any time, the Futures Exchanges may impose position limits on contracts held in the last few days of trading in the near month contract to expire. It is unlikely that a Trust Series will run up against such position limits. A Trust Series does not typically hold the near month contract in its Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contracts. In addition, each Trust Series&#8217; investment strategy is to close out its positions during each Rebalancing Period in advance of the period right before expiration and purchase new contracts. As such, none of the Trust Series anticipates that position limits that apply to the last few days prior to a contract&#8217;s expiration will impact it. For the year ended December 31, 2015, no Trust Series exceeded position limits imposed by the NYMEX, COMEX, CME, CBOT, KCBT or ICE Futures.

&#160;

The CFTC has proposed to adopt limits on speculative positions in 28 physical commodity futures and option contracts and swaps that are economically equivalent to such contracts in the agriculture, energy and metals markets and rules addressing the circumstances under which market participants would be required to aggregate their positions with other persons under common ownership or control (the &#8220;Position Limit Rules&#8221;). The Position Limit Rules would, among other things: identify which contracts are subject to speculative position limits; set thresholds that restrict the number of speculative positions that a person may hold in a spot month, individual month, and all months combined; create an exemption for positions that constitute bona fide hedging transactions; impose responsibilities on designated contract markets (&#8220;DCMs&#8221;) and swap execution facilities (&#8220;SEFs&#8221;) to establish position limits or, in some cases, position accountability rules; and apply to both futures and swaps across four relevant venues: OTC, DCMs, SEFs as well as non-U.S. located platforms. The CFTC&#8217;s first attempt at finalizing the Position Limit Rules, in 2011, was successfully challenged by market participants in 2012 and, since then, the CFTC has re-proposed them and solicited comments from market participants multiple times.

&#160;

Until such time as the Position Limit Rules are adopted, the regulatory architecture in effect prior to the adoption of the Position Limit Rules will govern transactions in commodities and related derivatives (collectively, &#8220;Referenced Contracts&#8221;). Under that system, the CFTC enforces federal limits on speculation in agricultural products (e.g., corn, wheat and soy), while futures exchanges enforce position limits and accountability levels for agricultural and certain energy products (e.g., oil and natural gas). As a result, a Trust Series may be limited with respect to the size of its investments in any commodities subject to these limits. Finally, subject to certain narrow exceptions, the Position Limit Rules require the aggregation, for purposes of the position limits, of all positions in the 28 Referenced Contracts held by a single entity and its affiliates, regardless of whether such position existed on U.S. futures exchanges, non-U.S. futures exchanges, in cleared swaps or in OTC swaps. Under the CFTC&#8217;s existing position limits requirements and the Position Limit Rules, a market participant is generally required to aggregate all positions for which that participant controls the trading decisions with all positions for which that participant has a 10 percent or greater ownership interest in an account or position, as well as the positions of two or more persons acting pursuant to an express or implied agreement or understanding. At this time, it is unclear how the Position Limit Rules may affect the Trust Series, but the effect may be substantial and adverse. By way of example, the Position Limit Rules may negatively impact the ability of a Trust Series to meet its investment objectives through limits that may inhibit USCF&#8217;s ability to sell additional Creation Baskets of a Trust Series. See &#8220; The Commodity Interest Markets &#8211; Regulation&#8221; in this annual report on Form 10-K for additional information.

&#160;

&#160;

Price Volatility . The price volatility of futures contracts generally has been historically greater than that for traditional securities such as stocks and bonds. Price volatility often is greater day-to-day as opposed to intra-day. Because each Trust Series invests a significant portion of its assets in futures contracts, the assets of each Trust Series, and therefore the price of each Trust Series&#8217; shares, may be subject to greater volatility than traditional securities.

&#160; 

Marking-to-Market Futures Positions . Futures contracts are marked to market at the end of each trading day and the margin required with respect to such contracts is adjusted accordingly. This process of marking-to-market is designed to prevent losses from accumulating in any futures account. Therefore, if a Trust Series&#8217; futures positions have declined in value, such Trust Series may be required to post variation margin to cover this decline. Alternatively, if a Trust Series&#8217; futures positions have increased in value, this increase will be credited to such Trust Series&#8217; account.

&#160; 

What is the SDCI? 

&#160;

The SDCI was developed based upon academic research by Yale University professors Gary B. Gorton and K. Geert Rouwenhorst, and Hitotsubashi University professor Fumio Hayashi. The SDCI is designed to reflect the performance of a fully margined or collateralized portfolio of 14 commodity futures contracts with equal weights, selected each month from a universe of 27 eligible commodity futures contracts. The SDCI is rules-based and rebalanced monthly based on observable price signals. In this context, the term &#8220;rules-based&#8221; is meant to indicate that the composition of the SDCI in any given month will be determined by quantitative formulas relating to the prices of the futures contracts that relate to the commodities that are eligible to be included in the SDCI. Such formulas are not subject to adjustment based on other factors. The overall return on the SDCI is generated by two components: (i) uncollateralized returns from the commodity futures contracts comprising the SDCI and (ii) a daily fixed income return reflecting the interest earned on a hypothetical 3-month U.S. Treasury Bill collateral portfolio, calculated using the weekly auction rate for the 3-Month U.S. Treasury Bills published by the U.S. Department of the Treasury. SHIM is the owner of the SDCI.

&#160;

The SDCI is composed of physical non-financial commodity futures contracts with active and liquid markets traded upon futures exchanges in major industrialized countries. The futures contracts are denominated in U.S. dollars and weighted equally by notional amount. The SDCI currently reflects commodities in six commodity sectors: energy ( e.g. , crude oil, natural gas, heating oil, etc.), precious metals ( e.g. , gold, silver platinum), industrial metals ( e.g. , zinc, nickel, aluminum, copper, etc.), grains ( e.g. , wheat, corn, soybeans, etc.), softs ( e.g. , sugar, cotton, coffee, cocoa), and livestock ( e.g. , live cattle, lean hogs, feeder cattle).

&#160;

Table 1 below lists the eligible commodities, the relevant futures exchange on which the futures contract is listed and quotation details. Table 2 lists the eligible futures contracts, their sector designation and maximum allowable tenor.

&#160;

&#160;

Prior to the end of each month, SHIM determines the composition of the SDCI and provides such information to Bloomberg. Values of the SDCI are computed by Bloomberg and disseminated approximately every fifteen (15) seconds from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, which also publishes a daily SDCI value at approximately 5:30 p.m., New York City time, under the index ticker symbol &#8220;SDCITR:IND.&#8221; Only settlement and last-sale prices are used in the SDCI&#8217;s calculation, bids and offers are not recognized &#8212; including limit-bid and limit-offer price quotes. Where no last-sale price exists, typically in the more deferred contract months, the previous days&#8217; settlement price is used. This means that the underlying SDCI may lag its theoretical value. This tendency to lag is evident at the end of the day when the SDCI value is based on the settlement prices of the Benchmark Component Futures Contracts, and explains why the underlying SDCI often closes at or near the high or low for the day.

&#160; 

Composition of the SDCI 

&#160;

The composition of the SDCI on any given day, as determined and published by SHIM, is determinative of the benchmark for USCI. However, it is not possible to anticipate all possible circumstances and events that may occur with respect to the SDCI and the methodology for its composition, weighting and calculation. Accordingly, a number of subjective judgments must be made in connection with the operation of the SDCI that cannot be adequately reflected in this description of the SDCI. All questions of interpretation with respect to the application of the provisions of the SDCI methodology, including any determinations that need to be made in the event of a market emergency or other extraordinary circumstances, will be resolved by SHIM.

&#160;

Contract Expirations 

&#160;

Because the SDCI is comprised of actively traded contracts with scheduled expirations, it can be calculated only by reference to the prices of contracts for specified expiration, delivery or settlement periods, referred to as contract expirations. The contract expirations included in the SDCI for each commodity during a given year are designated by SHIM, provided that each contract must be an active contract. An active contract for this purpose is a liquid, actively-traded contract expiration, as defined or identified by the relevant trading facility or, if no such definition or identification is provided by the relevant trading facility, as defined by standard custom and practice in the industry.

&#160;

If a Futures Exchange ceases trading in all contract expirations relating to a particular Futures Contract, SHIM may designate a replacement contract on the commodity. The replacement contract must satisfy the eligibility criteria for inclusion in the SDCI. To the extent practicable, the replacement is effected during the next monthly review of the composition of the SDCI. If that timing is not practicable, SHIM determines the date of the replacement based on a number of factors, including the differences between the existing Futures Contract and the replacement Futures Contract with respect to contractual specifications and contract expirations.

&#160;

If a contract is eliminated and there is no replacement contract, the underlying commodity will necessarily be dropped from the SDCI. The designation of a replacement contract, or the elimination of a commodity from the SDCI because of the absence of a replacement contract, could affect the value of the SDCI, either positively or negatively, depending on the price of the contract that is eliminated and the prices of the remaining contracts. It is impossible, however, to predict the effect of these changes, if they occur, on the value of the SDCI.

&#160; 

Commodity Selection 

&#160;

Fourteen of the 27 eligible Futures Contracts are selected for inclusion in the SDCI for the next month, subject to the constraint that each of the six commodity sectors is represented by at least one commodity. The methodology used to select the 14 Futures Contracts is based solely on quantitative data using observable futures prices and is not subject to human bias.

&#160;

Monthly commodity selection is a two-step process based upon examination of the relevant futures prices for each commodity:

&#160;

&#160; 12 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

1) The annualized percentage price difference between the closest-to-expiration Futures Contract and the next closest-to-expiration Futures Contract is calculated for each of the 27 eligible Futures Contracts on USCI&#8217;s Selection Date. The seven commodities with the highest percentage price difference are selected.

&#160;

2) For the remaining 20 eligible commodities, the percentage price change of each commodity over the previous year is calculated, as measured by the change in the price of the closest-to-expiration Futures Contract on the Selection Date from the price of the closest-to-expiration Futures Contract a year prior to USCI&#8217;s Selection Date. The seven commodities with the highest percentage price change are selected.

&#160;

When evaluating the data from the second step, all six commodity sectors must be represented. If the selection of the seven additional commodities with the highest price change fails to meet the overall diversification requirement that all six commodity sectors are represented in the SDCI, the commodity with the highest price change among the commodities of the omitted sector(s) would be substituted for the commodity with the lowest price change among the seven additional commodities.

&#160;

The 14 commodities selected are included in the SDCI for the next month on an equally-weighted basis. Due to the dynamic monthly commodity selection, the sector weights will vary from approximately 7% to 43% over time, depending on the price observations each month. USCI&#8217;s Selection Date for the SDCI is the fifth business day prior to the first business day of the next calendar month.

&#160;

The following graph shows the sector weights of the commodities selected for inclusion in the SDCI as of December 31, 2015.

For each commodity selected for inclusion into the SDCI for a particular month, the SDCI selects a specific Futures Contract with a tenor ( i.e. , contract month) among the eligible tenors (the range of contract months) based upon the relative prices of the Futures Contracts within the eligible range of contract months. The previous notwithstanding, the contract expiration is not changed for such month if a contract remains in the SDCI, as long as the contract does not expire or enter its notice period in the subsequent month.

&#160; 

&#160; 13 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Portfolio Construction 

&#160;

The portfolio rebalancing takes place during the Rebalancing Period. At the end of each of the days in the Rebalancing Period, one fourth of the prior month portfolio positions are replaced by an equally-weighted position in the commodity contracts determined on USCI&#8217;s Selection Date. At the end of the Rebalancing Period, the SDCI takes an equal-weight position of approximately 7.14% in each of the selected commodity contracts.

&#160; 

SDCI Total Return Calculation 

&#160;

The value of the SDCI on any business day is equal to the product of (i) the value of the SDCI on the immediately preceding business day multiplied by (ii) one plus the sum of the day&#8217;s returns for another version of the SDCI known as the SummerHaven Dynamic Commodity Index Excess Return (&#8220;SDCI ER&#8221;) (explained below) and one business day&#8217;s interest from hypothetical Treasuries. The value of the SDCI is calculated and published by Bloomberg.

&#160; 

SDCI Base Level 

&#160;

The SDCI was set to 100 on January 2, 1991.

&#160;

SDCI ER Calculation 

&#160;

The total return of the SDCI ER reflects the percentage change of the market values of the underlying commodity futures. During the Rebalancing Period, the SDCI changes its contract holdings during a four day period. The value of the SDCI ER at the end of a business day &#8220; t &#8221; is equal to the SDCI ER value on day &#8220; t -1&#8221; multiplied by the sum of the daily percentage price changes of each commodity future factoring in each respective commodity future&#8217;s notional holding on day &#8220; t -1&#8221;.

&#160; 

Rebalancing Period 

&#160;

During the Rebalancing Period, existing positions are replaced by new positions based on the signals used for contract selection as outlined above. At the end of the first day of the Rebalancing Period, the signals are observed and on the second day a new portfolio is constructed that is equally weighted in terms of notional positions in the newly selected contracts.

&#160; 

What is the SCI? 

&#160;

The SCI is a single-commodity index designed to be an investment benchmark for copper as an asset class. The SCI is composed of copper futures contracts on the COMEX exchange. The SCI attempts to maximize backwardation and minimize contango while utilizing contracts in liquid portions of the futures curve.

&#160;

The SCI is rules-based and is rebalanced monthly based on observable price signals described below in the section &#8220;Contract Selection and Weighting.&#8221; In this context, the term &#8220;rules-based&#8221; is meant to indicate that the composition of the SCI in any given month will be determined by quantitative formulas relating to the prices of the futures contracts that are included in the SCI. Such formulas are not subject to adjustment based on other factors.

&#160;

The overall return on the SCI is generated by two components: (i) uncollateralized returns from the Benchmark Component Copper Futures Contracts comprising the SCI, and (ii) a daily fixed income return reflecting the interest earned on hypothetical 3-month Treasuries, calculated using the weekly auction rate for 3-Month Treasuries published by the U.S. Department of the Treasury. SHIM is the owner of the SCI.

Prior to the end of each month, SHIM determines the composition of the SCI and provides such information to the NYSE Arca. Values of the SCI are computed by the NYSE Arca and disseminated approximately every fifteen (15) seconds from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, which also publishes a daily SCI value at approximately 5:30 p.m., New York City time, under the index ticker symbol &#8220;SCI.&#8221; Only settlement and last-sale prices are used in the SCI&#8217;s calculation, bids and offers are not recognized &#8212; including limit-bid and limit-offer price quotes. Where no last-sale price exists, typically in the more deferred contract months, the previous days&#8217; settlement price is used. This means that the underlying SCI may lag its theoretical value. This tendency to lag is evident at the end of the day when the SCI value is based on the settlement prices of the Benchmark Component Copper Futures Contracts, and explains why the underlying SCI often closes at or near the high or low for the day.

&#160; 

Composition of the SCI 

&#160;

The composition of the SCI on any given day, as determined and published by SHIM, is determinative of the benchmark for CPER. Neither the index methodology for the SCI nor any set of procedures, however, are capable of anticipating all possible circumstances and events that may occur with respect to the SCI and the methodology for its composition, weighting and calculation. Accordingly, a number of subjective judgments must be made in connection with the operation of the SCI that cannot be adequately reflected in this description of the SCI. All questions of interpretation with respect to the application of the provisions of the index methodology for the SCI, including any determinations that need to be made in the event of a market emergency or other extraordinary circumstances, will be resolved by SHIM.

&#160; 

Contract Expirations 

&#160;

Because the SCI is comprised of actively traded contracts with scheduled expirations, it can be calculated only by reference to the prices of contracts for specified expiration, delivery or settlement periods, referred to as contract expirations. The contract expirations included in the SCI for each commodity during a given year are designated by SHIM, provided that each contract must be an active contract. An active contract for this purpose is a liquid, actively-traded contract expiration, as defined or identified by the relevant trading facility or, if no such definition or identification is provided by the relevant trading facility, as defined by standard custom and practice in the industry.

&#160;

If a futures exchange, such as the COMEX, ceases trading in all contract expirations relating to an Eligible Copper Futures Contract, SHIM may designate a replacement contract. The replacement contract must satisfy the eligibility criteria for inclusion in the SCI. To the extent practicable, the replacement will be effected during the next monthly review of the composition of the SCI. If that timing is not practicable, SHIM will determine the date of the replacement based on a number of factors, including the differences between the existing Benchmark Component Copper Futures Contract and the replacement contract with respect to contractual specifications and contract expirations.

&#160;

The designation of a replacement contract could affect the value of the SCI, either positively or negatively, depending on the price of the contract that is eliminated and the prices of the replacement contract. It is impossible, however, to predict the effect of these changes, if they occur, on the value of the SCI.

&#160; 

Contract Selection and Weighting 

&#160;

Weights for each of the Benchmark Component Copper Futures Contracts are determined for the next month. The methodology used to calculate the SCI weighting is based solely on quantitative data using observable futures prices and is not subject to human bias.

&#160;

&#160; 15 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

The monthly weighting selection is a process based upon examination of the relevant futures prices for copper:

&#160;

1) On CPER&#8217;s Selection Date (&#8220;CPER&#8217;s Selection Date&#8221;):

&#160;

&#160; a) the copper futures curve is assessed to be in either backwardation or contango (as discussed below); and 

&#160; b) the annualized percentage price difference between the Closest-to-Expiration Eligible Copper Futures Contract and each of the Next Four Eligible Copper Futures Contracts is calculated. For each month, the Closest-to-Expiration Eligible Copper Futures Contract and the Next Four Eligible Copper Futures Contracts are as follows: 

Month &#160; January &#160; February &#160; March &#160; April &#160; May &#160; June &#160; July &#160; August &#160; September &#160; October &#160; November &#160; December &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Closest-to-Expiration Eligible Futures Contract &#160; February &#160; March &#160; April &#160; May &#160; June &#160; July &#160; August &#160; September &#160; October &#160; November &#160; December &#160; January &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Next Four Eligible Futures Contracts &#160; April &#160; May &#160; June &#160; July &#160; August &#160; September &#160; October &#160; November &#160; December &#160; January &#160; February &#160; March &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; May &#160; June &#160; July &#160; August &#160; September &#160; October &#160; November &#160; December &#160; January &#160; February &#160; March &#160; April &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; June &#160; July &#160; August &#160; September &#160; October &#160; November &#160; December &#160; January &#160; February &#160; March &#160; April &#160; May &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; July &#160; August &#160; September &#160; October &#160; November &#160; December &#160; January &#160; February &#160; March &#160; April &#160; May &#160; June &#160;

A futures curve in backwardation occurs when the price of the closest-to-expiration contract is greater than or equal to the price of the third closest-to-expiration contract. These contracts will have expirations that are approximately two months apart. A curve not in backwardation is defined as being in contango, which occurs when the price of the closest-to-expiration contract is less than the price of the third closest-to-expiration contract.

&#160;

2a) Backwardation: If the copper futures curve is in backwardation on the Selection Date, the SCI takes positions in the two Eligible Copper Futures Contracts with the highest annualized percentage price difference, each weighted at 50%.

&#160;

A hypothetical example is included below, with the two selected Eligible Copper Futures Contracts shaded below (the selected commodities are ranked 1 and 2):

&#160;

2b) Contango: If the copper futures curve is in contango, then the SCI takes positions in three Eligible Copper Futures Contracts, as follows: first, the SCI takes positions in the two Eligible Copper Futures Contracts with the highest annualized percentage price difference, each weighted at 25%; then, the SCI also takes a position in the closest-to-expiration December Eligible Future Contract that has expiration more distant than the fourth of the Next Four Eligible Copper Futures Contracts for the applicable month, which position is weighted at 50%.

Due to the dynamic monthly weighting calculation, the individual weights will vary-over time, depending on the price observations each month. CPER&#8217;s Selection Date for the SCI is the last business day of the calendar month.

&#160;

The following graph shows the weights of the Benchmark Component Copper Futures Contracts selected for inclusion in the SCI as of December 31, 2015.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Portfolio Construction 

&#160;

The portfolio rebalancing takes place during the Rebalancing Period. At the end of each of the days in the Rebalancing Period one fourth of the prior month portfolio positions are replaced by the new weights for the Benchmark Component Copper Futures Contracts determined on CPER&#8217;s Selection Date.

&#160; 

SCI Total Return Calculation 

&#160;

The value of the SCI on any business day is equal to the product of (i) the value of the SCI on the immediately preceding business day multiplied by (ii) one plus the sum of the day&#8217;s returns for another version of the SCI known as the SummerHaven Dynamic Copper Index Excess Return (&#8220;SCI ER&#8221;) (explained below) and one business day&#8217;s interest from the hypothetical Treasury Bill portfolio. The value of the SCI will be calculated and published by the NYSE Arca.

&#160; 

SCI Base Level 

&#160;

The SCI was set to 100 on January 2, 1991.

&#160; 

SCI ER Calculation 

&#160;

The total return of the SCI ER reflects the percentage change of the market values of the underlying commodity futures. During the Rebalancing Period, the SCI changes its contract holdings and weightings during a four day period. The value of the SCI ER at the end of a business day &#8220; t &#8221; is equal to the SCI ER value on day &#8220; t -1&#8221; multiplied by the sum of the daily percentage price changes of each commodity future factoring in each respective commodity future&#8217;s notional holding on day &#8220; t -1&#8221;.

&#160; 

Rebalancing Period 

&#160;

The SCI is rebalanced during the first 4 business days of each calendar month, when existing positions are placed by new positions and weightings based on the signals used for contract selection on the last business day of the prior calendar month as outlined above.

&#160; 

What is the SDAI? 

&#160;

The SDAI is an agricultural sector index designed to broadly represent major agricultural commodities while overweighting the components that are assessed to be in a low inventory state and underweighting the components assessed to be in a high inventory state.

&#160;

The SDAI consists of fourteen agricultural markets: soybeans, corn, soft red winter wheat, hard red winter wheat, soybean oil, soybean meal, canola, sugar, cocoa, coffee, cotton, live cattle, feeder cattle and lean hogs. Each agricultural commodity is assigned a base weight based on an assessment of market liquidity and the commodity&#8217;s overall economic importance. Each commodity is U.S. dollar based, with the exception of canola, which is quoted in Canadian dollars and converted to U.S. dollars for the purpose of the SDAI calculation.

&#160;

Academic research by Professors Gorton, Rouwenhorst and Hayashi has shown that commodities in relatively low inventory states tend to have higher returns than commodities in relatively high inventory states. Furthermore, relative inventory comparisons can be estimated by the price-based signals momentum and basis. Momentum is the percentage price change in a commodity over the previous year. Basis is the annualized percentage difference between the nearest-to-maturity contract and the second nearest-to-maturity contract. Using these price-based signals, agricultural commodities determined to be in low inventory state will be weighted more heavily, and agricultural commodities in high inventory state will be weighted less heavily during any given month.

&#160;

The SDAI is rules-based and rebalanced monthly based on observable price signals described above. In this context, the term &#8220;rules-based&#8221; is meant to indicate that the composition of the SDAI in any given month will be determined by quantitative formulas relating to the prices of the futures contracts that relate to the commodities that are included in the SDAI. Such formulas are not subject to adjustment based on other factors.

&#160;

The overall return on the SDAI is generated by two components: (i) uncollateralized returns from the Benchmark Component Agriculture Futures Contracts comprising the SDAI and (ii) a daily fixed income return reflecting the interest earned on a hypothetical 3-month U.S. Treasury Bill collateral portfolio, calculated using the weekly auction rate for the 3-Month U.S. Treasury Bills published by the U.S Department of the Treasury. SHIM is the owner of the SDAI.

Prior to the end of each month, SHIM determines the composition of the SDAI and provides such information to the NYSE Arca. Values of the SDAI are computed by the NYSE Arca and disseminated approximately every fifteen (15) seconds from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, which also publishes a daily SDAI value at approximately 5:30 p.m., New York City time, under the index ticker symbol &#8220;SDAITR&#8221;. Only settlement and last-sale prices are used in the SDAI&#8217;s calculation, bids and offers are not recognized; including limit-bid and limit-offer price quotes. Where no last-sale price exists, typically in the more deferred contract months, the previous days&#8217; settlement price is used. This means that the underlying SDAI may lag its theoretical value. This tendency to lag is evident at the end of the day when the SDAI value is based on the settlement prices of the Benchmark Component Agriculture Futures Contracts, and explains why the underlying SDAI often closes at or near the high or low for the day.

Currency Conversion 

&#160;

Canola seed futures trade on the ICE Futures Canada and are denominated in Canadian dollars. Canola futures prices are divided by the USD/CAD foreign exchange spot price for purposes of index calculation and commodity weighting calculations. The USD/CAD price used for canola futures for the daily SDAI value is the 3:00 p.m. EST USD/CAD price quoted by Bloomberg under currency ticker &#8220;USDCAD F150&#8221;.

&#160; 

Composition of the SDAI 

&#160;

The composition of the SDAI on any given day, as determined and published by SHIM, is determinative of the benchmark for USAG. Neither the SDAI methodology nor any set of procedures, however, are capable of anticipating all possible circumstances and events that may occur with respect to the SDAI and the methodology for its composition, weighting and calculation. Accordingly, a number of subjective judgments must be made in connection with the operation of the SDAI that cannot be adequately reflected in this description of the SDAI. All questions of interpretation with respect to the application of the provisions of the SDAI methodology, including any determinations that need to be made in the event of a market emergency or other extraordinary circumstances, will be resolved by SHIM.

&#160;

Contract Expirations 

&#160;

Because the SDAI is comprised of actively traded contracts with scheduled expirations, it can be calculated only by reference to the prices of contracts for specified expiration, delivery or settlement periods, referred to as contract expirations. The contract expirations included in the SDAI for each commodity during a given year are designated by SHIM, provided that each contract must be an active contract. An active contract for this purpose is a liquid, actively-traded contract expiration, as defined or identified by the relevant trading facility or, if no such definition or identification is provided by the relevant trading facility, as defined by standard custom and practice in the industry.

&#160;

If a Futures Exchange ceases trading in all contract expirations relating to a particular Benchmark Component Agriculture Futures Contract, SHIM may designate a replacement contract on the particular agricultural commodity. The replacement contract must satisfy the eligibility criteria for inclusion in the SDAI. To the extent practicable, the replacement will be effected during the next monthly review of the composition of the SDAI. If that timing is not practicable, SHIM will determine the date of the replacement based on a number of factors, including the differences between the existing Benchmark Component Agriculture Futures Contract and the replacement contract with respect to contractual specifications and contract expirations.

&#160;

If a Benchmark Component Agriculture Futures Contract is eliminated and there is no replacement contract, the underlying agricultural commodity will necessarily drop out of the SDAI. The designation of a replacement contract, or the elimination of an agricultural commodity from the SDAI because of the absence of a replacement contract, could affect the value of the SDAI, either positively or negatively, depending on the price of the contract that is eliminated and the prices of the remaining contracts. It is impossible, however, to predict the effect of these changes, if they occur, on the value of the SDAI.

&#160; 

Commodity Weighting 

&#160;

Each of the Benchmark Component Agriculture Futures Contracts will remain in the SDAI from month to month. Weights for each of the Benchmark Component Agriculture Futures Contracts in the SDAI are determined for the next month. The methodology used to calculate the SDAI weighting is based solely on quantitative data using observable futures prices and is not subject to human bias.

&#160;

The monthly weighting selection is a three-step process based upon examination of the relevant futures prices for each agricultural commodity:

&#160;

&#160; 1) The annualized percentage price difference between the closest-to-expiration Benchmark Component Agriculture Futures Contract and the next closest-to-expiration Benchmark Component Agriculture Futures Contract is calculated for each of the 14 eligible agricultural commodities on the fifth business day prior to the first business day of the next calendar month (the &#8220;USAG&#8217;s Selection Date&#8221;). The four agricultural commodities with the highest percentage price difference are selected. &#160;

&#160; 20 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

2) For the remaining 10 eligible agricultural commodities, the percentage price change of each agricultural commodity over the previous year is calculated, as measured by the change in the price of the closest-to- expiration Benchmark Component Agriculture Futures Contract on the Selection Date from the price of the closest-to-expiration Benchmark Component Agriculture Futures Contract a year prior to the Selection Date. The three agricultural commodities with the highest percentage price change are selected. &#160;

3) For the seven commodities selected through basis (step 1) and momentum (step 2), each commodity weight is increased by 2% above its base weighting for the following month. For the remaining seven commodities not selected, each commodity weight is decreased by 2% below its base weighting for the following month. &#160;

Due to the dynamic monthly agricultural commodity weighting calculation, the individual agricultural commodity weights will vary over time, depending on the price observations each month. USAG&#8217;s Selection Date for the SDAI is the fifth business day prior to the first business day of the next calendar month.

&#160; 

SDAI Commodity Weights 

As of December 31, 2015 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Contract Selection 

&#160;

For each agricultural commodity in the SDAI, the index selects a specific Benchmark Component Agriculture Futures Contract with a tenor ( i.e. , contract month) among the eligible tenors (the range of contract months) based upon the relative prices of the Benchmark Component Agriculture Futures Contracts within the eligible range of contract months. The previous notwithstanding, the contract expiration is not changed for that month if a Benchmark Component Agriculture Futures Contract remains in the SDAI, as long as the contract does not expire or enter its notice period in the subsequent month.

&#160; 

&#160; 21 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Portfolio Construction 

&#160;

The portfolio rebalancing takes place during the Rebalancing Period. At the end of each of the days in the last four business days of each month (the &#8220;Rebalancing Period&#8221;) one fourth of the prior month portfolio positions are replaced by the new commodity weights for the commodity contracts determined on USAG&#8217;s Selection Date.

&#160; 

SDAI Total Return Calculation 

&#160;

The value of the SDAI on any business day is equal to the product of (i) the value of the SDAI on the immediately preceding business day multiplied by (ii) one plus the sum of the day&#8217;s returns for another version of the SDAI known as the SummerHaven Dynamic Agriculture Index Excess Return (&#8220;SDAI ER&#8221;) (explained below) and one business day&#8217;s interest from the hypothetical Treasury Bill portfolio. The value of the Agriculture will be calculated and published by the NYSE Arca.

&#160; 

SDAI Base Level 

&#160;

The SDAI was set to 100 on January 2, 1991.

&#160;

SDAI ER Calculation 

&#160;

The total return of the SDAI ER reflects the percentage change of the market values of the underlying Benchmark Component Agriculture Futures Contracts. During the Rebalancing Period, the SDAI changes its contract holdings and weightings during a four day period. The value of the SDAI ER at the end of a business day &#8220; t &#8221; is equal to the SDAI ER value on day &#8220; t -1&#8221; multiplied by the sum of the daily percentage price changes of each commodity future factoring in each respective commodity future&#8217;s notional holding on day &#8220; t -1&#8221;.

&#160; 

Rebalancing Period 

&#160;

During the Rebalancing Period, existing positions are replaced by new positions based on the signals used for contract selection as outlined above. At the end of the first day of the Rebalancing Period, the signals are observed and on the second day a new portfolio is constructed that is equally weighted in terms of notional positions in the newly selected contracts.

&#160; 

2016 Holiday Schedule for All Applicable Indices 

&#160;

None of the Applicable Indices will be computed on the following weekdays in 2016:

&#160;

January 1 January 18 February 15 March 25 May 30 July 4 September 5 November 24 December 25 &#160;

The holiday schedule is subject to change. None of the Trust Series will accept orders for Creation Baskets or Redemption Baskets on these days.

&#160; 

Treasuries, Cash and Cash Equivalents 

&#160;

Each Trust Series seeks to have the aggregate &#8220;notional&#8221; amount of the Applicable Interests it holds approximate at all times its aggregate NAV. At any given time, however, most of the Trust Series holdings are in short-term Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents that support such Trust Series&#8217; positions in Applicable Interests. For example, the purchase of an Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contract with a stated or notional amount of $10 million would not require a Trust Series to pay $10 million upon entering into the contract; rather, only a margin deposit, generally of 5% to 30% of the notional amount, would be required. To secure its obligations under Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contracts, a Trust Series would deposit the required margin with the FCM and would separately hold its remaining assets through its Custodian in Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents. Such remaining assets may be used to meet future margin payments that a Trust Series is required to make on its Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contracts. Other Related Investments typically also involve collateral requirements that represent a small fraction of their notional amounts, so most of a Trust Series&#8217; assets dedicated to Other Related Investments will also be held in Treasuries, cash and cash equivalents.

&#160;

&#160; 22 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Each of the Trust Series earns income from the Treasuries and/or cash equivalents that it purchases and on the cash it holds through the Custodian. USCF anticipates that the earned income will increase each Trust Series&#8217; NAV. Each Trust Series applies the earned income to the acquisition of additional investments or uses it to pay its expenses. If a Trust Series reinvests the earned income, it makes investments that are consistent with its investment objective.

&#160; 

What are the Trading Policies of the Trust Series? 

&#160; 

Liquidity 

&#160;

Each Trust Series invests only in Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contracts that, in the opinion of USCF, are traded in sufficient volume to permit the ready taking and liquidation of positions in these financial interests and in OTC Applicable Interests that, in the opinion of USCF, may be readily liquidated with the original counterparty or through a third party assuming a Trust Series&#8217; position.

&#160; 

Spot Commodities 

&#160;

While certain futures contracts can be physically settled, none of the Trust Series intends to take or make physical delivery. However, a Trust Series may from time to time trade in Other Related Investments based on the spot price of the applicable commodities comprising the Applicable Index.

&#160; 

Leverage 

&#160;

USCF endeavors to have the value of a Trust Series&#8217; Treasuries, cash and cash equivalents, whether held by a Trust Series or posted as margin or other collateral, at all times approximate the aggregate market value of its obligations under its Applicable Interests and Other Related Investments. Commodity pools&#8217; trading positions in Futures Contracts or Other Related Investments are typically required to be secured by the deposit of margin funds that represent only a small percentage of a futures contract (or other commodity interest&#8217;s) entire market value. While USCF does not intend to leverage the assets of any Trust Series, it is not prohibited from doing so under the Trust Agreement.

&#160; 

Borrowings 

&#160;

Borrowings are not used by any Trust Series unless it is required to borrow money in the event of physical delivery, if it trades in cash commodities, or for short-term needs created by unexpected redemptions. None of the Trust Series plans to establish credit lines.

&#160; 

OTC Derivatives (Including Spreads and Straddles) 

&#160;

In addition to Futures Contracts and options on Futures Contracts, derivative contracts that are tied to various commodities are entered into outside of public exchanges. These OTC contracts are entered into between two parties in private contracts. Unlike most of the exchange-traded futures contracts or exchange-traded options on futures contracts, each party to such a contract bears the credit risk of the other party, i.e. , the risk that the other party may not be able to perform its obligations under its contract. To reduce the credit risk that arises in connection with such contracts, each Trust Series may enter into an agreement with each counterparty based on the Master Agreement published by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. that provides for the netting of its overall exposure to its counterparty.

&#160;

USCF assesses or reviews, as appropriate, the creditworthiness of each potential or existing counterparty to an OTC contract pursuant to guidelines approved by USCF&#8217;s Board.

&#160;

Each Trust Series may enter into certain transactions where an OTC component is exchanged for a corresponding futures contract (&#8220;Exchange for Related Position&#8221; or &#8220;EFRP&#8221; transaction). These EFRP transactions may expose a Trust Series to counterparty risk during the interim period between the execution of the OTC component and the exchange for a corresponding futures contract. Generally, the counterparty risk from the EFRP transaction will exist only on the day of execution.

&#160;

&#160; 23 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Each Trust Series may employ spreads or straddles in its trading to mitigate the differences in its investment portfolio and its goal of tracking the price of the Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contracts. Each Trust Series would use a spread when it chooses to take simultaneous long and short positions in futures written on the same underlying asset, but with different delivery months.

&#160;

During the 12 month reporting period ended December 31, 2015, each Trust Series limited its derivatives activities to Futures Contracts.

&#160; 

Pyramiding 

&#160;

None of the Trust Series has, and will not employ, the technique, commonly known as pyramiding, in which the speculator uses unrealized profits on existing positions as variation margin for the purchase or sale of additional positions in the same or another commodity interest.

&#160; 

Who are the Service Providers? 

&#160;

In its capacity as the Custodian for each Trust Series, BBH&#38;Co. may hold each Trust Series&#8217; Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents pursuant to a custodial agreement. BBH&#38;Co. is also the registrar and transfer agent for the shares. In addition, in its capacity as Administrator for each Trust Series, BBH&#38;Co. performs certain administrative and accounting services for each Trust Series and prepares certain SEC, NFA and CFTC reports on behalf of each Trust Series. USCF pays BBH&#38;Co.&#8217;s fees for these services.

&#160;

BBH&#38;Co.&#8217;s principal business address is 50 Post Office Square, Boston, MA 02110-1548. BBH&#38;Co., a private bank founded in 1818, is neither a publicly held company nor insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. BBH&#38;Co. is authorized to conduct a commercial banking business in accordance with the provisions of Article IV of the New York State Banking Law, New York Banking Law &#167;&#167;160&#8211;181, and is subject to regulation, supervision, and examination by the New York State Department of Financial Services. BBH&#38;Co. is also licensed to conduct a commercial banking business by the Commonwealths of Massachusetts and Pennsylvania and is subject to supervision and examination by the banking supervisors of those states.

&#160;

Each Trust Series also employs ALPS Distributors as its marketing agent USCF pays the Marketing Agent an annual fee. In no event may the aggregate compensation paid to the Marketing Agent and any affiliate of USCF for distribution-related services in connection with the offering of shares exceed ten percent (10%) of the gross proceeds of the offering.

&#160;

ALPS Distributors&#8217; principal business address is 1290 Broadway, Suite 1100, Denver, CO 80203. ALPS Distributors is a broker-dealer registered with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (&#8220;FINRA&#8221;) and a member of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation.

&#160;

On July 7, 2014, the Trust on behalf of each Trust Series entered into a Futures and Cleared Swaps Agreement with Wells Fargo Securities, LLC (&#8220;WFS&#8221;). WFS is collectively referred to as the &#8220;Futures Commissions Merchant&#8221; or &#8220;FCM&#8221;. After July 7, 2014, most, if not all, transactions were placed with WFS. The agreements require the FCM to provide services to each Trust Series in connection with the purchase and sale of Futures Contracts and Other Related Investments that may be purchased and sold by or through the FCM for each Trust Series&#8217; account. In accordance with the agreement, the FCM charges each Trust Series commissions of approximately $7 to $15 per round-turn trade, including applicable exchange and NFA fees for Futures Contracts and options on Futures Contracts. Such fees include those incurred when purchasing Futures Contracts and options on Futures Contracts when each Trust Series issues shares as a result of a Creation Basket, as well as fees incurred when selling Futures Contacts and options on Futures Contracts when each Trust Series redeems shares as a result of a Redemption Basket. Such fees are also incurred when Futures Contracts and options on Futures Contracts are purchased or redeemed for the purpose of rebalancing the portfolio. Each Trust Series also incurs commissions to brokers for the purchase and sale of Futures Contracts, Other Commodity-Related Investments or short-term obligations of the United States of two years or less (&#8220;Treasuries&#8221;).

&#160;

&#160; 24 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

WFS is a large broker-dealer subject to many different complex legal and regulatory requirements. As a result, certain of WFS&#8217;s regulators may from time to time conduct investigations, initiate enforcement proceedings and/or enter into settlements with WFS with respect to issues raised in various investigations. WFS complies fully with its regulators in all investigations being conducted and in all settlements it reaches. In addition, WFS is and has been subject to a variety of civil legal claims in various jurisdictions, a variety of settlement agreements and a variety of orders, awards and judgments made against it by courts and tribunals, both in regard to such claims and investigations. WFS complies fully with all settlements it reaches and all orders, awards and judgments made against it.

&#160;

The Trust has entered into an agreement with Wells Fargo Securities, LLC whereby Wells Fargo Securities, LLC will serve as a Futures Commission Merchant (&#8220;FCM&#8221;) for each Trust Series. Wells Fargo Securities, LLC is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Wells Fargo &#38; Co. and has a principal place of business at 550 S. Tryon Street, Charlotte, North Carolina 28202. WFS is registered in the U.S. with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority as a broker-dealer and with the CFTC as an FCM. WFS is a member of various U.S. futures and securities exchanges.

&#160;

Although Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, in its capacity as Broker-Dealer and/or FCM, has been subject to regulatory disciplinary matters involving fines or other sanctions, as of the date hereof neither Wells Fargo Securities, LLC nor any of its principals has been the subject of any material administrative, civil or criminal action, including any action that has been pending, on appeal, or concluded within the last five years, except as follows:

&#160;

ABS CDO INVESTIGATION In April of 2011, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC (f/k/a Wachovia Capital Markets, LLC) entered into a settlement with the SEC in which the firm paid $11.2 million in disgorgement and penalties and agreed to cease and desist from violating Sections 17(a)(2) and (3) of the Securities Act, in order to resolve issues arising from an investigation into Wachovia Capital Markets, LLC&#8217;s ABS CDO underwriting, marketing and pricing practices.

&#160;

ASSET-BACKED COMMERCIAL PAPER INVESTIGATION On August 14, 2012, the SEC entered a settled administrative order against Wells Fargo Brokerage Services LLC (n/k/a Wells Fargo Securities, LLC) and a former sales representative concerning alleged sales practice and suitability issues related to certain 2007 sales of three asset-backed commercial paper products to institutional and municipal purchasers. Without admitting or denying the allegations, the firm agreed to a censure, a cease-and-desist order, disgorgement of $65,000 plus prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $6.5 million.

&#160;

NATIONAL CREDIT UNION ADMINISTRATION The National Credit Union Administration, as the successor to various federal credit unions, has asserted claims against Wachovia Capital Markets, WFS&#8217;s predecessor and Wachovia Mortgage Loan Trust (&#8220;WMLT&#8221;) (as the issuer of residential mortgage-backed securities (&#8220;RMBS&#8221;)) in three separate actions in federal courts in Kansas (the &#8220;Kansas Actions&#8221;), California (the &#8220;California Action&#8221;), and New York (the &#8220;New York Action&#8221;) as follows: National Credit Union Administration Board v. Wachovia Mortgage Loan Trust; National Credit Union Administration Board as Liquidating Agent of Western Corporate Federal Credit Union v. RBS Securities, Inc. f/k/a RBS Greenwich Capital Markets, Inc., et al.; and National Credit Union Administration Board v. Wachovia Capital Markets, LLC n/k/a Wells Fargo Securities, LLC. These actions seek to recover losses associated with the credit unions&#8217; investment in RMBS underwritten or sold by WCM and/or issued by WMLT. These three matters were resolved in October of 2015 for $53 million and have now been dismissed.

&#160;

NOVASTAR MORTGAGE LITIGATION This is a putative class action filed in federal court for the Southern District of New York involving six different NovaStar offerings in which Wachovia Capital Markets, LLC (WCM) served as one of several underwriters. It is alleged that the offering documents were materially misleading because they failed to disclose that NovaStar, which originated or acquired the loans backing the certificates disregarded its lending guidelines. The claims were initially dismissed in 2011 and 2012, but those rulings were overturned on appeal and all claims were reinstated by the trial court in 2015. The matter is currently being litigated.

&#160;

WFS will only act as a clearing broker for each Trust Series and as such will be paid commissions for executing and clearing trades on behalf of each Trust Series. WFS will not act in any supervisory capacity with respect to USCF or participate in the management of USCF or a Trust Series. WFS has not passed upon the adequacy or accuracy of this annual report on Form 10-K.

&#160;

&#160; 25 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

WFS is not affiliated with USCF or the Trust Series. Therefore, neither USCF nor the Trust Series believe that there are any conflicts of interest with WFS or their trading principals arising from their acting as the Trust Series&#8217; FCM.

&#160;

&#160; 

Other Fees. USCI also pays the fees and expenses associated with its audit expenses, tax accounting and reporting requirements. These fees were approximately $600,000 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015. In addition, USCI is responsible for paying its portion of the directors&#8217; and officers&#8217; liability insurance for USCI, the other Trust Series and the Related Public Funds. In addition, as of July 8, 2011, USCI became responsible for paying the fees and expenses of the independent directors who also serve as audit committee members of USCI, the other Trust Series and the Related Public Funds. USCI shares the fees and expenses on a pro rata basis with the other Trust Series and each Related Public Fund, as described above, based on the relative assets of each fund computed on a daily basis.

&#160; 

Form of Shares 

&#160; 

Registered Form. Shares are issued in registered form in accordance with the Trust Agreement. The Administrator has been appointed registrar and transfer agent for the purpose of transferring shares in certificated form. The Administrator keeps a record of all shareholders and holders of the shares in certificated form in the registry. The beneficial interests in such shares are held in book-entry form through participants and/or accountholders in the Depository Trust Company (&#8220;DTC&#8221;).

&#160; 

&#160; 29 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Book Entry. Individual certificates are not issued for the shares. Instead, shares are represented by one or more global certificates, which are deposited by the Administrator with DTC and registered in the name of Cede &#38; Co., as nominee for DTC. The global certificates evidence all of the shares outstanding at any time. Shareholders are limited to: (1) participants in DTC such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies (&#8220;DTC Participants&#8221;), (2) those who maintain, either directly or indirectly, a custodial relationship with a DTC Participant (&#8220;Indirect Participants&#8221;), and (3) those banks, brokers, dealers, trust companies and others who hold interests in the shares through DTC Participants or Indirect Participants, in each case who satisfy the requirements for transfers of shares. DTC Participants acting on behalf of investors holding shares through such participants&#8217; accounts in DTC will follow the delivery practice applicable to securities eligible for DTC&#8217;s Same-Day Funds Settlement System. Shares are credited to DTC Participants&#8217; securities accounts following confirmation of receipt of payment.

&#160; 

DTC. DTC has advised the Trust Series as follows: It is a limited purpose trust company organized under the laws of the State of New York and is a member of the Federal Reserve System, a &#8220;clearing corporation&#8221; within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code and a &#8220;clearing agency&#8221; registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Exchange Act. DTC holds securities for DTC Participants and facilitates the clearance and settlement of transactions between DTC Participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of DTC Participants.

&#160; 

Inter-Series Limitation on Liability 

&#160;

Because the Trust was established as a Delaware statutory trust, each Trust Series will be operated so that it will be liable only for obligations attributable to such series and will not be liable for obligations of any other series or affected by losses of any other series. If any creditor or shareholder of any particular series asserts against the series a valid claim with respect to its indebtedness or shares, the creditor or shareholder will only be able to obtain recovery from the assets of that series and not from the assets of any other series or the Trust generally. The assets of each Trust Series will include only those funds and other assets that are paid to, held by or distributed to the series on account of and for the benefit of that series, including, without limitation, amounts delivered to the Trust for the purchase of shares in a series. This limitation on liability is referred to as the Inter-Series Limitation on Liability. The Inter-Series Limitation on Liability is expressly provided for under the Delaware Statutory Trust Act, which provides that if certain conditions (as set forth in Section 3804(a)) are met, then the debts of any particular series will be enforceable only against the assets of such series and not against the assets of any other series or the Trust generally. In furtherance of the Inter-Series Limitation on Liability, every party providing services to the Trust, any Trust Series or USCF on behalf of the Trust or any Trust Series, will acknowledge and consent in writing to the Inter-Series Limitation on Liability with respect to such party&#8217;s claims.

&#160;

The existence of a Trustee should not be taken as an indication of any additional level of management or supervision over any Trust Series. To the greatest extent permissible under Delaware law, the Trustee acts in an entirely passive role, delegating all authority for the management and operation of each Trust Series and the Trust to USCF. The Trustee does not provide custodial services with respect to the assets of any Trust Series.

&#160; 

Calculating Per Share NAV 

&#160;

Each Trust Series&#8217; per share NAV is calculated by:

&#160;

&#160; &#8226; &#160; Taking the current market value of its total assets; &#160; &#8226; &#160; Subtracting any liabilities; and &#160; &#8226; &#160; Dividing that total by the total number of outstanding shares. &#160;

&#160; 30 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

The Administrator calculates the per share NAV of each Trust Series once each NYSE Arca trading day. The per share NAV for a normal trading day is released after 4:00 p.m. New York time. Trading during the core trading session on the NYSE Arca typically closes at 4:00 p.m. New York time. The Administrator uses the closing prices on the relevant Futures Exchanges of the Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contracts (determined at the earlier of the close of such exchange or 2:30 p.m. New York time) for the Futures Contracts traded on the Futures Exchanges, but calculates or determines the value of all other investments of a Trust Series (including Other Related Investments) using market quotations, if available, or other information customarily used to determine the fair value of such investments as of the earlier of the close of the NYSE Arca or 4:00 p.m. New York time, in accordance with the Administrative Agency Agreement among BBH&#38;Co., the Trust Series and USCF. &#8220;Other information&#8221; customarily used in determining fair value includes information consisting of market data in the relevant market supplied by one or more third parties including, without limitation, relevant rates, prices, yields, yield curves, volatilities, spreads, correlations or other market data in the relevant market; or information of the types described above from internal sources if that information is of the same type used by a Trust Series in the regular course of its business for the valuation of similar transactions. The information may include costs of funding, to the extent costs of funding are not and would not be a component of the other information being utilized. Third parties supplying quotations or market data may include, without limitation, dealers in the relevant markets, end-users of the relevant product, information vendors, brokers and other sources of market information.

&#160;

In addition, in order to provide updated information relating to each Trust Series for use by investors and market professionals, the NYSE Arca calculates and disseminates throughout the core trading session on each trading day an updated indicative fund value. The indicative fund value is calculated by using the prior day&#8217;s closing per share NAV of a Trust Series as a base and updating that value throughout the trading day to reflect changes in the most recently reported price level of the Applicable Index as reported by Bloomberg or other reporting service. The indicative fund value share basis disseminated during NYSE Arca core trading session hours should not be viewed as an actual real time update of the per share NAV, because the per share NAV is calculated only once at the end of each trading day based upon the relevant end of day values of each Trust Series&#8217; investments.

&#160;

The indicative fund value is disseminated on a per share basis every 15 seconds during regular NYSE Arca core trading session hours of 9:30 a.m. New York time to 4:00 p.m. New York time. The normal trading hours of the Futures Exchanges vary, with some Futures Exchanges ending their trading hours before the close of the core trading session on the NYSE Arca (for example, the normal trading hours of the NYMEX are 10:00 a.m. New York time to 2:30 p.m. New York time). When a Trust Series holds Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contracts from Futures Exchanges with different trading hours than the NYSE Arca, there will be a gap in time at the beginning and/or the end of each day during which such Trust Series&#8217; shares are traded on the NYSE Arca, but real-time Futures Exchange trading prices for Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contracts traded on such Futures Exchanges are not available. During such gaps in time the indicative fund value will be calculated based on the end of day price of such Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contracts from Futures Exchanges immediately preceding trading session. In addition, Other Related Investments and Treasuries held by a Trust Series will be valued by the Administrator, using rates and points received from client-approved third party vendors (such as Reuters and WM Company) and advisor quotes. These investments will not be included in the indicative fund value.

&#160;

The NYSE Arca disseminates the indicative fund value through the facilities of CTA/CQ High Speed Lines. In addition, the indicative fund value is published on the NYSE Arca&#8217;s website and is available through on-line information services such as Bloomberg and Reuters.

&#160;

Dissemination of the indicative fund value provides additional information that is not otherwise available to the public and is useful to investors and market professionals in connection with the trading of the shares of a Trust Series on the NYSE Arca. Investors and market professionals are able throughout the trading day to compare the market price of a Trust Series and the indicative fund value. If the market price of shares of a Trust Series diverges significantly from the indicative fund value, market professionals will have an incentive to execute arbitrage trades. For example, if a Trust Series appears to be trading at a discount compared to the indicative fund value, a market professional could buy shares of such Trust Series on the NYSE Arca and sell short Futures Contracts. Such arbitrage trades can tighten the tracking between the market price of such Trust Series and the indicative fund value and thus can be beneficial to all market participants.

&#160;

In addition, other Futures Contracts, Other Related Investments and Treasuries held by a Trust Series are valued by the Administrator, using rates and points received from client-approved third party vendors (such as Reuters and WM Company) and advisor quotes. These investments are not included in the indicative value. The indicative fund value is based on the prior day&#8217;s per share NAV and moves up and down solely according to changes in the price of the Applicable Index as reported on Bloomberg or another reporting service.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Creation and Redemption of Shares 

&#160;

Each Trust Series creates and redeems shares from time to time, but only in one or more Creation Baskets or Redemption Baskets. The creation and redemption of baskets are only made in exchange for delivery to a Trust Series or the distribution by a Trust Series of the amount of Treasuries and/or cash represented by the baskets being created or redeemed, the amount of which is equal to the combined NAV of the number of shares included in the baskets being created or redeemed determined as of 4:00 p.m. New York time on the day the order to create or redeem baskets is properly received.

&#160;

Authorized Participants are the only persons that may place orders to create and redeem baskets. Authorized Participants must be (1) either registered broker-dealers or other securities market participants, such as banks and other financial institutions, that are not required to register as broker-dealers to engage in securities transactions as described below, and (2) DTC Participants. To become an Authorized Participant, a person must enter into an Authorized Participant Agreement with USCF on behalf of a Trust Series (each such agreement, an &#8220;Authorized Participant Agreement&#8221;). The Authorized Participant Agreement provides the procedures for the creation and redemption of baskets and for the delivery of the Treasuries and/or cash required for such creations and redemptions. The Authorized Participant Agreement and the related procedures attached thereto may be amended by USCF, without the consent of any shareholder or Authorized Participant. From July 1, 2011 through April 30, 2016, Authorized Participants pay USCI $350 for each order placed to create one or more Creation Baskets or to redeem one or more Redemption Baskets; prior to July 1, 2011, Authorized Participants paid USCI $1,000 for each order placed to create one or more Creation Baskets or to redeem one or more Redemption Baskets. From May 1, 2012 through April 30, 2016, Authorized Participants pay each of CPER and USAG $350 for each order placed to create one or more Creation Baskets or to redeem one or more Redemption Baskets; prior to May 1, 2012, Authorized Participants paid $1,000 for each order placed to create one or more Creation Baskets or to redeem one or more Redemption Baskets. Authorized Participants who make deposits with a Trust Series in exchange for baskets receive no fees, commissions or other form of compensation or inducement of any kind from either the Trust or USCF, and no such person will have any obligation or responsibility to the Trust or USCF to effect any sale or resale of shares. As of December 31, 2015, 11 Authorized Participants had entered into agreements with USCF on behalf of USCI. During the year ended December 31, 2015, USCI issued 70 Creation Baskets and redeemed 107 Redemption Baskets. As of December 31, 2015, 10 Authorized Participants had entered into agreements with USCF on behalf of CPER. During the year ended December 31, 2015, CPER issued 1 Creation Baskets and redeemed 1 Redemption Baskets. As of December 31, 2015, 10 Authorized Participants had entered into agreements with USCF on behalf of USAG. During the year ended December 31, 2015, USAG did not issue any Creation Baskets and did not redeem any Redemption Baskets.

&#160;

Certain Authorized Participants are expected to be capable of participating directly in the applicable physical commodity and the Applicable Interest markets. Some Authorized Participants or their affiliates may from time to time buy or sell applicable commodities or Applicable Interests and may profit in these instances. USCF believes that the size and operation of the applicable commodities market make it unlikely that Authorized Participants&#8217; direct activities in the applicable commodities or securities markets will significantly affect the price of applicable commodities, Applicable Interests, or the price of shares.

&#160;

Each Authorized Participant is required to be registered as a broker-dealer under the Exchange Act and is a member in good standing with FINRA, or exempt from being or otherwise not required to be registered as a broker-dealer or a member of FINRA, and qualified to act as a broker or dealer in the states or other jurisdictions where the nature of its business so requires. Certain Authorized Participants may also be regulated under federal and state banking laws and regulations. Each Authorized Participant has its own set of rules and procedures, internal controls and information barriers as it determines is appropriate in light of its own regulatory regime.

&#160;

Under the Authorized Participant Agreement, USCF, and the Trust under limited circumstances, have agreed to indemnify the Authorized Participants against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the &#8220;Securities Act&#8221;), and to contribute to the payments the Authorized Participants may be required to make in respect of those liabilities.

&#160;

The following description of the procedures for the creation and redemption of baskets is only a summary and an investor should refer to the relevant provisions of the Trust Agreement and the form of Authorized Participant Agreement for more detail, each of which is incorporated by reference into this annual report on Form 10-K.

&#160; 

&#160; 32 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Creation Procedures 

&#160;

On any business day, an Authorized Participant may place an order with the Marketing Agent to create one or more baskets. For purposes of processing purchase and redemption orders, a &#8220;business day&#8221; means any day other than a day when the NYSE Arca, the New York Stock Exchange, or any of the Futures Exchanges upon which a Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contract is traded is closed for regular trading. Purchase orders must be placed by 10:30 a.m. New York time or the close of regular trading on the NYSE Arca, whichever is earlier. The day on which the Marketing Agent receives a valid purchase order is referred to as the purchase order date.

&#160;

By placing a purchase order, an Authorized Participant agrees to deposit Treasuries, cash or a combination of Treasuries and cash with the Trust, as described below. Prior to the delivery of baskets for a purchase order, the Authorized Participant must also have wired to the Custodian the non-refundable transaction fee due for the purchase order. Authorized Participants may not withdraw a creation request, except as otherwise set forth in the procedures in the Authorized Participant Agreement.

&#160;

The manner by which creations are made is dictated by the terms of the Authorized Participant Agreement. By placing a purchase order, an Authorized Participant agrees to (1) deposit Treasuries, cash, or a combination of Treasuries and cash with the Custodian, and (2) if required by USCF in its sole discretion, enter into or arrange for a block trade, an exchange for physical or exchange for swap, or any other OTC energy transaction (through itself or a designated acceptable broker) with a Trust Series for the purchase of a number and type of futures contracts at the closing settlement price for such contracts on the purchase order date. If an Authorized Participant fails to consummate (1) and (2), the order shall be cancelled. The number and type of contracts specified shall be determined by USCF, in its sole discretion, to meet a Trust Series&#8217; investment objective and shall be purchased as a result of the Authorized Participant&#8217;s purchase of shares.

&#160; 

Determination of Required Deposits 

&#160;

The total deposit required to create each basket (&#8220;Creation Basket Deposit&#8221;) is the amount of Treasuries and/or cash that is in the same proportion to the total assets of a Trust Series (net of estimated accrued but unpaid fees, expenses and other liabilities) on the purchase order date as the number of shares to be created under the purchase order is in proportion to the total number of shares outstanding on the purchase order dates. USCF determines, directly in its sole discretion or in consultation with the Administrator, the requirements for Treasuries and cash, including the remaining maturities of the Treasuries and proportions of Treasuries and cash that may be included in deposits to create baskets. The Marketing Agent will publish an estimate of the Creation Basket Deposit requirements at the beginning of each business day. The amount of cash deposit required is the difference between the aggregate market value of the Treasuries required to be included in a Creation Basket Deposit as of 4:00 pm New York time on the date the order to purchase is properly received and the total required deposit.

&#160;

Delivery of Required Deposits 

&#160;

An Authorized Participant who places a purchase order is responsible for transferring to a Trust Series&#8217; account with the Custodian the required amount of Treasuries and/or cash by noon New York time on the third business day following the purchase order date. Upon receipt of the deposit amount, the Administrator directs DTC to credit the number of baskets ordered to the Authorized Participant&#8217;s DTC account on the third business day following the purchase order date. The expense and risk of delivery and ownership of Treasuries until such Treasuries have been received by the Custodian on behalf of each Trust Series shall be borne solely by the Authorized Participant.

&#160;

Because orders to purchase baskets must be placed by 10:30 a.m., New York time, but the total payment required to create a basket during the continuous offering period will not be determined until 4:00 p.m., New York time, on the date the purchase order is received, Authorized Participants will not know the total amount of the payment required to create a basket at the time they submit an irrevocable purchase order for the basket. A Trust Series&#8217; per share NAV and the total amount of the payment required to create a basket could rise or fall substantially between the time an irrevocable purchase order is submitted and the time the amount of the purchase price in respect thereof is determined.

&#160;

&#160; 33 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Rejection of Purchase Orders 

&#160;

USCF acting by itself or through the Marketing Agent shall have the absolute right, but shall have no obligation, to reject any purchase order or Creation Basket Deposit if USCF determines that:

&#160;

&#160; &#8226; &#160; the purchase order or Creation Basket Deposit is not in proper form; 

&#160; &#8226; &#160; it would not be in the best interest of the shareholders of a Trust Series; 

&#160; &#8226; &#160; due to position limits or otherwise, investment alternatives that will enable a Trust Series to meet its investment objective are not available to such Trust Series at that time; 

&#160; &#8226; &#160; the acceptance of the purchase order or the Creation Basket Deposit would have adverse tax consequences to a Trust Series or its shareholders; 

&#160; &#8226; &#160; the acceptance or receipt of which would, in the opinion of counsel to USCF, be unlawful; or 

&#160; &#8226; &#160; circumstances outside the control of USCF, the Marketing Agent or the Custodian make it, for all practical purposes, not feasible to process creations of Creation Baskets (including if USCF determines that the investments available to a Trust Series at that time will not enable it to meet its investment objective). &#160;

None of USCF, the Marketing Agent or the Custodian will be liable for the rejection of any purchase order or Creation Basket Deposit.

&#160; 

Redemption Procedures 

&#160;

The procedures by which an Authorized Participant can redeem one or more baskets mirror the procedures for the creation of baskets. On any business day, an Authorized Participant may place an order with the Marketing Agent to redeem one or more baskets. Redemption orders must be placed by 10:30 a.m. New York time or the close of regular trading on the NYSE Arca, whichever is earlier. A redemption order so received will be effective on the date it is received in satisfactory form by the Marketing Agent (&#8220;Redemption Order Date&#8221;). The redemption procedures allow Authorized Participants to redeem baskets and do not entitle an individual shareholder to redeem any shares in an amount less than a Redemption Basket, or to redeem baskets other than through an Authorized Participant.

&#160;

By placing a redemption order, an Authorized Participant agrees to deliver the baskets to be redeemed through DTC&#8217;s book-entry system to a Trust Series, as described below. Prior to the delivery of the redemption distribution for a redemption order, the Authorized Participant must also have wired to USCF&#8217;s account at the Custodian the non-refundable transaction fee due for the redemption order. An Authorized Participant may not withdraw a redemption order, except as otherwise set forth in the procedures in the Authorized Participant Agreement.

&#160;

The manner by which redemptions are made is dictated by the terms of the Authorized Participant Agreement. By placing a redemption order, an Authorized Participant agrees to (1) deliver the Redemption Basket to be redeemed through DTC&#8217;s book-entry system to a Trust Series&#8217; account with the Custodian not later than 3:00 p.m. New York time on the third business day following the effective date of the redemption order (&#8220;Redemption Distribution Date&#8221;), and (2) if required by USCF in its sole discretion, enter into or arrange for a block trade, an exchange for physical or exchange for swap, or any other OTC transaction (through itself or a designated acceptable broker) with a Trust Series for the sale of a number and type of futures contracts at the closing settlement price for such contracts on the Redemption Order Date. If an Authorized Participant fails to consummate (1) and (2) above, the order shall be cancelled. The number and type of contracts specified shall be determined by USCF, in its sole discretion, to meet a Trust Series&#8217; investment objective and shall be sold as a result of the Authorized Participant&#8217;s sale of shares.

&#160;

Determination of Redemption Distribution 

&#160;

The redemption distribution from a Trust Series consists of a transfer to the redeeming Authorized Participant of an amount of Treasuries and/or cash that is in the same proportion to the total assets of such Trust Series (net of estimated accrued but unpaid fees, expenses and other liabilities) on the date the order to redeem is properly received as the number of shares to be redeemed under the redemption order is in proportion to the total number of shares outstanding on the date the order is received. USCF, directly or in consultation with the Administrator, determines the requirements for Treasuries and cash, including the remaining maturities of the Treasuries and proportions of Treasuries and cash that may be included in distributions to redeem baskets. The Marketing Agent will publish an estimate of the redemption distribution per basket as of the beginning of each business day.

&#160; 

&#160; 34 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Delivery of Redemption Distribution 

&#160;

The redemption distribution due from a Trust Series will be delivered to the Authorized Participant on the third business day following the redemption order date if, by 3:00 p.m., New York time on such third business day, such Trust Series&#8217; DTC account has been credited with the baskets to be redeemed. If such Trust Series&#8217; DTC account has not been credited with all of the baskets to be redeemed by such time, the redemption distribution will be delivered to the extent of whole baskets received. Any remainder of the redemption distribution will be delivered on the next business day to the extent of remaining whole baskets received if USCF receives the fee applicable to the extension of the redemption distribution date which USCF may, from time to time, determine and the remaining baskets to be redeemed are credited to a Trust Series&#8217; DTC account by 3:00 p.m., New York time on such next business day. Any further outstanding amount of the redemption order shall be cancelled. Pursuant to information from USCF, the Custodian will also be authorized to deliver the redemption distribution notwithstanding that the baskets to be redeemed are not credited to a Trust Series&#8217; DTC account by 3:00 p.m., New York time on the third business day following the redemption order date if the Authorized Participant has collateralized its obligation to deliver the baskets through DTC&#8217;s book-entry system on such terms as USCF may from time to time determine.

&#160; 

Suspension or Rejection of Redemption Orders 

&#160;

USCF may, in its discretion, suspend the right of redemption, or postpone the redemption settlement date, (1) for any period during which the NYSE Arca or any of the Futures Exchanges upon which an Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contract is traded is closed other than customary weekend or holiday closings, or trading on the NYSE Arca or the Futures Exchanges is suspended or restricted, (2) for any period during which an emergency exists as a result of which delivery, disposal or evaluation of Treasuries is not reasonably practicable, or (3) for such other period as USCF determines to be necessary for the protection of the shareholders. For example, USCF may determine that it is necessary to suspend redemptions to allow for the orderly liquidation of a Trust Series&#8217; assets at an appropriate value to fund a redemption. If USCF has difficulty liquidating a Trust Series&#8217; positions, e.g. , because of a market disruption event in the futures markets or an unanticipated delay in the liquidation of a position in an over the counter contract, it may be appropriate to suspend redemptions until such time as such circumstances are rectified. None of USCF, the Marketing Agent, the Administrator or the Custodian will be liable to any person or in any way for any loss or damages that may result from any such suspension or postponement.

&#160;

Redemption orders must be made in whole baskets. USCF will reject a redemption order if the order is not in proper form, as described in the Authorized Participant Agreement, or the fulfillment of the order in the opinion of its counsel may be illegal under applicable laws and regulations, or if circumstances outside the control of USCF, the Marketing Agent or the Custodian make it for all practical purposes not feasible for the shares to be delivered under the Redemption Order. USCF may also reject a redemption order if the number of shares being redeemed would reduce the remaining outstanding shares to 100,000 shares ( i.e. , two baskets) or less.

&#160;

Creation and Redemption Transaction Fee 

&#160;

To compensate each Trust Series for its expenses in connection with the creation and redemption of baskets, an Authorized Participant is required to pay a transaction fee to each Trust Series per order to create or redeem baskets, regardless of the number of baskets in such order. From July 1, 2011 through December 31, 2014 (and continuing at least through April 30, 2016), Authorized Participants pay USCI $350 for each order placed to create one or more Creation Baskets or to redeem one or more Redemption Baskets; prior to July 1, 2011, Authorized Participants paid USCI $1,000 for each order placed to create one or more Creation Baskets or to redeem one or more Redemption Baskets. From May 1, 2012 through December 31, 2014 (and continuing at least through April 30, 2016), Authorized Participants pay each of CPER and USAG $350 for each order placed to create one or more Creation Baskets or to redeem one or more Redemption Baskets; prior to May 1, 2012, Authorized Participants paid $1,000 for each order placed to create one or more Creation Baskets or to redeem one or more Redemption Baskets. The transaction fee may be reduced, increased or otherwise changed by USCF. USCF shall notify DTC of any change in the transaction fee and will not implement any increase in the fee for the redemption of baskets until 30 days after the date of the notice.

&#160; 

Tax Responsibility 

&#160;

Authorized Participants are responsible for any transfer tax, sales or use tax, stamp tax, recording tax, value added tax or similar tax or governmental charge applicable to the creation or redemption of baskets, regardless of whether or not such tax or charge is imposed directly on the Authorized Participant, and agree to indemnify USCF and each Trust Series if they are required by law to pay any such tax, together with any applicable penalties, additions to tax and interest thereon.

&#160; 

&#160; 35 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Secondary Market Transactions 

&#160;

As noted, each Trust Series creates and redeems shares from time to time, but only in one or more Creation Baskets or Redemption Baskets. The creation and redemption of baskets are only made in exchange for delivery to a Trust Series or the distribution by a Trust Series of the amount of Treasuries and/or cash equal to the aggregate NAV of the number of shares included in the baskets being created or redeemed determined on the day the order to create or redeem baskets is properly received.

&#160;

As discussed above, Authorized Participants are the only persons that may place orders to create and redeem baskets. Authorized Participants must be registered broker-dealers or other securities market participants, such as banks and other financial institutions that are not required to register as broker-dealers to engage in securities transactions. An Authorized Participant is under no obligation to create or redeem baskets, and an Authorized Participant is under no obligation to offer to the public shares of any baskets it does create. Authorized Participants that do offer to the public shares from the baskets they create will do so at per-share offering prices that are expected to reflect, among other factors, the trading price of the shares on the NYSE Arca, the NAV of a Trust Series&#8217; shares at the time the Authorized Participant purchased the Creation Baskets, the per share NAV of the shares at the time of the offer of the shares to the public, the supply of and demand for shares at the time of sale, and the liquidity of the Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contract market and the market for Other Related Investments. Baskets are generally redeemed when the price per share is at a discount to the per share NAV.

&#160;

Shares initially comprising the same basket but offered by Authorized Participants to the public at different times may have different offering prices. An order for one or more baskets may be placed by an Authorized Participant on behalf of multiple clients. Authorized Participants who make deposits with a Trust Series in exchange for baskets receive no fees, commissions or other forms of compensation or inducement of any kind from either a Trust Series or USCF and no such person has any obligation or responsibility to USCF or a Trust Series to effect any sale or resale of shares. Shares trade in the secondary market on the NYSE Arca. Shares may trade in the secondary market at prices that are lower or higher relative to their per share NAV. The amount of the discount or premium in the trading price relative to the per share NAV may be influenced by various factors, including the number of investors who seek to purchase or sell shares in the secondary market and the liquidity of the Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contract market and the market for Other Related Investments. While the shares trade during the core trading session on the NYSE Arca until 4:00 p.m. New York time, liquidity in the market for Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contracts and Other Related Investments may be reduced after the close of the Futures Exchanges upon which the Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contracts are traded. As a result, during this time, trading spreads, and the resulting premium or discount, on the shares may widen.

&#160; 

Who is the Trustee? 

&#160;

The sole Trustee of the Trust is Wilmington Trust Company, a Delaware trust company (the &#8220;Trustee&#8221;). The Trustee&#8217;s principal offices are located at 1100 North Market Street, Wilmington, Delaware 19890-0001. The Trustee is unaffiliated with USCF. The Trustee&#8217;s duties and liabilities with respect to the offering of shares and the management of the Trust and each Trust Series are limited to its express obligations under the Trust Agreement.

&#160;

The Trustee will accept service of legal process on the Trust in the State of Delaware and will make certain filings under the Delaware Statutory Trust Act. The Trustee does not owe any other duties to the Trust, USCF or the shareholders. The Trustee is permitted to resign upon at least sixty (60) days&#8217; notice to USCF. If no successor trustee has been appointed by USCF within such sixty-day period, the Trustee may, at the expense of the Trust, petition a court to appoint a successor. The Trustee is entitled to reasonable compensation for its services from USCF or an affiliate of USCF (including the Trust), and is indemnified by USCF against any expenses it incurs relating to or arising out of the formation, operation or termination of the Trust, or any action or inaction of the Trustee under the Trust Agreement, except to the extent that such expenses result from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Trustee. USCF has the discretion to replace the Trustee.

&#160;

Under the Trust Agreement, the Trustee has delegated to USCF the exclusive management and control of all aspects of the business of the Trust and the Trust Series. The Trustee has no duty or liability to supervise or monitor the performance of USCF, nor does the Trustee have any liability for the acts or omissions of USCF.

&#160;

&#160; 36 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Because the Trustee has no authority over the operation of the Trust, the Trustee itself is not registered in any capacity with the CFTC.

&#160; 

Investments 

&#160;

USCF applies substantially all of a Trust Series&#8217; assets in Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contracts and Other Related Investments, short-term Treasuries, cash and cash equivalents. When a Trust Series purchases Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contracts and certain Other Related Investments that are exchange-traded, a Trust Series is required to deposit with the FCM on behalf of the exchange a portion of the value of the contract or other interest as security to ensure payment for the obligation under the Applicable Interests at maturity. This deposit is known as initial margin. Counterparties in transactions in OTC Applicable Interests generally impose similar collateral requirements on a Trust Series. USCF invests a Trust Series&#8217; assets that remain after margin and collateral is posted in Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents. Subject to these margin and collateral requirements, USCF has sole authority to determine the percentage of assets that will be:

&#160;

&#160; &#8226; &#160; held as margin or collateral with FCMs or other custodians; &#160; &#8226; &#160; used for other investments; and &#160; &#8226; &#160; held in bank accounts to pay current obligations and as reserves. &#160;

In general, a Trust Series posts between 5% to 30% of the notional amount of an Applicable Interest as initial margin when entering into such Applicable Interest. Ongoing margin and collateral payments will generally be required for both exchange-traded and OTC Applicable Interests based on changes in the value of the Applicable Interests. Furthermore, ongoing collateral requirements with respect to OTC Applicable Interests are negotiated by the parties, and may be affected by overall market volatility, volatility of the underlying commodity or index, the ability of the counterparty to hedge its exposure under the Applicable Interest, and each party&#8217;s creditworthiness. In light of the differing requirements for initial payments under exchange-traded and OTC Applicable Interests and the fluctuating nature of ongoing margin and collateral payments, it is not possible to estimate what portion of a Trust Series&#8217; assets will be posted as margin or collateral at any given time. The Treasuries, cash and cash equivalents held by a Trust Series constitute reserves that are available to meet ongoing margin and collateral requirements. All income is used for a Trust Series&#8217; benefit.

&#160;

An FCM, counterparty, government agency or commodity exchange could increase margin or collateral requirements applicable to a Trust Series to hold trading positions at any time. Moreover, margin is merely a security deposit and has no bearing on the profit or loss potential for any positions held.

&#160;

Each Trust Series&#8217; assets posted as margin for Futures Contracts will be held in segregated accounts pursuant to CEA and CFTC regulations. Collateral posted in connection with OTC contracts held with a Trust Series&#8217; FCM will be similarly segregated and if held with other counterparties will be segregated pursuant to a contract between such Trust Series and its counterparties.

&#160;

If a Trust Series enters into a swap agreement, it must post both collateral and independent amounts to its swap counterparty(ies). The amount of collateral The Trust Series posts changes according to the amounts owed by the Trust Series to its counterparty on a given swap transaction, while independent amounts are fixed amounts posted by the Trust Series at the start of a swap transaction. Collateral and independent amounts posted to swap counterparties will be held by a third party custodian.

&#160; 

The Commodity Interest Markets 

&#160; 

General 

&#160;

The CEA governs the regulation of commodity interest transactions, markets and intermediaries. The CEA provides for varying degrees of regulation of commodity interest transactions depending upon: (1) the type of instrument being traded ( e.g. , contracts for future delivery, forwards, options, swaps or spot contracts), (2) the type of commodity underlying the instrument (distinctions are made between instruments based on agricultural commodities, energy and metals commodities and financial commodities), (3) the nature of the parties to the transaction (e.g. retail or eligible contract participant), (4) whether the transaction is entered into on a principal-to-principal or intermediated basis, (5) the type of market on which the transaction occurs, and (6) whether the transaction is subject to clearing through a clearing organization.

&#160;

&#160; 37 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

The offer and sale of shares of each Trust Series as well as shares of each Related Public Fund, is registered under the Securities Act. Each Trust Series and the Related Public Funds are subject to the requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations adopted thereunder as administered by the SEC. The Firm&#8217;s participation in the distribution of shares are regulated as described above, as well as by the self-regulatory association, FINRA.

&#160; 

Futures Contracts 

&#160;

A futures contract is a standardized contract traded on, or subject to the rules of, an exchange that calls for the future delivery of a specified quantity and type of a commodity at a specified time and place. Futures contracts are traded on a wide variety of commodities, including agricultural products, bonds, stock indices, interest rates, currencies, energy and metals. The size and terms of futures contracts on a particular commodity are identical and are not subject to any negotiation, other than with respect to price and the number of contracts traded between the buyer and seller.

&#160;

The contractual obligations of a buyer or seller may generally be satisfied by taking or making physical delivery of the underlying commodity or by making an offsetting sale or purchase of an identical futures contract on the same or linked exchange before the designated date of delivery. The difference between the price at which the futures contract is purchased or sold and the price paid for the offsetting sale or purchase, after allowance for brokerage commissions, constitutes the profit or loss to the trader. Some futures contracts, such as stock index contracts, settle in cash (reflecting the difference between the contract purchase/sale price and the contract settlement price) rather than by delivery of the underlying commodity.

&#160;

In market terminology, a trader who purchases a futures contract is long in the market and a trader who sells a futures contract is short in the market. Before a trader closes out his long or short position by an offsetting sale or purchase, his outstanding contracts are known as open trades or open positions. The aggregate amount of open positions held by traders in a particular contract is referred to as the open interest in such contract.

&#160; 

Forward Contracts 

&#160;

A forward contract is a contractual obligation to purchase or sell a specified quantity of a commodity at or before a specified date in the future at a specified price and, therefore, is economically similar to a futures contract. Unlike futures contracts, however, forward contracts are typically traded in the OTC markets and are not standardized contracts. Forward contracts for a given commodity are generally available for various amounts and maturities and are subject to individual negotiation between the parties involved. Moreover, generally there is no direct means of offsetting or closing out a forward contract by taking an offsetting position as one would a futures contract on a U.S. exchange. If a trader desires to close out a forward contract position, he generally will establish an opposite position in the contract but will settle and recognize the profit or loss on both positions simultaneously on the delivery date. Thus, unlike in the futures contract market where a trader who has offset positions will recognize profit or loss immediately, in the forward market a trader with a position that has been offset at a profit will generally not receive such profit until the delivery date, and likewise a trader with a position that has been offset at a loss will generally not have to pay money until the delivery date. In recent years, however, the terms of forward contracts have become more standardized, and in some instances such contracts now provide a right of offset or cash settlement as an alternative to making or taking delivery of the underlying commodity.

&#160;

In general, the CFTC does not regulate the interbank and forward foreign currency markets with respect to transactions in contracts between certain sophisticated counterparties such as a Trust Series or between certain regulated institutions and retail investors. Although U.S. banks are regulated in various ways by the Federal Reserve Board, the Comptroller of the Currency and other U.S. federal and state banking officials, banking authorities do not regulate the forward markets to the same extent that the swap markets are regulated by the CFTC and SEC.

&#160;

Regulation exempts both foreign exchange swaps and foreign exchange forwards from the definition of &#8220;swap&#8221; and, by extension, certain regulatory requirements applicable to swaps (such as clearing and margin). The exemption does not extend to other foreign exchange derivatives, such as foreign exchange options, currency swaps, and non-deliverable forwards.

&#160;

&#160; 38 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

While the U.S. government does not currently impose any restrictions on the movements of currencies, it could choose to do so. The imposition or relaxation of exchange controls in various jurisdictions could significantly affect the market for that and other jurisdictions&#8217; currencies. Trading in the interbank market also exposes the Trust Series to a risk of default since failure of a bank with which a Trust Series had entered into a forward contract would likely result in a default and thus possibly substantial losses to the Trust Series.

&#160; 

Options on Futures Contracts 

&#160;

Options on futures contracts are standardized contracts traded on an exchange. An option on a futures contract gives the buyer of the option the right, but not the obligation, to take a position at a specified price (the striking, strike, or exercise price) in the underlying futures contract or underlying interest. The buyer of a call option acquires the right, but not the obligation, to purchase or take a long position in the underlying interest, and the buyer of a put option acquires the right, but not the obligation, to sell or take a short position in the underlying interest.

&#160;

The seller, or writer, of an option is obligated to take a position in the underlying interest at a specified price opposite to the option buyer if the option is exercised. The seller of a call option must stand ready to take a short position in the underlying interest at the strike price if the buyer should exercise the option. The seller of a put option, on the other hand, must stand ready to take a long position in the underlying interest at the strike price.

&#160;

A call option is said to be in-the-money if the strike price is below current market levels and out-of-the-money if the strike price is above current market levels. Conversely, a put option is said to be in-the-money if the strike price is above the current market levels and out-of-the-money if the strike price is below current market levels.

&#160;

Options have limited life spans, usually tied to the delivery or settlement date of the underlying interest. Some options, however, expire significantly in advance of such date. The purchase price of an option is referred to as its premium, which consists of its intrinsic value (which is related to the underlying market value) plus its time value. As an option nears its expiration date, the time value shrinks and the market and intrinsic values move into parity. An option that is out-of-the-money and not offset by the time it expires becomes worthless. On certain exchanges, in-the-money options are automatically exercised on their expiration date, but on others unexercised options simply become worthless after their expiration date.

&#160;

Regardless of how much the market swings, the most an option buyer can lose is the option premium. The option buyer deposits his premium with his broker, and the money goes to the option seller. Option sellers, on the other hand, face risks similar to participants in the futures markets. For example, since the seller of a call option is assigned a short futures position if the option is exercised, his risk is the same as someone who initially sold a futures contract. Because no one can predict exactly how the market will move, the option seller typically posts margin to demonstrate his ability to meet any potential contractual obligations.

&#160; 

Options on Forward Contracts or Commodities 

&#160;

Options on forward contracts or commodities operate in a manner similar to options on futures contracts. An option on a forward contract or commodity gives the buyer of the option the right, but not the obligation, to take a position at a specified price in the underlying forward contract or commodity. However, unlike options on futures contracts, options on forward contracts or on commodities are individually negotiated contracts between counterparties and are typically traded in the OTC market. Therefore, options on forward contracts and physical commodities possess many of the same characteristics of forward contracts with respect to offsetting positions and credit risk that are described above.

&#160;

Swap Contracts 

&#160;

Swap transactions generally involve contracts between two parties to exchange a stream of payments computed by reference to a notional amount and the price of the asset that is the subject of the swap. Swap contracts are principally traded off-exchange, although certain swap contracts are also being traded in electronic trading facilities and cleared through clearing organizations.

&#160;

Swaps are usually entered into on a net basis, that is, the two payment streams are netted out in a cash settlement on the payment date or dates specified in the agreement, with the parties receiving or paying, as the case may be, only the net amount of the two payments. Swaps do not generally involve the delivery of underlying assets or principal. Accordingly, the risk of loss with respect to swaps is generally limited to the net amount of payments that the party is contractually obligated to make. In some swap transactions one or both parties may require collateral deposits from the counterparty to support that counterparty&#8217;s obligation under the swap agreement. If the counterparty to such a swap defaults, the risk of loss consists of the net amount of payments that the party is contractually entitled to receive less any collateral deposits it is holding.

&#160;

&#160; 39 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Some swap transactions are cleared through central counterparties. &#8220;Clearing&#8221; refers to the process by which a trade that is bilaterally executed by two parties is submitted to a central clearing counterparty, via a clearing member ( i.e. , an FCM), and replaced by two mirror swaps, with the central clearing counterparty becoming the counterparty to both of the initial parties to the swap. These transactions, known as cleared swaps, involve two counterparties first agreeing to the terms of a swap transaction, then submitting the transaction to a clearing house that acts as the central counterparty. Once accepted by the clearing house, the original swap transaction is novated and the central counterparty becomes the counterparty to a trade with each of the original parties based upon the trade terms determined in the original transaction. In this manner each individual swap counterparty reduces its risk of loss due to counterparty nonperformance because the clearing house acts as the counterparty to each transaction.

&#160; 

Regulation 

&#160;

Futures exchanges in the United States are subject to varying degrees of regulation under the CEA depending on whether such exchange is a designated contract market, exempt board of trade or electronic trading facility. Clearing organizations are also subject to the CEA and the rules and regulations adopted thereunder and administered by the CFTC. The CFTC is the governmental agency charged with responsibility for regulation of futures exchanges and commodity interest trading. The CFTC&#8217;s function is to implement the CEA&#8217;s objectives of preventing price manipulation and excessive speculation and promoting orderly and efficient commodity interest markets. In addition, the various exchanges and clearing organizations themselves exercise regulatory and supervisory authority over their member firms.

&#160;

The CFTC also regulates the activities of &#8220;commodity trading advisors&#8221; and &#8220;commodity pool operators&#8221; and the CFTC has adopted regulations with respect to certain of such persons&#8217; activities. Pursuant to its authority, the CFTC requires a CPO, such as USCF, to keep accurate, current and orderly records with respect to each pool it operates. The CFTC may suspend, modify or terminate the registration of any registrant for failure to comply with CFTC rules or regulations. Suspension, restriction or termination of USCF&#8217;s registration as a CPO would prevent it, until such time (if any) as such registration were to be reinstated, from managing, and might result in the termination of, the Trust Series or the Related Public Funds.

&#160;

Under certain circumstances, the CEA grants shareholders the right to institute a reparations proceeding before the CFTC against USCF (as a registered commodity pool operator), as well as those of their respective employees who are required to be registered under the CEA. Shareholders may also be able to maintain a private right of action for certain violations of the CEA.

&#160;

Pursuant to authority in the CEA, the NFA has been formed and registered with the CFTC as a registered futures association. The NFA is the only self regulatory association for commodities professionals other than the exchanges. As such, the NFA promulgates rules governing the conduct of commodity professionals and disciplines those professionals that do not comply with such standards. The CFTC has delegated to the NFA responsibility for the registration of commodity pool operation. USCF is a member of the NFA. As a member of the NFA, USCF is subject to NFA standards relating to fair trade practices, financial condition, and consumer protection.

&#160;

The CEA requires all FCMs, such as USCI&#8217;s, CPER&#8217;s or USAG&#8217;s clearing brokers, to meet and maintain specified fitness and financial requirements, to segregate customer funds from proprietary funds and account separately for all customers&#8217; funds and positions, and to maintain specified books and records open to inspection by the staff of the CFTC. The CFTC has similar authority over introducing brokers, or persons who solicit or accept orders for commodity interest trades but who do not accept margin deposits for the execution of trades. The CEA authorizes the CFTC to regulate trading by FCMs and by their officers and directors, permits the CFTC to require action by exchanges in the event of market emergencies, and establishes an administrative procedure under which customers may institute complaints for damages arising from alleged violations of the CEA. 

&#160;

The regulations of the CFTC and the NFA prohibit any representation by a person registered with the CFTC or by any member of the NFA, that registration with the CFTC, or membership in the NFA, in any respect indicates that the CFTC or the NFA, as the case may be, has approved or endorsed that person or that person&#8217;s trading program or objectives. The registrations and memberships of the parties described in this summary must not be considered as constituting any such approval or endorsement. Likewise, no futures exchange has given or will give any similar approval or endorsement.

&#160;

&#160; 40 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Regulations require enhanced customer protections, risk management programs, internal monitoring and controls, capital and liquidity standards, customer disclosures and auditing and examination programs for FCMs. The rules are intended to afford greater assurances to market participants that customer segregated funds and secured amounts are protected, customers are provided with appropriate notice of the risks of futures trading and of the FCMs with which they may choose to do business, FCMs are monitoring and managing risks in a robust manner, the capital and liquidity of FCMs are strengthened to safeguard the continued operations, and the auditing and examination programs of the CFTC and the self-regulatory organizations are monitoring the activities of FCMs in a thorough manner.

&#160;

Each Trust Series&#8217; investors are afforded prescribed rights for reparations under the CEA against USCF (as a registered commodity pool operator), as well as its respective employees who are required to be registered under the CEA. Investors may also be able to maintain a private right of action for violations of the CEA. The CFTC has adopted rules implementing the reparation provisions of the CEA, which provide that any person may file a complaint for a reparations award with the CFTC for violation of the CEA against a floor broker or an FCM, introducing broker, commodity trading advisor, CPO, and their respective associated persons.

&#160;

The regulation of commodity interest trading in the United States and other countries is an evolving area of the law. Below are discussed several key regulatory items that are relevant to the Funds. The various statements made in this summary are subject to modification by legislative action and changes in the rules and regulations of the CFTC, the NFA, the futures exchanges, clearing organizations and other regulatory bodies. In addition, with regard to any other rules that the CFTC or SEC may adopt in the future, the effect of any such regulatory changes on the Trust and each Trust Series is impossible to predict, but it could be substantial and adverse.

&#160; 

Futures Contracts and Position Limits 

&#160;

The CFTC is generally prohibited by statute from regulating trading on non-U.S. futures exchanges and markets. The CFTC, however, has adopted regulations relating to the marketing of non-U.S. futures contracts in the United States. These regulations permit certain contracts on non-U.S. exchanges to be offered and sold in the United States.

&#160;

The CFTC has proposed to adopt limits on speculative positions in 28 physical commodity futures and option contracts and swaps that are economically equivalent to such contracts in the agriculture, energy and metals markets and rules addressing the circumstances under which market participants would be required to aggregate their positions with other persons under common ownership or control (the &#8220;Position Limit Rules&#8221;). The Position Limit Rules would, among other things: identify which contracts are subject to speculative position limits; set thresholds that restrict the number of speculative positions that a person may hold in a spot month, individual month, and all months combined; create an exemption for positions that constitute bona fide hedging transactions; impose responsibilities on designated contract markets (&#8220;DCMs&#8221;) and swap execution facilities (&#8220;SEFs&#8221;) to establish position limits or, in some cases, position accountability rules; and apply to both futures and swaps across four relevant venues: OTC, DCMs, SEFs as well as non-U.S. located platforms. The CFTC&#8217;s first attempt at finalizing the Position Limit Rules, in 2011, was successfully challenged by market participants in 2012 and, since then, the CFTC has re-proposed them and solicited comments from market participants multiple times.

&#160;

Until such time as the Position Limit Rules are adopted, the regulatory architecture in effect prior to the adoption of the Position Limit Rules will govern transactions in commodities and related derivatives (collectively, &#8220;Referenced Contracts&#8221;). Under that system, the CFTC enforces federal limits on speculation in agricultural products (e.g., corn, wheat and soy), while futures exchanges enforce position limits and accountability levels for agricultural and certain energy products (e.g., oil and natural gas). As a result, a Trust Series may be limited with respect to the size of its investments in any commodities subject to these limits. Finally, subject to certain narrow exceptions, the Position Limit Rules require the aggregation, for purposes of the position limits, of all positions in the 28 Referenced Contracts held by a single entity and its affiliates, regardless of whether such position existed on U.S. futures exchanges, non-U.S. futures exchanges, in cleared swaps or in OTC swaps. Under the CFTC&#8217;s existing position limits requirements and the Position Limit Rules, a market participant is generally required to aggregate all positions for which that participant controls the trading decisions with all positions for which that participant has a 10 percent or greater ownership interest in an account or position, as well as the positions of two or more persons acting pursuant to an express or implied agreement or understanding. At this time, it is unclear how the Position Limit Rules may affect a Trust Series, but the effect may be substantial and adverse. By way of example, the Position Limit Rules may negatively impact the ability of a Trust Series to meet its investment objectives through limits that may inhibit USCF&#8217;s ability to sell additional Creation Baskets of a Trust Series.

Margin Requirements 

&#160; 

Futures and Cleared Swaps 

&#160;

Original or initial margin is the minimum amount of funds that must be deposited by a commodity interest trader with the trader&#8217;s broker to initiate and maintain an open position in futures contracts. Maintenance margin is the amount (generally less than the original margin) to which a trader&#8217;s account may decline before he must deliver additional margin. A margin deposit is like a cash performance bond. It helps assure the trader&#8217;s performance of the futures contracts that he or she purchases or sells. Futures contracts are customarily bought and sold on initial margin that represents a very small percentage (ranging upward from 5%) of the aggregate purchase or sales price of the contract. Because of such low margin requirements, price fluctuations occurring in the futures markets may create profits and losses that, in relation to the amount invested, are greater than are customary in other forms of investment or speculation. As discussed below, adverse price changes in the futures contract may result in margin requirements that greatly exceed the initial margin. In addition, the amount of margin required in connection with a particular futures contract is set from time to time by the exchange on which the contract is traded and may be modified from time to time by the exchange during the term of the contract.

&#160;

Brokerage firms, such as the Trust Series&#8217; clearing brokers, carrying accounts for traders in commodity interest contracts may not accept lower, and generally require higher, amounts of margin as a matter of policy to further protect themselves. The clearing brokers require a Trust Series to make margin deposits equal to exchange minimum levels for all commodity interest contracts. This requirement may be altered from time to time in the clearing brokers&#8217; discretion.

&#160;

Margin requirements are computed each day by the relevant clearing organization and a trader&#8217;s clearing broker. When the market value of a particular open commodity interest position changes to a point where the margin on deposit does not satisfy maintenance margin requirements, a margin call is made by the broker. With respect to a Trust Series&#8217; trading, a Trust Series (and not its investors) is subject to margin calls.

&#160;

Finally, many major U.S. exchanges have passed certain cross margining arrangements involving procedures pursuant to which the futures and options positions held in an account would, in the case of some accounts, be aggregated and margin requirements would be assessed on a portfolio basis, measuring the total risk of the combined positions.

&#160; 

Options 

&#160;

When a trader purchases an option, there is no margin requirement; however, the option premium must be paid in full. When a trader sells an option, on the other hand, he or she may be required to deposit margin in an amount determined by the margin requirements established for the underlying interest and, in addition, an amount substantially equal to the current premium for the option. The margin requirements imposed on the selling of options, although adjusted to reflect the probability that out-of-the-money options will not be exercised, can in fact be higher than those imposed in dealing in the futures markets directly. Complicated margin requirements apply to spreads and conversions, which are complex trading strategies in which a trader acquires a mixture of options positions and positions in the underlying interest.

&#160; 

OTC Swaps 

&#160;

In October 2015 the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the FDIC, the Farm Credit Administration, and the FHFA (each an Agency and, collectively, the Agencies) jointly adopted final rules to establish minimum margin and capital requirements for registered swap dealers, major swap participants, security-based swap dealers, and major security-based swap participants (Swap Entities) that are subject to the jurisdiction of one of the Agencies (such entities, Covered Swap Entities, and the joint final rules, the Final Margin Rules).

&#160;

&#160; 42 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

When they take effect, the Final Margin Rules will subject non-cleared swaps and non-cleared security-based swaps between Covered Swap Entities and Swap Entities, and between Covered Swap Entities and financial end users that have material swaps exposure (i.e., an average daily aggregate notional of $8 billion or more in non-cleared swaps calculated in accordance with the Final Margin Rules), to a mandatory two-way minimum initial margin requirement. The minimum amount of the initial margin required to be posted or collected would be either the amount calculated by the Covered Swap Entity using a standardized schedule set forth as an appendix to the Final Margin Rules, which provides the gross initial margin (as a percentage of total notional exposure) for certain asset classes, or an internal margin model of the Covered Swap Entity conforming to the requirements of the Final Margin Rules that is approved by the Agency having jurisdiction over the particular Covered Swap Entity. The Final Margin Rules specify the types of collateral that may be posted or collected as initial margin for non-cleared swaps and non-cleared security-based swaps with financial end users (generally cash, certain government, government-sponsored enterprise securities, certain liquid debt, certain equity securities, certain eligible publicly traded debt, and gold); and sets forth haircuts for certain collateral asset classes.

&#160;

The Final Margin Rules will require minimum variation margin to be exchanged daily for non-cleared swaps and non-cleared security-based swaps between Covered Swap Entities and Swap Entities and between Covered Swap Entities and all financial end-users (without regard to the swaps exposure of the particular financial end-user). The minimum variation margin amount is the daily mark-to-market change in the value of the swap to the Covered Swap Entity, taking into account variation margin previously posted or collected. For non-cleared swaps and security-based swaps between Covered Swap Entities and financial end-users, variation margin may be posted or collected in cash or non-cash collateral that is considered eligible for initial margin purposes. Variation margin is not subject to segregation with an independent, third-party custodian, and may, if permitted by contract, be rehypothecated.

&#160;

The Fund is not a Covered Swap Entity under the Final Margin Rules but it is a financial end-user. Accordingly, the Fund will be subject to the variation margin requirements of the Final Margin Rules, which will become effective for the Fund on March 1, 2017. However, the Fund will not have material swaps exposure and, accordingly, the Fund will not be subject to the initial margin requirements of the Final Margin Rules.

&#160;

The CFTC and the SEC are required to adopt their own versions of the Final Margin Rules that are comparable to the Final Margin Rules. The CFTC&#8217;s and SEC&#8217;s rules will only apply to a limited number of registered swap dealers, security-based swap dealers, major swap participants, and major security-based swap participants that are not subject to the jurisdiction of one of the Agencies. The CFTC finalized its margin rules on December 16, 2015. The CFTC&#8217;s rules are substantially the same as the Final Margin Rules. The SEC has yet to finalize its margin rules.

&#160; 

Mandatory Clearing of Swaps 

&#160;

Regulations require that certain transactions ultimately falling within the definition of &#8220;swap&#8221; be executed on organized exchanges or &#8220;swap execution facilities&#8221; and cleared through regulated clearing organizations (&#8220;derivative clearing organizations&#8221; (&#8220;DCOs&#8221;)), if the CFTC mandates the central clearing of a particular contract and such contract is &#8220;made available to trade&#8221; on a swap execution facility. Currently, swap dealers, major swap participants, commodity pools, certain private funds and entities predominantly engaged in financial activities are required to execute on a swap execution facility, and clear, certain interest rate swaps and index-based credit default swaps. As a result, if a Trust Series enters into any of the interest rate or index-based credit default swaps that are subject to these requirements, such swaps will be required to be executed on a swap execution facility and centrally cleared. Mandatory clearing and &#8220;made available to trade&#8221; determinations with respect to additional types of swaps are expected in the future, and, when finalized, could require each Trust Series to electronically execute and centrally clear certain OTC instruments presently entered into and settled on a bi-lateral basis. If a swap is required to be cleared, the initial margin will be set by the relevant clearing organization, subject to certain regulatory requirements and guidelines.

&#160; 

Other Requirements for Swaps 

&#160;

Swaps that are not required to be cleared and executed on an SEF but that are executed bilaterally are also subject to various requirements pursuant to CFTC regulations, including, among other things, reporting and recordkeeping requirements and, depending on the status of the counterparties, trading documentation requirements and dispute resolution requirements. If a Trust Series engages in non-cleared swap transactions it may be subject to some or all of these requirements.

&#160;

&#160; 43 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

In addition to the rules and regulations imposed under the Dodd-Frank Act, swap dealers that are European banks may also be subject to European Market Infrastructure Regulation (&#8220;EMIR&#8221;). EMIR imposes requirements on non-cleared derivatives that are similar to those imposed by the CFTC and other regulators in the United States and which are described above. A Trust Series may be indirectly impacted by EMIR to the extent that it engages in derivatives transactions with counterparties that are subject to EMIR.
