Our Company

&#160;

First Guaranty Bancshares, Inc. ("First Guaranty" or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) is a Louisiana-chartered bank holding company headquartered in Hammond, Louisiana. Our wholly owned subsidiary, First Guaranty Bank (the &#8220;Bank&#8221;), a Louisiana-chartered commercial bank, provides personalized commercial banking services mainly to Louisiana customers through 21 banking facilities primarily located in the Market Services Areas (MSAs), of Hammond, Baton Rouge, Lafayette and Shreveport-Bossier City. Our principal business consists of attracting deposits from the general public and local municipalities in our market areas and investing those deposits, together with funds generated from operations and borrowings in lending and in securities activities to serve the credit needs of our customer base, including commercial real estate loans, commercial and industrial loans, one- to four-family residential real estate loans, construction and land development loans, agricultural and farmland loans, and to a lesser extent, consumer and multifamily loans. We also participate in certain syndicated loans, including shared national credits, with other financial institutions. We offer a variety of deposit accounts to consumers and small businesses, including personal and business checking and savings accounts, time deposits, money market accounts and demand accounts. We invest a portion of our assets in securities issued by the United States Government and its agencies, state and municipal obligations, corporate debt securities, mutual funds, and equity securities. We also invest in mortgage-backed securities primarily issued or guaranteed by United States Government agencies or enterprises. In addition, we offer a broad range of consumer services, including personal and commercial credit cards, remote deposit capture, safe deposit boxes, official checks, internet banking, automated teller machines, online bill pay, mobile banking and lockbox services.

&#160;

At December 31, 2015, we had consolidated total assets of $1.5 billion, total deposits of $1.3 billion and total shareholders&#8217; equity of $118.2 million.

&#160;

Recent Events

&#160;

In November 2015, the Company completed a public offering of 626,560 shares of its common stock, par value $1.00 per share, at a public offering price of $18.50 per share for net proceeds of $9.3 million. Concurrent with the completion of the offering, the Company's shares began to trade on the Nasdaq Global Market. Following the completion of the offering, the Company declared a 10% stock dividend.

&#160;

In December 2015, the Company issued a $15.0 million subordinated note to Edgar Ray Smith III, a director of the Company in a private placement. The subordinated note is for a ten-year term and will bear interest at a fixed annual rate of 4.0% for the first five years of the term and then adjust to a floating rate based on the Prime Rate plus 75 basis points for the period of time after the fifth year until redemption or maturity. Also in December 2015, the Company entered into a term loan of $25.0 million with First Tennessee Bank National Association secured by approximately 85% of the stock of the Company's wholly-owned bank subsidiary, First Guaranty Bank. The term loan will bear interest quarterly and the interest rate will float based on the 3-month LIBOR plus 250 basis points. The term loan will be due and payable five years from the origination date (December 2020).

&#160;

Following the completion of the capital raising actions noted above, on December 22, 2015, the Company redeemed all of the 39,435 shares of its Senior Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series C, that had been issued to the United States Department of Treasury pursuant to the Small Business Lending Fund (the "SBLF"). The shares were redeemed at their liquidation value of $1,000 per share plus accrued and unpaid dividends for a total redemption price of $39.5 million.

Our History and Growth 

&#160;

First Guaranty Bank was founded in Amite, Louisiana on March 12, 1934. While the origins of First Guaranty Bank go back over 80 years, we began our modern history in 1993 when an investor group, led by Marshall T. Reynolds, our Chairman, invested $3.6 million in First Guaranty Bank as part of a recapitalization plan with the objective of building a community-focused commercial bank in our Louisiana markets. Since the implementation of that recapitalization plan, we have grown from six branches and $159 million in assets at the end of 1993 to 21 branches and $1.5 billion in assets at December 31, 2015. We have also paid a quarterly dividend for 90 consecutive quarters at December 31, 2015. On July 27, 2007, we formed First Guaranty Bancshares and completed a one-for-one share exchange that resulted in First Guaranty Bank becoming the wholly-owned subsidiary of First Guaranty Bancshares (the &#8220;Share Exchange&#8221;) and First Guaranty Bancshares becoming an SEC reporting public company.

&#160;

Since our Share Exchange, we have supplemented our organic growth with two acquisitions, which added stable deposits that provided funding for our lending business and extended our geographic footprint in the Baton Rouge and Hammond MSAs.

In addition, our participation in the SBLF enabled us to leverage $39.4 million in capital received from the United States Department of the Treasury (the &#8220;U.S. Treasury&#8221;) to grow our lending business. As a result of the SBLF capital, we were able to grow our qualified small business lending by $54.4 million since 2011. The majority of this loan growth has been concentrated in owner-occupied commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans. In December of 2015, we redeemed the $39.4 million in preferred stock issued to the U.S. Treasury.

&#160;

Our Markets

&#160;

Our primary market areas include the Louisiana MSAs of Hammond, Baton Rouge, Lafayette, and Shreveport-Bossier City. Most of our branches are located along the major Louisiana interstates of I-12, I-55, I-10 and I-20.

&#160;

Hammond MSA. We are headquartered in Hammond, Louisiana and approximately 50% of our deposits are in the Hammond MSA, our largest deposit concentration market. We had a deposit market share of 36.4% (at June 30, 2015) in the Hammond MSA, placing us first overall. Hammond is the principal city of the Hammond MSA, which includes all of Tangipahoa Parish, and is located approximately 50 miles north of New Orleans and 30 miles east of Baton Rouge. The Hammond MSA has a population of approximately 125,000. Hammond is intersected by I-55 and I-12, which are two heavily traveled interstate highways. As a result of Hammond's close proximity to New Orleans and Baton Rouge, Hammond and Tangipahoa Parish are among the fastest growing cities and Parishes in Louisiana. There is an abundance of new development, both commercial and residential, as well as numerous hotels which absorb overflowing demand for rooms near major events in New Orleans. Hammond is also the home of the main campus of Southeastern Louisiana University, with an enrollment of approximately 15,000 students. 

The Hammond Northshore Regional Airport is a backup landing site for the Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport. The Louisiana National Guard maintains a 56-acre campus at the airport, which is home to the 1/244 th Air Assault Helicopter Battalion. Port Manchac, which provides egress via Lake Pontchartrain with the Gulf of Mexico, is located 15 miles south of Hammond. The Hammond Amtrak Station located in downtown Hammond is on Amtrak's City of New Orleans route, which runs from New Orleans to Chicago, Illinois. The combination of highway, air, sea and rail transportation has made Hammond a major transportation and commercial hub of Louisiana. Hammond hosts numerous warehouses and distribution centers, and is a major distribution point for Wal-Mart and Winn Dixie.

&#160;

Baton Rouge MSA . Baton Rouge is the capital of Louisiana and the MSA has a population of approximately 824,000. As the capital city, Baton Rouge is the political hub for Louisiana. The state government is the largest employer in Baton Rouge. Baton Rouge is the farthest inland port on the Mississippi River that can accommodate ocean-going tankers and cargo carriers. As a result, Baton Rouge's largest industry is petrochemical production and manufacturing. The ExxonMobil facility in Baton Rouge is one of the largest oil refineries in the country. Baton Rouge also has a diverse economy comprised of healthcare, education, finance and motion pictures. The main campus of Louisiana State University, with an enrollment of approximately 30,000 students, and Southern University, with an enrollment of approximately 7,000 students, are located in Baton Rouge. 

&#160;

Our market areas in the Baton Rouge MSA also include the Livingston and St. Helena Parishes. Livingston Parish's growth is tied to Baton Rouge as it is a suburban community with many of its residents commuting to Baton Rouge for employment. The economy for St. Helena Parish is comprised primarily of forestry operations, construction, manufacturing, educational services, health care, and social assistance. 

&#160;

Lafayette MSA. Lafayette is Louisiana's third largest city and deposit market, and is located in the Lafayette-Acadiana region. The Lafayette MSA has a population of approximately 479,000. Its major industries include oil and gas, healthcare, construction, manufacturing and agriculture. With respect to agriculture, sugarcane and rice are the leaders among the plant producers within the area, with approximately 30,000 acres of sugarcane and 51,000 acres of rice plantings. Lafayette also has numerous beef producers and fisheries. We finance agricultural loans, predominately out of our Abbeville and Jennings branches, in Southwest Louisiana. Lafayette is home to the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, with an enrollment of approximately 17,000 students. 

Shreveport-Bossier City MSA. Our primary market areas in northwest Louisiana are the Bossier and Caddo Parishes, which are a part of the Shreveport-Bossier City MSA. The Shreveport and Bossier City MSA has a population of approximately 451,000. Shreveport and Bossier City are located in northern Louisiana on I-20, approximately 15 miles from the Texas state border and 185 miles east of Dallas, Texas. Our primary market area has a diversified economy with employment in services, government and wholesale/retail trade constituting the basis of the local economy, with service jobs being the largest component. The majority of the services are health care related as Shreveport has become a regional hub for health care. The casino gaming industry, with its Las Vegas-style gaming, year-round festivals and local dining, also supports a significant number of service jobs. The energy sector has a prominent role in the regional economy, resulting from oil and gas exploration and drilling. Bossier Parish is also the home to the Barksdale Air Force Base, which has 12,000 employees. 

&#160;

Our Strategy

Our mission is to increase shareholder value while providing services for and contributing to the growth and welfare of the communities that we serve. As "The Relationship Bank," our mission is to become the bank of choice for small business and consumer customers who are located in both metropolitan and rural markets. We desire to grow our market share along Louisiana's key interstate corridors of major interstates I-12, I-55, I-10 and I-20 both organically and through strategic acquisitions. To achieve this, we seek to implement the following strategies:

Continue to Increase Total Loans as a Percentage of Assets . We plan to continue to change our asset composition by growing our loan portfolio to increase our total loans as a percentage of our assets. Our loan to deposit ratio was 64.9% as of December 31, 2015. The growth in our loan portfolio has broadened our customer base, reduced our interest rate risk exposure to fixed rate investment securities, and helped us expand our net interest margin. We have invested in the internal development of our lending department along with the select addition of experienced lenders.

We intend to continue to grow our loan portfolio organically by targeting small and medium-sized businesses engaged in manufacturing, agriculture, petrochemicals, healthcare and other professional services. As a participant in the SBLF, we developed and executed a sustained loan growth campaign focused on these target loan areas beginning in 2011 that far exceeded our original goals of the program. We are continuing this campaign even after we redeemed our SBLF preferred stock in December 2015. Our gross loan portfolio has increased by $268.5 million, or 46.8%, to $841.6 million at December 31, 2015 from $573.1 million at December 31, 2011.

&#160;

Our commercial lending team is organized around our regional market areas of Louisiana. A senior experienced lender leads each market team and ensures that our lenders deliver timely service to customers, meet and exceed expectations of loan approval time, and broaden customer relationships through referrals. We hired a seasoned chief lending officer in 2015 who will manage our loan portfolio and foster strong commercial and consumer lending opportunities in both our current and new market areas.

We are expanding upon our successful small business lending program with a new emphasis on growing our SBA, USDA and commercial leasing lending programs. We have invested in training key personnel to focus on this market as we believe that SBA, USDA and commercial leasing loans can serve as new market opportunities for our Bank. We will continue to be a leading agricultural lender and grow our FSA lending.

Over the last eight years, we have pursued a focused program to participate in syndicated loans (loans made by a group of lenders, including us, who share or participate in a specific loan, which is typically secured by business assets or equipment, and also commercial real estate) with a larger regional financial institution as the lead lender. Our focus has been to finance middle market companies whose borrowing needs typically range from $25 million to $75 million. Syndicated loans diversify our loan portfolio, increase our yield and mitigate interest rate risk due to the variable rate pricing structure of the loans. We expect to continue our syndicated lending program but our local loan originations remain our funding priority.

We intend to grow our consumer loan portfolio principally through our residential mortgage program. We hired an experienced team leader in 2013 to grow the consumer residential mortgage business and we have invested in systems to accelerate the decision making process to deliver quality customer service to our customers. We intend to leverage our existing branch network to expand our retail lending. We have expanded our technology to make it easier for both individual and business customers to bank with us through mobile and internet banking.

Expand Individual and Business Deposits and Maintain our Public Funds Program . Our deposit strategy is focused on continuing to expand our individual and business deposit bases while maintaining our public funds deposit program. Our deposit strategy leverages off the market share dominance that we have in several of our markets, such as the Hammond MSA where we had a 36.4% deposit market share at June 30, 2015, placing us first overall. In recent years, we have worked to prudently and diligently lower our cost of deposits. Our commercial and consumer lending teams focus on building business and individual deposits concurrent with loans. Our public funds department is dedicated to maintaining strong relationships with our well diversified base of public entities. We provide a variety of services to our public funds clients. Our public funds deposit program has provided us with a stable and low cost source of funding. We will continue to concentrate on keeping many of these funds under contract as we are often the fiscal agent for these governmental agencies which helps maintain this funding.

Maintain Strong Asset Quality . We emphasize a disciplined credit culture based on intimate market knowledge, close ties to our customers, sound underwriting standards and experienced loan officers. While the challenging operating environment which began following the 2008-2009 recession of the United States contributed to an increase in problem assets, management's primary objective has been to expeditiously reduce the level of non-performing assets through diligent monitoring and aggressive resolution efforts. The results of this effort are reflected in our improved asset quality. At December 31, 2015, non-performing assets totaled $22.0 million, or 1.51% of total assets, and has declined by $6.9 million from $28.9 million, or 2.13% of total assets at December 31, 2011.

&#160;

Pursue Strategic Acquisitions. Our strategy is to supplement our organic growth by executing a targeted and disciplined acquisition strategy of community banks and non-banking financial companies as opportunities arise. We have successfully integrated prior acquisitions as demonstrated by our acquisitions of Greensburg Bancshares, Inc. in 2011 and Homestead Bancorp, Inc. in 2007. Our board of directors' broad experiences across many industries assists us in expanding our business. Our Chairman, Marshall T. Reynolds, has more than 40 years of experience in managing the growth of commercial banks both organically and through acquisitions throughout the United States. 

We believe our ability to execute an acquisition strategy has been enhanced by our internal investments in the areas of operations, compliance, finance, credit and information technology that provide us with a scalable platform for growth. Our focus will be on targets with quality loan portfolios and a long term deposit customer base, particularly those with high levels of consumer and retail checking accounts, low cost deposits and favorable market share. We intend to pursue opportunities that will be accretive to earnings, result in a tangible book value earn back of approximately three years, strengthen our franchise, and ultimately enhance shareholder value. We also believe the listing of our shares on NASDAQ in November 2015 provides us with a more marketable and liquid stock currency that will be attractive to potential targets.

Lending Activities

We offer a broad range of loan and lease products with a variety of rates and terms throughout our market areas, including business loans to primarily small to medium-sized businesses and professionals, as well as loans to individuals. Our lending operations consist of the following major segments: non-farm, non-residential loans secured by real estate, commercial and industrial loans, one- to four-family residential loans, construction and land development loans, agricultural loans, farmland loans, consumer and other loans, and multifamily loans. All loan decisions are locally made which can allow for a faster approval process than many of our larger regional and nationwide bank competitors.

Non-Farm Non-Residential Loans . Non-farm non-residential loans are an integral part of our operating strategy. We expect to continue to emphasize this business line in the future with a target loan size of $1.0 million to $10.0 million to small businesses and real estate projects in our market area. At December 31, 2015 loans secured by non-farm non-residential properties totaled $323.4 million, or 38.3% of our total loan portfolio. Our non-farm non-residential loans are secured by commercial real estate generally located in our market area, which may be owner-occupied or non-owner occupied. Following receipt of the SBLF capital, we have increased our owner-occupied commercial real estate loans by $37.0 million since December 31, 2011. Our owner-occupied commercial real estate loans totaled $144.3 million, or 44.6% of total non-farm non-residential loans at December 31, 2015. Permanent loans on non-farm non-residential properties are generally originated in amounts up to 85% of the appraised value of the property for owner-occupied commercial real estate properties and up to 80% of the appraised value of the property for non- owner-occupied commercial real estate properties. We consider a number of factors in originating non-farm non-residential loans. We evaluate the qualifications and financial condition of the borrower (including credit history), profitability and expertise, as well as the value and condition of the mortgaged property securing the loan. We consider the financial resources of the borrower, the borrower's experience in owning or managing similar property and the borrower's payment history with us and other financial institutions. In evaluating the property securing the loan, the factors we consider include the net operating income of the mortgaged property before debt service and depreciation, the debt service coverage ratio (the ratio of net operating income to debt service) to ensure that the borrower's net operating income together with the borrower's other sources of income is at least 125% of the annual debt service and the ratio of the loan amount to the appraised value of the mortgaged property. We generally obtain personal guarantees from the borrower or a third party as a condition to originating commercial real estate loans. All non-farm non-residential loans are appraised by outside independent appraisers approved by the board of directors. 

Our non-farm non-residential loans are diversified by borrower and industry group, and generally secured by improved property such as hotels, office buildings, retail stores, gaming facilities, warehouses, church buildings and other non-residential buildings. Non-farm non-residential loans are generally made at rates that adjust above the prime rate as reported in the Wall Street Journal , that mature in three to five years and with principal amortization for a period of up to 20 years. We will also originate fixed-rate, non-farm non-residential loans that mature in three to five years with principal amortization of up to 20 years. Our largest concentration of non-farm non-residential loans is secured by hotels, and such loans are generally made only to hotel operators known to management. We will finance the construction of the hotel project and upon completion the loan will convert to permanent financing with a balloon feature after three to five years. 

Loans secured by non-farm non-residential real estate are generally larger and involve a greater degree of risk than residential real estate loans. The borrower's creditworthiness and the feasibility and cash flow potential of the project is of primary concern in non-farm non-residential real estate lending. Loans secured by income properties are generally larger and involve greater risks than residential mortgage loans, because payments on loans secured by income properties are often dependent on the successful operation or management of the properties. As a result, repayment of such loans may be subject to a greater extent than residential real estate loans to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy.

Commercial and Industrial Loans . Commercial and industrial loans totaled $224.2 million, or 26.6% of our total loan portfolio at December 31, 2015. Commercial and industrial loans (excluding syndicated loans) are generally made to small and mid-sized companies located within the State of Louisiana. We also participate in government programs which guarantee portions of commercial and industrial loans such as the SBA and USDA. In most cases, we require collateral of equipment, accounts receivable, inventory, chattel or other assets before making a commercial business loan. We have a dedicated staff within our credit department that monitors asset based lending and regularly conducts reviews of borrowing based certificates, aging and inventory reports, and on-site audits. Our commercial term loans totaled $136.7 million at December 31, 2015, or 61.0% of total commercial and industrial loans. Our commercial and industrial maximum loan to value limit is 80%. Our commercial term loans are generally fixed interest rate loans, indexed to the prime rate, with terms of up to five years, depending on the needs of the borrower and the useful life of the underlying collateral. Our commercial lines of credit totaled $87.5 million at December 31, 2015, or 39.0% of total commercial and industrial loans. Typically, our commercial lines of credit are adjustable rate lines, indexed to the prime interest rate, which generally mature yearly. Our underwriting standards for commercial and industrial loans include a review of the applicant's tax returns, financial statements, credit history, the underlying collateral and an assessment of the applicant's ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loan based on cash flow generated by the applicant's business. We generally obtain personal guarantees from the borrower or a third party as a condition to originating commercial and industrial loans. 

Over the last eight years, we pursued a focused program to participate in syndicated loans (loans made by a group of lenders, including us, who share or participate in a specific loan) with a larger regional financial institution as the lead lender. Syndicated loans are typically made to large businesses (which are referred to as shared national credits) or middle market companies (which do not meet the regulatory definition of shared national credits), both of which are secured by business assets or equipment, and also commercial real estate. The syndicate group for both types of loans usually consists of two to three other financial institutions. These loans are adjustable-rate loans generally tied to LIBOR. Our participation amounts typically range between $5.0 million and $15.0 million. Our focus has been to finance middle market companies whose borrowing needs typically range from $25.0 million to $75.0 million. Syndicated loans diversify our loan portfolio, increase our yield and mitigate interest rate risk due to the variable rate pricing structure of the loans. We have a defined set of credit guidelines that we use when evaluating these credits. Our credit department independently reviews all syndicate loans and our board of directors has created a special committee to oversee the underwriting and approval of these loans. At December 31, 2015, syndicated loans secured by assets other than commercial real estate totaled $105.9 million, or 47.2% of the commercial and industrial loan portfolio. 

Commercial and industrial loans generally involve increased credit risk and, therefore, typically yield a higher return. The increased risk in commercial and industrial loans derives from the expectation that such loans generally are serviced principally from the operations of the business, and those operations may not be successful. Any interruption or discontinuance of operating cash flows from the business, which may be influenced by events not under the control of the borrower such as economic events and changes in governmental regulations, could materially affect the ability of the borrower to repay the loan. In addition, the collateral securing commercial and industrial loans generally includes movable property such as equipment and inventory, which may decline in value more rapidly than we anticipate exposing us to increased credit risk. As a result of the foregoing, commercial and industrial loans require extensive administration and servicing.

One- to Four- Family Residential Real Estate Loans . At December 31, 2015, our one- to four-family residential real estate loans totaled $129.6 million, or 15.4% of our total loan portfolio. We originate one- to four-family residential real estate loans that are secured primarily by residential property in Louisiana. We generally originate loans in amounts up to 95% of the lesser of the appraised value or purchase price of the mortgaged property. We currently offer one- to four-family residential real estate loans with terms up to 30 years that are generally underwritten according to Fannie Mae guidelines, and we refer to loans that conform to such guidelines as "conforming loans." We generally originate fixed-rate mortgage loans in amounts up to the maximum conforming loan limits as established by the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which at December 31, 2015 was $417,000 for single-family homes in our market area. At December 31, 2015, we held $25.4 million in jumbo loans that are greater than the conforming loan limit. We generally hold our one- to four-family residential real estate loans in our portfolio. We also originate one- to four-family residential real estate loans secured by non-owner occupied properties, but less frequently. Our fixed-rate one- to four-family residential real estate loans include loans that generally amortize on a monthly basis over periods between 10 to 30 years with maturities that range from eight to 30 years. Fixed rate one- to four-family residential real estate loans often remain outstanding for significantly shorter periods than their contractual terms because borrowers have the right to refinance or prepay their loans. We do not offer one- to four-family residential real estate loans specifically designed for borrowers with sub-prime credit scores, including interest-only, negative amortization or payment option adjustable-rate mortgage loans. 

We have diversified our one- to four-family residential real estate loans with the select purchase of conforming mortgage loans that are located outside Louisiana. Our purchased loans are generally serviced by other financial institutions. At December 31, 2015, $33.1 million of our one- to four-family residential real estate loans, or 25.5% of our one- to four-family residential real estate loans, were purchased loans secured by property located outside our market area. The majority of our out of state purchased one- to four-family residential real estate loans are located in West Virginia, Virginia, Pennsylvania and the District of Columbia. Our purchased one- to four-family residential real estate loans must meet our internal underwriting criteria. At December 31, 2015, we had no purchased one- to four-family residential real estate loans that were classified as nonaccruing. While we intend to continue to purchase one- to four-family residential real estate loans from time-to-time, our strategic emphasis for future periods is to increase the volume of our internal originations of such loans.

Our one- to four-family loans also include home equity lines of credit that have second mortgages. At December 31, 2015, we had $6.8 million in home equity lines of credit, which represented 5.2% of our one- to four-family residential real estate loans. Our home equity products are originated in amounts, that when combined with the existing first mortgage loan, do not generally exceed 80% of the loan-to-value ratio of the subject property.

All of our one- to four-family residential mortgages include "due on sale" clauses, which are provisions giving us the right to declare a loan immediately payable if the borrower sells or otherwise transfers an interest in the property to a third party.

Property appraisals on real estate securing our single-family residential loans are made by state certified and licensed independent appraisers approved by the board of directors. Appraisals are performed in accordance with applicable regulations and policies. At our discretion, we obtain either title insurance policies or attorneys' certificates of title, on all first mortgage real estate loans originated. We also require fire and casualty insurance on all properties securing our one- to four-family residential loans. We also require the borrower to obtain flood insurance where appropriate. In some instances, we charge a fee equal to a percentage of the loan amount, commonly referred to as points.

Construction and Land Development Loans . We offer loans to finance the construction of various types of commercial and residential property. At December 31, 2015, $56.1 million, or 6.6% of our total loan portfolio consisted of construction and land development loans. Construction loans to builders generally are offered with terms of up to 18 months and interest rates are tied to the prime lending rate. These loans generally are offered as fixed or adjustable-rate loans. We will originate residential construction loans for individual borrowers and builders, provided all necessary plans and permits have been obtained. Construction loan funds are disbursed as the project progresses. We will originate construction loans up to 80% of the estimated completed value of the project and we will originate land development loans in amounts up to 75% of the value of the property as developed. We will originate owner occupied one-to-four family residential construction loans up to 90% of the estimated completed value of the property.

Construction and land development financing is generally considered to involve a higher degree of risk of loss than long-term financing on improved, occupied real estate. Risk of loss on a construction loan is dependent largely upon the accuracy of the initial estimate of the property's value at completion of construction and development and the estimated cost (including interest) of construction. During the construction phase, a number of factors could result in delays and cost overruns. If the estimate of construction costs proves to be inaccurate, we may be required to advance funds beyond the amount originally committed to permit completion of the project. Additionally, if the estimate of value proves to be inaccurate, we may be confronted, at or prior to the maturity of the loan, with a project having a value which is insufficient to assure full repayment.

&#160;

Agricultural Loans. We are the leading lender for agricultural loans in our Southwest Louisiana market. Our agricultural lending includes loans to farmers for the purpose of cultivating rice, sugarcane, soybeans, timber, poultry and cattle. Agricultural loans are generally secured by crops, but may include additional collateral such as farm equipment or vehicles. Agricultural loans totaled $25.8 million, or 3.1% of our total loan portfolio at December 31, 2015. Such loans are generally offered with fixed rates at a margin above prime for a term of generally one year. We will originate agricultural loans in those instances where the borrower's financial strength and creditworthiness has been established. Agricultural loans generally bear higher interest rates than residential loans, but they also may involve a higher risk of default since their repayment is generally dependent on the successful operation of the borrower's business. Substantially all of our originated agricultural loans are guaranteed by the U.S. Farm Service Agency. We generally obtain personal guarantees from the borrower or a third party as a condition to originating its agricultural loans. 

&#160;

The underwriting standards used for agricultural loans include a determination of the borrower's ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loan from normal cash flows generated in the borrower's business. The financial strength of each applicant also is assessed through review of financial statements and tax returns provided by the applicant. The creditworthiness of a borrower is derived from a review of credit reports as well as a search of public records. Once originated, agricultural loans are reviewed periodically. Financial statements are requested at least annually and are reviewed for substantial deviations or changes that might affect repayment of the loan. Loan officers also visit the premises of borrowers to observe the business premises, facilities, and personnel and to inspect the collateral. Underwriting standards for agricultural loans are different for each type of loan depending on the financial strength of the borrower and the value of collateral offered as security.

&#160;

Farmland Loans. We originate first mortgage loans secured by farmland. At December 31, 2015, farmland loans totaled $17.7 million, or 2.1% of our total loan portfolio. Such loans are generally fixed-rate loans at a margin over the prime rate with terms up to five years and amortization schedules of up to 20 years (40 years if secured by a guarantee from the U. S. Farm Service Agency). Loans secured by farmland may be made in amounts up to 80% of the value of the farm. However, we will originate farmland loans in amounts up to 100% of the value of the farm if the borrower is able to secure a guarantee from the U.S. Farm Service Agency. Generally, we obtain personal guarantees of the borrower on all loans secured by farmland. 

&#160;

Consumer and Other Loans . We make various types of secured consumer loans that are collateralized by deposits, boats and automobiles as well as unsecured consumer loans. Such loans totaled $54.2 million, or 6.4% of our total loan portfolio at December 31, 2015. Included in other loans were $23.6 million in purchased commercial leases that are serviced by the Bank as of December 31, 2015. Consumer loans generally have a fixed rate at a margin over the prime rate and have terms of three years to ten years. At December 31, 2015, $6.4 million of our consumer loans were unsecured. Our procedure for underwriting consumer loans includes an assessment of the applicant's credit history and ability to meet existing obligations and payments for the proposed loan, as well as an evaluation of the value of the collateral security, if any. 

Consumer loans generally entail greater risk than other types of loans, particularly in the case of loans that are unsecured or are secured by assets that tend to depreciate in value, such as automobiles. As a result, consumer loan collections are primarily dependent on the borrower's continuing financial stability and thus are more likely to be adversely affected by job loss, divorce, illness or personal bankruptcy. In these cases, repossessed collateral for a defaulted consumer loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment for the outstanding loan, and the remaining value often does not warrant further substantial collection efforts against the borrower.

&#160;

Multi-Family Loans . On occasion we will originate loans secured by multifamily real estate. At December 31, 2015, we had $12.6 million or 1.5% of our total loan portfolio in multifamily loans. Such loans may be either fixed- or adjustable-rate loans tied to the prime rate with terms to maturity up to five years and amortization schedules of up to 20 years. We will originate multifamily loans in amounts up to 80% of the value of the multi-family property. Nearly all of our multifamily loans are secured by properties in Louisiana. The underwriting of multi-family loans follows the general guidelines for our non-farm non-residential loans. 

Loans secured by multi-family real estate generally involve a greater degree of credit risk than one- to four-family residential mortgage loans and carry larger loan balances. This increased credit risk is a result of several factors, including the concentration of principal in a limited number of loans and borrowers, the effects of general economic conditions on income producing properties, and the increased difficulty of evaluating and monitoring these types of loans. Furthermore, the repayment of loans secured by multi-family real estate typically depends upon the successful operation of the real estate property securing the loans. If the cash flow from the project is reduced, the borrower's ability to repay the loan may be impaired.

Loan Originations, Sales and Participations. Loan originations are derived from a number of sources such as referrals from our board of directors, existing customers, borrowers, builders, attorneys and walk-in customers. We generally retain the loans that we originate in our loan portfolio and only sell loans infrequently. We had $13.9 million at December 31, 2015 in purchased loan participations that were not syndicated loans. We had $23.6 million in purchased commercial leases that are serviced by the Bank as of December 31, 2015. At December 31, 2015, we had $105.9 million in syndicated loans, of which $89.4 million were shared national credits. 

Loan Approval Authority . We establish various lending limits for executive management and also maintain a loan committee comprised of our directors and management. Generally, loan officers have authority to approve secured loan relationships in amounts up to $100,000 and unsecured loan relationships in amounts up to $25,000. For loans exceeding a loan officer's approval authority, we utilize two methods for approvals: (1) credit officers and (2) the Bank's loan committee. Loan relationships between $100,000 and $500,000 are approved by a combination of credit officers and executive management. The loan committee approves loan relationships of between $500,000 and up to $10.0 million. Any loan relationship exceeding $10.0 million requires the approval of the board of directors. Syndicated loans are approved by the Bank's syndicate loan committee in amounts up to $10.0 million. 

Our lending activities are also subject to Louisiana statutes and internal guidelines limiting the amount we can lend to any one borrower. Subject to certain exceptions, under Louisiana law the Bank may not lend on an unsecured basis to any single borrower (i.e., any one individual or business entity and his or its affiliates) an amount in excess of 20% of the sum of the Bank's capital stock and surplus, or on a secured basis an amount in excess of 50% of the sum of the Bank's capital stock and surplus. At December 31, 2015, our secured legal lending limit was approximately $47.4 million and our unsecured legal lending limit was approximately $19.0 million. None of our borrowers are currently approaching these limits.

&#160;

Deposit Products

Consumer and commercial deposits are attracted principally from within our primary market area through the offering of a selection of deposit instruments including noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing demand, savings accounts and time accounts. Deposit account terms vary according to the minimum balance required, the time period the funds must remain on deposit, and the interest rate. At December 31, 2015, we held $1.3 billion in deposits.

We actively seek to obtain public funds deposits. At December 31, 2015, public funds deposits totaled $568.7 million. We have developed a program for the retention and management of public funds deposits. These deposits are from local government entities such as school districts, hospital districts, sheriff departments and other municipalities. We solicit their operating, savings, and time deposits and we are often the fiscal agent for the municipality. The majority of these deposits are under contractual terms of up to three years. Public funds deposit accounts are collateralized by FHLB letters of credit and by eligible government and government agency securities such as those issued by the FHLB, FFCB, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac. We believe that public funds provide a low cost and stable source of funding. The public funds deposit portfolio has been a key driver of earnings for First Guaranty as we have profitability deployed these funds into investment securities and loans.

The interest rates paid by us on deposits are set at the direction of our executive management. Interest rates are determined based on our liquidity requirements, interest rates paid by our competitors, and our growth goals and applicable regulatory restrictions and requirements. At December 31, 2015, we had $26.7 million in brokered deposits.

Investments

Our investment policy is to provide a source of liquidity, to provide an appropriate return on funds invested, to manage interest rate risk and to meet pledging requirements for our public funds and other borrowings. Our investment securities consist of: (1) U.S. Treasury obligations; (2) U.S. government agency obligations; (3) mortgage-backed securities; (4) corporate and other debt securities; (5) mutual funds and other equity securities and (6) municipal bonds. Our U.S. government agency securities, primarily consisting of government-sponsored enterprises, comprise the largest share of our investment securities, having a fair value of $240.4 million, of which $163.8 million were classified as available-for-sale and $76.6 million as held-to-maturity, at December 31, 2015.

The Bank's management asset liability committee and board investment committee are responsible for regular review of our investment activities and the review and approval of our investment policy. These committees monitor our investment securities portfolio and direct our overall acquisition and allocation of funds, with the goal of structuring our portfolio such that our investment securities provide us with a stable source of income but without exposing us to an excessive degree of market risk. During the last five years, our securities portfolio has generated $92.5 million of pre-tax income. As of December 31, 2015, we had one other than temporary impairment of $0.2 million.

Competition

We face intense competition both in making loans and attracting deposits. Our market areas in Louisiana have a high concentration of financial institutions, many of which are branches of large money center, super-regional and regional banks that have resulted from consolidation of the banking industry in Louisiana. Many of these competitors have greater resources than we do and may offer services that we do not provide, including more attractive pricing than we offer and more extensive branch networks for which they can offer their financial products.

Our larger competitors have a greater ability to finance wide-ranging advertising campaigns through their greater capital resources. Our marketing efforts depend heavily upon referrals from officers, directors and shareholders, selective advertising in local media and direct mail solicitations. We compete for business principally on the basis of personal service to customers, customer access to our officers and directors and competitive interest rates and fees. We also can offer new technologies such as our mobile app and mobile check deposit for consumers and remote deposit capture for commercial customers.

In the financial services industry in recent years, intense market demands, technological and regulatory changes and economic pressures have eroded industry classifications that were once clearly defined. Financial institutions have been forced to diversify their services, increase rates paid on deposits and become more cost effective as a result of competition with one another and with new types of financial services companies, including non-banking competitors. Some of the results of these market dynamics in the financial services industry have been a number of new bank and non-bank competitors, increased merger activity, and increased customer awareness of product and service differences among competitors. These factors could affect our business prospects.

Employees

At December 31, 2015, we had 267 full-time and 22 part-time employees. None of our employees is represented by a collective bargaining group or are parties to a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that our relationship with our employees is good.

Subsidiaries

Other than our wholly-owned bank subsidiary, First Guaranty Bank, we have no subsidiaries.

Supervision and Regulation

&#160;

General

First Guaranty Bank is a Louisiana-chartered commercial bank and is the wholly-owned subsidiary of First Guaranty Bancshares, a Louisiana-chartered banking holding company. First Guaranty Bank&#8217;s deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the FDIC. First Guaranty Bank is subject to extensive regulation by the OFI, as its chartering agency, and by the FDIC, its primary federal regulator and deposit insurer. First Guaranty Bank is required to file reports with, and is periodically examined by, the FDIC and the Louisiana Office of Financial Institutions (the &#8220;OFI&#8221;) concerning its activities and financial condition and must obtain regulatory approvals prior to entering into certain transactions, including, but not limited to, mergers with or acquisitions of other financial institutions. As a registered bank holding company, First Guaranty Bancshares is regulated by the Federal Reserve Board.

&#160;

The regulatory and supervisory structure establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which an institution can engage and is intended primarily for the protection of depositors and the deposit insurance funds, rather than for the protection of shareholders and creditors. The regulatory structure also gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, including policies concerning the establishment of deposit insurance assessment fees, classification of assets and establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes. Any change in such regulatory requirements and policies, whether by the Louisiana legislature, the OFI, the FDIC, the Federal Reserve Board or the United States Congress, could have a material adverse impact on the financial condition and results of operations of First Guaranty Bancshares and First Guaranty Bank. As is further described below, the Dodd-Frank Act has significantly changed the bank regulatory structure and may affect the lending, investment and general operating activities of depository institutions and their holding companies.

&#160;

Set forth below is a summary of certain material statutory and regulatory requirements applicable to First Guaranty Bancshares and First Guaranty Bank. The summary is not intended to be a complete description of such statutes and regulations and their effects on First Guaranty Bancshares and First Guaranty Bank.

&#160;

The Dodd-Frank Act

&#160;

The Dodd-Frank Act significantly changed bank regulation and has affected the lending, investment, trading and operating activities of depository institutions and their holding companies. The Dodd-Frank Act also created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) with extensive powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws. The CFPB has broad rule-making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and savings institutions, including the authority to prohibit &#8220;unfair, deceptive or abusive&#8221; acts and practices. The CFPB also has examination and enforcement authority over all banks and savings institutions with more than $10 billion in assets. Banks and savings institutions with $10 billion or less in assets, such as First Guaranty Bank, will continue to be examined by their applicable federal bank regulators. The Dodd-Frank Act also gave state attorneys general the ability to enforce applicable federal consumer protection laws.

&#160;

The Dodd-Frank Act broadened the base for FDIC assessments for deposit insurance, permanently increasing the maximum amount of deposit insurance to $250,000 per depositor. The Dodd-Frank Act also, among other things, requires originators of certain securitized loans to retain a portion of the credit risk, stipulates regulatory rate-setting for certain debit card interchange fees, repeals restrictions on the payment of interest on commercial demand deposits and contains a number of reforms related to mortgage originations. The Dodd-Frank Act increased the ability of shareholders to influence boards of directors by requiring companies to give shareholders a non-binding vote on executive compensation and so-called &#8220;golden parachute&#8221; payments. The Dodd-Frank Act also directed the Federal Reserve Board to promulgate rules prohibiting excessive compensation paid to company executives, regardless of whether the company is publicly traded or not.

&#160;

Many of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act are subject to delayed effective dates or require the implementing regulations and, therefore, their impact on our operations cannot be fully determined at this time. However, it is likely that the Dodd-Frank Act will increase the regulatory burden, operating costs, compliance costs and interest expense for First Guaranty Bank and First Guaranty Bancshares.

&#160;

SBLF Participation

&#160;

On December 22, 2015, First Guaranty redeemed all of the 39,435 shares of its Senior Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series C, that had been issued to the United States Department of Treasury pursuant to SBLF in September 2011. The shares were redeemed at their liquidation value of $1,000 per share plus accrued and unpaid dividends for a total redemption price of $39.5 million.

&#160;

Louisiana Bank Regulation

&#160;

As a Louisiana-chartered bank, First Guaranty Bank is subject to the regulation and supervision of the OFI. Under Louisiana law, First Guaranty Bank may establish additional branch offices within Louisiana, subject to the approval of OFI. After the Dodd-Frank Act, we can also establish additional branch offices outside of Louisiana, subject to prior regulatory approval, as long as the laws of the state where the branch is to be located would permit such expansion. In addition, First Guaranty Bank is the primary source of our dividend payments, and our ability to pay dividends will be subject to any restrictions applicable to the Bank. Under Louisiana law, a Louisiana bank may not pay cash dividends unless the bank has unimpaired surplus equal to 50% of its outstanding capital stock, both before and after giving effect to the dividend payment. Subject to satisfying such requirement, First Guaranty Bank may pay dividends to us without the approval of the OFI so long as the amount of the dividend does not exceed its net profits earned during the current year combined with its retained earnings for the immediately preceding year. The OFI must approve any proposed dividend in excess of this threshold.

&#160;

Federal Regulations

&#160;

Capital Requirements. Federal regulations require FDIC-insured depository institutions to meet several minimum capital standards: a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 6.0%, a total capital to risk-based assets of 8%, and a 4% Tier 1 capital to total assets leverage ratio. The existing capital requirements were effective January 1, 2015 and are the result of a final rule implementing regulatory amendments based on recommendations of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act.

&#160;

For purposes of the regulatory capital requirements, common equity Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common stockholders' equity and retained earnings. Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common equity Tier 1 and additional Tier 1 capital. Additional Tier 1 capital includes certain noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries. Total capital includes Tier 1 capital (common equity Tier 1 capital plus additional Tier 1 capital) and Tier 2 capital. Tier 2 capital is comprised of capital instruments and related surplus, meeting specified requirements, and may include cumulative preferred stock and long-term perpetual preferred stock, mandatory convertible securities, intermediate preferred stock and subordinated debt. Also included in Tier 2 capital is the allowance for loan and lease losses limited to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets and, for institutions such as First Guaranty Bank, that have exercised an opt-out election regarding the treatment of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income ("AOCI"), up to 45% of net unrealized gains on available-for-sale equity securities with readily determinable fair market values. Calculation of all types of regulatory capital is subject to deductions and adjustments specified in the regulations.

&#160;

In determining the amount of risk-weighted assets for purposes of calculating risk-based capital ratios, all assets, including certain off-balance sheet assets ( e.g. , recourse obligations, direct credit substitutes, residual interests) are multiplied by a risk weight factor assigned by the regulations based on the risks believed inherent in the type of asset. Higher levels of capital are required for asset categories believed to present greater risk. For example, a risk weight of 0% is assigned to cash and U.S. government securities, a risk weight of 50% is generally assigned to prudently underwritten first lien one to four- family residential mortgages, a risk weight of 100% is assigned to commercial and consumer loans, a risk weight of 150% is assigned to certain past due loans and a risk weight of between 0% to 600% is assigned to permissible equity interests, depending on certain specified factors.

In addition to establishing the minimum regulatory capital requirements, the regulations limit capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to management if the institution does not hold a "capital conservation buffer" consisting of 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted asset above the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements. The capital conservation buffer requirement is being phased in beginning January 1, 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and increasing each year until fully implemented at 2.5% on January 1, 2019.

In assessing an institution's capital adequacy, the FDIC takes into consideration, not only these numeric factors, but qualitative factors as well, and has the authority to establish higher capital requirements for individual institutions where deemed necessary.

&#160;

At December 31, 2015, First Guaranty Bank was well-capitalized based on FDIC guidelines.

&#160;

&#160;

Standards for Safety and Soundness. As required by statute, the federal banking agencies have adopted final regulations and Interagency Guidelines Establishing Standards for Safety and Soundness to implement safety and soundness standards. The guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. The guidelines address internal controls and information systems, internal audit system, credit underwriting, loan documentation, interest rate exposure, asset growth, asset quality, earnings, compensation, fees and benefits and, more recently, safeguarding customer information. If the appropriate federal banking agency determines that an institution fails to meet any standard prescribed by the guidelines, the agency may require the institution to submit to the agency an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard.

&#160;

Business and Investment Activities. Under federal law, all state-chartered FDIC-insured banks have been limited in their activities as principal and in their equity investments to the type and the amount authorized for national banks, notwithstanding state law. Federal law permits exceptions to these limitations. For example, certain state-chartered banks may, with FDIC approval, continue to exercise state authority to invest in common or preferred stocks listed on a national securities exchange and in the shares of an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. The maximum permissible investment is the lesser of 100.0% of Tier 1 capital or the maximum amount permitted by Louisiana law.

&#160;

The FDIC is also authorized to permit state banks to engage in state authorized activities or investments not permissible for national banks (other than non-subsidiary equity investments) if they meet all applicable capital requirements and it is determined that such activities or investments do not pose a significant risk to the FDIC insurance fund. The FDIC has adopted regulations governing the procedures for institutions seeking approval to engage in such activities or investments. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 specified that a state bank may control a subsidiary that engages in activities as principal that would only be permitted for a national bank to conduct in a &#8220;financial subsidiary,&#8221; if a bank meets specified conditions and deducts its investment in the subsidiary for regulatory capital purposes.

Prompt Corrective Regulatory Action. Federal law requires, among other things, that federal bank regulatory authorities take &#8220;prompt corrective action&#8221; with respect to banks that do not meet minimum capital requirements. For these purposes, the law establishes five capital categories: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized.

&#160;

The applicable FDIC regulations were amended to incorporate the previously mentioned increased regulatory capital standards that were effective January 1, 2015. Under the amended regulations, an institution is deemed to be "well capitalized" if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a leverage ratio of 5.0% or greater and a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 6.5% or greater. An institution is "adequately capitalized" if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0% or greater, a leverage ratio of 4.0% or greater and a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 4.5% or greater. An institution is "undercapitalized" if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a leverage ratio of less than 4.0% or a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 4.5%. An institution is deemed to be "significantly undercapitalized" if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0%, a leverage ratio of less than 3.0% or a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 3.0%. An institution is considered to be "critically undercapitalized" if it has a ratio of tangible equity (as defined in the regulations) to total assets that is equal to or less than 2.0%. 

&#160;

&#8220;Undercapitalized&#8221; banks must adhere to growth, capital distribution (including dividend) and other limitations and are required to submit a capital restoration plan. A bank&#8217;s compliance with such a plan must be guaranteed by any company that controls the undercapitalized institution in an amount equal to the lesser of 5% of the institution&#8217;s total assets when deemed undercapitalized or the amount necessary to achieve the status of adequately capitalized. If an &#8220;undercapitalized&#8221; bank fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is &#8220;significantly undercapitalized .&#8221; &#8220;Significantly undercapitalized&#8221; banks must comply with one or more of a number of additional measures, including, but not limited to, a required sale of sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized, a requirement to reduce total assets, cessation of taking deposits from correspondent banks, the dismissal of directors or officers and restrictions on interest rates paid on deposits, compensation of executive officers and capital distributions by the parent holding company. &#8220;Critically undercapitalized&#8221; institutions are subject to additional measures including, subject to a narrow exception, the appointment of a receiver or conservator within 270 days after it obtains such status.

&#160;

&#160;

Transactions with Related Parties. Transactions between a bank (and, generally, its subsidiaries) and its related parties or affiliates are limited by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act. An affiliate of a bank is any company or entity that controls, is controlled by or is under common control with the bank. In a holding company context, the parent bank holding company and any companies which are controlled by such parent holding company are affiliates of the bank. Generally, Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act limit the extent to which the bank or its subsidiaries may engage in &#8220;covered transactions&#8221; with any one affiliate to 10% of such institution&#8217;s capital stock and surplus and contain an aggregate limit on all such transactions with all affiliates to an amount equal to 20% of such institution&#8217;s capital stock and surplus. The term &#8220;covered transaction&#8221; includes the making of loans, purchase of assets, issuance of a guarantee and similar transactions. In addition, loans or other extensions of credit by the institution to the affiliate are required to be collateralized in accordance with specified requirements. The law also requires that affiliate transactions be on terms and conditions that are substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the institution, as those provided to non-affiliates.

&#160;

First Guaranty Bank&#8217;s authority to extend credit to its directors, executive officers and 10% shareholders, as well as to entities controlled by such persons, is currently governed by the requirements of Sections 22(g) and 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation O of the Federal Reserve Board. Among other things, these provisions generally require that extensions of credit to insiders:

&#160;

&#9679;

be made on terms that are substantially the same as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than, those prevailing for comparable transactions with unaffiliated persons and that do not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features; and

&#160;

&#9679;

not exceed certain limitations on the amount of credit extended to such persons, individually and in the aggregate, which limits are based, in part, on the amount of First Guaranty Bank&#8217;s capital.

&#160;

In addition, extensions of credit in excess of certain limits must be approved by First Guaranty Bank&#8217;s board of directors. Extensions of credit to executive officers are subject to additional limits based on the type of extension involved.

&#160;

Enforcement. The FDIC has extensive enforcement authority over insured state banks, including First Guaranty Bank. That enforcement authority includes, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, issue cease and desist orders and remove directors and officers. In general, enforcement actions may be initiated in response to violations of laws and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices. The FDIC also has authority under federal law to appoint a conservator or receiver for an insured bank under certain circumstances. The FDIC is required, with certain exceptions, to appoint a receiver or conservator for an insured state non-member bank if that bank was &#8220;critically undercapitalized&#8221; on average during the calendar quarter beginning 270 days after the date on which the institution became &#8220;critically undercapitalized.&#8221;

&#160;

Federal Insurance of Deposit Accounts. The Dodd-Frank Act permanently increased the maximum amount of deposit insurance for banks, savings institutions and credit unions to $250,000 per depositor.

&#160;

Under the FDIC&#8217;s risk-based assessment system, insured institutions are assigned to one of four risk categories based on supervisory evaluations, regulatory capital levels and certain other risk factors. Rates are based on each institution&#8217;s risk category and certain specified risk adjustments. Stronger institutions pay lower rates while riskier institutions pay higher rates.

&#160;

The FDIC published a final rule under the Dodd-Frank Act to reform the deposit insurance assessment system. The rule redefined the assessment base used for calculating deposit insurance assessments effective April 1, 2011. Under the rule, assessments are based on an institution&#8217;s average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity instead of total deposits. The rule revised the assessment rate schedule to establish assessments ranging from 2.5 to 45 basis points.

&#160;

In addition to the FDIC assessments, the Financing Corporation (&#8220;FICO&#8221;) is authorized to impose and collect, with the approval of the FDIC, assessments for anticipated payments, issuance costs and custodial fees on bonds issued by the FICO in the 1980s to recapitalize the former Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation. The bonds issued by the FICO are due to mature in 2017 through 2019. For the quarter ended December 31, 2015, the annualized Financing Corporation assessment was equal to 0.60 of a basis point of total assets less tangible capital.

&#160;

The Dodd-Frank Act increased the minimum target Deposit Insurance Fund ratio from 1.15% of estimated insured deposits to 1.35% of estimated insured deposits. The FDIC must seek to achieve the 1.35% ratio by September 30, 2020. It is intended that insured institutions with assets of $10 billion or more will fund the increase. The Dodd-Frank Act eliminated the 1.5% maximum fund ratio, instead leaving it to the discretion of the FDIC and the FDIC has exercised that discretion by establishing a long-term fund ratio of 2%.

&#160;

The FDIC has authority to increase insurance assessments. Any significant increases would have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of First Guaranty Bank. Management cannot predict what assessment rates will be in the future.

&#160;

Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that an institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC. We do not currently know of any practice, condition or violation that may lead to termination of our deposit insurance.

&#160;

Community Reinvestment Act . Under the CRA, a bank has a continuing and affirmative obligation, consistent with its safe and sound operation, to help meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low and moderate income neighborhoods. The CRA does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions nor does it limit an institution&#8217;s discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community. The CRA does require the FDIC, in connection with its examination of a bank, to assess the institution&#8217;s record of meeting the credit needs of its community and to take such record into account in its evaluation of certain applications by such institution, including applications to establish or acquire branches and merger with other depository institutions. The CRA requires the FDIC to provide a written evaluation of an institution&#8217;s CRA performance utilizing a four-tiered descriptive rating system. First Guaranty Bank&#8217;s latest FDIC CRA rating, dated June 28, 2013, was &#8220;satisfactory.&#8221; 

&#160;

Federal Reserve System. The Federal Reserve Board regulations require savings institutions to maintain non interest-earning reserves against their transaction accounts (primarily negotiable order of withdrawal (NOW) and regular checking accounts). For 2015, the regulations generally provide that reserves be maintained against aggregate transaction accounts as follows: a 3% reserve ratio is assessed on net transaction accounts up to and including $103.6 million; a 10% reserve ratio is applied above $103.6 million. The first $14.5 million of otherwise reservable balances are exempted from the reserve requirements. The amounts are adjusted annually. First Guaranty Bank complies with the foregoing requirements. 

&#160;

FHLB System. First Guaranty Bank is a member of the FHLB System, which consists of twelve regional FHLBs.

&#160;

Holding Company Regulation

&#160;

As a bank holding company, First Guaranty is subject to examination, regulation, and periodic reporting under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, as administered by the Federal Reserve Board. We are required to obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board to acquire all, or substantially all, of the assets of any bank or bank holding company. Prior Federal Reserve Board approval would be required for us to acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting securities of any bank or bank holding company if it would, directly or indirectly, own or control more than 5% of any class of voting shares of the bank or bank holding company.

&#160;

A bank holding company is generally prohibited from engaging in, or acquiring, direct or indirect control of more than 5% of the voting securities of any company engaged in non-banking activities. One of the principal exceptions to this prohibition is for activities found by the Federal Reserve Board to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. Some of the principal activities that the Federal Reserve Board has determined by regulation to be closely related to banking are: (1) making or servicing loans; (2) performing certain data processing services; (3) providing securities brokerage services; (4) acting as fiduciary, investment or financial advisor; (5) leasing personal or real property under certain conditions; (6) making investments in corporations or projects designed primarily to promote community welfare; and (7) acquiring a savings association.

&#160;

The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 authorizes a bank holding company that meets specified conditions, including depository institutions subsidiaries that are &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; and &#8220;well managed,&#8221; to opt to become a &#8220;financial holding company.&#8221; A &#8220;financial holding company&#8221; may engage in a broader array of financial activities than permitted a typical bank holding company. Such activities can include insurance underwriting and investment banking. We have not elected &#8220;financial holding company&#8221; status.

&#160;

The Dodd-Frank Act required the Federal Reserve Board to revise its consolidated capital requirements for holding companies so that they are no less stringent, both quantitatively and in terms of components of capital, than those applicable to the subsidiary banks. This eliminated certain instruments from tier 1 capital, such as trust preferred securities that were previously includable for bank holding companies. The previously mentioned new capital rules were also effective for First Guaranty on January 1, 2015 and are the same rules as apply to First Guaranty Bank.

&#160;

We are subject to the Federal Reserve Board&#8217;s consolidated capital adequacy guidelines for bank holding companies as we have more than $1.0 billion in total assets, subject to certain grandfathered rules.

&#160;

A bank holding company is generally required to give the Federal Reserve Board prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of then outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption, when combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding 12 months, is equal to 10% or more of the company&#8217;s consolidated net worth. The Federal Reserve Board may disapprove such a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would constitute an unsafe and unsound practice, or would violate any law, regulation, Federal Reserve Board order or directive, or any condition imposed by, or written agreement with, the Federal Reserve Board. The Federal Reserve Board has adopted an exception to that approval requirement for well-capitalized bank holding companies that meet certain other conditions.

&#160;

The Federal Reserve Board has issued a policy statement regarding the payment of dividends by bank holding companies. In general, the Federal Reserve Board&#8217;s policies provide that dividends should be paid only out of current earnings and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention by the bank holding company appears consistent with the organization&#8217;s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. The Federal Reserve Board&#8217;s policies also require that a bank holding company serve as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary banks by using available resources to provide capital funds during periods of financial stress or adversity and by maintaining the financial flexibility and capital-raising capacity to obtain additional resources for assisting its subsidiary banks where necessary. The Dodd-Frank Act codified the source of strength policy and requires the promulgation of implementing regulations. Under the prompt corrective action laws, the ability of a bank holding company to pay dividends may be restricted if a subsidiary bank becomes undercapitalized. These regulatory policies could affect our ability to pay dividends or otherwise engage in capital distributions.

&#160;

The Federal Deposit Insurance Act makes depository institutions liable to the FDIC for losses suffered or anticipated by the insurance fund in connection with the default of a commonly controlled depository institution or any assistance provided by the FDIC to such an institution in danger of default. That law would have potential applicability if we ever held as a separate subsidiary a depository institution in addition to the Bank.

&#160;

We are affected by the monetary and fiscal policies of various agencies of the United States Government, including the Federal Reserve System. In view of changing conditions in the national economy and in the money markets, it is impossible for management to accurately predict future changes in monetary policy or the effect of such changes on our business or financial condition.

&#160;

Federal Securities Laws

&#160;

First Guaranty's common stock is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. First Guaranty is subject to the information, proxy solicitation, insider trading restrictions and other requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

&#160;

Sarbanes-Oxley Act

&#160;

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act addresses, among other issues, corporate governance, auditing and accounting, executive compensation, and enhanced and timely disclosure of corporate information. As directed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer are required to certify that our quarterly and annual reports do not contain any untrue statement of a material fact. The rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act have several requirements, including having these officers certify that: they are responsible for establishing, maintaining and regularly evaluating the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting; they have made certain disclosures to our auditors and the audit committee of the board of directors about our internal control over financial reporting; and they have included information in our quarterly and annual reports about their evaluation and whether there have been changes in our internal control over financial reporting or in other factors that could materially affect internal control over financial reporting. We have prepared policies, procedures and systems designed to ensure compliance with these regulations.

&#160;

Concentrated Commercial Real Estate Lending Regulations.

&#160;

The Federal Reserve Board and FDIC have promulgated guidance governing financial institutions with concentrations in commercial real estate lending. The guidance provides that a company has a concentration in commercial real estate lending if (i) total reported loans for construction, land development, and other land represent 100% or more of total capital or (ii) total reported loans secured by multifamily and non-farm residential properties and loans for construction, land development, and other land represent 300% or more of total capital and the outstanding balance of such loans has increased 50% or more during the prior 36 months. If a concentration is present, Management must employ heightened risk management practices including board and Management oversight and strategic planning, development of underwriting standards, risk assessment and monitoring through market analysis and stress testing, and increasing capital requirements. First Guaranty is subject to these regulations.
