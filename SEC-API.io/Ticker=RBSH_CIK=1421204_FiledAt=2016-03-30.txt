 ITEM 1. BUSINESS &#160;

Overview 

&#160; 

We are an early-stage, pre-revenue, pharmaceutical company focused on the development of prodrug cancer therapeutics for the treatment of solid tumors including liver, brain, prostate and other cancers. A prodrug is an inactive precursor of a drug that is converted into its active form only at the site of the tumor. Our technology platform combines a powerful, plant-derived cytotoxin with a patented prodrug delivery system that targets the release of the drug within the tumor. We believe our cancer prodrugs have the potential to provide a targeted therapeutic approach to a broad range of solid tumors with fewer side effects than those related to current chemotherapy treatments. Our lead drug candidate, mipsagargin, is currently undergoing Phase II clinical evaluation in glioblastoma patients.

&#160;

Our major focus for the next twelve to eighteen months is on the (i) ongoing Phase II clinical trial in patients with glioblastoma, (ii) development of a clinical protocol for our next clinical trial in glioblastoma, which we anticipate will be a randomized study, (iii) ongoing business development discussions with potential development partners, and (iv) prioritization of our next thapsigargin prodrug development candidate. We anticipate undertaking a pilot study of mipsagargin in patients with prostate cancer during the first half of 2016 but have indefinitely postponed the previously planned Phase II renal cancer study. Our ability to execute our product development plan is dependent on the amount and timing of cash, if any, that we are able to raise. Should we fail to raise sufficient funds to execute our product development plan, our priority is the continuation and completion of our ongoing Phase II clinical study in glioblastoma patients.

&#160;

In January 2015, we presented preliminary results from our Phase II study of mipsagargin in liver cancer patients, and these data were updated in May 2015 when we received a final clinical study report. We consider the study outcome as positive and the results support our plans to continue the development of mipsagargin for patients with liver cancer, as well as proceed with our clinical development strategy in other indications. We plan to develop subsequent randomized studies to further develop mipsagargin, preferably with a development partner, with a goal of seeking marketing approval from the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA. Although data from our completed trials appear promising, the outcomes of our ongoing or future trials may ultimately be unsuccessful.

&#160;

Going Concern 

&#160; 

Our auditors&#8217; report on our December 31, 2015 financial statements expressed an opinion that our capital resources as of the date of their Audit Report were not sufficient to sustain operations or complete our planned activities for the upcoming year unless we raised additional funds. Accordingly, notwithstanding our recent financings, our current cash level raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern past September 2016. If we do not obtain additional funds by such time, we may no longer be able to continue as a going concern and will cease operation which means that our shareholders will lose their entire investment.

&#160;

Recent Developments 

&#160;

&#183; In January 2015 we issued updated data from our Phase II liver cancer trial in which a total of twenty-five patients were treated with mipsagargin. Study participants experienced a median time to progression of 4.5 months, more than double the time demonstrated in prior studies with placebo or ineffective agents. Sixty-three percent of patients experienced stable disease at two months. Additionally, mipsagargin was shown to dramatically decrease blood flow in liver tumors. &#160;

&#183; In February 2015 we announced a strategic partnership with Phyton Biotech for the manufacture of thapsigargin, the key ingredient in mipsagargin. We believe that Phyton Biotech&#8217;s plant cell fermentation expertise in converting the Thapsia plant into a preserved, fermentable cell line will provide us access to a sustainable source of high-quality thapsigargin to support the development of our drugs. In July the World Intellectual Property Organization published Phyton Biotech&#8217;s international patent application WO 2015/0892978 A1 "Production of Thapsigargins by Thapsia Cell Suspension Culture." The invention described in the patent application provides, for the first time, a suspension cell culture suitable for mass production of thapsigargin, offering a potential alternative route to commercial-scale production of this starting material for synthesis of mipsagargin. &#160;

&#183; In May 2015, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration&#8217;s Office of Orphan Products Development issued an RO-1 grant to Santosh Kesari, M.D., Ph.D., one of the Principal Investigators of our glioblastoma study. The $1.6 million grant covers a four-year period for the study of PSMA and other biomarkers to better identify the subset of patients who will receive the most therapeutic benefit with mipsagargin treatment. Dr. Kesari, who is ranked in the top 1% of neuro-oncologists and neurologists in the U.S. by Castle Connolly Medical Ltd., joined our Scientific Advisory Board in October. &#160;

4&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; In May 2015, sufficiently encouraging data were observed in the first stage of the ongoing Phase II study of mipsagargin in glioblastoma (brain cancer) patients to warrant continuation of enrollment for an expansion phase of the trial. We have now treated twenty patients in our Phase II glioblastoma clinical trial. &#160;

&#183; On July 16, 2015, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit entered judgment in GenSpera, Inc. v. Annastasiah Mudiwa Mhaka in favor of GenSpera. In a per curiam order without an opinion, the Federal Circuit affirmed the decision of the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland granting summary judgment in GenSpera's favor in two consolidated cases relating to the inventorship of two patents owned by GenSpera. The district court had issued a declaratory judgment that Dr. Annastasiah Mhaka should not be added as an inventor to the two patents at issue, and had also granted summary judgment with respect to state law tort claims brought by Dr. Mhaka against the company and two of its founders, Dr. John Isaacs and Dr. Sam Denmeade. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit previously dismissed another appeal brought by Dr. Mhaka from the same district court judgments. &#160;

&#183; In September 2015, we presented encouraging interim data from the ongoing Phase II clinical trial in glioblastoma which showed clear clinical benefit in a subset of patients. &#160;

&#183; In July and December 2015 we completed two financings with total gross proceeds of $5.0 million. We will use this capital to fund our Phase 2 study for the treatment of glioblastoma and for general corporate purposes. &#160; 

&#183; On March 16, 2016, Dr. Craig Dionne provided us his notice of termination as the company&#8217;s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. &#160;

&#183; On March 16, 2016, upon receipt of Dr. Dionne&#8217;s notice of termination, Dr. Russell Richerson assumed the duties of principal executive and principal accounting officer on an interim basis. &#160; 

Business Strategy 

&#160;

Our ability to execute our product development plan is dependent on the amount and timing of cash, if any, that we are able to raise. Should we not raise sufficient funds to execute our product development plan, our priority is the continuation and completion of our ongoing and planned Phase II clinical studies in glioblastoma. We are actively involved in identifying a potential development and commercialization partner at both multi-national and regional levels to assist with the development of mipsagargin through clinical trials in liver cancer.

&#160;

Our current product development plan of mipsagargin contemplates the following major initiatives:

&#160;

&#183; Development of a clinical protocol for our next clinical trial in glioblastoma, which we anticipate will be a randomized study. &#160;

&#183; Continue ongoing business development discussions with potential development partners. &#160;

&#183; Continue our Phase II clinical trial in patients with glioblastoma (a form of brain cancer) which is being conducted at the University of California San Diego Moores Cancer Center. &#160;

&#183; Initiation of a Phase II clinical pilot study in patients with prostate cancer via a collaborative agreement with a single site in the U.S. &#160;

Clinical and Pre-Clinical Development Strategy 

&#160; 

Under the planning and direction of key personnel, we expect to continue to outsource all of our preclinical development (e.g., toxicology), manufacturing, and clinical development activities to contract research organizations (CROs) and contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs). Our contract CROs and CMOs are required to comply with federal, state and United States Food and Drug Administration or FDA regulations including Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP), Good Clinical Practices (GCP), and Good Lab Practices (GLP).

&#160;

We intend to conduct several Phase II clinical trials to determine the therapeutic efficacy of mipsagargin in cancer patients. We anticipate that mipsagargin will be therapeutically effective in a wide range of solid tumor types and have chosen to first evaluate the drug in liver cancer, glioblastoma, prostate cancer and renal cell carcinoma. We believe this strategy will validate mipsagargin as a platform technology over multiple indications while at the same time diversifying the risk associated with any individual indication.

Closed to further enrollment. &#160; &#160; &#160; Hepatocellular Carcinoma (liver cancer) &#160; In 2012, we obtained clearance from the FDA to initiate our Phase II clinical trial entitled, &#8220;A Phase II, Multicenter, Single-Arm Study of G-202 as Second-Line Therapy Following Sorafenib for Adult Patients with Progressive Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma.&#8221; In October of 2014 we closed patient enrollment in the trial. In total, we treated 25 patients. We presented trial data at a poster session at the American Society for Clinical Oncology 2015 Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium on January 2015 in San Francisco, CA and presented final data at the BIO International Convention 2015 held in Philadelphia, PA. in June of 2015. &#160; &#160; &#160; Glioblastoma (brain cancer) &#160; In the first quarter of 2014, we entered into a collaborative arrangement and commenced a Phase II clinical trial in patients with recurrent or progressive glioblastoma. We announced the expansion of the Phase 2 trial to a potential 34 patients in May after the successful completion of the first stage of the trial. In September we announced interim Phase 2 data from 11 patients with glioblastoma with demonstrated clinical benefit in a subset of patients with high levels of PSMA expression in the primary tumor. The trial is ongoing and as of March 1, 2016, a total of twenty patients have been treated in the study. This trial is being conducted at the University of California San Diego Moores Cancer Center. &#160; &#160; &#160; Prostate Cancer &#160; Anticipate enrolling the first patient in a Phase II pilot study in the first half of 2016. &#160; &#160; &#160; Renal Cell Carcinoma &#160; We have also postponed the start of the Phase II trial in order to focus efforts on clinical development in glioblastoma and our planned clinical trial in patients with prostate cancer. &#160;

Hepatocellular Carcinoma (Liver Cancer) 

&#160;

Hepatocellular carcinoma is cancer that forms in the tissues of the liver. Estimates for liver and intrahepatic bile duct cancer in the U.S. for 2016 are approximately 39,000 new cases and 27,000 deaths. Incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma in the U.S. is rising, principally in relation to the spread of hepatitis C infection. Hepatocellular carcinoma is potentially curable by surgical resection, but surgery is the treatment of choice for only the small fraction of patients with localized disease. Prognosis depends on the degree of local tumor replacement and the extent of liver function impairment. Treatment options for people with liver cancer are surgery (including liver transplant), ablation, embolization, targeted therapy, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy, for which there is only one approved drug (sorafenib), or a combination of these options. There is no standard therapy for patients with advanced metastatic liver cancer after treatment with sorafenib.

&#160;

Glioblastoma multiforme (Brain Cancer) 

&#160;

Glioblastoma is the most common and most aggressive malignant primary brain tumor in humans. Estimated for brain and other nervous system tumors in the United States in 2016 are approximately 24,000 new cases and 16,000 deaths. Brain tumors account for 85% to 90% of all primary central nervous system (CNS) tumors. Despite optimal treatment, the median survival for these patients is only 12 - 15 months. Treatment commonly consists of surgery followed by radiation and the drug temozolomide. There are a few drugs that have been approved in patients that have recurrent tumors but none have been shown to promote long-term tumor stabilization or survival.

&#160; 

Prostate Cancer 

&#160;

Prostate cancer forms in tissues of the prostate (a gland in the male reproductive system found below the bladder and in front of the rectum). Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in American men, behind only lung cancer. Estimates for prostate cancer in the U.S. for 2016 are about 181,000 new cases and approximately 26,000 deaths. Depending on the situation, the treatment options for men with prostate cancer may include: expectant management (watchful waiting) or active surveillance; surgery; radiation therapy; cryosurgery; hormone therapy; chemotherapy; and vaccine treatment. These treatments are generally used one at a time, although in some cases they may be combined.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Generic Name Designation 

&#160;

In August of 2014, we were notified that the World Health Organization&#8217;s or the WHO&#8217;s International Nonproprietary Name group or the INN recommended the generic name &#8220;mipsagargin&#8221; for our lead compound G-202. Mipsagargin was also recommended by the United States Adopted Names Council of the American Medical Association. Our generic name includes a new or novel pre-stem that we believe was proposed based on our compound possessing a unique mechanism of action or structure.

&#160;

Commercialization Strategy 

&#160; 

We intend to (i) license or sell the underlying technology of our drug compounds to third parties during or after Phase II clinical trials, (ii) seek a corporate partner for further development, or (iii) continue developing our drug candidates ourselves. It is expected that such third parties would then continue to develop, market, sell, and distribute any resulting products. As part of our overall strategic plan, we are exploring our options and actively seeking to engage in a collaborative, strategic and/or licensing arrangement with another pharmaceutical company. If we enter into any such transaction, we may be required to give up certain rights to our technology and control over its future development.

&#160;

Clinical Trials 

&#160;

Phase II Clinical Development of G-202 &#8211; Hepatocellular Carcinoma (Liver Cancer) 

&#160; 

In 2012, we obtained clearance from the FDA to initiate our Phase II clinical trial entitled, &#8220;A Phase II, Multicenter, Single-Arm Study of G-202 as Second-Line Therapy Following Sorafenib for Adult Patients with Progressive Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma.&#8221; This trial was conducted at multiple sites in the U.S. and measured disease progression in 25 patients with advanced stage liver disease and poor liver reserves who had failed first line treatment with sorafenib. Patients were administered episodic dosing of mipsagargin on the first three days of each treatment cycle.

&#160;

In January 2015, we presented Phase II results that demonstrated that mipsagargin appears to be effective and is well-tolerated by HCC patients. Mipsagargin targets the enzyme prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), which is highly expressed in tumor vasculature and prostate cancer cells. The Phase II study results (n=25) demonstrate that the prodrug effectively stabilizes progression of HCC by reducing blood flow within tumors while not affecting blood flow within normal tissues. Study participants experienced a median time to progression of 4.5 months, nearly twice the time demonstrated in prior studies with placebo or ineffective agents. Additionally, mipsagargin demonstrated decreased blood flow in liver tumors as measured by DCE-MRI.

&#160;

We plan to develop subsequent randomized studies to further develop mipsagargin with a development partner with the ultimate goal of seeking regulatory approval to market our drug on a global basis. Notwithstanding that the data from our studies appear promising, the outcome of our ongoing trial is uncertain and our current or future trials may ultimately be unsuccessful.

&#160;

Phase II Clinical Development of G-202 &#8211; Glioblastoma (Brain Cancer) 

&#160; 

In the first quarter of 2014, we entered into a collaborative arrangement and plan to conduct a Phase II clinical trial entitled, &#8220;An Open-Label, Single-Arm, Phase II Study to Evaluate the Efficacy, Safety and CNS Exposure of G-202 in Patients with Recurrent or Progressive Glioblastoma.&#8221; In May we announced that based on preliminary data obtained in the first stage of the trial, we were expanding the trial to a potential 34 patients. In September we announced interim Phase II data from 11 patients with glioblastoma with demonstrated clinical benefit in a subset of patients with high levels of PSMA expression in the primary tumor. In November we reported that a total of 18 patients have been treated in the study. This trial is being conducted at the University of California San Diego Moores Cancer Center. As of March 11, 2016, we have treated twenty patients in the study.

&#160;

Our Technology 

&#160;

Our approach is to identify specific enzymes that are found at high levels in tumors relative to other tissues in the body. Upon identifying these enzymes, we attempt to create a peptide that is recognized predominantly by those enzymes in the tumor and not by enzymes in normal tissues. We then use the peptide as the masking/targeting agent and attach it to our &#8220;cytotoxin&#8221; to create a prodrug. We believe that this double layer of recognition adds to the tumor-targeting found in our prodrugs.

&#160;

7&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Cytotoxin-Thapsigargin 

&#160;

Thapsigargin is a cytotoxin found within the plant Thapsia garganica that grows wild in the Mediterranean region. Thapsigargin is a potent inhibitor of the intracellular sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum calcium adenosine triphosphastase (SERCA) pump protein, consequently causing calcium levels to rise significantly and trigger apoptosis (cell death). We chemically modify thapsigargin to create the molecule 12ADT that retains all the potent cell-killing attributes of thapsigargin, but contains a new structure that can be coupled to a masking/targeting agent. Our prodrugs are manufactured by attaching a specific peptide to 12ADT.

&#160;

Masking/Targeting Agent 

&#160; 

We use peptides to mask the cytotoxin and target the tumor (masking/targeting agents). Peptides are short strings of amino-acids, the building blocks of many components found in cells. When attached to 12ADT, they have the potential to make the cytotoxin inactive and once the peptide is removed from 12ADT, the cytotoxin is active again. Our technology attempts to take advantage of the fact that the masking peptides can be removed by chemical reactors in the body called enzymes, and that the recognition of particular peptides by particular enzymes can be very specific. The peptides also make 12ADT soluble in blood. When the masking peptide is removed, 12ADT returns to its natural insoluble state and precipitates directly into nearby tumor cells.

&#160;

Our Prodrug Therapies 

&#160; 

Cancer chemotherapy involves treating patients with cytotoxic drugs (compounds or agents that are toxic to cells). Chemotherapy is often combined with surgery or radiation in the treatment of early-stage disease and it is the preferred, or only, treatment option for many forms of cancer in later stages of the disease. However, major drawbacks of chemotherapy include, but are not limited to:

&#160;

&#183; Side effects - non-cancer cells in the body are also affected, often leading to serious side effects, which may include the destruction of bone marrow, damage to digestive tract cells, and hair loss. &#160;

&#183; Incomplete tumor kill - many of the leading chemotherapeutic agents act during the process of cell division and may be effective on tumors comprised of rapidly-dividing cells, but are much less effective on tumors that contain slowly dividing cells. &#160;

&#183; Resistance - tumors will often develop resistance to current drugs after repeated exposure, thereby limiting the effectiveness of such therapies over multiple dosing. &#160;

Prodrug chemotherapy is a relatively new approach to cancer treatment that is being explored as a means of delivering higher concentrations of cytotoxic agents at the tumor location while avoiding or decreasing toxicity in the rest of the body. An inactive form of a cytotoxin is administered to the patient. The prodrug is converted into the active cytotoxin preferentially at the tumor site. We believe that our lead compound, mipsagargin, may overcome a number of drawbacks associated with current cancer drugs, including:

&#160;

&#183; Reduced side effects - our lead compound, mipsagargin, appears to be well-tolerated in cancer patients with reduced side effects compared to traditional chemotherapeutic agents, particularly exhibiting significantly less or no effect on the patient&#8217;s bone marrow. &#160;

&#183; Cell-killing activity - our prodrugs have been shown in animal cancer models to kill slowly-dividing, non-dividing, as well as rapidly-dividing cancer cells. &#160;

&#183; Lack of acquired drug resistance - testing in animal models of cancer indicated no development of resistance to mipsagargin after multiple cycles of treatment. &#160;

8&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Our Prodrug Development Candidates 

&#160;

We currently have identified four prodrug candidates based on our technology, as summarized in the table below. At this time we are focused exclusively on the clinical development of mipsagargin and have deferred further development of the other prodrug candidates.

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; G-114 &#160; Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) &#160; Prostate cancers &#160; Validated efficacy in pre-clinical animal models (Johns Hopkins University). &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; G-301 &#160; Human glandular kallikrein 2 (hK2) &#160; Prostate cancers &#160; Validated efficacy in pre-clinical animal models (Johns Hopkins University). &#160; &#160;

Mipsagargin 

&#160;

The enzymes that we target with our prodrugs are found in very specific places within the body and within the tumors. Our lead drug candidate, mipsagargin, is activated by the enzyme Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen, or PSMA, which is found in prostate epithelial cells in the normal prostate, in prostate cancer cells, and in vascular endothelial cells (blood vessels) found in almost all solid tumors. Thus, we expect that mipsagargin may be used in the treatment of almost all solid tumors. Importantly, we believe that mipsagargin may work by destroying the tumor vasculature, thus starving the tumor to death.

&#160;

G-115 

&#160;

G-115 is activated by the enzyme Prostate Specific Antigen, or PSA, which is secreted by prostate epithelial cells in the normal prostate and by prostate cancer cells. PSA is found in the bloodstream and is a known tumor marker for prostate cancer, but it is inactive in the bloodstream due to potent binding by a protein inhibitor. However, PSA is enzymatically active on the surface of prostate cancer cells as it is being secreted and this activity forms the basis for tumor targeting with G-115.

&#160;

G-301 

&#160;

G-301 is activated by the enzyme Human Glandular Kallikrein 2, or hK2, which is secreted by prostate epithelial cells in the normal prostate and by prostate cancer cells. The enzyme hK2 is found in the bloodstream and is known as a tumor marker for prostate cancer but it is inactive in the bloodstream due to potent binding by a protein inhibitor. However, hK2 is enzymatically active on the surface of prostate cancer cells as it is being secreted and this activity forms the basis for tumor targeting with G-301.

&#160;

Both G-115 and G-301 are believed to be useful in the treatment of prostate cancers only and not to be useful for the treatment of other cancers. 

&#160;

&#160;

Market and Competitive Considerations 

&#160; 

The table below summarizes estimates for a number of potential U.S. target markets for our proposed drug candidates:

&#160;

Therapeutic Opportunity for Our Drug Candidates 

&#160;

We believe that current anti-angiogenesis drugs (drugs that disrupt the blood supply to tumors) validate the clinical approach and market potential of our drug candidate. Angiogenesis is the physiological process involving the growth of new blood vessels from pre-existing vessels and is a normal process in growth and development, as well as in wound healing. Angiogenesis is also a fundamental step in the development of tumors from a clinically insignificant size to a malignant state because no tumor can grow beyond a few millimeters in size without the nutrition and oxygenation that comes from an associated blood supply. Interrupting this process has been targeted as a point of intervention for slowing or reversing tumor growth. An example of an anti-angiogenic approach is the FDA approved drug, Avastin &#174; , a monoclonal antibody that inhibits the activity of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor, which is important for the growth and survival of endothelial cells. Avastin and other anti-angiogenic drugs have only a limited therapeutic effect with increased median patient survival times of only a few months. Our approach is designed to destroy both the existing and newly growing tumor vasculature, rather than just block new blood vessel formation. We anticipate that this approach will lead to a more immediate collapse of the tumor&#8217;s nutrient supply and consequently an enhanced rate and degree of tumor destruction.

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are very competitive, fast moving and intense, and expected to be increasingly so in the future. Although we are not aware of any competitor who is developing a drug that is designed to destroy both the existing and newly growing tumor vasculature in a manner similar to our drug candidates, there are several marketed drugs and drugs in development that attack tumor-associated blood vessels to some degree. For example, Avastin &#174; is a marketed product that acts predominantly as an anti-angiogenic agent. Zybrestat &#174; is another drug in development that is described as a vascular-disrupting agent that inhibits blood flow to tumors. Nexavar &#174; and Sutent &#174; are two other approved drugs that appear to work in part through anti-angiogenic mechanisms. It is impossible to accurately ascertain how well our drugs will compete against these or other products that may be in the marketplace until we have more complete human patient data for comparison.

&#160;

Intellectual Property 

&#160;

We regard the protection of patents and other intellectual property rights that we own or license as critical to our business and competitive position. To protect our intellectual property, we rely on patent, trade secret and copyright law, as well as confidentiality, nondisclosure, assignment of invention and other contractual arrangements with our officers, directors, employees, consultants, investigators, clinical trial sites, contractors, collaborators and other third parties to whom we disclose confidential information. Our policy is to pursue patent applications on inventions and discoveries that we believe are commercially important to the development and growth of our business. We solely own or have exclusive licenses to all of our patents and patent applications.

&#160;

Our pipeline currently includes four drug product candidates: mipsagargin (solid tumors), G-114 (prostate cancer), G-115 (prostate cancer) and G-301 (prostate cancer). Our patent portfolio is currently composed of: 14 issued U.S. patents; 3 pending U.S. non-provisional patent applications; 1 pending Patent Cooperation Treaty, or PCT, application; and more than 35 pending applications throughout the world, including European, Japan, China and Hong Kong, among others.

&#160;

When appropriate, we plan to continue to seek patent protection for inventions in our core technologies and in ancillary technologies that support our core technologies or which we otherwise believe would provide us with a competitive advantage. We expect to be able to accomplish this by filing and maintaining patent applications for discoveries we make, either alone or in collaboration with scientific collaborators and strategic partners. Typically, we plan to file patent applications in the United States as well as foreign countries, where applicable. In addition, we may obtain licenses or options to acquire licenses to patent filings from other individuals and organizations that we anticipate could be useful in advancing our research, development and commercialization initiatives and our strategic business interest.

&#160;

10&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

In addition to and separate from patent protection, mipsagargin for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma has been granted orphan drug designation under the Orphan Drug Act of 1983, as amended, which was enacted to provide incentives to pharmaceutical companies who create treatments for rare diseases. It does so by granting seven years of exclusivity after approval of a drug in the rare disease, or "orphan" indication. During the seven-year period, the FDA may not grant marketing authorization (e.g. to a generic manufacturer) for the same drug for the orphan indication.

&#160;

Manufacturing and Supply 

&#160;

We do not plan to develop company-owned or company-operated manufacturing facilities. We outsource all drug manufacturing to contract manufacturers that are required to operate in compliance with cGMP. We may also seek to refine the current manufacturing process in order to achieve improvements in efficiency, costs, purity and the like as well as address different drug formulations to achieve improvements in stability and/or drug delivery.

Supply of Raw Materials - Thapsibiza SL 

&#160;

To our knowledge, there is only one commercial supplier of Thapsia garganica seeds. In April 2007, we obtained the proper permits from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (the USDA) for the importation of Thapsia garganica seeds. In April 2012, we entered into a five year sole source agreement with Thapsibiza, SL. Either party can extend the agreement for an additional five years by providing 30 days written notice prior to the expiration date. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, Thapsibiza, SL has agreed to exclusively provide us Thapsia garganica seeds while we retain the right to seek additional suppliers. The agreement requires us to purchase minimum quantities of seeds per harvest period.

&#160;

Long-term Supply of Raw Materials 

&#160;

We believe that we have sufficient supply of Thapsia garganica seeds in storage to complete our clinical trials as currently planned. However, in order to secure a long-term, stable supply of thapsigargin starting material, we are engaged in two ongoing research projects, including traditional cultivation and metabolic engineering of moss cells.

&#160;

We are funding an ongoing Thapsia garganica cultivation project with Thapsibiza, SL. It is known that thapsigargin is produced in the various parts of the plant and we are evaluating the most cost-effective way to produce thapsigargin, whether it is extracted from seedlings, early roots, stems and/or shoots or from seeds of the mature plant. Reliable germination methods are established and transfer of plantings from greenhouse to fields appears straightforward. At the current time, we believe traditional cultivation, farming and harvesting of Thapsia garganica is the most reliable and straightforward source of thapsigargin starting material.

&#160;

We also co-funded a moss project at the University of Copenhagen. A major goal of the project entitled SPOTLight (Sustainable Production of Thapsigargin using Light) is to produce thapsigargin in high yields in genetically modified moss cells thus enabling an inexpensive year-round supply of thapsigargin for drug manufacturing. The SPOTLight project was primarily funded by a DKK 18.3M (approximately $3.5M USD) grant from The Danish Council for Strategic Research and is directed by Dr. S&#248;ren Br&#248;gger Christensen, Professor at the University of Copenhagen, member of our Scientific Advisory Board and the scientist responsible for the initial isolation and characterization of thapsigargin. As a result of our co-funding, under the terms of our agreement, we have obtained an exclusive, milestone- and royalty-free, fully paid license to the resulting moss cell lines necessary to generate thapsigargin or its chemical precursors. We recognize that this is an ambitious project and that the goal of having a thapsigargin-producing cell line may not be reached. However, even if the project can only generate cell lines that produce chemical precursors of thapsigargin, this might form the basis of a semi-synthetic route to thapsigargin on a commercially viable scale.

&#160;

Manufacturing Partnership 

&#160;

In February 2014, we entered into an agreement with Phyton Biotech GmbH (Phyton) to conduct a feasibility study to evaluate plant cell suspension cultures derived from Thapsia garganica as a potential source of thapsigargin, the key ingredient in the company's investigational agent mipsagargin. In November 2014, we expanded our strategic partnership to have Phyton develop a method for a high producing cell line derived from the Thapsia garganica expressing thapsigargin. We anticipate this method development will provide us with a sustainable source of high quality thapsigargin, and assist us in achieving commercial production of our active pharmaceutical ingredient.

Governmental Regulations 

&#160;

FDA Approval Process 

&#160;

Prior to commencement of clinical studies involving humans, preclinical testing of new pharmaceutical products is generally conducted on animals in the laboratory to evaluate the potential efficacy and safety of the product candidate. The results of these studies are submitted to the FDA as part of an Investigational New Drug (IND) application, which must become effective before clinical testing in humans can begin. Typically, human clinical evaluation involves a time-consuming and costly three-phase process. In Phase I, clinical trials are conducted with a small number of people to assess safety, tolerability and to evaluate the pattern of drug distribution within the body. In Phase II, clinical trials are conducted with groups of patients afflicted with a specific disease in order to determine preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and expanded evidence of safety. (In some cases, an initial trial is conducted in diseased patients to assess both preliminary efficacy and preliminary safety, in which case it is referred to as a Phase I/II trial.) In Phase III, large-scale, multi-center, comparative trials are conducted with patients afflicted with a target disease in order to provide enough data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety required by the FDA. The FDA closely monitors the progress of each of the three phases of clinical testing and may, at its discretion, re-evaluate, alter, suspend, or terminate the testing based upon the data which have been accumulated to that point and its assessment of the risk/benefit ratio to the patient. All adverse events must be reported to the FDA. Monitoring of all aspects of the study to minimize risks is a continuing process.

&#160;

The results of the preclinical and clinical testing on non-biologic drugs and certain diagnostic drugs are submitted to the FDA in the form of a New Drug Application (NDA) for approval prior to commencement of commercial sales. In responding to an NDA submission, the FDA may grant marketing approval, may request additional information, may deny the application if it determines that the application does not provide an adequate basis for approval, and may also refuse to review an application that has been submitted if it determines that the application does not provide an adequate basis for filing and review. There can be no assurance that approvals would be granted on a timely basis, if at all, for any of our proposed products.

&#160;

Orphan Drugs 

&#160;

Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally defined as a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the drug and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. The first NDA applicant to receive FDA approval for a particular active ingredient to treat a particular disease with FDA orphan drug designation is entitled to a seven-year exclusive marketing period in the United States for that product, for that indication. During the seven-year exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same orphan indication, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity in that it is shown to be safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the NDA application user fee.

&#160;

European and Other Regulatory Approval 

&#160;

Whether or not FDA approval has been obtained, approval of a product by comparable regulatory authorities in Europe and other countries is necessary prior to commencement of marketing the product in such countries. The regulatory authorities in each country may impose their own requirements and may refuse to grant an approval, or may require additional data before granting it, even though the relevant product has been approved by the FDA or another authority. As with the FDA, the regulatory authorities in the European Union (EU), and other developed countries have lengthy approval processes for pharmaceutical products. The process for gaining approval in particular countries varies, but generally follows a similar sequence to that described for FDA approval. In Europe, the European Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products provides a mechanism for EU-member states to exchange information on all aspects of product licensing. The EU has established a European agency for the evaluation of medical products, with both a centralized community procedure and a decentralized procedure, the latter being based on the principle of licensing within one member country followed by mutual recognition by the other member countries.

&#160;

Reimbursement and Health Care Cost Control 

&#160;

Reimbursement for the costs of treatments and products such as ours from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and others, both in the United States and abroad, is a key element in the success of new health care products. Significant uncertainty often exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved health care products. The revenue and profitability of some health care-related companies have been affected by the continuing efforts of governmental and third party payors to contain or reduce the cost of health care through various means. Payors are increasingly attempting to limit both coverage and the levels of reimbursement for new therapeutic products approved for marketing by the FDA, and are refusing, in some cases, to provide any coverage for uses of approved products for disease indications for which the FDA has not granted marketing approval. In certain foreign markets, pricing or profitability of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to government control.

&#160;

12&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

In the United States, there have been a number of federal and state proposals to implement government control over health care costs. The U.S. Patient Protection and Affordance Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act were signed into law in March 2010. A number of provisions of those laws require further rulemaking action by governmental agencies to implement. The laws change access to health care products and services and create new fees for the pharmaceutical and medical device industries. Future rulemaking could increase rebates, reduce prices or the rate of price increases for health care products and services, or require additional reporting and disclosure. The laws also include new authorization to the FDA to approve companies to market biosimilar products within the United States, although to date FDA rulemaking under this legislation has been limited. We cannot predict the timing or impact of any such future rulemaking on our business.

&#160;

Other Regulations 

&#160;

We are also subject to various U.S. federal, state, local and international laws, regulations and recommendations relating to safe working conditions, laboratory and manufacturing practices and the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances, including radioactive compounds and infectious disease agents, used in connection with our business. Additionally, we are subject to regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and Securities and Exchange Commission regulations. We cannot accurately predict the extent of government regulation which might result from future legislation or administrative action.

&#160;

Scientific Advisory Board 

&#160; 

We have access to a number of academic and industry advisors with expertise in clinical and pharmaceutical development. Members of our Scientific Advisory Board, or SAB, meet with our management and key scientific employees on an ad hoc basis to provide advice in their respective areas of expertise and further assist us by periodically reviewing with management our preclinical and clinical activities. The members of our SAB are S&#248;ren Br&#248;gger Christensen, PhD, Samuel R. Denmeade, MD, John T. Isaacs, PhD and Santosh Kesari, MD, PhD. Our SAB members possess deep insight into our technologies and our drug candidate&#8217;s mechanism of action which is instrumental in advancing our clinical and development programs. In connection with a member&#8217;s retention on our SAB, we have entered into confidentiality agreements as well as assignment of invention agreements, subject to the member respective obligations and responsibilities to any institution or institutions at which they are employed.

&#160;

Employees 

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015, we employed two full-time individuals both of whom hold advanced degrees. In addition, we contract with approximately 12 to 15 consultants to assist in activities related to our operations and research and development plan. On March 16, 2016, pursuant to Dr. Dionne&#8217;s termination as chief executive officer and chief financial officer, the Company only has one full-time employee as of the date of this report.

&#160; 

Corporate History 

&#160;

We were incorporated in the State of Delaware in November 2003 and our principal office is located in San Antonio, Texas. Since our inception, we have invested a substantial portion of our efforts and financial resources in the development of mipsagargin (G-202). Mipsagargin is the only product candidate for which we have conducted clinical trials, and to date we have not marketed, distributed or sold any products. We have generated no revenues from the sale of our product candidates and have experienced substantial net operating losses.
