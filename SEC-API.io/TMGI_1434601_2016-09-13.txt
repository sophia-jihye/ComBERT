Company History 

&#160;

Music of Your Life, Inc. (hereafter, &#8220;we&#8221;, &#8221;our&#8221;, &#8221;us&#8221;, &#8220;MYL&#8221;, or the &#8221;Company&#8221;) was incorporated on January 30, 2008, in the State of Florida, as Zhong Sen International Tea Company, with the principal business objective of providing sales and marketing consulting services to small to medium sized Chinese tea producing companies who wish to export and distribute high quality Chinese tea products worldwide. The Company commenced business activities in August, 2008, when it entered into a related party Sales and Marketing Agreement with Yunnan Zhongsen Group, Ltd. However, due to lack of capital, the Company was unable to implement its business plan fully.On May 31, 2013 (the &#8220;Closing Date&#8221;), the Company entered into a Merger Agreement (the &#8220;Merger Agreement&#8221;), pursuant to which Music of Your Life, Inc. (MYL Nevada) merged with a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and the Company began its current operations as a multi-media entertainment company, producing live concerts, television shows and radio programming. The Company changed its name to Music of Your Life, Inc. effective July 26, 2013.

&#160;

Operational Overview 

&#160;

Music of Your Life&#174; is a multi-media entertainment company that currently produces live radio programming 24 hours a day, syndicated to AM, FM and HD radio stations around the country. The network is also heard streaming across the Internet using its registered trademark, iRadio&#174;. Music of Your Life&#174; has been on the air since 1978, making it the longest running syndicated music radio network in the world.

&#160;

The company has recently co-produced a 60-minute television infomercial and CD box set with Time Life, called &#8220;Country Music of Your Life&#8221;. The infomercial, featuring entertainers, Crystal Gayle and Charlie Pride is currently broadcasting on television stations across the United States to promote sales of the 10-CD box set. This marks the second such endeavor between Music of Your Life and Time Life.

&#160;

The Terrestrial and Internet Radio Broadcast Industry 

&#160; 

Revenues in the radio broadcasting industry are primarily generated by: (1) spot sales (commercials); (2) digital sales for on-line streaming; and (3) subscription based sales. According to the Radio Advertising Bureau, spot revenue was down 3% in 2014 to $13.6 billion; digital revenue was up 9% to $973 million compared to 2013. According to RIAA, subscription based revenue from Internet streaming rose to $860 million in 2014, a 28% year-over-year increase.

&#160;

While we expect to see a continual decline in terrestrial radio spot sales in the coming years, we see streaming and digital revenue continue to make huge gains. This is due in part to the decrease in cost for mobile data, and for the increase in technology improvements to the in-dash or Internet vehicle radio, and mobile devices.

Our Business Strategy 

&#160;

Music of Your Life&#174; has several projects underway:

&#160;

&#183; The Company acquired the iRadio trademarks and intellectual property through a merger with its subsidiary on May 20, 2014. The business purpose of this transaction was to enable the Company to claim a stake in the growing Internet radio category. As the Company&#8217;s core business of providing syndicated programming to AM and FM radio stations across the country continues to decline, in both the number of radio stations using the service, and the rates that can be charged for commercials, we decided to make a change in focus, to Internet streaming services. This will allow the Company to participate in the growing revenue in the digital ad landscape, and in the subscription based Internet streaming model. &#160;

&#183; The Company is now expanding its current single-channel network into a multi-channel, multi-genre offering, from Country to Rock, Pop, Jazz and more, all presented under the iRadio&#174; brand. &#160;

&#183; A new interactive, format-adaptive player is in development to deliver the iRadio&#174; channels to desktops, mobile devices and the new in-dash car radios. The updated iRadio&#174; player will include a sponsor driven revenue model, as well as a commercial-free subscription based model. &#160;

&#183; Music of Your Life has partnered with Time Life for a new 10-CD box set called, &#8220;Country Music of Your Life&#8221;. The infomercial starring Crystal Gayle and Charlie Pride is now airing on nationwide television. The previous Time Life / Music of Your Life box set sold more than 1-million CD&#8217;s. &#160;

&#183; The Company is also negotiating additional licensing opportunities for its family of iRadio&#174; and Music of Your Life&#174; trademarks for both hardware and software products. &#160;

&#183; The Company is now in the early stages of development of the Music of Your Life television network by seeking rights to several concert style television shows for broadcast on the network. This will also include a Music of Your Life TV Special in 2017, commemorating the Company&#8217;s 40 th anniversary of broadcasting. &#160;

Objectives 

&#160;

Music of Your Life&#8217;s main objective is to reach the consumer with quality content, in the vehicle and on mobile devices with its current Adult Standards format, as well as introducing new channels featuring a multitude of genres, including Country, Rock, Top-40, Jazz, etc. To do this, the Company is developing a new website, and mobile device app to compete in the subscription based interactive radio platform. To distinguish itself from other services, Music of Your Life will expand its list of celebrity on-air personalities to host much of this expanded programming.

&#160;

Another Company key objective is to partner, merge, acquire and/or license the rights to third party companies with their own quality audio and video content, and brands, to enhance the Music of Your Life&#174; and iRadio&#174; initiatives. Some of these may be developed as wholly owned or through licensing agreements.

&#160; 

Market Advantage 

&#160; 

Music of Your Life&#174; can be heard on AM, FM, and HD radio stations across the U.S., including 5 of the top 10 markets using its iRadio&#174; syndicated broadcasting network, and to more than 90 countries worldwide over the Internet. This well-established listener base gives the company a strong market advantage over the typical Internet radio service.

&#160;

&#160; 6 &#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

Another one of the Company&#8217;s key marketing advantages comes from its theory that the listener appreciates an interactive experience to radio with disk jockeys, or show hosts. To that advantage, Music of Your Life has been the voice of many celebrities over the years hosting their own radio shows. This, &#8220;Stars Play the Stars&#8221; marketing approach has proven to be an advantage for the Company&#8217;s 45-up demographic that is less interested in an on-line jukebox, such as Pandora, and more interested in a traditional, interactive radio experience.

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

The entertainment industry is highly competitive, and we have limited financial and personnel resources with which to compete. We expect to be at a disadvantage when competing with many firms that have substantially greater financial and management resources and capabilities. We believe a high degree of competition in this industry will continue for the foreseeable future.

&#160;

We believe that we can distinguish the Company from our competition by providing high quality entertainment, and products, with competitive pricing, and compelling branding.

&#160;

Employees 

&#160;

As of May 31, 2016, we currently have one full-time employee, Marc Angell our CEO. We currently have seven part-time and full-time independent contractors working with the management of the Company. Additionally, we are planning to hire other employees and contractors. Certain other executive positions have been identified, and we intend to fill these positions. Additional other support staff and other personnel will be hired when there is adequate capital available to do so.

&#160;

We have undertaken preliminary investigations concerning candidates for the above positions and do not currently anticipate difficulty in filling such positions with qualified persons, however we cannot assure you that we will in fact be able to hire qualified persons for such positions when needed. Additional positions to be filled may be identified from time to time by the Company. We expect to be able to attract and retain such additional employees as are necessary, commensurate with the anticipated future expansion of our business. Further, we expect to continue to use consultants, contract labor, attorneys and accountants as necessary.

&#160;

The loss of our CEO Marc Angell would likely have a material adverse effect on the Company.We intend to reduce this risk by obtaining key-man insurance after the Offering, in the event that affordable insurance coverage may be obtained. We cannot assure you that the Company will be able to obtain such insurance or that the Company will be successful in recruiting needed personnel.
