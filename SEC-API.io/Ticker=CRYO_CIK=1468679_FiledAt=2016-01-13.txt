Company Overview 

History 

&#160; 

We were incorporated in the state of Nevada on March 13, 2009. On April 20, 2011, we acquired, through our wholly owned subsidiary American CryoStem Acquisition Corporation, substantially all of the assets from, and assumed substantially all of the liabilities of, ACS Global, Inc. (&#8220;ACS&#8221;) in exchange for our issuance of 21,000,000 shares of our common stock, par value $0.001 per share, to ACS (the &#8220;Asset Purchase&#8221;). We filed a Current Report on Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on April 27, 2011 disclosing the Asset Purchase and certain related matters including, but not limited to, the appointment of our present officers and directors as well as the resignation by the former chief executive officer and sole director. Our fiscal year ends September 30 of each calendar year. 

&#160; 

Upon the closing of the Asset Purchase: (i) ACS Global became our majority shareholder, (ii) John Arnone was appointed as our chief executive officer and president and Anthony Dudzinski was appointed as our chief operating officer, treasurer and secretary, and (iii) John Arnone and Anthony Dudzinski were appointed to our board of directors, with Mr. Arnone being appointed as Chairman of the Board. Mr. Dudzinski is also a director and the president and treasurer of ACS Global and Mr. Arnone is a director and secretary of ACS Global. Contemporaneously with the Asset Purchase Closing, we sold 1,860,000 shares of Common Stock to accredited investors in a private placement at a purchase price of $0.50 per share for aggregate gross proceeds of $930,000. 

&#160; 

Our Business 

&#160; 

American CryoStem Corporation is a biotechnology pioneer in the field of Regenerative and Personalized Medicine and operates a state-of-the-art, FDA-registered, clinical laboratory dedicated to our standardized processing, bio-banking and development of cellular tools and applications using autologous adipose (fat) tissue and adipose derived stem cells (&#8220; ADSCs &#8221;). The Company has built a strong, strategic portfolio of intellectual property, patent applications, and proprietary operating processes that form its core standardized cellular platform which we believe supports and promotes a growing pipeline of biologic products and processes, clinical services and international licensing opportunities. Our FDA registered clinical laboratory which we believe to be in compliance with FDA regulations for human tissue processing, cryro-storage and cell culture and differentiation media development is located in Mount Laurel, New Jersey at the Burlington County College Science Incubator. 

&#160; 

The Company believes the reproducibility of scientific studies has become a substantial issue in life science research from drug discovery and development through clinical trials as researchers throughout the world continue to use different protocols for processes associated with sample preparation, cryopreservation and cold chain management. We believe the scientific community is becoming more aware of factors that affect sample integrity and experimental variability. By standardizing handling, storage, and transportation protocols we can substantially improve the quality and reproducibility of preclinical and clinical data which will help to accelerate the transition from lab research to drug and therapy development and market launch. To this end, we have licensed affiliates operating on our cellular collection-processing and storage platform in Tokyo, Japan, and Hong Kong. Our licensees purchase our CELLECT &#174; adipose tissue collection kits and ACSelerate-CP &#8482; storage consumables from us. 

&#160; 

Our business strategy is centered on marketing our standardized platform as a complete adipose stem cell solution and expanding our research and development through scientific collaborations. We intend to generate revenue through the sale and licensing of our patented products, laboratory tools, and services to attempt to capitalize on: (1) ADSC technologies; (2) scientific breakthroughs incorporating ADSCs that have been developing in the fast growing Regenerative and Personalized Medicine industries; (3) providing these growth industries with a standardized ADSC cell processing platform; (4) enhancing the delivery of healthcare through cellular-based therapies and applications which address disease treatment, wound and burn healing, joint repair and personalized health and beauty care; and (5) building a global network of physicians and affiliated laboratory facilities for the delivery of our products and services. 

&#160; 

Our proprietary, patent pending clinical processing platform allows for the collection, preparation and cryo-preservation of adipose tissue without manipulation, bio-generation or the addition of animal-derived products or other chemical materials which require removal from the tissue sample upon retrieval or prior to use. Management believes this core process makes each tissue sample suitable for use in cosmetic grafting procedures or for further processing to adult stem cells for other types of stem cell therapies. Currently, we believe there are numerous therapeutic and orthopedic applications for adipose tissue and adult stem cell treatments identified or in use globally. As of January 1, 2016, a review of clinicaltrials.gov, operated by the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) indicates that there is a significant number of clinical trials registered or completed that are focused on adipose tissue (1776), adult stem cells (5165), adipose derived stem cells (155), mesenchymal stem cells (575), and stromal vascular fraction (33). 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Products and Services 

&#160; 

American CryoStem is focused on multiple high margin business lines capable of generating sustainable, recurring revenue streams from each of our developed products and services. The Company also incorporates its proprietary and patented or patent pending laboratory products, such as our ACSelerate &#8482; cell culture media, into our processing product production and contract manufacturing services. Additionally, the Company may require licensees of our tissue and cell processing technologies to purchase all the consumable products required in the collection, processing and storage of tissue/stem cells as part of the licensing agreement. 

&#160; 

To date, we have generated minimal revenue; however, subject to, among other factors, obtaining the requisite financing, management believes that we are well positioned to leverage our developed products and services as the basis for international distribution through licensees of our technologies and a host of Regenerative Medicine uses and future applications. 

&#160; 

The following products and services are designed to become the basis of, or an integral part of, planned licensing territories, revenue generating, and cellular therapy development activities: Our products and services are:

The CELLECT &#174; service is included in our pending patent application U.S. Serial No. 13/702,304. 

&#160; 

American CryoStem is the first tissue bank to globally incorporate through its CELLECT &#174; service the International Blood Banking identification and labeling and product identification coding system. The coding was developed in conjunction with the American Association of Blood Banks (AABB), the American Red Cross and the International Society of Blood Transfusion (ISBT). These groups formed the International Council for Commonality in Blood Banking Automation (ICCBBA) and developed the ISBT 128 Standard for machine readable labeling. This labeling system is an acceptable machine readable labeling standard, product description, and bar coding system for FDA Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research under 21 CFR 606.12(c) 13. American CryoStem conforms to this standard in its Mount Laurel facility and all cellular and tissue products produced at the facility carry our W3750 ICCBBA facility identifier allowing any hospital, clinic, laboratory and regulator worldwide to identify the origin and obtain additional information of any sample produced at an American CryoStem facility. The Company will promote this standard in all laboratories that license or utilize our technology. 

&#160; 

ATGRAFT &#8482; Adipose Tissue Storage Service &#8211; A clinical fat storage solution allowing physicians to provide their patients with multiple tissue/stem cell storage options. The ATGRAFT &#8482; service, through one liposuction procedure allows individuals the benefit of multiple cosmetic or regenerative procedures by using their own stored adipose tissue as a natural biocompatible filler or cellular therapy application without the trauma of further liposuctions. ATGRAFT &#8482; procedures may include breast reconstruction, layered augmentation, buttocks enhancement or volume corrections of the hands, feet, face and neck areas that experience significant adipose tissue (fat) volume reduction as we age. ATGRAFT &#8482; is processed and stored utilizing our standards so that any stored fat tissue sample may be retrieved in the future and re-processed to create ATCELL &#8482; , our clinical grade stem cell product for use in Regenerative Medicine applications. The ATGRAFT &#8482; service is included in our pending patent application U.S. Serial No. 13/646,647. 

&#160; &#160; 

The Company&#8217;s charges standardized fees for ATGRAFT &#8482; tissue processing and initial storage ranges from $750 to $3,000, depending on the volume of tissue processed. The annual storage fee is $200 for up to 100ml of tissue. Storage of tissue over 100ml is billed an additional $1 per 1ml annually. These fees may be paid by the collecting/treating physician or the consumer. The Company earns additional fees ranging from $100 to $500 plus shipping costs, paid by the physician upon retrieval, for the thawing, packaging and shipment of the stored samples to the physician for immediate use upon receipt. Additionally, physicians may request that any stored package of ATGRAFT &#8482; of 25ml or greater be reprocessed utilizing the Company&#8217;s ATCELL &#8482; and Autokine-CM &#8482; processing. The Company charges fees of $1,500 for the reprocessing of a 25ml stored ATGRAFT &#8482; sample and may charge additional fee&#8217;s if additional expansion of the newly created ATCELL &#8482; sample is also requested. 

&#160; 

ATGRAFT &#8482; Processing, Storage and Retrieval fees are determined by the storage configuration as follows: 

&#160; 

&#183; Small Sample package &#8211; for storages of 100ml of adipose tissue or less. &#183; Medium Sample package &#8211; for storage of 100ml to 300ml of adipose tissue. &#183; Large Storage package &#8211; for storage of over 300ml of adipose tissue. &#183; Custom Package &#8211; storage configuration for pre planned procedures. &#160; 

The Company believes, the ATGRAFT &#8482; service may create patient retention, and significant revenue opportunities for the participating physician to promote additional procedures and generate additional tissue transfer fees from adipose tissue collected during liposuction procedures. These additional fees can be generated with significantly lower physician costs by eliminating the overhead associated with performing a liposuction for each scheduled fat transfer or therapy procedure. Physician cost savings may include: materials, supplies, equipment, and the expenses of utilizing a surgical center, hospital operating room or an in-office aseptic procedure room. The ATGRAFT &#8482; service is designed to operate under the minimally manipulated regulations contained in both 21 CFR 1271.10 and PHS 361. 

&#160; 

ATCELL &#8482; Adipose Derived Stem Cells (ADSCs) &#8211; Clinically processed and characterized adipose derived stem cells (ADSCs) created using the Company&#8217;s proprietary Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and patented cell culture media. ATCELL &#8482; is the Company&#8217;s trademarked name for its ADSC and differentiated cell products and processing methodology. The Company can create multiple master and differentiated cell lines and labels them according to their characterization. (i.e. ATCELL &#8482; (adipose derived stem cells) ATCELL-SVF &#8482; (stromal vascular fraction), ATCELL &#8211; CH &#8482; (differentiated chondrocytes), etc. Cell lines are custom created for patients desiring to store their cells for their own use in future Regenerative Medicine procedures. The Company charges its customers fees ranging from $1,500 to $10,000 to process a previously stored ATGRAFT &#8482; sample or a minimum of $2,500 for newly collected client tissue samples to be processed to Stromal Vascular Fraction (SVF). Customer samples submitted for processing must utilize the CELLECT &#174; collection system to conform to our internal SOPs. 

&#160; 

The Company believes it will earn additional fees based upon the proposed storage configuration of the final ATCELL &#8482; sample and for additional culturing in the ACSelerate &#8482; cell culture and differentiation media. We believe cell culturing and differentiation can be performed upon receipt of the raw tissue sample or at any time on a previously processed and cryopreserved ATGRAFT &#8482; or ATCELL &#8482; sample. We believe ATCELL &#8482; is ideally suited for expansion and differentiation into additional cell types utilizing the ACSelerate &#8482; MAX (fetal bovine serum (FBS) free high yield media),SFM (standard serum free medium), LSM (low 0.05% FBS media) or differentiation media. The ATCELL &#8482; products and services are incorporated into our pending patent filing US Serial No. 13/646,647. 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s ATCELL &#8482; cell lines are processed and cultured in our patented ACSelerate &#8482; &#8211; MAX our high yield, animal product free cell culture media. All tissue, cells, and research materials that are made available for sale to research institutions are tested for sterility, disease, lifespan, and population doubling rate (PDL). Additionally, we believe these cells are suited for any type of cellular therapy or regenerative medicine research. Cell morphology is confirmed by (i) flow cytometry and (ii) differentiation analysis using ACSelerate &#8482; differentiation media. Each ATCELL &#8482; line can be further cultured and differentiated allowing the Company to provide genetically matched clinical grade cell types. We believe this research methodology may provide opportunities for the Company&#8217;s ATCELL &#8482; and ACSelerate &#8482; products to become the building blocks of final developed commercial applications. 

&#160; 

The Company intends to support its application research, development and collaborative efforts by making ATCELL &#8482; and ATGRAFT &#8482; samples available for research and product development purposes through joint ventures, and university and commercial collaborations. These adipose tissue and cell line samples, we believe will be highly sought after by private researchers and universities for use in pre-clinical trial studies and in-vitro research due to our clinical processing methodology, donor sample data and the ability to create multiple cell types that have identical genetic profiles. We believe the clinical processing methods, data collection and testing of our ATCELL &#8482; and the ability to make multiple cell types from the same donor line allows research teams to focus on application development and avoid bench to commercialization delays. 

&#160; 

ACSelerate &#8482; Cell Culture Media Products &#8211; Manufactured patented cell culture media products for growing human stromal cells (including all cells found in human skin, fat and other connective tissue). Certain ACSelerate &#8482; cell culture media lines are available in animal serum free, which is suitable for human clinical and therapeutic uses; and a low serum version for application development and research purposes is also available. The patented ACSelerate &#8482; cell culture media line was specifically developed to address increasing industry demand for animal serum-free cell culture products and for the acceleration of products from the laboratory to the patient. 

&#160; 

On August 2, 2011, the Company was issued US patent number 7,989,205 for &#8220;Cell Culture Media, Kits and Methods of Use.&#8221; The granted claims include media variations for cellular differentiation of ADSCs into osteoblasts (bone), chondrocytes (cartilage), adipocytes (fat), neural cells, and smooth muscles cells in both HSA medium (clinical) grade and FBS (research) grade. This patent covers both non-GMP research grades and GMP clinical grades suitable for cell culture of adipose-derived stem cells intended for use in humans. Additionally, in 2014 the Company filed a continuation of this granted patent with additional claims and improvements, U.S. Serial No. 13/194,900. The Company has received notice from the USPTO of certain allowable claims within the continuation application and is aggressively pursuing the granting of these additional claims. 

&#160; 

We believe the most widely used cell culture medium today for growing and differentiating stem cell cultures for in vitro diagnostics and research contains 10% or more FBS. The use of FBS and other animal products in clinical cellular therapy application development and manufacture raises concerns and generates debates within the scientific and regulatory community relating to potential human/animal cross-contamination. These same concerns may also need to be addressed through additional expensive and expansive testing and documentation with the FDA during the application and approval process for new cellular therapies. FDA concerns are evidenced in their Guidance&#8217;s and Guidelines regarding cellular therapy involving human cells, tissues and products (HCT/Ps) published and maintained by the FDA such as: Guidance for Industry: Source Animal, Product, Preclinical and Clinical Issues Concerning the Use of Xenotransplantation Products in Humans, FDA Final Guidance, April 2003. It is our belief that eliminating or greatly reducing FBS in cellular manufacturing, applications and products can eliminate or ease these scientific and regulatory concerns and may prove to be a winning strategy for cellular therapy application developers seeking FDA approval. 

&#160; 

Currently, our media products are being utilized by our research partners engaged in developing novel new cellular applications and treatments. The Company supports these efforts by also making ATCELL &#8482; samples available for research purposes and for internal product development through our research programs. We believe these cell lines are highly sought after by private researchers and universities for use in pre-clinical trial studies and in-vitro research. We also believe that the Company&#8217;s ability to provide clinical grade materials for these research and development collaborators, partners and other third parties extends the Company&#8217;s ability to become a primary source of clinical grade materials and services necessary to support approved applications and treatments. 

&#160; 

The Company manufactures several versions of its ACSelerate &#8482; cell culture media including: 

&#183; ACSelerate-MAX &#8482; - our improved clinical grade, animal serum free cell culture media, is ideally suited for the rapid expansion of adipose-derived cell samples for direct use or further culturing into other cell types; &#183; ACSelerate-SFM &#8482; - our general purpose clinical grade, manufactured animal serum free cell culture media, which is ideally suited for the expansion of adipose-derived cell samples for direct use or further culturing into other cell types; &#183; ACSelerate-LSM &#8482; - our research grade, low FBS (0.05%) cell culture media, which is ideally suited for the rapid expansion of adipose-derived cell samples for research and cellular application development or further culturing into other research grade cell types; &#183; ACSelerate-CY &#8482; - for differentiation of ATCELL &#8482; into chondrocytes ( ATCELL-CY &#8482; ), which are suitable for use in cartilage repair applications in knees and other joints for patients suffering from joint injury, osteoarthritis and other diseases that cause degeneration of joint cartilage; &#183; ACSelerate-OB &#8482; - for differentiation of ATCELL &#8482; into osteoblasts ( ATCELL-OB &#8482; ) for the repair of bone injuries resulting from traumatic injury and musculoskeletal diseases; &#183; ACSelerate-AD &#8482; - for differentiation of ATCELL &#8482; into adipocytes ( ATCELL-AD &#8482; ) for the repair of adipose tissue defects resulting from injury or surgical procedures and is designed for those patients without an appropriate amount of body fat for corrective tissue transfer procedures; &#183; ACSelerate-MY &#8482; - for differentiation of ATCELL &#8482; into myocytes ( ATCELL-MY &#8482; ) for the repair of muscle tissue defects and loss as the result of traumatic injury, surgery or systemic disease; &#183; ACSelerate-CP &#8482; - a clinical grade, non-DMSO (Dimethyl Sulfoxide) cellular cryopreservation media designed to conform to certain FDA and PHS 361 exemptions available for marketing our ATGRAFT &#8482; service. &#183; ACSelerate- TR &#8482; - A clinical grade sterile transportation medium designed to maintain the viability of the tissue, at ambient temperatures for up to 100 hours during the shipment of adipose tissue to our processing facility. &#160; 

The Company continues to optimize additional versions of ACSelerate &#8482; media through further research and testing to develop versions for differentiation of ATCELL &#8482; ADSCs into neural, lung and other specific cell types that may be necessary for use in future clinical applications. Many of these applications are not currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. On December 31, 2014 the Company filed a new patent application for an advanced medium formulation titled Human Albumin Serum for Cell Culture Medium for Clinical Growth of Human Adipose Stromal Cells. (US Serial No. 62/098799) representing the most recent results of this ongoing optimization program. On December 31, 2015, the Company converted the provisional application to an international PCT filing (PCT/US/68350) under the title Human Serum for Cell Culture for Clinical Groth of Human Adipose Stromal Cells. 

&#160; 

ACS Laboratories &#8482; : Laboratory Product Sales, Contract Manufacturing and Professional Services &#8211; ACS Laboratories is a division of American CryoStem Corporation, responsible for the manufacturing and sale of all the Company&#8217;s patented and patent pending cellular, cell culture, processing and testing products to professional, institutional and commercial clients. The Company operates a separate website ( acslaboratories.com) to distinguish the sale of commercial and research products from its consumer products and services, which are marketed on its main website ( americancryostem.com ). ACS Laboratories manufactures a full line of ACSelerate &#8482; cell culture media and ATCELL &#8482; products; and provides these products to our collaborative partners as further discussed below. 

&#160; 

Contract Manufacturing, Autokine-CM &#174; Anti-Aging, Autologous Skin Care Product Line &#8211; Under agreement with Personal Cell Sciences (PCS), we manufacture the key ingredient Autokine-CM &#174; (autologous adipose derived stem cell conditioned medium) for PCS&#8217; U-Autologous &#8482; anti-aging topical formulation. Each product is genetically unique to the patient and custom blended, deriving its key ingredients from the individual client&#8217;s own stem cells. The Company provides its CELLECT &#174; Tissue Collection service to collect the required tissue to manufacture the U-Autologous product and processes it under the same Standard Operating Procedures that it developed for the ATGRAFT &#8482; and ATCELL &#8482; cell processing services utilizing ACSelerate &#8482; cell culture media. The Company receives collection, processing and long term storage fees and earns a royalty on all U-Autologous product sales. The utilization of the Company&#8217;s core services in its contract manufacturing relationships provides opportunities for the Company to promote ATGRAFT &#8482; and ATCELL &#8482; products. 

&#160; 

Our Company&#8217;s contract manufacturing services can be extended to develop custom and/or white label products and services for both local and global cosmetic and regenerative medicine companies, physicians, wellness clinics and medical spas. The Company intends to expand its relationships and contract manufacturing regionally through its physician networks and globally through its International Licensing Program. 

&#160; 

International Licensing Program &#8211; The Company believes that globally, many jurisdictions outside the US currently permit use of cellular therapies and regenerative medicine applications. The Company has received numerous international inquiries concerning the sale or licensing of our SOPs, products and services in the Regenerative Medicine and Medical Tourism Markets. The Company believes that the inquiries to date are a result of the global boom in Medical Tourism, Regenerative Medicine and the slow pace of approval of cellular therapies and regenerative medicine applications in the US. To address the Company&#8217;s sales, marketing and branding opportunities globally, the Company has created its international licensing program. To date we have licensed our technologies in Hong Kong and Shenzhen, China and, Tokyo, Japan. 

&#160; 

The Company believes it can take advantage of the significant growth of the global cellular therapy market through its international licensing and marketing efforts. A recently published study by Transparency Market Research predicts that the Stem Cell market will grow at a CAGR of 24.2% upon its value of US $26.23 billion in 2013 and will reach an approximate value of US $119.52 billion by 2019. The report, titled &#8220;Stem Cells Market - Global Industry Analysis, Size, Share, Growth, Trends and Forecast, 2012 - 2018&#8221;; which can be found at ( http://globenewswire.com/news-release/2014/12/22/693419/10113247/en/Global-Stem-Cells-Market-to-grow-at-a-CAGR-of-24-2-to-Push-US-119-52-billion-by-2019-Transparency-Market-Research. ) 

&#160; 

Product Development 

Our strategic approach to product development is to design, develop and launch new products and services that utilize our existing products and services. Management believes that this approach will provide the Company with opportunities to produce near term cash flow, strong recurring revenue streams, strong international licensing partners and complementary scientific data. We focus on developing products, services and applications that require tissue collection and processing as the initial requirement to produce cellular therapies and products. These products and services may include adipose tissue and stem cell sample processing and storage as a form of personal &#8220;bio-insurance&#8221;, adipose tissue (fat) storage for cosmetic fat engraftment procedures, and the creation and production of topical applications and ingredients used by other companies in the wound care and cosmetic industries as well as cellular applications and bio-materials development. 

&#160; 

We intend to focus our efforts on expanding our product and services pipelines based upon our intellectual property portfolio, collaborative development relationships, product sales and distribution, and international licensing and partnering opportunities. Our current activities include supporting our university and industry collaborations by providing our products and services with the expectation that our products and services become the basis for new adipose tissue and stem cell based Regenerative Medicine and cellular therapy applications. We believe this strategy allows our proposed research partners and their application development to begin with clinically harvested and processed adipose tissue and ADSCs (ATCELL &#8482; ), which may be a significant step toward accelerating the development and approval of new treatments. 

&#160; 

Collaboration / Partnering Opportunities / Acquisitions 

BioLife Customer and Physician Acquisition 

In February 2015 the Company entered into a binding asset purchase agreement with BioLife Cell Bank Dallas, LLC and BioLife Cell Bank Management, LLC (collectively &#8220;BioLife&#8221;), to purchase all of BioLife&#8217;s current adipose tissue, stem cell storage clients samples, and physician network. The transaction was concluded in March of 2015. Transfer of the adipose tissue samples was completed on April 24, 2015 and the Company undertook a complete physical inventory of the transferred samples. The Company initiated annual storage fee billing to the acquired storage clients in June of 2015. Management believes that, with the acquisition of BioLife, the Company became one of the largest commercial adipose storage facility in the United States. 

Additionally the Company acquired the physician customer list of approximately 60 cosmetic and plastic surgeons, and began marketing its services to all previous physician users of the BioLife services. 

&#160;

Protein Genomics and Formation of Autogenesis Corporation 

In 2012, American CryoStem entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) outlining our initial collaborative efforts with Protein Genomics, Inc. (PGEN) to test and develop new products by combining certain components of our respective intellectual property and patented products. We have provided PGEN and its research partner, Development Engineering Sciences (DES), with Adipose Derived Stem Cells (ATCELL &#8482; ) and our patented cell culture mediums (ACSelerate &#8482; ) for testing with PGEN&#8217;s patented products designed for the wound healing market. Research and development has been ongoing since late 2012 and notable progress has been achieved. 

&#160; 

As a result of the success realized in the early stage of this research collaboration, in fiscal 2013 we entered into a formal joint venture with Protein Genomics through the incorporation of Autogenesis, Corp. as required by the 2012 MOU. Each company (CRYO and PGen) initially has an equal ownership interest. All products capable of being commercialized, as well as any new intellectual property, resulting from the ongoing scientific collaboration will be wholly-owned by Autogenesis. This is representative of how we believe additional research collaborations utilizing our Company&#8217;s technology may evolve in the future. 

During 2013 and 2014, the collaborative efforts resulted in successful initial &#8220;proof of concept&#8221; combining PGEN&#8217;s unique biomaterial and the Company&#8217;s ATCELL &#8482; and ACSelerate &#8482; products. Management believes the publication of the preliminary results showed successful healing of full depth wounds on the backs of immune deficient mice. 

Our collaborative research has established that membrane scaffolds fabricated from human proteins can be cultivated with ATCELL &#8482; cells causing the scaffolds to be rapidly and completely covered by the cells. The cells then secrete their own extracellular matrix, creating a structure with layers of matrix, cells and scaffold. This living structure, when introduced into a mouse wound model, localizes the stem cells in the wound, protects the cells within the wound environment, promotes cell growth and causes a statistically significant increase in the rate of wound closure and healing compared to the standard of care. Further evaluation will measure the performance of these scaffolds in accelerating the rate of wound closure, healed scar thickness, growth of new blood vessels and production of key wound healing factors. Our objective is to show that these constructs can stimulate the growth of new tissue and promote wound closure and healing. 

INTEGRA LifeSciences: 

On June 4, 2015, the Company and Autogenesis, Corp. entered into Non-Disclosure and Material Transfer Agreements with Integra LifeSciences, under which the parties are exploring certain combinations of American CryoStem&#8217;s, ATCELL &#8482; stem cells, its licensed biomaterials and Integra products and other biomaterials for the development of new products and services. Integra LifeSciences, a NYSE traded (INT) New Jersey based company, is a world leader in medical technology and wound healing. Integra offers innovative solutions, including leading regenerative technologies, in specialty surgical solutions, orthopedics and tissue technologies. ( http://www.integralife.com/ ) 

Under the terms of the Agreement the Company will supply biomaterials to Integra and utilize its AGRFAFT &#8482; , CELLECT &#174; , ATCELL &#8482; and ACSelerate &#8482; products for the development of new devices and biologic products for use with the co-developed biomaterials. To date the Company has delivered biomaterials to Integra for use in the development of the new biomaterials and initiated the processing and testing of porcine (pig) adipose tissue for use in the initial animal studies. The Company is currently working with Integra to schedule additional work necessary to advance the product development in 2016 which include additional porcine tissue processing, and combining our ATCELL &#8482; and ACSelerate &#8482; products with the new materials. 

Rutgers University 

In May of 2012, American CryoStem entered into Material Transfer Agreements with three research scientists at Rutgers University allowing them to utilize the Company&#8217;s autologous Adipose-Derived Stem Cells (ATCELL&#8482;) and patented, serum free, GMP grade cell culture and differentiation mediums (ACSelerate&#8482;) for evaluation with the anticipation to implement additional agreements to research, develop and commercialize innovative new cellular therapies targeting incurable diseases, neurological disorders and the $5 billion global wound care market. 

During the last quarter of 2015 the Company undertook a review of the collaborative efforts between the Company and Dr. Lee pending the expiration of the agreements in November of 2015. Management believes that potential commercialization of the licensed technologies would require a number of years of additional study and experimentation and requires substantial investment by the Company. In November of 2015 the Collaboration and Research Agreement and the Licensing Agreement were terminated. The Company continues to discuss alternative arrangements with Dr. Lee and the Rutgers Office of Technology Transfer for the continuing provision of our ATCELL &#8482; and ATGRAFT &#8482; products to Dr. Lee to support his continuing research. 

Cells on Ice: 

In August of 2015 the company entered into an Agreement with Cells On Ice, Inc. (COI) located in Los Angeles, California to process adipose tissue and adipose derived cellular samples for future use in Regenerative Medicine. COI is a network of physicians interested in the development and use of adipose tissue and adipose derived cellular samples in regenerative therapies and cellular medicine. The Company has agreed to distribute its CELLECT &#174; collection boxes and provide its ATGRAFT &#8482; and ATCELL &#8482; processing services under the COI brand for the collection, processing and storage of tissue samples at its NJ facility. Under the agreement, COI will pay the Company for the processing and storage of each sample generated by COI network physicians. COI plans to seek regulatory approval for use of the stored samples in clinical studies and trials utilizing adipose tissue processed into Stromal Vascular Fraction (SVF) and ultimately expanded adipose derived mesenchymal adult stem cells. The Company is incorporating its existing Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved protocols into COI&#8217;s studies and may provide processing and other data to COI in support of their ongoing efforts to develop and obtain regulatory approval of its cellular therapies. 

Additional Collaborations 

The Company is in the early stages of developing collaborations with additional industry and university partners. These developing relationships in their earliest stages are covered by Confidential Disclosure Agreements and those that are more advanced also include Material Transfer Agreements under which the Company supplies either ATCELL &#8482; or ACSelerate &#8482; medium products for evaluation, testing, and the development of new cellular therapy applications. 

&#160; 

To Date the Company has advanced to a Material Transfer Agreement with the University of Miami, University of Washington, UHV Technologies, and STEMCell Technologies and has provided both ATCELL &#8482; and ACSelerate &#8482; products to these entities under Agreement. No assurance can be given that these relationships will progress to full collaborative agreements or ultimately result in new technology for future commercialization. As of September 30, 2015 these relationships have yet to result in a material agreement. 

Additionally in August of 2015 the Company entered into a Confidential Disclosure Agreement and a Material Transfer Agreement with Dr. Sazlay, a research scientist currently investigating unique cancer treatments at the University of Wurzburg in Germany and the University of California in San Diego. Following execution of the Agreement, the Company delivered a number of ATCELL-SVF &#8482; , ATCELL &#8482; and ACSelerate &#8482; samples to Dr. Sazlay for testing and determination of usefulness of our products for development of his novel treatments. Dr. Sazlay has reported positive results of this initial work and the Company and Dr. Sazlay are currently negotiating additional collaborative agreements for further development of the treatments. 

Institutional Review Board Approval of Protocols 

&#160; 

In an effort to make it easier for other physicians and researchers to study the safety of SVF and ADSCs, in 2013 we sought approval from the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the International Cell Surgical Society (ICSS) of our protocols for the processing of SVF and culturing of mesenchymal stem cells from autologous adipose tissue. The two protocols, titled: Autologous Adipose Tissue-Derived Stromal Vascular Fraction (SVF) Containing Adult Stem Cells with Isolation of SVF, and Culturing of Adipose Derived Stem Cells (ADSCs) For Use in Institutional Review Board Studies , (the &#8220;IRB Studies&#8221;) provide appropriate processing, storage and testing methods necessary to move the clinical investigative process towards uniform treatments. The collection of processing and outcome data from IRB approved protocols is required by prevailing FDA regulations and guidance for approval of regenerative cellular therapies, including potency (cell count), contamination testing and cell viability. 

&#160; 

The ICSS IRB thoroughly evaluated every step of our standardized processing protocols, which serve to isolate the SVF or ADSCs from a patient&#8217;s adipose tissue. The objective of the IRB is to assess these protocols to ensure the highest patient safety possible and to minimize the risks for those participating in innovative research and investigational studies. On June 30, 2013, the ICSS IRB approved the protocols until June 30, 2014. Additionally, the Company obtained approval for a new study, entitled &#8220; Comparative Viability Assessment of Human Adipose Tissue before and After Cryopreservation (ICSS -2013-010), the Study was approved on November 22, 2013 and is valid until November 22, 2014 

&#160; 

In June of 2014 the Company submitted its IRB Studies to the Institutional Review Board of the Institute of Regenerative Cellular Medicine (the &#8220;IRCM&#8221;) and on July 23, 2014 the ICEM IRB approved the following studies: 

&#160; 

&#183; Isolation of SVF: Autologous Adipose Derived Stromal Vascular Fraction Containing Adult Stem Cells (IRCM 2014-024) until July 23, 2015 &#183; Comparative Viability Assessment of Humean Adipose Tissue Before and After Cryopreservation (IRCM 2014-025) until July 23, 2015 &#183; Isolation of SCF and Culturing Adipose Derived Stem Cells for Use in Investigational Review Board Studies (IRCM 2014-023) until July 23, 2015 &#160; 

The IRCM approved studies require annual renewal; the Company renewed the studies in July of 2015. 

&#160; 

The Company is currently making its processing services available to physicians and clinical researchers utilizing the IRB-approved protocols for inclusion in their studies. By adopting these standardized and repeatable protocols utilizing our laboratory services, researchers are able to focus their resources on application development rather than creating, validating and managing a clinical laboratory for processing tissue and cellular samples. These studies above do not currently involve actual human clinical trials, but affords the IRB the opportunity to endorse our repeatable, standardized and validated processing methodologies for the isolation of SVF and for tissue culture expansion of ADSCs obtained from SVF as the basis for future human clinical study. 

&#160; 

In 2014, the Company created and is the Sponsor of a new IRB study with The DaVinci Center, Dr. Louis Cona, Principal Investigator , in George Town, Grand Cayman Island entitled Impact and Safety of Cultured Expanded Autologous, Adipose-Derived Stem Cells deployed via Intravenous Injection for the Treatment of Multiple Sclerosis Protocol: CRYO-MS-ADSC-006. On July 23, 2014 the study was approved for 100 patients. On November 1, 2014 the first patient was treated at the Da Vinci Center utilizing the approved protocol. The IRB filing can be found on www.clinicaltrials.gov , (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT02326935). The Company renewed the IRB studies with The Institute of Regenerative Cellular Medicine in August of 2015 for another one year period. 

&#160; 

Management intends to pursue additional collaborative and partnering opportunities as a strategic method to enhance awareness of and expand the distribution of our patented products, services, technologies and expertise in the IRB-approved clinical processing of adult adipose tissue and ADSCs for autologous (self) use. We believe that as the pace of clinical trials and cellular therapy results reporting increase and scientific and peer reviewed papers are published, new opportunities to market our existing products, services and Intellectual Property portfolio may also emerge. 

&#160; 

Moreover, we further believe that the combination of our validated cellular processing capabilities and patented products give us an economical platform to develop and produce cellular therapy applications for injection or intravenous therapy, topical applications, burn and wound healing, joint repair, disease treatments and cosmeticeuticals. The clinical methods and products we have developed are designed to permit a variety of treatments for any patient with their own genetically matched raw materials utilizing our ATCELL &#8482; and ATGRAFT &#8482; products prepared with our patented line of ACSelerate &#8482; cell culture mediums.

Physician Network 

&#160; 

The Company continues to develop regional relationships to leverage its new products and services through existing cosmetic surgery and regenerative medicine practices. The Company continues to develop and expand its network of physicians seeking to adopt its products and services, initially focusing on surgeons performing liposuction, tissue transfer and regenerative procedures involving the use of adipose tissue. The Company intends to continue expanding its efforts to medical professionals interested in Regenerative Medicine applications utilizing ASDCs and establish itself as a primary source of collection, processing, and preparation of cellular therapies as they are developed and approved for patient use by the FDA. 

&#160;

Development of International Markets 

&#160; 

International Licensing Program &#8211; Globally, many jurisdictions outside the US permit the use of adipose tissue, cellular therapies and regenerative medicine applications. The Company has received numerous inquiries concerning the sale or licensing of our products and services in these jurisdictions. The Company believes that the inquiries to date are a result of the global boom in Medical Tourism and the slow pace of approval of cellular therapies and regenerative medicine applications in the US. To address these inquiries and to expand the Company&#8217;s sales, marketing and branding opportunities the Company has designed and is offering an International Licensing Program. 

The program is designed to permit the licensing of the company&#8217;s products and services to organizations that meet the Company&#8217;s financial and technical criteria. The licensing program allows for a variety of business relationship including franchising, partnering and joint venturing. Marketing efforts to date have been to clinics, physician and hospitals in foreign jurisdictions capable of rapidly building or committing the appropriate facilities and personnel to create the required laboratory facilities to operate the CELLECT &#174; , ATGRAFT &#8482; and ATCELL &#8482; services in their local market. Strategically, the Company&#8217;s international licensees will maintain the branding of the Company&#8217;s services along the lines of the &#8220;Intel Inside&#8221; branding program. 

Qualified Licensees can quickly take advantage of the rapidly expanding opportunity to collect, process, store and culture individual stem cell samples for their clients with the comfort and confidence that they are providing services that have been developed to US FDA standards. Core to the relationship is the developed proprietary and patent pending processing and laboratory operational methodologies contained in our Standard Operating Procedures, Training, and Continuous Quality Management, Testing Program, and Laboratory Operations manuals. 

Licensing programs may be initiated through a letter of intent (LOI) agreement between the Company and the prospective licensee. This LOI agreement is designed for due diligence and facility qualifications purposes. The Company may receive an initial fee under the agreement which is credited toward future royalty payments. Following evaluation of the prospective licensee the Compay will enter into a final Agreement which outlines all upfront fees, minimum royalties and consumable purchase obligations of the Licensee. 

Significant to our international development activities is the global expansion of the American CryoStem branded services and patented products, as well as the expansion of the Company&#8217;s services, technology and products as the core platform to implement cellular therapies and regenerative medicine.
