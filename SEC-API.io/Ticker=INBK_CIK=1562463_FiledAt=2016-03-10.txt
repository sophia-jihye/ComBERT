 Item 1. Business 

&#160; 

General 

&#160; 

First Internet Bancorp is a bank holding company that conducts its business activities through its wholly-owned subsidiary, First Internet Bank of Indiana, an Indiana chartered bank. First Internet Bank of Indiana was the first state-chartered, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (&#8220;FDIC&#8221;) insured Internet bank and commenced banking operations in 1999. First Internet Bancorp was incorporated under the laws of the State of Indiana on September 15, 2005. On March 21, 2006, we consummated a plan of exchange by which we acquired all of the outstanding shares of the Bank. 

When we refer to &#8220;First Internet Bancorp,&#8221; the &#8220;Company,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us&#8221; and &#8220;our&#8221; in the remainder of this annual report on Form 10-K, we mean First Internet Bancorp and its consolidated subsidiaries, unless the context indicates otherwise. References to &#8220;First Internet Bank&#8221; or the &#8220;Bank&#8221; refer to First Internet Bank of Indiana, an Indiana chartered bank and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. The Bank has one wholly owned subsidiary, JKH Realty Services, LLC, which was established on August 20, 2012 as a single member LLC to manage other real estate owned properties as needed. 

We offer a full complement of products and services on a nationwide basis. We conduct our deposit operations primarily over the Internet and have no traditional branch offices. We have diversified our operations by adding commercial real estate (&#8220;CRE&#8221;) lending, including nationwide single tenant lease financing and commercial and industrial (&#8220;C&#38;I&#8221;) lending, including business banking/treasury management services to meet the needs of high-quality commercial borrowers and depositors. We have no significant customer concentrations within our loan portfolio. 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015 , we had total assets of $1.3 billion , total liabilities of $1.2 billion , and shareholders&#8217; equity of $104.3 million . We employed 152 &#32;full-time equivalent employees at December 31, 2015 . 

Our principal executive offices are located at 11201 USA Parkway, Fishers, Indiana 46037 and our telephone number is (317) 532-7900. 

&#160; 

Business Strategies 

&#160; 

Our business model is significantly different from that of a typical community bank. We do not have a conventional brick and mortar branch system, but instead operate through our scalable Internet banking platform. The market area for our residential real estate lending, consumer lending, and deposit gathering activities is the entire United States. We also offer single tenant lease financing on a nationwide basis. Our other commercial banking activities, including CRE and C&#38;I loans, corporate credit cards, and corporate treasury management services, are offered by our commercial banking team to businesses primarily within Central Indiana, Phoenix, Arizona and adjacent markets. 

Performance 

Growth. &#32;&#32;Total assets have increased 116.9% &#32;from $585.4 million &#32;at December 31, 2011 &#32;to $1.3 billion &#32;at December 31, 2015 . This increase was driven primarily by strong organic growth. During the same time period, loans receivable increased from $335.2 million &#32;to $953.9 million &#32;and deposits increased from $486.7 million &#32;to $956.1 million , increases of 184.5% &#32;and 96.5% , respectively. Our sustained growth profile is the result of our flexible and highly scalable Internet banking platform that allows us to target a broad reach of customers across all 50 states. Additionally, key strategic commercial banking hires have enabled us to further expand our product offerings on both a local and national basis. At December 31, 2015 , commercial loans comprised 61.1% &#32;of loans receivable compared to 16.1% &#32;at December 31, 2011 . 

Earnings Trend. &#32;Net income has increased 180.3% &#32;from $3.2 million &#32;for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 &#32;to $8.9 million &#32;for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 . Diluted earnings per share have increased 76.6% &#32;from $1.11 &#32;for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 &#32;to $1.96 &#32;for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 . 

Asset Quality. &#32; &#32;We have maintained a high quality loan portfolio due to our emphasis on a strong credit culture, conservative underwriting standards, and a diverse national and local customer base. At December 31, 2015 , our nonperforming assets to total assets was 0.37% , our nonperforming loans to total loans receivable was 0.02% &#32;and our allowance for loan losses to total loans receivable was 0.88% . 

Strategic Focus 

We operate on a national basis through our scalable Internet banking platform to gather deposits and offer residential mortgage and consumer lending products rather than relying on a conventional brick and mortar branch system. We also primarily conduct commercial banking and related activities on a local basis, except for single tenant lease financing which is offered nationwide. Our overriding strategic focus is enhancing franchise and shareholder value while maintaining strong risk management policies and procedures. We believe the continued creation of franchise and shareholder value will be driven by profitable growth in consumer and commercial banking, effective underwriting, strong asset quality and efficient technology-driven operations. 

National Focus on Deposit and Consumer Banking Growth. Our first product offerings were basic deposit accounts, certificates of deposit, electronic bill pay and credit cards. Within 90 days of opening, we had accounts with consumers in all 50 states. Over the years, we added consumer loans, lines of credit, home equity loans and single-family mortgages. Our footprint for deposit gathering and these consumer lending activities is the entire nation. With the use of our Internet-based technology platform, we do not face geographic boundaries that traditional banks must overcome for customer acquisition. Armed with smart phones, tablets and computers, our customers can access our online banking system, bill pay, and remote deposit capture 24 hours a day, seven days a week, on a real-time basis. In addition, we have dedicated banking specialists who can service customer needs via telephone, email or online chat. We intend to continue to expand our deposit base by leveraging technology and through cross-selling capabilities as well as targeted marketing efforts. 

Commercial Banking Growth. &#32;&#32; We have continued to diversify our operations by adding commercial banking to complement our consumer platform. We offer traditional CRE loans, single tenant lease financing, C&#38;I loans, corporate credit cards and treasury management services. Our commercial lending teams consist of seasoned commercial bankers, most of whom have had extensive careers with larger money center, super-regional or regional banks. These lenders leverage deep market knowledge and experience to serve commercial borrowers with a relationship-based approach. We are continuing to develop new products and services for this market which is expected to produce additional revenue. We also intend to grow and expand our commercial banking platform by hiring additional seasoned loan officers and relationship managers with specialized market or product expertise. 

Experience. &#32;&#32; Our management team and our Board of Directors are integral to our success. Our management team and Board of Directors are led by David B. Becker, the founder of First Internet Bank of Indiana. Mr. Becker is a seasoned business executive and entrepreneur with over three decades of management experience in the financial services and financial technology space, and has served as Chief Executive Officer since 2005. Mr. Becker has been the recipient of numerous business awards, including Ernst &#38; Young Entrepreneur of the Year in 2001, and was inducted into the Central Indiana Business Hall of Fame in 2008. The senior management team consists of individuals with backgrounds in both regional and community banking and financial technology services. The senior management team is complemented by a dedicated Board of Directors with a wide range of experience from careers in financial services, legal and regulatory services, and industrial services. 

Profitability. We intend to continue to leverage our technology, our long-term customer relationships and our noninterest income sources to drive profitability. As we continue to grow, we believe that our model will produce a greater level of efficiency than more traditional community banks, with the goal of higher returns on assets and shareholders&#8217; equity. 

Maintain Asset Quality, Diversified Loan Portfolio and Effective Underwriting. &#32; We place an emphasis on our strong credit culture and strict underwriting standards of diverse loan products to maintain our excellent credit quality. As of December 31, 2015 , the composition of our loan portfolio was 38.4% &#32;consumer loans, 61.1% &#32;commercial loans and 0.5% &#32;net deferred loan origination costs and premiums and discounts on purchased loans. As of December 31, 2011 , the composition of our loan portfolio was 82.9% &#32;consumer loans, 16.1% &#32;commercial loans and 1.0% &#32;net deferred loan origination costs and premiums and discounts on purchased loans. 

Efficiency Through Technology. To date, we have pursued growth in a prudent and disciplined fashion. We will continue to monitor our efficiency ratio and intend to invest in and utilize technology to compete more effectively as we grow in the future. Through our online account access services, augmented by our team of dedicated banking specialists, we can satisfy the needs of our retail and commercial customers in an efficient manner. Our data processing systems run on a &#8220;real-time&#8221; basis, unlike many banks that run a &#8220;batch system,&#8221; so customers benefit from an up-to-the-minute picture of their financial position, particularly our commercial customers who complete numerous transactions in a single day. We believe we have built a scalable banking infrastructure based upon technology, rather than a traditional branch network, and that our Internet banking processes are capable of supporting continued growth while improving operational efficiencies. 

Expand Market Share Through Disciplined Acquisition Strategy. &#32; We may expand through acquisitions on an opportunistic basis, primarily as a means of securing additional asset generation capabilities and product or geographic expertise. 

Lending Activities 

We earn interest income on loans as well as fee income from the origination of loans. Lending activities include loans to individuals, which primarily consist of residential real estate loans, home equity loans and lines of credit, and consumer loans, and loans to commercial clients, which include commercial loans, commercial real estate loans, lines of credit, letters of credit, and single tenant lease financing. Residential real estate loans are either kept in our loan portfolio or sold to secondary investors, with gains or losses from the sales being recognized within noninterest income. Refer to Note 4 of the financial statements for further discussion of each loan portfolio segment. 

Deposit Activities and Other Sources of Funds 

&#160; 

We obtain deposits through the ACH network (direct deposit as well as customer-directed transfers of funds from outside financial institutions), remote and mobile deposit capture, mailed checks, wire transfers and a deposit-taking ATM network. Additionally, we had approximately $12.8 million &#32;in brokered time deposits at December 31, 2015 &#32;that were originated in prior years. 

&#160; 

The Bank does not own or operate any ATMs. Through network participation, the Bank&#8217;s customers are able to use nearly any ATM worldwide to withdraw cash. The Bank currently rebates up to $10.00 per customer per month for surcharges our customers incur when using an ATM owned by another institution. Management believes this program is more cost effective for the Bank, and more convenient for customers, than it would be to build and maintain a proprietary nationwide ATM network for our customers. 

&#160; 

By providing robust online capabilities, quality customer service and competitive pricing for the products and services offered, we have been able to develop relationships with our customers and build brand loyalty. As a result, we are not dependent upon costly account acquisition campaigns to attract new customers on a continual basis. 

&#160; 

Market Areas 

&#160; 

The market area for our residential real estate lending, consumer lending and deposit gathering activities is the entire United States. We also offer single tenant lease financing on a nationwide basis. Our other commercial banking activities, including CRE and C&#38;I loans, corporate credit cards, and corporate treasury management services, are offered by our commercial banking team to businesses primarily within Central Indiana, Phoenix, Arizona, and adjacent markets. 

&#160; 

C ompetition 

&#160; 

The markets in which we compete to make loans and attract deposits are highly competitive. 

&#160; 

For retail banking activities, we compete with other banks that use the Internet as a primary service channel, including Ally Bank, EverBank and Bank of Internet. However, we also compete with other banks, savings banks, credit unions, investment banks, insurance companies, securities brokerages and other financial institutions, as nearly all have some form of Internet delivery for their services. For residential mortgage lending, competitors that use the Internet as a primary service channel include Quicken Loans and Loan Depot. However, we also compete with the major banks in residential mortgage lending, including Bank of America, Chase and Wells Fargo. 

&#160; 

For our traditional commercial lending activities, we compete with larger financial institutions operating in the Midwest and Central Indiana regions, including Key Bank, PNC Bank, Chase, BMO Harris, Huntington National Bank and First Financial Bank. In the Southwest, competitors include Wells Fargo, Chase, Bank of America, U.S. Bank, Bank of Arizona and CoBiz Bank. For our single tenant lease financing activities, we compete nationally with regional banks, local banks and credit unions, as well as life insurance companies and commercial mortgage-backed securities lenders. Examples of these competitors include Wells Fargo, Everbank and StanCorp. These competitors may have significantly greater financial resources and higher lending limits than we do, and may also offer specialized products and services that we do not. 

&#160; 

In the United States, banking has experienced widespread consolidation over the last decade leading to the emergence of several large nationwide banking institutions. These competitors have significantly greater financial resources and offer many branch locations as well as a variety of services we do not. We have attempted to offset some of the advantages of the larger competitors by leveraging technology to deliver product solutions and better compete in targeted segments. We have positioned ourselves as an alternative to these institutions for consumers who do not wish to subsidize the cost of large branch networks through high fees and unfavorable rates. 

&#160; 

We anticipate that consolidation will continue in the financial services industry and perhaps accelerate as a result of ongoing financial stress, intensified competition for the same customer segments and significantly increased regulatory burdens and rules that are expected to increase expenses and put pressure on earnings. 

Regulation and Supervision 

&#160; 

General 

&#160; 

Because the Company is a public company, it is subject to regulation by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#8220;SEC&#8221;). Under these regulations, the Company is considered to be an accelerated filer and, as such, must comply with SEC reporting requirements applicable to accelerated filers. 

The Company and the Bank are extensively regulated under federal and state law. The Company is a registered bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (the &#8220;BHCA&#8221;) and, as such, is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the &#8220;Federal Reserve&#8221;). The Company is required to file reports with the Federal Reserve on a quarterly basis. 

&#160; 

The Bank is an Indiana-chartered bank formed pursuant to the Indiana Financial Institutions Act (the &#8220;IFIA&#8221;). As such, the Bank is regularly examined by and subject to regulations promulgated by the Indiana Department of Financial Institutions (the &#8220;DFI&#8221;) and the FDIC as its primary federal bank regulator. The Bank is not a member of the Federal Reserve System. 

&#160; 

The regulatory environment affecting the Company has been and continues to be altered by the enactment of new statutes and the adoption of new regulations as well as by revisions to, and evolving interpretations of, existing regulations. State and federal banking agencies have significant discretion in the conduct of their supervisory and enforcement activities and their examination policies. Any change in such practices and policies could have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s operations and shareholders. 

&#160; 

The following discussion is intended to be a summary of the material statutes, regulations and regulatory directives that are currently applicable to us. It does not purport to be comprehensive or complete and it is expressly subject to and modified by reference to the text of the applicable statutes, regulations and directives. 

&#160; 

The Dodd-Frank Act 

&#160; 

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the &#8220;Dodd-Frank Act&#8221;) comprehensively reformed the regulation of financial institutions and the products and services they offer. Certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act noted in this section are also discussed in other sections. Furthermore, many of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act require further study or rulemaking by federal agencies, a process which will take years to implement fully. 

&#160; 

Among other things, the Dodd-Frank Act provides for new capital standards that eliminate or restrict the treatment of trust preferred securities as Tier 1 capital based on the asset size of an institution. The Company has never issued any trust preferred securities. The Dodd-Frank Act permanently raised deposit insurance levels to $250,000, retroactive to January 1, 2008, and provided unlimited deposit insurance coverage for noninterest-bearing transaction accounts through December 31, 2012. Pursuant to modifications under the Dodd-Frank Act, deposit insurance assessments are now being calculated based on an insured depository institution&#8217;s assets rather than its insured deposits, and the minimum reserve ratio of the FDIC&#8217;s Deposit Insurance Fund (the &#8220;DIF&#8221;) has been raised to 1.35%. The payment of interest on business demand deposit accounts is permitted by the Dodd-Frank Act. The Dodd-Frank Act authorized the Federal Reserve to regulate interchange fees for debit card transactions and established new minimum mortgage underwriting standards for residential mortgages. Further, the Dodd-Frank Act barred certain banking organizations from engaging in proprietary trading and from sponsoring and investing in hedge funds and private equity funds, except as permitted under certain limited circumstances. The Dodd-Frank Act empowered the newly established Financial Stability Oversight Council to designate certain activities as posing a risk to the U.S. financial system and to recommend new or heightened standards and safeguards for financial organizations engaging in such activities. 

&#160; 

The Dodd-Frank Act also established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the &#8220;CFPB&#8221;) as an independent agency within the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. The CFPB has the exclusive authority to administer, enforce, and otherwise implement federal consumer financial laws, which includes the power to make rules, issue orders, and issue guidance governing the provision of consumer financial products and services. The CFPB has exclusive federal consumer law supervisory authority and primary enforcement authority over insured depository institutions with assets totaling over $10 billion. Authority for institutions with $10 billion or less rests with the prudential regulator, and in the case of the Bank will be enforced by the FDIC. The CFPB was also required to establish four offices: 1) Office of Fair Lending and Equal Opportunity, 2) Office of Financial Education, 3) Office of Service Member Affairs, and 4) Office of Financial Protection for Older Americans. Additionally, the Bureau was required to establish a Consumer Advisory Board to advise and consult with the Bureau in the exercise of its functions. Further, the Dodd-Frank Act established the Office of Financial Research, which has the power to require reports from other financial services companies. 

On December 10, 2013, five federal agencies published the final &#8220;Volcker Rule&#8221; pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act. Among other things, the Volcker Rule imposes significant limitations on certain activities by covered banks and bank holding companies, including restrictions on holding certain types of securities, proprietary trading and private equity investing. Most of the limitations imposed by the Volcker Rule are not likely to impact smaller banks which do not engage in proprietary trading or private equity activities. However, the restrictions on investing in hedge funds and similar entities could impact the ability to invest in collateralized debt obligations and other investments that many smaller banks hold. On January 14, 2014, through publication of an Interim Final Rule, the federal banking agencies clarified that investments by banks in certain trust preferred collateralized debt obligations are not prohibited by the Volcker Rule. The Volcker Rule did not have any material implications on the Bank or our investments or activities. 

&#32; 

On October 3, 2015, the CFPB&#8217;s final rules on integrated mortgage disclosures under the Truth in Lending Act and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act became effective. The new disclosures are intended to improve disclosures to consumers and also contain tolerance limitations that may cause lenders to refund fees charged to consumers when certain costs vary between the initial and final disclosure. 

Holding Company Regulation 

&#160; 

We are subject to supervision and examination as a bank holding company by the Federal Reserve under the BHCA. In addition, the Federal Reserve has the authority to issue orders to bank holding companies to cease and desist from unsafe or unsound banking practices and from violations of conditions imposed by, or violations of agreements with, the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve is also empowered, among other things, to assess civil money penalties against companies or individuals who violate Federal Reserve orders or regulations, to order termination of nonbanking activities of bank holding companies and to order termination of ownership and control of a nonbanking subsidiary by a bank holding company. Federal Reserve approval is also required in connection with bank holding companies&#8217; acquisitions of more than 5% of the voting shares of any class of a depository institution or its holding company and, among other things, in connection with the bank holding company&#8217;s engaging in new activities. 

&#160; 

Under the BHCA, our activities are limited to businesses so closely related to banking, managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. The BHCA also requires a bank holding company to obtain approval from the Federal Reserve before (1) acquiring or holding more than a 5% voting interest in any bank or bank holding company, (2) acquiring all or substantially all of the assets of another bank or bank holding company or (3) merging or consolidating with another bank holding company. 

&#160; 

We have not filed an election with the Federal Reserve to be treated as a &#8220;financial holding company,&#8221; a type of holding company that can engage in certain insurance and securities-related activities that are not permitted for a bank holding company. 

&#160; 

Source of Strength . Under the Dodd-Frank Act, we are required to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength for the Bank in the event of the financial distress of the Bank. This provision codifies the longstanding policy of the Federal Reserve. Although the Dodd-Frank Act requires the federal banking agencies to issue regulations to implement the source of strength provisions, no regulations have been promulgated at this time. In addition, any capital loans by a bank holding company to any of its depository subsidiaries are subordinate to the payment of deposits and to certain other indebtedness. In the event of a bank holding company&#8217;s bankruptcy, any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a depository subsidiary will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment. 

Regulatory Capital . The Federal Reserve sets risk-based capital ratio and leverage ratio guidelines for bank holding companies. Under the guidelines and related policies, bank holding companies must maintain capital sufficient to meet both a risk-based asset ratio test and a leverage ratio test on a consolidated basis. The guidelines provide a systematic analytical framework that makes regulatory capital requirements sensitive to differences in risk profiles among banking organizations, takes off-balance sheet exposures expressly into account in evaluating capital adequacy and minimizes disincentives to holding assets considered by regulatory agencies to be liquid and low-risk. The risk-based ratio is determined by allocating assets and specified off-balance sheet commitments into risk-weighted categories, with higher weighting assigned to categories perceived as representing greater risk. The risk-based ratio represents total capital divided by total risk-weighted assets. The leverage ratio is Tier 1 capital divided by total average assets adjusted as specified in the guidelines. The Bank, supervised by the FDIC and DFI, is subject to substantially similar capital requirements. Our applicable capital ratios as of December 31, 2015 &#32;and December 31, 2014 &#32;are summarized in Note 13 to the financial statements. 

In July 2013, the Federal Reserve published final rules (the &#8220;Basel III Capital Rules&#8221;) establishing a new comprehensive capital framework for U.S. bank holding companies. The FDIC adopted substantially identical standards for institutions, like the Bank, subject to its jurisdiction in an interim final rule. The Basel III Capital Rules implement requirements consistent with agreements reached by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision as well as certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. These rules substantially revised the risk-based capital requirements applicable to depository institutions and their holding companies, including the Company and the Bank. The Basel III Capital Rules were effective for all banks as of January 1, 2015, subject to certain phase-in periods for some requirements. 

Among other things, the Basel III Capital Rules (i) introduce a new capital measure called &#8220;Common Equity Tier 1&#8221; (&#8220;CET1&#8221;), (ii) specify that Tier 1 capital consists of CET1 and &#8220;Additional Tier 1 capital&#8221; instruments meeting specified requirements, (iii) apply most deductions/adjustments to regulatory capital measures to CET1 and not to the other components of capital, thus potentially requiring higher levels of CET1 in order to meet minimum ratios, and (iv) expand the scope of the deductions/adjustments from capital in comparison to current regulations. 

As of December 31, 2015, the minimum capital ratios under Basel III Capital Rules were: 4.5% CET1 to risk-weighted assets, 6.0% Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets, 8.0% Total capital (Tier 1 Capital plus Tier 2 Capital) to risk-weighted assets and 4.0% leverage ratio. 

In addition, a capital conservation buffer of 2.5% above each level applicable to the CET1, Tier 1, and Total capital ratios will be required for banking institutions like the Company and the Bank to avoid restrictions on their ability to make capital distributions, including dividends, and pay certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers. The following are the Basel III regulatory capital levels that the Company and the Bank must satisfy to avoid limitations on capital distributions, including dividends, and discretionary bonus payments during the applicable transition period from January 1, 2015, until January 1, 2019:

The Basel III Capital Rules provide for multiple new deductions from and adjustments to CET1. These include, for example, the requirement that deferred tax assets dependent upon future taxable income and significant investments in non-consolidated financial entities be deducted from CET1 to the extent that any one category exceeds 10% of total CET1 or all such categories in the aggregate exceed 15% of CET1. Implementation of these adjustments began on January 1, 2015, and will be phased in over the following four years. 

The Basel III Capital Rules also revise the prompt corrective action framework by (i) introducing a CET1 ratio requirement at each capital level, with a required CET1 ratio to remain well-capitalized at 6.5%, (ii) increasing the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio requirement for each category, with the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio for well-capitalized status being increased to 8% and (iii) transitioning to a leverage ratio of 4% in order to qualify as adequately capitalized and a leverage ratio of 5% to be well-capitalized. 

The Company believes that, as of December 31, 2015, the Company and the Bank would meet all capital adequacy requirements under the Basel III Capital Rules on a fully phased-in basis if such requirements were then effective. 

Regulation of Banks 

&#160; 

Business Activities . The Bank derives its lending and investment powers from the IFIA, the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (the &#8220;FDIA&#8221;) and related regulations. 

&#160; 

Loans-to-One Borrower Limitations . Generally, the Bank&#8217;s total loans or extensions of credit to a single borrower, including the borrower&#8217;s related entities, outstanding at one time, and not fully secured, cannot exceed 15% of the Bank&#8217;s unimpaired capital and surplus. If the loans or extensions of credit are fully secured by readily marketable collateral, the Bank may lend up to an additional 10% of its unimpaired capital and surplus. 

&#160; 

Community Reinvestment Act . Under the Community Reinvestment Act (the &#8220;CRA&#8221;), as implemented by FDIC regulations, the Bank has a continuing and affirmative obligation, consistent with safe and sound banking practices, to help meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low and moderate income neighborhoods. The CRA does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions nor does it limit an institution&#8217;s discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community, consistent with the CRA. The CRA requires the FDIC, in connection with its examinations of the Bank, to assess the Bank&#8217;s record of meeting the credit needs of its entire community and to take that record into account in evaluating certain applications for regulatory approvals that we may file with the FDIC. 

Due to its Internet-driven model and nationwide consumer banking platform, the Bank has opted to operate under a CRA Strategic Plan, which was submitted to and approved by the FDIC and sets forth certain guidelines the Bank must meet. The current Strategic Plan expires December 31, 2017. The Bank received a &#8220;Satisfactory&#8221; CRA rating in its most recent CRA examination. Failure of an institution to receive at least a &#8220;Satisfactory&#8221; rating could inhibit such institution or its holding company from engaging in certain activities or pursuing acquisitions of other financial institutions. 

&#160; 

Transactions with Affiliates . The authority of the Bank, like other FDIC-insured banks, to engage in transactions with its &#8220;affiliates&#8221; is limited by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and the Federal Reserve&#8217;s Regulation W. An &#8220;affiliate&#8221; for this purpose is defined generally as any company that owns or controls the Bank or is under common ownership or control with the Bank, but excludes a company controlled by a bank. In general, transactions between the Bank and its affiliates must be on terms that are consistent with safe and sound banking practices and at least as favorable to the Bank as comparable transactions between the Bank and non-affiliates. In addition, covered transactions with affiliates are restricted individually to 10% and in the aggregate to 20% of the Bank&#8217;s capital. Collateral ranging from 100% to 130% of the loan amount depending on the quality of the collateral must be provided for an affiliate to secure a loan or other extension of credit from the Bank. The Company is an &#8220;affiliate&#8221; of the Bank for purposes of Regulation W and Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act. We believe the Bank is in compliance with these provisions. 

&#160; 

Loans to Insiders . The Bank&#8217;s authority to extend credit to its directors, executive officers and principal shareholders, as well as to entities controlled by such persons (&#8220;Related Interests&#8221;), is governed by Sections 22(g) and 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation O of the Federal Reserve. Among other things, these provisions require that extensions of credit to insiders: (1) be made on terms that are substantially the same as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than, those prevailing for comparable transactions with unaffiliated persons and that do not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features; and (2) not exceed certain limitations on the amount of credit extended to such persons, individually and in the aggregate, which limits are based, in part, on the amount of the Bank&#8217;s capital. In addition, extensions of credit in excess of certain limits must be approved in advance by the Bank&#8217;s Board of Directors. Further, provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act require that after July 21, 2011, any sale or purchase of an asset by the Bank with an insider must be on market terms and if the transaction represents more than 10% of the Bank&#8217;s capital stock and surplus it must be approved in advance by a majority of the disinterested directors of the Bank. We believe the Bank is in compliance with these provisions. 

&#160; 

Enforcement . The DFI and the FDIC share primary regulatory enforcement responsibility over the Bank and its institution-affiliated parties (&#8220;IAPs&#8221;), including directors, officers and employees. This enforcement authority includes, among other things, the ability to appoint a conservator or receiver for the Bank, to assess civil money penalties, to issue cease and desist orders, to seek judicial enforcement of administrative orders and to remove directors and officers from office and bar them from further participation in banking. In general, these enforcement actions may be initiated in response to violations of laws, regulations and administrative orders, as well as in response to unsafe or unsound banking practices or conditions. 

&#160; 

Standards for Safety and Soundness . Pursuant to the FDIA, the federal banking agencies have adopted a set of guidelines prescribing safety and soundness standards. These guidelines establish general standards relating to internal controls and information systems, internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate risk exposure, asset growth, asset quality, earnings standards, compensation, fees and benefits. In general, the guidelines require appropriate systems and practices to identify and manage the risks and exposures specified in the guidelines. We believe we are in compliance with the safety and soundness guidelines. 

&#160; 

Dividends . The ability of the Bank to pay dividends is limited by state and federal laws and regulations that require the Bank to obtain the prior approval of the DFI before paying a dividend that, together with other dividends it has paid during a calendar year, would exceed the sum of its net income for the year to date combined with its retained net income for the previous two years. The amount of dividends the Bank may pay may also be limited by the principles of prudent bank management. 

&#160; 

Capital Distributions . The FDIC may disapprove of a notice or application to make a capital distribution if: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

the Bank would be undercapitalized following the distribution; 

&#8226; 

the proposed capital distribution raises safety and soundness concerns; or 

&#8226; 

the capital distribution would violate a prohibition contained in any statute, regulation or agreement applicable to the Bank. 

Insurance of Deposit Accounts . The Bank is a member of the DIF, which is administered by the FDIC. All deposit accounts at the Bank are insured by the FDIC up to a maximum of $250,000 per depositor. 

&#160; 

The FDIA, as amended by the Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Act and the Dodd-Frank Act, requires the FDIC to set a ratio of deposit insurance reserves to estimated insured deposits&#8212;the designated reserve ratio (the &#8220;DRR&#8221;)&#8212;of at least 1.35%. The FDIC utilizes a risk-based assessment system that imposes insurance premiums based upon a risk matrix that takes into account a bank&#8217;s capital level and supervisory rating. On February 27, 2009, the FDIC introduced three possible adjustments to an institution&#8217;s initial base assessment rate: (1) a decrease of up to five basis points for long-term unsecured debt, including senior unsecured debt (other than debt guaranteed under the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program) and subordinated debt and, for small institutions, a portion of Tier 1 capital; (2) an increase not to exceed 50 percent of an institution&#8217;s assessment rate before the increase for secured liabilities in excess of 25 percent of domestic deposits; and (3) for non-Risk Category I institutions, an increase not to exceed 10 basis points for brokered deposits in excess of 10 percent of domestic deposits. On November 9, 2010, the FDIC proposed to change its assessment base from total domestic deposits to average total assets minus average tangible equity as required in the Dodd-Frank Act. The new assessment formula became effective on April 1, 2011, and was used to calculate the June 30, 2011 assessment. The FDIC plans to raise the same expected revenue under the new base as under the current assessment base. Since the new base is larger than the current base, the proposal would lower the assessment rate schedule to maintain revenue neutrality. Assessment rates would be reduced to a range of 2.5 to 9 basis points on the broader assessment base for banks in the lowest risk category (well capitalized and CAMELS I or II) and up to 30 to 45 basis points for banks in the highest risk category. 

&#160; 

FDIC insurance expense, including assessments relating to Financing Corporation (FICO) bonds, totaled $0.6 million &#32;for 2015 . 

&#160; 

Under the FDIA, the FDIC may terminate deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC. 

&#160; 

Liquidity . The Bank is required to maintain a sufficient amount of liquid assets to ensure its safe and sound operation. To fund its operations, the Bank historically has relied upon deposits, Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis (&#8220;FHLB&#8221;) borrowings, fed funds lines with correspondent banks and brokered deposits. The Bank believes it has sufficient liquidity to meet its funding obligations. 

&#160; 

Federal Home Loan Bank System . The Bank is a member of the FHLB, which is one of the regional Federal Home Loan Banks comprising the Federal Home Loan Bank System. Each Federal Home Loan Bank serves as a central credit facility primarily for its member institutions. The Bank, as a member of the FHLB, is required to acquire and hold shares of FHLB capital stock. While the required percentage of stock ownership is subject to change by the FHLB, the Bank is in compliance with this requirement with an investment in FHLB stock at December 31, 2015 &#32;of $8.6 million . Any advances from the FHLB must be secured by specified types of collateral, and long term advances may be used for the purpose of providing funds to make residential mortgage or commercial loans and to purchase investments. Long term advances may also be used to help alleviate interest rate risk for asset and liability management purposes. The Bank receives dividends on its FHLB stock. 

&#160; 

Federal Reserve System . Although the Bank is not a member of the Federal Reserve System, it is subject to provisions of the Federal Reserve Act and the Federal Reserve&#8217;s regulations under which depository institutions may be required to maintain reserves against their deposit accounts and certain other liabilities. In 2008, the Federal Reserve Banks began paying interest on reserve balances. Currently, reserves must be maintained against transaction accounts (primarily NOW and regular checking accounts). As of December 31, 2015 , the Federal Reserve&#8217;s regulations required reserves equal to 3% on transaction account balances over $14.5 million and up to $103.6 million, plus 10% on the excess over $103.6 million. These requirements are subject to adjustment annually by the Federal Reserve. The Bank is in compliance with the foregoing reserve requirements. The balances maintained to meet the reserve requirements imposed by the Federal Reserve may be used to satisfy liquidity requirements imposed by the FDIC. 

&#160; 

Anti-Money Laundering and the Bank Secrecy Act . Under the Bank Secrecy Act (the &#8220;BSA&#8221;), a financial institution is required to have systems in place to detect and report transactions of a certain size and nature. Financial institutions are generally required to report to the U.S. Treasury any cash transactions involving more than $10,000. In addition, financial institutions are required to file suspicious activity reports for transactions that involve more than $5,000 and which the financial institution knows, suspects or has reason to suspect involves illegal funds, is designed to evade the requirements of the BSA or has no lawful purpose. The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (the &#8220;USA PATRIOT Act&#8221;), which amended the BSA, is designed to deny terrorists and others the ability to obtain anonymous access to the U.S. financial system. The USA PATRIOT Act has significant implications for financial institutions and businesses of other types involved in the transfer of money. The USA PATRIOT Act, in conjunction with the implementation of various federal regulatory agency regulations, has caused financial institutions, such as the Bank, to adopt and implement additional policies or amend existing policies and procedures with respect to, among other things, anti-money laundering compliance, suspicious activity, currency transaction reporting, customer identity verification and customer risk analysis. 

&#160; 

The United States has imposed economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries, nationals and others. These sanctions, which are administered by the Treasury Office of Foreign Assets Control (&#8220;OFAC&#8221;), take many different forms. Generally, however, they contain one or more of the following elements: (1) restrictions on trade with or investment in a sanctioned country, including prohibitions against direct or indirect imports from and exports to a sanctioned country and prohibitions on &#8220;U.S. persons&#8221; engaging in financial transactions relating to making investments in, or providing investment-related advice or assistance to, a sanctioned country; and (2) blocking of assets in which the government or specially designated nationals of the sanctioned country have an interest by prohibiting transfers of property subject to U.S. jurisdiction (including property in the possession or control of U.S. persons). Blocked assets (for example, property and bank deposits) cannot be paid out, withdrawn, set off or transferred in any manner without a license from OFAC. 

&#160; 

Consumer Protection Laws . The Bank is subject to a number of federal and state laws designed to protect consumers and prohibit unfair or deceptive business practices. These laws include the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, Fair Housing Act, Home Ownership Protection Act, Fair Credit Reporting Act, as amended by the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 (the &#8220;FACT Act&#8221;), the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (the &#8220;GLBA&#8221;), the Truth in Lending Act, the CRA, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the National Flood Insurance Act and various state law counterparts. These laws and regulations mandate certain disclosure requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must interact with customers when taking deposits, making loans, collecting loans and providing other services. Further, the Dodd-Frank Act established the CFPB, which has the responsibility for making and amending rules and regulations under the federal consumer protection laws relating to financial products and services. The CFPB also has a broad mandate to prohibit unfair or deceptive acts and practices and is specifically empowered to require certain disclosures to consumers and draft model disclosure forms. Failure to comply with consumer protection laws and regulations can subject financial institutions to enforcement actions, fines and other penalties. The FDIC will enforce applicable CFPB rules with respect to the Bank. 

&#160; 

Mortgage Reform . The Dodd-Frank Act prescribes certain standards that mortgage lenders must consider before making a residential mortgage loan, including verifying a borrower&#8217;s ability to repay such mortgage loan. The Dodd-Frank Act also allows borrowers to assert violations of certain provisions of the Truth-in-Lending Act as a defense to foreclosure proceedings. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, prepayment penalties are prohibited for certain mortgage transactions and creditors are prohibited from financing insurance policies in connection with a residential mortgage loan or home equity line of credit. The Dodd-Frank Act requires mortgage lenders to make additional disclosures prior to the extension of credit, in each billing statement and for negative amortization loans and hybrid adjustable rate mortgages. Additionally, the Dodd-Frank Act prohibits mortgage originators from receiving compensation based on the terms of residential mortgage loans and generally limits the ability of a mortgage originator to be compensated by others if compensation is received from a consumer. 

&#160; 

Customer Information Security . The federal banking agencies have adopted final guidelines for establishing standards for safeguarding nonpublic personal information about customers. These guidelines implement provisions of the GLBA. Specifically, the Information Security Guidelines established by the GLBA require each financial institution, under the supervision and ongoing oversight of its board of directors or an appropriate committee thereof, to develop, implement and maintain a comprehensive written information security program designed to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer information (as defined under the GLBA), to protect against anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such information and to protect against unauthorized access to or use of such information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer. The federal banking regulators have issued guidance for banks on response programs for unauthorized access to customer information. This guidance, among other things, requires notice to be sent to customers whose &#8220;sensitive information&#8221; has been compromised if unauthorized use of this information is &#8220;reasonably possible.&#8221; 

&#160; 

Identity Theft Red Flags . The federal banking agencies jointly issued final rules and guidelines in 2007 implementing Section 114 of the FACT Act and final rules implementing Section 315 of the FACT Act. The rules implementing Section 114 require each financial institution or creditor to develop and implement a written Identity Theft Prevention Program to detect, prevent and mitigate identity theft in connection with the opening of certain accounts or certain existing accounts. In addition, the federal banking agencies issued guidelines to assist financial institutions and creditors in the formulation and maintenance of an Identity Theft Prevention Program that satisfies the requirements of the rules. The rules implementing Section 114 also require credit and debit card issuers to assess the validity of notifications of changes of address under certain circumstances. Additionally, the federal banking agencies issued joint rules, that became effective in 2008, under Section 315 that provide guidance regarding reasonable policies and procedures that a user of consumer reports must employ when a consumer reporting agency sends the user a notice of address discrepancy. 

&#160; 

Privacy . The GLBA requires financial institutions to implement policies and procedures regarding the disclosure of nonpublic personal information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties. In general, the statute requires financial institutions to explain to consumers their policies and procedures regarding the disclosure of such nonpublic personal information and, except as otherwise required or permitted by law, financial institutions are prohibited from disclosing such information except as provided in their policies and procedures. The Bank is required to provide notice to its customers on an annual basis disclosing their policies and procedures on the sharing of nonpublic personal information. In December 2009, the federal banking agencies promulgated regulations that incorporate a two-page model form that financial institutions may use to satisfy their privacy disclosure obligations under the GLBA. These regulations became effective in January 2011. 

Cybersecurity . In March of 2015, federal regulators issued two related statements regarding cybersecurity. One statement indicates that financial institutions should design multiple layers of security controls to establish lines of defense and ensure that their risk management processes also address the risk posed by compromised customer credentials, including security measures to reliably authenticate customers accessing internet-based services of the financial institution. The other statement indicates that a financial institution&#8217;s management is expected to maintain sufficient business continuity planning processes to ensure the rapid recovery, resumption, and maintenance of the institution&#8217;s operations after a cyber-attack involving destructive malware. A financial institution is also expected to develop appropriate processes to enable recovery of data and business operations and address rebuilding network capabilities and restoring data if the institution or its critical service providers fall victim to this type of cyber-attack. If the Company fails to observe the regulatory guidance, it could be subject to various regulatory sanctions, including financial penalties. 

In support of its Internet banking platform, the Company relies heavily on electronic communications and information systems to conduct its operations and store sensitive data. The Company employs an in-depth approach that leverages people, processes, and technology to manage and maintain cybersecurity controls. In addition, the Company employs a variety of preventative and detective tools to monitor, block, and provide alerts regarding suspicious activity, as well as to report on any suspected advanced persistent threats. Notwithstanding the strength of the Company&#8217;s defensive measures, the threat from cyber-attacks is severe, attacks are sophisticated and increasing in volume, and attackers respond rapidly to changes in defensive measures. Although to date the Company has not experienced any material losses relating to cyber-attacks or other information security breaches, its systems and those of its customers and third-party service providers are under constant threat and it is possible that the Company could experience a significant event in the future. Risks and exposures related to cybersecurity attacks are expected to remain high for the foreseeable future due to the rapidly evolving nature and sophistication of these threats, as well as due to the expanding use of Internet and mobile banking and other technology-based products and services, by the Company and its customers.
