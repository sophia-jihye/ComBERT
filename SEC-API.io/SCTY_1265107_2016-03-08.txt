 ITEM 1. &#160; BUSINESS 

&#160; 

(a) General Development of Business 

&#160; 

Monitronics International, Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company" or "Monitronics") is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ascent Capital Group, Inc. ("Ascent Capital"). On December 17, 2010, Ascent Capital acquired 100% of the outstanding capital stock of Monitronics through the merger of Mono Lake Merger Sub, Inc. ("Merger Sub"), a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Ascent Capital established to consummate the merger, with and into Monitronics, with Monitronics as the surviving corporation in the merger (the "Monitronics Acquisition"). Monitronics was incorporated in the state of Texas on August 31, 1994. 

&#160; 

On August 16, 2013, Monitronics acquired all of the equity interests of Security Networks, LLC and certain affiliated entities (the "Security Networks Acquisition"). On February 23, 2015, Monitronics acquired LiveWatch Security, LLC ("LiveWatch"), a Do-It-Yourself ("DIY") home security firm, offering professionally monitored security services through a direct-to-customer sales channel (the "LiveWatch Acquisition"). 

Monitronics provides security alarm monitoring and related services to residential and business subscribers throughout the United States (the &#8220;U.S.&#8221;) and parts of Canada. The Company monitors signals arising from burglaries, fires, medical alerts and other events through security systems installed by independent dealers at subscribers&#8217; premises. 

Recent Events 

On August 16, 2013, in connection with the Security Networks Acquisition, the Company executed and delivered a Promissory Note to Ascent Capital in a principal amount of $100,000,000 &#32;(the &#8220;Intercompany Loan&#8221;). On February 29, 2016, the Board of Directors of Ascent Capital approved the contribution to the stated capital of Monitronics of $88,000,000 of the $100,000,000 outstanding principal amount under the Intercompany Loan. The remaining $12,000,000 principal amount will be reflected on an Amended and Restated Promissory Note, which is due on October 1, 2020 and will bear interest at a rate equal to 12.5% per annum, payable semi-annually in cash in arrears.

&#160; 

(c) &#160; Narrative Description of Business 

&#160; 

Monitronics International Inc., a Texas corporation incorporated on August 31, 1994, is primarily engaged in the business of providing the following security alarm monitoring services: monitoring signals arising from burglaries, fires, medical alerts and other events though security systems at subscribers&#8217; premises, as well as providing customer service and technical support. Our principal office is located at 1990 Wittington Place, Farmers Branch, Texas, telephone number (972) 243-7443. 

We are one of the largest alarm monitoring companies in the United States of America (the "U.S.")., with over one million subscribers under contract. With subscribers in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and Canada, we provide a wide range of mainly residential security services including hands-free two-way interactive voice communication with the monitoring center, cellular options, and an interactive service option which allows the customer to control their security system remotely using a computer or smart phone. 

Monitronics Operations 

&#160; 

Unlike many of our national competitors, we outsource the sales, installation and most of our field service functions to our dealers. By outsourcing the low margin, high fixed-cost elements of our business to a large network of independent service providers, we are able to allocate capital to growing our revenue-generating account base rather than to local offices or depreciating hard assets. 

&#160; 

Revenue is generated primarily from fees charged to customers under alarm monitoring contracts. The initial contract term is typically three to five years, with automatic renewal on a month-to-month basis. We generate incremental revenue by providing additional services, such as maintenance and contract monitoring. Contract monitoring includes fees charged to other security alarm companies for monitoring their accounts on a wholesale basis. As of December 31, 2015 , we provided contract monitoring services for over 93,000 accounts. These incremental revenue streams do not represent a significant portion of our overall revenue. 

&#160; 

Our authorized independent dealers are typically small businesses that sell and install alarm systems. During 2015 , we acquired alarm monitoring contracts from more than 520 dealers. These dealers focus on the sale and installation of security systems and generally do not retain the monitoring contracts for their customers and do not have their own facilities to monitor such systems due to the large upfront investment required to create the account and build a monitoring station. They also do not have the scale required to operate a monitoring station efficiently. These dealers typically sell the contracts to third parties and outsource the monitoring function for any accounts they retain. We have the ability to monitor a variety of signals from nearly all types of residential security systems. We generally enter into exclusive contracts with dealers under which the dealers sell and install security systems and we have a right of first refusal to acquire the associated alarm monitoring contracts. In order to maximize revenues, we seek to attract dealers from throughout the U.S. rather than focusing on specific local or regional markets. In evaluating the quality of potential participants for the dealer program, we conduct an internal due diligence review and analysis of each dealer using information obtained from third party sources. This process includes: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

background checks on the dealer, including lien searches to the extent applicable; and 

&#8226; 

a review of the dealer&#8217;s licensing status and creditworthiness. 

Once a dealer is approved and signed as an authorized dealer, the primary steps in creating an account are as follows: 

&#160; 

1. &#160; &#32;Dealer sells an alarm system to a homeowner or small business. 

2. &#160; &#32;Dealer installs the alarm system, which is monitored by our central monitoring center, trains the customer on its use, and receives a signed three to five year contract for monitoring services. 

3. &#160; &#32;Dealer presents the account to us for acquisition. 

4. &#160; &#32;We perform diligence on the alarm monitoring account to validate quality. 

5. &#160; &#32;We acquire the customer contract at a formula-based cost. 

&#160; 

We believe our ability to maximize our return on invested capital is largely dependent on the quality of the accounts acquired. We conduct a review of each account to be acquired through our dealer network. This process typically includes: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

subscriber credit score reviews; 

&#8226; 

telephone surveys to confirm satisfaction with the installation and security systems; 

&#8226; 

an individual review of each alarm monitoring contract; 

&#8226; 

confirmation that the customer is a homeowner; and 

&#8226; 

confirmation that each security system is monitored by our central monitoring station prior to origination. 

&#160; 

We generally acquire each new customer account at a cost based on a multiple of the account&#8217;s monthly recurring revenue. Our dealer contracts generally provide that if a customer account acquired by us is terminated within the first 12 months, the dealer must replace the account or refund the cost paid by us. To secure the dealer&#8217;s obligation, we typically hold back a percentage of the cost paid for the account. 

&#160; 

We believe that this process, which includes both clearly defined customer account standards and a comprehensive due diligence process, contributes significantly to the high quality of our subscriber base. For each of the last five calendar years, the average credit score of accounts acquired by us was 715 or higher on the FICO scale. 

&#160; 

Approximately 94% of our subscribers are residential homeowners and the remainder are small commercial accounts. We believe that by focusing on residential homeowners, rather than renters, we can reduce attrition, because homeowners relocate less frequently than renters. 

&#160; 

We provide monitoring services as well as billing and 24-hour telephone support through our central monitoring station, located in Dallas, Texas. This facility is Underwriters Laboratories ("UL") listed. To obtain and maintain a UL listing, an alarm monitoring center must be located in a building meeting UL&#8217;s structural requirements, have back-up and uninterruptable power supplies, have secure telephone lines and maintain redundant computer systems. UL conducts periodic reviews of alarm monitoring centers to ensure compliance with their requirements. Our central monitoring station in Dallas has also received the Central Station Alarm Association&#8217;s ("CSAA") prestigious Five Diamond Certification. Less than approximately 5% of recognized North American central monitoring stations have attained Five Diamond Certified status. 

&#160; 

We have a back-up facility that is capable of supporting monitoring and certain customer service operations in the event of a disruption at our primary customer care center. A third party call center in Mexico provides telephone support for Spanish-speaking subscribers. 

&#160; 

Our telephone systems utilize high-capacity, high-quality, digital circuits backed up by conventional telephone lines. When an alarm signal is received at the monitoring facility, it is routed to an operator. At the same time, information concerning the subscriber whose alarm has been activated and the nature and location of the alarm signal are delivered to the operator&#8217;s computer terminal. The operator is then responsible for following standard procedures to contact the subscriber or take other appropriate action, including, if the situation requires, contacting local emergency service providers. We never dispatch our own personnel to the subscriber&#8217;s premises in response to an alarm event. If a subscriber lives in an area where the emergency service provider will not respond without verification of an actual emergency, we will contract with an independent third party responder if available in that area. 

We seek to increase subscriber satisfaction and retention by carefully managing customer and technical service. The customer service center handles all general inquiries from subscribers, including those related to subscriber information changes, basic alarm troubleshooting, alarm verification, technical service requests and requests to enhance existing services. Our Dallas facility has a proprietary centralized information system that enables us to satisfy over 85% of subscriber technical inquiries over the telephone, without dispatching a service technician. If the customer requires field service, we rely on our nationwide network of independent service dealers and over 70 employee field service technicians to provide such service. We closely monitor service dealer performance with customer satisfaction forms, follow-up quality assurance calls and other performance metrics. In 2015, we dispatched over 580 independent service dealers around the country to handle our field service. 

LiveWatch Operations 

LiveWatch is a leading DIY home security provider offering professionally monitored security services through a direct-to-consumer sales channel. Similar to Monitronics, LiveWatch is an asset-light business and geographically unconstrained. LiveWatch generates subscriber contracts through leads from direct response marketing, where Monitronics generates subscriber contracts from a dealer network with local market presence. 

Services are provided to customers throughout the United States. Revenue is generated primarily from fees charged to customers under alarm monitoring contracts and the sale of the security equipment to facilitate the alarm monitoring service and other home automation or interactive services. LiveWatch typically offers substantial equipment subsidies to initiate, renew or upgrade alarm monitoring service contracts. The initial contract term is typically one year, with automatic renewal on a month-to-month basis. 

When a customer initiates the process to obtain alarm monitoring services, LiveWatch pre-configures the alarm monitoring system based on customer specifications. LiveWatch then packages and ships the equipment directly to the customer. The customer self installs the equipment on-site and activates the monitoring service over the phone. Technical support for installation is provided via telephone or online assistance via the LiveWatch website. 

LiveWatch has call centers in its operations center in St. Marys, Kansas and in a satellite office in Evanston, Illinois to handle sales, monitoring activations, technical support, billing and other general inquiry matters. 

Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

We have a registered service mark for the Monitronics name and a service mark for the Monitronics logo. We own certain proprietary software applications that are used to provide services to our dealers and subscribers. We do not hold any patents or other intellectual property rights on our proprietary software applications. 

LiveWatch has a registered service mark for the LiveWatch name and a service mark for the LiveWatch logo. 

&#160; 

Sales and Marketing 

&#160; 

General 

&#160; 

We believe our nationwide network of authorized dealers is the most effective way to market alarm systems. Locally-based dealers are often an integral part of the communities they serve and understand the local market and how best to satisfy local needs. By combining the dealer&#8217;s local presence and reputation with our high quality service and support, we are able to cost-effectively provide local services and take advantage of economies of scale where appropriate. 

&#160; 

Our dealer network provides for the acquisition of subscriber accounts on an ongoing basis. The dealers install the alarm system and arrange for subscribers to enter into a multi-year alarm monitoring agreement in a form acceptable to us. The dealer then submits this monitoring agreement for our due diligence review. 

LiveWatch offers a differentiated go-to-market strategy through direct response TV, internet and radio advertising. 

&#160; 

Dealer Network Development 

&#160; 

We remain focused on expanding our network of independent authorized dealers. To do so, we have established a dealer program that provides participating dealers with a variety of support services to assist them as they grow their businesses. Authorized dealers may use the Monitronics brand name in their sales and marketing activities and on the products they sell and install. Our authorized dealers benefit from their affiliation with us and our national reputation for high customer satisfaction, as well as the support they receive from us. We also provide authorized dealers with the opportunity to obtain discounts on alarm systems and other equipment purchased by such dealers from original equipment manufacturers, including alarm systems labeled with the Monitronics logo. We also make available sales, business and technical training, sales literature, co-branded marketing materials, sales leads and management support to our authorized dealers. In most cases these services and cost savings would not be available to security alarm dealers on an individual basis. 

&#160; 

Currently, we employ sales representatives to promote our authorized dealer program, find account acquisition opportunities and sell our monitoring services. We target independent alarm dealers across the U.S. that can benefit from our dealer program services and can generate high quality monitoring customers for us. We use a variety of marketing techniques to promote the dealer program and related services. These activities include direct mail, trade magazine advertising, trade shows, internet web site marketing, publicity and telemarketing. 

Dealer Marketing Support 

&#160; 

We offer our authorized dealers an extensive marketing support program. We focus on developing professionally designed sales and marketing materials that will help dealers market alarm systems and monitoring services with maximum effectiveness. Materials offered to authorized dealers include: 

&#160; 

&#8226; sales brochures and flyers; 

&#8226; yard signs; 

&#8226; window decals; 

&#8226; customer forms and agreements; 

&#8226; sales presentation binders; 

&#8226; door hangers; 

&#8226; lead boxes; 

&#8226; vehicle graphics; 

&#8226; trade show booths; and 

&#8226; clothing bearing the Monitronics brand name. 

&#160; 

These materials are made available to dealers at prices that management believes would not be available to dealers on an individual basis. 

&#160; 

Our sales materials promote both the Monitronics brand and the dealer&#8217;s status as an authorized dealer. Dealers often sell and install alarm systems which display the Monitronics logo and telephone number, which further strengthens consumer recognition of their status as our authorized dealers. Management believes that the dealers&#8217; use of the Monitronics brand to promote their affiliation with one of the nation&#8217;s largest alarm monitoring companies boosts the dealers&#8217; credibility and reputation in their local markets and also assists in supporting their sales success. 

&#160; 

Customer Integration and Marketing 

&#160; 

Our dealers typically introduce customers to us in the home when describing our central monitoring station. Following the acquisition of a monitoring agreement from a dealer, the customer is notified that Monitronics is responsible for all their monitoring and customer service needs. The customer&#8217;s awareness and identification of the Monitronics brand as the monitoring service provider is further supported by the distribution of branded materials by the dealer to the customer at the point of sale. Such materials may include the promotional items listed above. All materials provided in the dealer model focus on the Monitronics brands and the role of Monitronics as the single source of support for the customer. 

&#160; 

Negotiated Account Acquisitions 

&#160; 

In addition to the development of our dealer network, we periodically acquire alarm monitoring accounts from other alarm companies in bulk on a negotiated basis. Management has extensive experience in identifying potential opportunities, negotiating account acquisitions and performing thorough due diligence, which helps facilitate the execution of new acquisitions in a timely manner. 

Strategy 

Our goal is to maximize return on invested capital, which we believe can be achieved by pursuing the following strategies: 

&#160; 

Maximize Subscriber Retention 

&#160; 

We seek to maximize subscriber retention by continuing to acquire high quality accounts and to increase the average life of an account through the following initiatives: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

maintain the high quality of our subscriber base by continuing to implement our highly disciplined account acquisition program; 

&#8226; 

continue to incentivize our dealers to obtain only high-quality accounts through quality incentives built into the cost multiples and by having a performance guarantee on substantially all dealer originated accounts; 

&#8226; 

provide superior customer service on the telephone and in the field; and 

&#8226; 

actively identify subscribers who are relocating, the number one reason for account cancellations, and target retention of such subscribers. 

&#160; 

Maximize Economics of Business Model 

&#160; 

Due to the scalability of our operations and the low fixed and variable costs inherent in our cost structure, we believe we will continue to experience high Adjusted EBITDA margins as costs are spread over larger recurring revenue streams. In addition, we optimize the rate of return on investment by managing creation costs, or the costs of acquiring an account. Creation costs, whether capitalized or expensed, include the costs to acquire alarm monitoring contracts from our dealers, LiveWatch's equipment costs and certain sales and marketing costs. We believe our cash flows may also benefit from our continued efforts to increase subscriber retention rates and reduce response times, call duration and false alarms. As used in this annual report, the term "Adjusted EBITDA" means net income before interest expense, interest income, income taxes, depreciation, amortization (including the amortization of subscriber accounts, dealer network and other intangible assets), restructuring charges, stock-based compensation, and other non-cash or non-recurring charges, and "Adjusted EBITDA margin" means Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net revenue. For further discussion of Adjusted EBITDA, see Item 7. &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.&#8221; 

Expand Our Network of Dealers 

&#160; 

Our plan is to continue to manage account acquisitions through our dealer network by targeting dealers that can benefit from our dealer program services and that can generate high quality subscribers while focusing on creation costs. We believe we are an attractive partner for dealers for the following reasons: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

we provide dealers with a full range of services designed to assist them in all aspects of their business, including sales leads, sales training, technical training, comprehensive on-line account access, detailed weekly account summaries, sales support materials and discounts on security system hardware purchased through our strategic alliances with security system manufacturers; 

&#8226; 

individual dealers retain local name recognition and responsibility for day-to-day sales and installation efforts, thereby supporting the entrepreneurial culture at the dealer level and allowing us to capitalize on the considerable local market knowledge, goodwill and name recognition of our dealers; and 

&#8226; 

we reliably offer competitive rates for account acquisition. 

For a description of the risks associated with the foregoing strategies, and with the Company&#8217;s business in general, see " ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS ." 

&#160; 

Industry; Competition 

&#160; 

The security alarm industry is highly competitive and fragmented, and as of February 29, 2016, competitors include four other major firms with nationwide coverage and numerous smaller providers with regional or local coverage. The four other security alarm companies with coverage across the U.S. are as follows: 

&#160; 

&#8226; The ADT Corporation ("ADT"); 

&#8226; Vivint, Inc., a subsidiary of APX Group Holdings, Inc.; 

&#8226; Protection One, Inc., a subsidiary of Apollo Global Management, Inc. ("AGM"); and 

&#8226; Stanley Security Solutions, a subsidiary of Stanley Black and Decker. 

On February 16, 2016, ADT announced that it would be acquired by certain funds managed by affiliates of AGM and then merged with AGM's subsidiary, Protection One, Inc. ADT and AGM expect that the transaction will be completed by June 2016. The security alarm industry has remained highly competitive and has not experienced any material change to market concentration. Competition in the security alarm industry is based primarily on reputation for quality of service, market visibility, services offered, price and the ability to identify subscriber accounts. Competition for subscribers has increased in recent years from cable and telecommunication providers expanding their service offerings into the security alarm industry, as well as the emergence of DIY home security providers. There are also threats of potential new entrants into the alarm monitoring space from technology companies that may offer professional alarm monitoring or self monitored solutions. We believe we compete effectively with other national, regional and local alarm monitoring companies, including cable and telecommunications companies, due to our reputation for reliable monitoring, customer and technical services, the quality of services, and our low cost structure. The dynamics of the security alarm industry often favor larger alarm monitoring companies with a nationwide focus that have greater capital and benefit from economies of scale in technology, advertising and other expenditures. 

&#160; 

Some of these larger alarm monitoring companies have also adopted, in whole or in part, a dealer program similar to ours. In these instances, we must also compete with these programs in recruiting dealers. We believe we compete effectively with other 

dealer programs due to the quality of our dealer support services and our competitive acquisition terms. The significant other dealer programs that we also compete with are as follows: 

&#8226; 

ADT 

&#8226; 

Central Security Group, Inc. 

&#8226; 

Guardian Protection Services, Inc. 

Of all of our competitors for both subscribers and dealers, ADT is significantly larger and has more capital. 

&#160; 

Seasonality 

&#160; 

Our operations are subject to a certain level of seasonality. Since more household moves take place during the second and third calendar quarters of each year, our disconnect rate and expenses related to retaining customers are typically higher in those calendar quarters than in the first and fourth quarters. There is also a slight seasonal effect resulting in higher new customer volume and related cash expenditures incurred in investment in new subscribers in the second and third quarters. 

&#160; 

Regulatory Matters 

&#160; 

Our operations are subject to a variety of laws, regulations and licensing requirements of federal, state and local authorities including federal and state customer protection laws. In certain jurisdictions, we are required to obtain licenses or permits to comply with standards governing employee selection and training and to meet certain standards in the conduct of our business. The security industry is also subject to requirements imposed by various insurance, approval, listing and standards organizations. Depending upon the type of subscriber served, the type of security service provided and the requirements of the applicable local governmental jurisdiction, adherence to the requirements and standards of such organizations is mandatory in some instances and voluntary in others. 

Although local governments routinely respond to panic and smoke/fire alarms, there are an increasing number of local governmental authorities that have adopted or are considering various measures aimed at reducing the number of false burglar alarms. Such measures include: 

&#160; 

&#8226; subjecting alarm monitoring companies to fines or penalties for false alarms; 

&#8226; imposing fines on alarm subscribers for false alarms; 

&#8226; imposing limitations on the number of times the police will respond to false alarms at a particular location; 

&#8226; 

requiring additional verification of intrusion alarms by calling two different phone numbers prior to dispatch ("Enhanced Call Verification"); and 

&#8226; 

requiring visual verification of an actual emergency at the premise before the police will respond to an alarm signal. 

&#160; 

Enhanced Call Verification has been implemented as standard policy by Monitronics. 

&#160; 

Security alarm systems monitored by us utilize telephone lines, internet connections, cellular networks and radio frequencies to transmit alarm signals. The cost of telephone lines, and the type of equipment which may be used in telephone line transmission, are currently regulated by both federal and state governments. The operation and utilization of cellular and radio frequencies are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission and state public utility commissions. 

&#160;
