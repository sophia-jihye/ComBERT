 ITEM 1. 

BUSINESS 

General 

We were incorporated in the State of Florida on January 26, 2012, to develop an e-waste recycling business. Because we were not able to raise sufficient capital to execute our original business plan, we are now engaged in discussions with third parties regarding alternative directions for our company that could enhance shareholder value.

Going forward, we intend to seek, investigate and, if such investigation warrants, engage in a business combination with a private entity whose business presents an opportunity for our shareholders. Our objectives discussed below are extremely general and are not intended to restrict discretion of our Board of Directors (&#8220;Board&#8221;) to search for and enter into potential business opportunities or to reject any such opportunities. 

We have no particular business combination in mind and have not entered into any negotiations regarding such a combination. Neither our officers nor any of our affiliates has engaged in any negotiations with any representative of any company regarding the possibility of an acquisition or combination between our company and such other company. We have not yet entered into any agreement, nor do we have any commitment or understanding to enter into or become engaged in a transaction.

We will not restrict our potential candidate target companies to any specific business, industry or geographical location and, thus, may acquire any type of business. Further, we may acquire or combine with a venture that is in its preliminary or early stages of development, one that is already in operation or one that is in a more mature stage of its corporate existence. Accordingly, business opportunities may be available in many different industries and at various stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities difficult and complex.

We believe that there are numerous firms seeking the perceived benefits of a publicly registered corporation. These benefits are commonly thought to include the following:

&#183;

the ability to use registered securities to acquire assets or businesses;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183;

increased visibility in the marketplace;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183;

greater ease of borrowing from financial institutions;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183;

improved stock trading efficiency;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183;

greater shareholder liquidity;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183;

greater ease in subsequently raising capital;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183;

ability to compensate key employees through stock options and other equity awards;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183;

enhanced corporate image; and

&#160;

&#160;

&#183;

a presence in the United States capital markets.

We have not conducted market research and are not aware of statistical data to support the perceived benefits of a merger or acquisition transaction for the owners of a business opportunity.

Target companies potentially interested in a business combination with us may include the following:

&#183;

a company for which a primary purpose of becoming public is the use of its securities for the acquisition of other assets or businesses;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183;

a company that is unable to find an underwriter of its securities or is unable to find an underwriter of securities on terms acceptable to it;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183;

a company that desires to become public with less dilution of its Common Stock than would occur upon an traditional underwritten public offering;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183;

a company that believes that it will be able to obtain investment capital on more favorable terms after it has become public;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183;

a foreign company that may wish an initial entry into the United States securities markets;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183;

a special situation company, such as a company seeking a public market to satisfy redemption requirements under a qualified employee stock option plan; or

&#160;

&#160;

&#183;

a company seeking one or more of the other mentioned perceived benefits of becoming a public company.

The analysis of new business opportunities will be undertaken by or under the supervision of our executive officers and directors, none of whom is a business analyst. Therefore, it is anticipated that outside consultants or advisors may be utilized to assist us in the search for and analysis of qualified target companies.

A decision to participate or not in a specific business opportunity will be made based upon our analysis of the quality of the prospective business opportunity&#8217;s management and personnel, its assets, the anticipated acceptability of products or marketing concepts, the merit of a proposed business plan and numerous other factors that are difficult, if not impossible, to analyze using any objective criteria. We have unrestricted flexibility in seeking, analyzing and participating in potential business opportunities.

In our efforts to analyze potential acquisition targets, we will consider the following kinds of factors:

&#183;

potential for growth, indicated by new technology, anticipated market expansion or new products;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183;

competitive position as compared to other firms of similar size and experience within the industry segment as well as within the industry as a whole;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183;

strength and diversity of management, either in place or scheduled for recruitment;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183;

capital requirements and anticipated availability of required funds, to be provided by us or from operations, through the sale of additional securities, through bank loans or other commercial borrowing arrangements, through joint ventures or similar arrangements or from other sources;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183;

the cost of participation by us as compared to the perceived tangible and intangible values and potentials;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183;

the extent to which the business opportunity can be advanced;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183;

the accessibility of required management expertise, personnel, raw materials, services, professional assistance and other required items; and

&#160;

&#160;

&#183;

other relevant factors.

In applying the foregoing criteria, no one of which will be controlling, management will attempt to analyze all factors and circumstances and make a determination based upon reasonable investigative measures and available data.

Potentially available business opportunities may occur in many different industries, and at various stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex. Due to our limited capital available for investigation, we may not discover or adequately evaluate adverse facts about the opportunity to be acquired.

In implementing a structure for a particular business acquisition, we may become a party to a merger, consolidation, reorganization, joint venture, licensing agreement or other arrangement with another entity. We also may acquire stock or assets of an existing business. On the consummation of a transaction it is probable that the present management and shareholders of the company will no longer be in control of the company. In addition, some or all of our officers and directors, as part of the terms of the acquisition transaction, likely will be required to resign and be replaced by one or more new officers and directors without a vote of our shareholders.

It is anticipated that any securities issued in any such reorganization would be issued in reliance upon exemption from registration under applicable federal and state securities laws. In some circumstances, however, as a negotiated element of a transaction, we may agree to register all or a part of such securities immediately after the transaction is consummated or at specified times thereafter. The issuance of substantial additional securities and their potential sale into any trading market which may develop in our securities may have a depressive effect on that market.

While the actual terms of a transaction to which we may be a party cannot be predicted, it may be expected that the parties to the business transaction will find it desirable to avoid the creation of a taxable event and thereby structure the acquisition as a &#8220;tax-free&#8221; reorganization under Sections 351 or 368 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.

With respect to any merger or acquisition, negotiations with target company management are expected to focus on the percentage of our company that the target company shareholders would acquire in exchange for all of their shareholdings in the target company. Depending upon, among other things, the target company&#8217;s assets and liabilities, our existing shareholders will in all likelihood hold a substantially lesser percentage ownership interest in our company following any merger or acquisition. The percentage ownership of our existing shareholders may be subject to significant reduction in the event we acquire a target company with substantial assets. Any merger or acquisition effected by us can be expected to have a significant dilutive effect on the percentage of shares held by our shareholders at such time.

We will participate in a business opportunity only after the negotiation and execution of appropriate agreements. Although the terms of such agreements cannot be predicted, generally such agreements will require certain representations and warranties of the parties thereto, will specify certain events of default, will detail the terms of closing and the conditions which must be satisfied by the parties prior to and after such closing, will outline the manner of bearing costs, including costs associated with our attorneys and accountants, and will include miscellaneous other terms.

It is anticipated that the investigation of specific business opportunities and the negotiation, drafting and execution of relevant agreements, disclosure documents and other instruments will require substantial management time and attention and substantial cost for accountants, attorneys and others. If a decision is made not to participate in a specific business opportunity, the costs theretofore incurred in the related investigation would not be recoverable. Furthermore, even if an agreement is reached for the participation in a specific business opportunity, the failure to consummate that transaction may result in our loss of the related costs incurred.

We do not intend to undertake any efforts to cause a market to develop in our securities, either debt or equity, until we have successfully concluded a business combination. 

Competition 

We expect to encounter substantial competition in our efforts to identify and consummate a transaction with a business opportunity. The primary competition will be from other companies organized and funded for similar purposes, small venture capital partnerships and corporations, small business investment companies and wealthy individuals, all of which may have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do. In view of our limited financial resources and limited management availability, we may be at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors.

Employees and Employment Agreements 

We presently have no employees apart from Peter de Svastich, our sole officer and director. Mr. de Svastich is engaged in outside business activities and anticipates that he will devote to our business very limited time until the acquisition of a successful business opportunity has been identified. We expect no significant changes in the number of our employees other than such changes, if any, incident to a business combination.

We intend to hire additional management and other support personnel when we have reached a point in our proposed growth that would allow for such employment. In the interim, we will rely upon consultants to assist us in identifying and investigating acquisition opportunities.
