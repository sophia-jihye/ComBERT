 ITEM 1 - BUSINESS 

&#160;

Overview 

&#160;

Document Security Systems, Inc. (referred to in this report as &#8220;Document Security Systems&#8221;, &#8220;DSS&#8221;, &#8220;we&#8221;, &#8220;us&#8221;, &#8220;our&#8221; or &#8220;Company&#8221;) was formed in New York in 1984 and, in 2002, chose to strategically focus on becoming a developer and marketer of secure technologies. We specialize in fraud and counterfeit protection for all forms of printed documents and digital information. The Company holds numerous patents for optical deterrent technologies that provide protection of printed information from unauthorized scanning and copying. We operate two production facilities, consisting of a combined security printing and packaging facility and a plastic card facility where we produce secure and non-secure documents for our customers. We license our anti-counterfeiting technologies to printers and brand-owners. In addition, we have a digital division which provides cloud computing services for its customers, including disaster recovery, back-up and data security services. In 2013, the Company expanded its business focus by merging with DSS Technology Management, Inc., formerly known as Lexington Technology Group, Inc. (as described in greater detail below), which acquires intellectual property assets and interests in companies owning intellectual property assets for the purpose of monetizing these assets through a variety of value-enhancing initiatives, including, but not limited to, investments in the development and commercialization of patented technologies, licensing, strategic partnerships and litigation. 

&#160;

Prior to 2006, our primary revenue source in our document security division was derived from the licensing of our technology. In 2006, we began a series of acquisitions designed to expand our ability to produce products for end-user customers. In 2006, we acquired Plastic Printing Professionals, Inc. (&#8220;P3&#8221;), a privately held plastic cards manufacturer located in the San Francisco, California area. P3 is also referred to herein as the &#8220;DSS Plastics Group&#8221;. In 2008, we acquired substantially all of the assets of DPI of Rochester, LLC, a privately held commercial printer located in Rochester, New York, referred to herein as &#8220;Secuprint&#8221; or &#8220;DSS Printing Group&#8221;. In 2010, we acquired Premier Packaging Corporation, a privately held packaging company located in the Rochester, New York area. Premier Packaging Corporation is also referred to herein as &#8220;Premier Packaging&#8221; or the &#8220;DSS Packaging Group.&#8221; In May 2011, we acquired all of the capital stock of ExtraDev, Inc. (&#8220;ExtraDev&#8221;), a privately held information technology and cloud computing company located in the Rochester, New York area. ExtraDev is also referred to herein as the &#8220;DSS Digital Group&#8221;. 

&#160;

On July 1, 2013, we merged with DSS Technology Management, Inc. (formerly known as Lexington Technology Group, Inc.), a private intellectual property monetization company. DSS Technology Management, Inc. is also referred to herein as &#8220;DSS Technology Management&#8221; or &#8220;DSSTM&#8221;. DSS Technology Management is focused on extracting the economic benefits of intellectual property assets through acquiring or internally developing patents or other intellectual property assets (or interests therein) and then monetizing such assets through a variety of value enhancing initiatives. 

&#160;

In January 2014, we moved our printing operation to the same location as our packaging operation in Victor, New York in an effort to make our printing and packaging operations more efficient. 

&#160;

We do business in four operating segments as follows: 

&#160;

DSS Packaging and Printing Group - Produces custom paperboard packaging serving clients in the pharmaceutical, beverage, photo packaging, toy, specialty foods and direct marketing industries, among others. The group also provides secure and commercial printing services for end-user customers along with technical support for our technology licensees. The division produces a wide array of printed materials such as security paper, vital records, prescription paper, birth certificates, receipts, manuals, identification materials, entertainment tickets, secure coupons, parts tracking forms, brochures, direct mailing pieces, catalogs, business cards, etc. The division also provides resources and production equipment resources for our ongoing research and development of security printing and related technologies. 

&#160;

DSS Plastics Group - Manufactures laminated and surface printed cards which can include magnetic stripes, bar codes, holograms, signature panels, invisible ink, micro fine printing, guilloche patterns, biometric, radio frequency identification (RFID) and watermarks for printed plastic documents such as ID cards, event badges, and driver&#8217;s licenses. 

&#160;

DSS Digital Group - Provides data center centric solutions to businesses and governments delivered via the &#8220;cloud&#8221;. This division developed an iPhone based application that integrates some of the our traditional optical deterrent technologies into proprietary digital data security based solutions for brand protection and product diversion prevention. 

&#160;

DSS Technology Management - Acquires or internally develops patented technology or intellectual property assets (or interests therein), with the purpose of monetizing these assets through a variety of value-enhancing initiatives, including, but not limited to, investments in the development and commercialization of patented technologies, licensing, strategic partnerships and commercial litigation.

Our Technology Management Business 

&#160;

In October 2012, Bascom Research, LLC, a subsidiary of Lexington Technology Group, Inc. (&#8220;LTG&#8221;), now DSS Technology Management, initiated litigation against Facebook, Inc. (&#8220;Facebook&#8221;), LinkedIn Corporation (&#8220;LinkedIn&#8221;), and three other defendants in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, alleging infringement of four social media software patents. The case was later transferred to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. On January 5, 2015, the United States District Court for the Northern District of California issued a decision granting summary judgment to defendants Facebook and LinkedIn, effectively ending the case at the trial court level. 

&#160;

On November 26, 2013, DSS Technology Management filed suit against Apple, Inc. (&#8220;Apple&#8221;) in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas for patent infringement. The complaint alleges infringement by Apple of DSS Technology Management&#8217;s patents that relate to systems and methods of using low power wireless peripheral devices. DSS Technology Management is seeking a judgment for infringement and money damages from Apple in connection with the case. On October 28, 2014, the case was stayed by the District Court pending a determination of Apple&#8217;s motion to transfer the case to the Northern District of California, which was filed on March 3, 2014. On November 7, 2014, Apple&#8217;s motion to transfer the case was granted. On December 30, 2014, Apple filed two Inter Partes Review (&#8220;IPR&#8221;) petitions with United States Patent Trial and Appeal Board (&#8220;PTAB&#8221;) relating to the patents at issue in the case. The California District Court then stayed the case pending the outcome of those IPR proceedings which were instituted by PTAB on June 25, 2015. Oral arguments of the IPRs took place on March 15, 2016, with a decision expected from PTAB by the end of June 2016. 

&#160;

On May 30, 2014, DSS Technology Management filed suit against Lenovo (United States), Inc. (&#8220;Lenovo&#8221;) in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, for patent infringement. The complaint alleged infringement by Lenovo of one of DSSTM&#8217;s patents that relates to systems and methods of using low power wireless peripheral devices. On June 17, 2015, the parties entered in to a confidential non-suit agreement which ended the litigation with Lenovo. 

&#160;

On March 10, 2014, DSS Technology Management filed suit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas against Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, TSMC North America, TSMC Development, Inc. (referred to collectively as &#8220;TSMC&#8221;), Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., Samsung Electronics America, Inc., Samsung Telecommunications America L.L.C., Samsung Semiconductor, Inc., Samsung Austin Semiconductor LLC (referred to collectively as &#8220;Samsung&#8221;), and NEC Corporation of America (referred to as &#8220;NEC&#8221;), for patent infringement involving one of its semiconductor patents. In this case, DSS Technology Management sought a judgment for infringement, injunctive relief, and money damages from each of the named defendants. 

&#160;

On June 24, 2014, TSMC filed an IPR petition with PTAB. Samsung then filed an IPR petition relating to the same patents on September 12, 2014, and filed a corrected IPR petition on October 3, 2014. On December 31, 2014, PTAB instituted review of several of the patent claims at issue in the case. Samsung filed a motion with PTAB to join TSMC&#8217;s IPR proceeding. The request was granted by PTAB. On November 30, 2015, the PTAB issued a decision invalidating the patent claims at issue in the case. DSS Technology Management then filed a notice of appeal of the IPR decision with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (&#8220;Federal Circuit&#8221;) on February 1, 2016, which is pending as of the date of this Report. On March 3, 2015, a Markman hearing was held in the Eastern District of Texas. Based on the District Court&#8217;s claim construction order issued on April 9, 2015, DSS Technology Management and TSMC entered in to Joint Stipulation and Proposed Final Judgment of Non-Infringement dated May 4, 2015, subject to DSS Technology Management&#8217;s right to appeal the court&#8217;s claim construction order to the Federal Circuit, thus preserving the status quo in the event an appeal results in a remand for further proceedings in the District Court. On March 22, 2016, the Federal Circuit ruled in favor of TSMC in the appeal. On April 28, 2015, DSS Technology Management reached a confidential settlement with NEC, ending the litigation with NEC. 

&#160;

On February 13, 2014, DSS Technology Management entered into an agreement with certain investors to receive a series of advances up to $4,500,000 from the investors in exchange for promissory notes, fixed return interests and contingent interests collateralized by certain of DSS Technology Management&#8217;s intellectual property. On February 13, 2014, we received $2,000,000 under the agreement and on March 27, 2014, we received an additional $1,000,000 under the agreement. On September 5, 2014, we received the remaining $1,500,000 under the agreement. As of February 13, 2016, DSS Technology Management had failed to repay a portion of the $4,500,000 of advances as called for in the agreement, and is currently in default for non-payment under the agreement. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

On February 16, 2015, DSS Technology Management filed suit in the United States District Court, Eastern District of Texas, against defendants Intel Corporation, Dell, Inc., GameStop Corp., Conn&#8217;s Inc., Conn Appliances, Inc., NEC Corporation of America, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., Wal-Mart Stores Texas, LLC, and AT&#38;T, Inc. The complaint alleges patent infringement and seeks a judgment for infringement of two of DSSTM&#8217;s patents, injunctive relief and money damages. On December 9, 2015, Intel filed IPR petitions with PTAB for review of the patents at issue in the case. As of the date of this Report, PTAB has not yet made a determination whether the IPRs will be instituted. On March 18, 2016, the District Court issued an Order granting Intel&#8217;s motion to stay the case until completion of the IPR proceedings. 

&#160;

On July 16, 2015, DSS Technology Management filed three separate lawsuits in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas alleging infringement of certain of its semiconductor patents. The defendants are SK Hynix et al., Samsung Electronics et al., and Qualcomm Incorporated. Each respective complaint alleges patent infringement and seeks judgment for infringement, injunctive relief and money damages. On November 12, 2015, SK Hynix filed an IPR petition with PTAB for review of the patent at issue in their case. On March 18, 2016, Samsung filed an IPR petition as well. As of the date of this Report, PTAB has not yet made a determination whether the IPR will be instituted. 

&#160;

Our Core Products, Technology and Services 

&#160;

Our core business is counterfeit prevention, brand protection and validation of authentic print media, including government-issued documents, packaging, ID cards and licenses. We believe we are a leader in the research and development of optical deterrent technologies and have commercialized these technologies with a suite of products that offer our customers an array of document security solutions. We provide document security technology to security printers, corporations, consumer product companies, and governments for protection of vital records and documents, certifications, travel documents, consumer products, pharmaceutical packaging and school transcripts. 

&#160;

Optical deterrent features such as ours are utilized mainly by large security printers for the protection of important printed documents, such as vital records, and identification documents. Many of these features such as micro-printing were developed pre-1980 as they were designed to be effective on the imaging devices of the day which were mainly photography mechanisms. With the advent of modern day scanners, digital copiers, digital cameras and easy to use imaging software such as Adobe Photoshop many of the pre-1980 optical deterrents such as micro-printing are no longer used or are much less effective in the prevention of counterfeiting. 

&#160;

Unlike some of our competitors, our technologies are developed to defeat today&#8217;s modern imaging systems. Almost all of our products and processes are built to thwart scanners and digital copiers and we believe that our products are the most effective in doing so in the market today. In addition, our technologies do not require expensive hardware or software add-ons to authenticate a document, but instead require simple, inexpensive hand-held readers which can be calibrated to particular hidden design features. Our technologies are literally ink on paper that is printed with a particular method to hide selected things from a scanner&#8217;s &#8220;eye&#8221; or distort what a scanner &#8220;sees.&#8221; These attributes make our anti-scanning technologies very cost effective versus other current offerings on the market since our technologies are imbedded during the normal printing process, thereby significantly reducing the costs to implement the technologies. 

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s primary anti-counterfeiting products and technologies are marketed under its AuthentiGuard&#174; registered trademark. 

&#160;

In October 2012, the Company introduced AuthentiGuard&#174;, an iPhone application for authentication, targeted to major pharmaceutical and other companies worldwide. The application is a cloud-enabled solution that permits efficient and cost effective authentication for packaging, documents and credentials. The solution embeds customizable, covert AuthentiGuard&#174; Prism technology that resists duplication on copiers and scanners in a product&#8217;s packaging. Product verification using a smartphone application creates real-time, accurate authentication results for brand owners that can be integrated into existing information systems. 

&#160;

Intellectual Property 

&#160;

Patents 

&#160;

Our ability to compete effectively depends largely upon our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology, products and manufacturing processes. We principally rely upon patent, trademark, trade secrets and contract law to establish and protect our proprietary rights. During our development, we have expended a significant percentage of our resources on research and development in an effort to become a market leader with the ability to provide our customers effective solutions against an ever changing array of counterfeit risks. Our position in the security print market is based on our technologies and products. We dedicate two staff members to research and development of print technologies, digital graphic files, and printing techniques that allow us to expand our ability to combat a wide variety of counterfeiting and brand protection issues. In 2015 and 2014, we spent approximately $470,000 and $462,000 respectively, on research and development which is comprised mainly of compensation costs, materials and consultants, including stock-based payments to consultants. 

&#160;

&#160; 5 &#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

We currently own several patents that cover technologies ranging from semiconductor to wireless peripherals. We also have a portfolio of issued anti-counterfeiting and authentication patents, and several patent applications in process, including provisional and Patent Cooperation Treaty (&#8220;PCT&#8221;) patent applications in various countries including the United States, Canada, and Europe. These applications cover our anti-counterfeiting technologies, including our AuthentiGuard&#174; On-Demand and ADX, AuthentiGuard&#174; Prism&#8482;, AuthentiGuard&#174; Phantom&#8482;, AuthentiGuard&#174; Survivor 21&#8482;, AuthentiGuard&#174; VeriGlow&#8482; products, and several other anti-counterfeiting and authentication technologies in development. Our issued patents have remaining durations ranging from 1 to 17 years. 

&#160;

Trademarks 

&#160;

We have registered our &#8220;AuthentiGuard&#174;&#8221; mark, as well as our &#8220;Survivor 21&#174;&#8221; electronic check icon and &#8220;VeriGlow&#174;&#8221; with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. A trademark application is pending in Canada for &#8220;AuthentiGuard.&#8221; AuthentiGuard&#174; is registered in several European countries including the United Kingdom. We have also applied to register AuthentiSite TM, AuthentiShare TM, and AuthentiSuite TM in the U.S. 

&#160;

Websites 

&#160;

The primary website we maintain is www.dsssecure.com, which describes our company, our company history, our patented document security solutions, our major product offerings, and our targeted vertical markets. The website provides detailed product offerings of each of our divisions - Printing, Packaging, Plastics and Digital. In addition, we maintain the website www.protectedpaper.com, an e-commerce site that markets and sells our patented security paper, hand-held security verifiers and custom security documents to end users worldwide. In addition to the active websites, the Company owns over 40 domain names for future use or for strategic competitive reasons. 

&#160;

Markets and Competition 

&#160;

The security print market is comprised of a few very large companies and an increasing number of small companies with specific technology niches. The expansion of this market is primarily due to the fact that counterfeiting has expanded significantly as advancing technologies in digital duplication and scanning combined with increasingly sophisticated design software has enabled easier reproduction of original documents, vital records and IDs, packaging, and labels. Our competitors include Standard Register Company, which specializes in printing security technologies for the check and forms and medical industries; and De La Rue Plc, that specializes in printing secure currency, tickets, labels, lottery tickets and vital records for governments and Fortune 500 companies. Large office equipment manufacturers, called OEMs, such as Sharp, Xerox Canon, Ricoh, Hewlett Packard and Eastman Kodak are developing &#8220;smart copier&#8221; technology that recognizes particular graphical images and produces warning words or distorted copies. Some of the OEMs are also developing user assigned and variable pantograph &#8220;hidden word&#8221; technologies in which users can assign a particular hidden word in copy, such as &#8220;void&#8221; that is displayed when a copy of such document is made. In addition, other competing hidden word technologies are being marketed by competitors such as NoCopi Technologies which sells and markets secure paper products, and Graphic Security Systems Corporation, which markets Scrambled Indicia. 

&#160;

Our packaging division competes with a significant number of national, regional and local companies, many of which are independent and privately-held. The largest competitors in this market are primarily focused on the long-run print order market. They include large integrated paper companies such as Rock-Tenn Company, Caraustar Industries, Inc., Graphic Packaging Holding Company and Mead Westvaco. Our printing division competes primarily with locally-based printing companies in the Rochester and Western New York markets. Most of our competitors in these markets are privately-held, single location operations. 

&#160;

Our plastics division competes with several companies including Bristol ID, AbNote (formerly Arthur Blanks), LaserCard Corporation and L-1 Identity Solutions. The plastics division primarily delivers its products through a dealer network, but also provides products to end-user customers. Competition in the plastic card industry is primarily based on production capabilities based on specialized equipment, geographic location, quality and service. In addition, competition is increasingly influenced by proprietary or niche offerings provided by competitors, such as RFID, biometric, read-write, and security features built-into the plastic card. 

&#160;

Our technology division also faces competition in the area of patent acquisitions and enforcement. Entities such as Acacia, RPX, AST, Intellectual Ventures, Wi-LAN, MOSAID, Round Rock Research LLC, IPvalue Management Inc., Vringo Inc. and Pendrell Corporation compete in acquiring rights to patents. 

&#160;

&#160; 6 &#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

In general, changes in prevailing U.S. economic conditions significantly impact the general commercial printing industry. To the extent weakness in the U.S. economy causes local and national corporations to reduce their spending on advertising and marketing materials, the demand for commercial printing services may be adversely affected. 

&#160;

Customers 

&#160;

During 2015, two customers accounted for 35% of the Company&#8217;s consolidated revenue. As of December 31, 2015, these two customers accounted for 27% of the Company&#8217;s trade accounts receivable balance. During 2014, these same two customers accounted for 40% of the Company&#8217;s consolidated revenue. As of December 31, 2014, these two customers accounted for 25% of the Company&#8217;s trade accounts receivable balance. 

&#160;

Raw Materials 

&#160;

The primary raw materials the Company uses in its businesses are paper, corrugated paperboard, plastic sheets, and ink. The Company negotiates with leading suppliers to maximize its purchasing efficiencies and uses a wide variety of paper grades, formats, ink formulations and colors. Paper and paperboard prices continued to increase in 2015, and we believe increases in future years are expected. Except for certain packaging customers where the Company enters into annual contracts, for which changes in paperboard pricing is absorbed by the Company, the Company has historically passed substantially all increases and decreases to its customers, although there can be no assurances that the Company will continue to do so in the future. 

&#160;

Environmental Compliance 

&#160;

It is the Company&#8217;s policy to conduct its operations in accordance with all applicable laws, regulations and other requirements. While it is not possible to quantify with certainty the potential impact of actions regarding environmental matters, particularly remediation and other compliance efforts that the Company may undertake in the future, in the opinion of management, compliance with the present environmental protection laws, before taking into account estimated recoveries from third parties, will not have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s consolidated annual results of operations, financial position or cash flows. 

&#160;

Government Regulation 

&#160;

In light of the events of September 11, 2001 and the subsequent war on terrorism, governments, private entities and individuals have become more aware of, and concerned with, the problems related to counterfeit documents. Homeland security remains a high priority in the United States. For example, in 2007, federal legislation was enacted that required hospitals, physicians and pharmacies to use tamperproof paper to fill all Medicaid prescriptions. The requirement, which was part 7002(b) of the &#8220;U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans&#8217; Care, Katrina Recovery and Iraq Accountability Appropriations Act of 2007&#8221;, was effective April 1, 2008. 

&#160;

We play an active role with the Document Security Alliance group, as one of our research and development management members sits on various committees of that group and has been involved in design recommendations for important U.S. documents. This group of security industry specialists was formed by the U.S. Secret Service to evaluate and recommend security solutions to the federal government for the protection of credentials and vital records. 

&#160;

Our patent monetization business is also faced with potential government regulations. If new legislation, regulations or rules are implemented either by Congress, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (the &#8220;USPTO&#8221;), or the courts that impact the patent application process, the patent enforcement process or the rights of patent holders, these changes could negatively affect our patent monetization efforts and, in turn, our assets, expenses and revenue. United States patent laws have been amended by the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act. The America Invents Act includes a number of significant changes to U.S. patent law. In general, the legislation attempts to address issues surrounding the enforceability of patents and the increase in patent litigation by, among other things, establishing new procedures for patent litigation. For example, the America Invents Act changes the way that parties may be joined in patent infringement actions, increasing the likelihood that such actions will need to be brought against individual parties allegedly infringing by their respective individual actions or activities. In addition, the U.S. Congress is currently considering a bill that would require non-practicing entities that bring patent infringement lawsuits to pay legal costs of the defendants if the lawsuits are unsuccessful. It is not known when, or if, this legislation will be passed. In addition, the U.S. Department of Justice (&#8220;DOJ&#8221;) has conducted reviews of the patent system to evaluate the impact of patent assertion entities, such as our Company, on industries in which those patents relate. It is possible that the findings and recommendations of the DOJ could adversely impact our ability to effectively license and enforce standards-essential patents and could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the enforcement of any such patented technologies. 

&#160; 

&#160; 7 &#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

On June 19, 2014, the Supreme Court of the United States decided the case of Alice Corp. v. CSL Bank International , or Alice. The Alice case was a legal case about patentable subject matter, and pertains to software patents generally. The primary issue in the Alice case was the question of whether claims to computer-implemented inventions, including claims to systems and machines, processes, and items of manufacture, are directed to patent-eligible subject matter within the meaning of 35 U.S.C. &#167; 101. The Alice opinion provides that an abstract idea coupled with a computer doing what a computer normally does is not something that the U.S. patent system was designed to protect. The Alice court then provided some interpretive guidance to be considered by the federal trial courts when making determinations as to whether certain patent claims constitute merely an abstract idea and, as such, are not patent-eligible subject matter within the meaning of 35 U.S.C. &#167; 101. As a result of the Alice decision, the defendants in our Bascom case argued that the software patents involved in our infringement case against Facebook and LinkedIn should be invalidated based on the court&#8217;s reasoning in Alice. In January 2015, the court agreed, and as a result, the value of our patents was impaired, which resulted in a significant impairment charge in the period of such invalidation. 

&#160;

Moreover, new rules regarding the burden of proof in patent enforcement actions could significantly increase the cost of our enforcement actions, and new standards or limitations on liability for patent infringement could negatively impact our revenue derived from such enforcement actions. 

&#160;

Corporate History 

&#160;

The Company was incorporated in 1984 and changed its name to Document Security Systems, Inc. in 2002. Since then, the Company has acquired a plastics card manufacturer, a printing company, a packaging company, an IT services company, and an intellectual property monetization company. 

&#160;

On July 1, 2013, DSSIP, Inc., a Delaware corporation (&#8220;Merger Sub&#8221;) and a wholly-owned subsidiary of DSS merged with and into Lexington Technology Group, Inc. (the &#8220;Merger&#8221;). As a result of the Merger, Lexington Technology Group, Inc., which later changed its name to DSS Technology Management, Inc., became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. 

&#160;

Employees 

&#160;

As of March 25, 2016, we had a total of 104 full-time employees. It is important that we continue to retain and attract qualified management and technical personnel. Our employees are not covered by any collective bargaining agreement, and we believe that our relations with our employees are generally good.
