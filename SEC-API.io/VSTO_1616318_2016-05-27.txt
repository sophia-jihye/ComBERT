 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

Certain business terms used in this document are defined in the &#8220;Glossary and Acronyms&#8221; found at the end of this section, and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated and combined financial statements included in this report. 

On April 1, 2016, we completed the acquisition of BRG Sports Inc.&#8217;s Action Sports division ("Action Sports"), operated by Bell Sports Corp. The acquisition includes the market-leading brands Bell and Giro. Under the terms of the transaction, we paid $400,000, subject to customary working capital adjustments, and additional contingent consideration payable if incremental profitability growth milestones within the Bell Powersports product line are achieved. The Action Sports brands are product category leaders, best-in-class innovators and industry pioneers in premium protective gear and related accessories. The Action Sports brands set the standard for innovation and excellence in cycling, snow sports, action sports and powersports. Action Sports remains headquartered in Scotts Valley, California and operates facilities in the U.S., Canada, Europe and Asia. The acquisition of Action Sports includes more than 600 employees worldwide. The acquisition of Action Sports occurred after the end of our fiscal 2016 and is not presented in the description of our business or the financial information provided throughout. 

Our Company 

Vista Outdoor is a leading global designer, manufacturer and marketer of consumer products in the growing outdoor sports and recreation markets. Vista Outdoor operates in two segments, Shooting Sports and Outdoor Products. Vista Outdoor is headquartered in Farmington, Utah and has manufacturing operations and facilities in 11 U.S. States, Canada, Mexico and Puerto Rico along with international sales and sourcing operations in Asia, Australia, Canada, Europe, and New Zealand. Vista Outdoor was incorporated in Delaware in 2014. 

We serve the outdoor sports and recreation markets through a diverse portfolio of over 40 well-recognized brands that provide consumers with a wide range of performance-driven, high-quality and innovative products, including sporting ammunition and firearms, outdoor accessories, outdoor sports optics, golf rangefinders, performance eyewear, hydration products, and stand up paddle boards. We serve a broad range of end consumers, including outdoor enthusiasts, hunters and recreational shooters, athletes, as well as law enforcement and military professionals. Our products are sold through a wide variety of mass, specialty and independent retailers, such as Bass Pro Shops, Cabela's, Dick's Sporting Goods, Gander Mountain, Recreational Equipment, Inc., Sportsman's Warehouse, Target and Walmart. We also sell certain of our products directly to consumers through the relevant brand's website. We have a scalable, integrated portfolio of brands that allows us to leverage our deep customer knowledge, product development and innovation, supply chain and distribution, and sales and marketing functions across product categories to better serve our retail partners and end users. 

Many of our brands have a rich, long-standing heritage, such as Federal Premium, founded in 1922, and Bushnell, founded in 1948. We believe this brand heritage supports our leading market share positions in multiple categories. For example, we believe we hold the No. 1 sales position in the U.S. markets for ammunition, riflescopes, golf rangefinders, and hydration packs/bottles. To maintain the strength of our brands and drive revenue growth, we invest in product innovation to improve performance, quality and affordability while providing world-class customer support to leading retail partners and end users. We have received numerous awards for product innovation by respected industry publications and for service from our retail customers. Additionally, high-profile professional sportsmen and athletes use and endorse our products, which influences the purchasing behavior of recreational consumers.

Weaver 

We have approximately 5,800 employees across four continents. We also source finished product both domestically and internationally for global distribution. Our supply chain and logistics infrastructure gives us the ability to serve a broad array of wholesale and retail customers, many of whom rely on us for services such as category management, marketing campaigns, merchandising and inventory replenishment. Our strong wholesale and retail relationships and diverse product offering provide a unique competitive advantage that enhances our growth opportunities, provides sales stability and supports high levels of profitability. 

Market Opportunity 

We participate in the global market for consumer goods geared toward outdoor recreation and shooting sports. Spending on outdoor recreation products in the U.S., including the purchase of gear for bicycling, camping, fishing, hunting, motorcycling, off-roading, snow sports, trail sports, water sports and wildlife viewing, totaled $48 billion in 2011, according to the 2012 Outdoor Recreation Economy National Report issued by the Outdoor Industry Association, which publishes data every five years. Examples of the sports and activities we target include archery, bird watching, camping, cycling, golf, hiking, hunting, paddle boarding, snow skiing, and target shooting. We believe the sporting goods and outdoor recreation sectors are lucrative global markets with the potential for sustained future growth. We believe a greater awareness of, and participation in, outdoor sports and recreation has been a principal driver of this growth. We believe growth will continue, driven by positive shifts in consumer demographics utilizing our products, including increases in new, female and younger participants, and expanding interest in outdoor sports and shooting activities. 

Outdoor Recreation and Accessories Industry 

The outdoor recreation and accessories industry represents a large and growing focus area of our business. Examples of activities in this industry include archery, camping and hiking, cycling, fishing, golf, rock climbing, water sports, wildlife watching, and winter sports. Our consumers often participate in more than one of these activities. We believe the fragmented nature of the outdoor recreation industry, combined with retail and consumer overlap with our existing businesses, present attractive growth opportunities, both organically and through strategic acquisitions. 

Shooting Sports Industry 

Shooting sports products currently represent the largest proportion of our sales. We design, develop, manufacture, and source ammunition, long guns and related equipment products. Among these categories, we derive the largest portion of our sales from ammunition, which is a consumable, repeat purchase product. During fiscal 2014 and early 2015 firearms and ammunition sales experienced a decline. However, in recent months, overall NICS checks increased and we believe the market for both firearms and ammunition is stabilizing. We believe we are well-positioned to succeed in the shooting sports market, 

given our scale and global operating platform, which we believe is difficult to replicate in the highly regulated and capital intensive ammunition manufacturing sector. 

Competitive Strengths 

Portfolio of Authentic Brands Focused on Outdoor Sports and Recreation 

We have a diverse portfolio of outdoor sports and recreation and shooting sports brands, many with long-standing, market leading positions. We seek to maintain our brand strength by developing performance-enhancing innovations, introducing new products, engaging in product and brand marketing campaigns, and providing marketing support to our strategic channel partners. We target selling prices that balance our premium positioning with our focus on affordability to capture a large consumer base. Our brand strength and product innovations allow us to drive sales growth and deliver robust profit margins. 

We employ a segmented brand strategy that leverages over 40 brands that are leaders in niche categories. This approach provides us with several competitive advantages: 

&#8226; 

Strong brand recognition, with the ability to command a leading market share position across several categories. For example: 

&#9702; 

Federal Premium ammunition brand has a No. 1 market share in ammunition, 

&#9702; 

Savage Arms is a nationally recognized long gun brand among hunters and recreational shooters who desire quality at an affordable price, 

&#9702; 

Bushnell brand has a No. 1 market share in binoculars and golf rangefinders, 

&#9702; 

CamelBak is the leading provider of hydration system solutions for individuals in the hiking, cycling, and winter sports markets, 

&#9702; 

BLACKHAWK! is an industry leader in tactical accessories with a customer base that ranges from individual shooting enthusiasts to government customers who depend on its performance and durability, 

&#9702; 

Hoppe's brand has a No. 1 market share in gun cleaning solutions and accessories. 

&#8226; Better insight into consumer preferences and market dynamics through information sharing across our portfolio. For example, our strategic relationships with key accounts combined with our world-class customer service model deliver consumer insights into our aligned product development organization and process. This information helps us develop and maintain a robust new product pipeline. 

&#8226; "Good, better, best" strategy using multiple brands. For example, our Bushnell Elite products target consumers seeking high-end products. 

&#8226; Increased presence and shelf space in our core retail channels. We are able to command more shelf space by offering a wide variety of brands. 

Leading Innovation and Product Development Competencies 

We believe our product development capabilities and intellectual property portfolio provide us with a strong competitive advantage. By applying our engineering and manufacturing expertise, we have been able to bring to market new and innovative products that maintain product differentiation while targeting affordability for our end consumers. 

We have continuously invested in research and development (R&#38;D) and made disciplined investments in new technology to deliver sustainable growth and satisfy the evolving needs of our customers. We have leveraged our scale to develop a sophisticated R&#38;D business process that we believe is difficult to replicate. Our current intellectual property portfolio includes over 500 patents, providing us with valuable proprietary trade secrets and technological know-how that we share across our platform. We employ approximately 100 dedicated design and product development professionals across the organization. Recent examples of our innovative, market-leading products include: 

&#8226; 

American Eagle Syntech ammunition has a complete polymer coating that takes the place of the copper jacket in conventional target ammunition, eliminating metal-on-metal contact in the barrel. The result is smoother shooting and less friction, heat and barrel wear. 

&#8226; 

The new Savage Arms A22 Magnum is based on the A17 Semi-Automatic released in 2015 and named Guns and Ammo magazine's 2015 Rifle of the Year. The A22 features the same delayed blow back action as the A17. 

&#8226; 

The new Low Rider collection of mountain bike packs was released in 2015 and won the Enduro magazine's Design &#38; Innovation award for the Skyline pack. The collection is focused on maximizing stability and a lower center of gravity for the rider. 

&#8226; 

The new Tour V4 family of golf rangefinders was unveiled at the PGA Show. The new Tour V4 and Tour V4 Slope edition are faster than their predecessor, 30% smaller, and increase the ease and accuracy in acquiring yardages. 

Proven Manufacturing, Global Sourcing and Distribution Platform 

We believe our state-of-the-art manufacturing expertise, leading sourcing and distribution capabilities, and high-quality retail, wholesale and distributor networks allow us to produce, deliver and replenish products in a more efficient and faster manner than our competitors. We believe this allows us to better meet the needs of our customers and end users. We operate 13 manufacturing facilities in the United States, Puerto Rico, Mexico and Canada. A large portion of our manufacturing requires rigorous adherence to regulatory standards and certification. These regulations provide high barriers to entry as they require significant capital investments and lengthy government approval processes to manufacture many of our high-volume products. Further, we believe that we leverage the scale and scope of our manufacturing operations to be the low-cost producer of many of our products. 

Our business model incorporates strategic deployment and alignment of the company's key objectives and goals, which include stringent operational metrics to drive year-over-year quality improvements, on-time delivery and operating efficiencies. We maintain a disciplined quality process and oversight to drive bottom line results and meet customer expectations. Additionally, our customer service model collects and incorporates consumer insight data, providing quality improvement opportunities. 

Integrated supply chain management is core to our company. We procure large quantities of raw materials for our manufacturing operations and we use effective negotiating disciplines and production methods, with the objective of obtaining the best price and delivery available as well as low-cost conversion of raw materials into finished product. We also source finished product both domestically and internationally for global distribution. We continuously seek to improve our vendor base as well as our in-country support and oversight and, through our integrated supply chain management process, we seek to provide year-over-year reductions in product costs. We believe the scope and scale of our sourcing network is not easily replicated. 

We have a global presence, selling goods through our distribution network in North America, South America, Europe, Asia and Australia. We continue to leverage and enhance the scale and automation of our consolidated North American distribution centers to decrease overall distribution costs. 

We maintain positive relationships with our retail partners based on trust and professionalism. Our long-standing commitment to our customers, diverse product offering and focus on profitability for both our company and our retail partners have enabled us to gain shelf space and secure premium placement of our products at many major retailers. Our top retail and distributor partners include Academy, AcuSport, Amazon, Cabela's, Dick's Sporting Goods, Gander Mountain, Nations Best Sports, Sports Inc., Sports South Inc., and Walmart. For many of our top retail partners, our management team interfaces directly with their executives to ensure we are delivering the products our retailers need to meet the demands of the end user in the most efficient and profitable manner possible. Furthermore, we believe our scale is a unique competitive advantage that allows us to leverage our platform to efficiently and profitably service our largest retail customers. For example, we work with 

our key retail customers to develop marketing and advertising campaigns, provide inventory replenishment support and organize product category merchandising plans. These capabilities give us an advantage as we believe few competitors offer this level of retail support or a more comprehensive product portfolio. 

Proven M&#38;A Capabilities 

We have a history of successfully identifying, acquiring, integrating and growing complementary businesses. For example, in fiscal year 2014, we acquired two companies, Savage Arms and Bushnell, both of which grew our presence in the outdoor recreation and shooting sports markets and enhanced our manufacturing, product development and distribution platform for future acquisitions. In fiscal year 2016, we acquired two companies, Jimmy Styks and CamelBak, both of which continued our growing presence in the outdoor recreation market and expanded our product portfolio. We have also maintained the discipline to forgo certain acquisition opportunities that did not meet our specific operating and return on investment criteria. We believe our integrated outdoor sports and recreation platforms, leading brands and scale enable us to enhance the cost synergy potential and success of an acquisition by leveraging our customer relationships, sales and marketing resources, low-cost manufacturing and distribution network. We also believe our broad distribution network and retail partnerships can accelerate revenue growth in acquired companies. 

Our Strategy 

Capitalize on a Growing and Fragmented Market 

We seek to capitalize on the growing and fragmented market opportunities in the outdoor sports and recreation markets. We believe our scalable business platform, strong retail and wholesale relationships and product development capabilities position us to capture additional market share. We intend to utilize our existing infrastructure and manufacturing capabilities to support the growth of our retail customers, and we will continue to leverage our economies of scale and distribution capabilities to efficiently capture the upside potential related to increases in consumer demand. 

Develop New and Innovative Products to Drive Organic Growth and Customer Loyalty 

We intend to continue to drive organic growth and customer loyalty through the development of new and innovative products. We believe our outdoor enthusiast consumers demand the latest technologies and performance enhancements, which drives new consumer purchases or replacement purchases for older products. We expect that our product development strategy will enable us to grow sales, maintain or increase profit margins and preserve the strength of our brands. 

Expand into Complementary or Adjacent Categories Through M&#38;A 

Given our financial flexibility and the highly fragmented nature of our industry, we believe we have the opportunity to continue to supplement our organic growth with acquisitions. We intend to maintain our highly disciplined approach to acquisitions, focusing on transactions that we believe will deliver significant shareholder value, create synergies and enable us to penetrate new markets, enter new product categories or service new channels. We intend to leverage the strength of our current brands and our knowledge of the end consumer to enter adjacent markets that target customers within the outdoor sports and recreation markets. We believe our free cash flow profile and strong balance sheet position provide us the financial flexibility to aggressively pursue strategic M&#38;A. 

Leverage Relationships with Our Wholesale and Retail Channels 

We have strong relationships with a number of leading wholesalers as well as mass and specialty retailers. We continuously strive to strengthen our relationships by working closely with each of our channel partners. This may include providing marketing support, supporting joint merchandising programs and managing inventory on our partners' behalf. We will continue to leverage these relationships to secure increased shelf space and premium product placement and to increase retailer sell-through of our products. As a result, we expect to continue to grow our market share. 

Continuously Improve Operations 

We have a strong focus on continuous improvement in all facets of our business, including engineering, product development, manufacturing, sourcing, sales, distribution and administrative functions. We use our business model, VPM, to align functional execution to the goals of the enterprise and to implement these goals throughout the organization. We also use VPM to identify opportunities for process improvement and to implement and monitor quality and efficiency-focused refinements to our processes. We expect to continue to use VPM to drive operational improvements in our legacy business 

areas, our recent acquisitions and in future acquired businesses to deliver improved competitive positions and margin improvement. 

Business Operations 

Operating Segments 

Vista Outdoor operates through two operating segments: Shooting Sports and Outdoor Products. Both of our segments enjoy expanded distribution for some of the most widely known and respected brands in the industry. See Note 16 to our consolidated and combined financial statements for financial information regarding our segments. 

Shooting Sports 

The Shooting Sports segment designs, develops, produces, and sources ammunition and firearms for the hunting and sport shooting enthusiast markets, as well as ammunition for local law enforcement, the U.S. government and international markets.

Our firearms products include centerfire rifles, rimfire rifles, shotguns and range systems. The Savage Arms brand is a leader in the sporting long gun market. Other brands include Savage Range Systems and Stevens. Our Shooting Sports segment generated 62% &#32;of our external sales in fiscal year 2016 .

These products are marketed under a number of well-known brand names including: Alliant Powder, Bee Stinger, BLACKHAWK!, Boll&#233;, Bushnell, Butler Creek, CamelBak, C&#233;b&#233;, Champion Target, Eagle, Final Approach, Gold Tip, GunMate, Gunslick Pro, Hoppe's, Jimmy Styks, M-Pro 7, Millett, Night Optics, Outers, Primos, RCBS, Redfield, Serengeti, Simmons, Stoney Point, Tasco, Uncle Mike's and Weaver. Our Outdoor Products segment generated 38% &#32;of our external sales in fiscal year 2016 . 

Customers and Marketing 

Our customers are outdoor sporting enthusiasts, hunters, recreational shooters and athletes, as well as law enforcement and military professionals. Sales to our top ten retail customers accounted for approximately 40% of our consolidated net sales in fiscal year 2016. In fiscal year 2016 , U.S. consumers represented 72% of our sales, while international customers represented 15% and law enforcement and military professionals represented 13%. See Note 16 to our consolidated and combined financial statements for further information regarding our customers and geographic information regarding our sales. We believe the outdoor industry is led by enthusiasts with a passion for reliable, high-performance products, who rely on a wide variety of media for opinions and recommendations about available products. We utilize third-party endorsements and purchased media to enhance the perception of our brands and products and to reinforce our leadership positions in the market. For example, we routinely garner coverage in leading print and digital trade and non-trade publications that include Field &#38; Stream, Guns &#38; Ammo and American Rifleman. We supplement this exposure with data-driven print advertising that is designed to maximize reach and return on investment. We have an industry-leading digital media presence that includes YouTube influencers and Vista Outdoor brand portfolio content sites Range365 and Shoot101. Our approach is reaching the new and recreational target shooter audience. Our integrated efforts include broadcast exposure on top networks and sponsorship of ratings-leading programming such as Bone Collector, Buckmasters, Guns &#38; Ammo and Primos' Truth About Hunting. We also rely on brand ambassadors within the industry such as Michael Waddell and Rickie Fowler, and mainstream personalities such as Troy, Jacob, and Chase Landry on the hit series "Swamp People". 

Quality Assurance 

We maintain a disciplined quality assurance process. We set stringent metrics to drive year-over-year quality improvements. We have also have a customer call center process, which allows us to collect important customer data, providing 

us with the opportunity to make improvements to our quality to ensure that our customers are satisfied with our customer service process. 

Employees 

We employ approximately 5,800 people. We operate 13 manufacturing facilities in the United States, Puerto Rico, Mexico and Canada. We have union-represented employees at our Westfield, MA location, comprising approximately 6% of our total workforce. We have had no strikes or work stoppages during the last five years. We believe that our employee relations are generally good. 

Competition 

Competition in the markets in which we operate is based on a number of factors, including price, quality, product innovation, performance, reliability, styling, product features and warranties, as well as sales and marketing programs. Significant competitors in the outdoor sporting market include Amer Sports, Jarden, Johnson Outdoors, and Thule Group. Significant accessories competitors include major optics companies Luxottica Group and Nikon and hydration system competitors including Bubba, Contigo, and Nalgene. Significant ammunition competitors include Remington Arms, Winchester Ammunition of Olin Corporation and various smaller manufacturers and importers, including Black Hills Ammunition, CBC Group, Fiocchi Ammunition, Hornady, PMC, Rio Ammunition and Wolf. Significant firearms competitors include Mossberg, Marlin, Ruger, Remington Arms, Smith and Wesson and Winchester. 

Seasonality 

Our business experiences a certain level of seasonality. Sales of our spring products and summer products, such as golf accessories, can be adversely impacted by unseasonably cold or wet weather in those periods. Sales of our hunting accessories are generally highest during the months of August to December due to shipments around the fall hunting season and holidays. Sales of sporting ammunition have historically been lower in our first fiscal quarter. Our winter sport accessories sales can be negatively impacted by unseasonably warm or dry weather in our markets. 

Intellectual Property 

In the highly competitive business in which we operate, our trade names, service marks and trademarks are important to distinguish our products and services from those of our competitors. We rely upon trade secrets, continuing technological innovations and licensing arrangements to maintain and improve our competitive position. We also have a portfolio of over 500 U.S. and foreign patents, and we believe these patents, as well as unpatented research, development and engineering skills, make important contributions to our business. We are not aware of any facts which would negatively impact our continuing use of any of our trade names, service marks, trademarks or patents. 

Regulatory Matters 

Like many other manufacturers and distributors of consumer products, we are required to comply with a wide variety of laws, rules and regulations, including those surrounding labor and employment law, environmental law, consumer product safety, and the export and import of our products. These laws, rules and regulations currently impose significant compliance requirements on our business, and more restrictive laws, rules and regulations may be adopted in the future. We believe we are in material compliance with all applicable domestic and international laws and regulations. 

Our operations are subject to a variety of international, federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including those governing the discharge, treatment, storage, transportation, remediation and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes, and restoration of damages to the environment, as well as health and safety matters. We believe that our operations are in material compliance with these laws and regulations and that forward-looking, proper and cost-effective management of air, land and water resources is vital to the long-term success of our business. Our environmental policy identifies key objectives for implementing this commitment throughout our operations. We incur operating and capital costs on an ongoing basis to comply with environmental requirements, and could incur significant additional costs as a result of more stringent requirements that may be promulgated in the future. 

Some environmental laws, such as the U.S. federal Superfund law and similar state laws, can impose liability, without regard to fault, for the entire costs of the cleanup of contaminated sites on current or former site owners and operators or parties who sent wastes to such sites. We are conducting investigation and/or remediation activities at certain of our current or former sites where impacts from historical operations have been identified. We also have been identified as a PRP, along with other 

parties, in regulatory agency actions associated with hazardous waste disposal sites. While uncertainties exist with respect to the amounts and timing of the ultimate environmental liabilities at these sites, based on currently available information, we do not currently expect these matters, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition or cash flows. We could incur substantial additional costs as a result of any additional obligations imposed or conditions identified at these or other sites in the future. 

As a manufacturer and distributor of consumer products, we are subject to various domestic and international consumer product safety laws, such as the Consumer Products Safety Act, which empowers the Consumer Products Safety Commission to investigate and deem certain of our products as unsafe or hazardous. Under certain circumstances, the Consumer Products Safety Commission or similar international agencies could ask a court to require us to repurchase or recall one or more of our products. In addition, laws regulating certain consumer products exist in some cities and states, as well as in other countries in which we sell our products. 

We are also subject to the rules and regulations of the ATF and various state and international agencies that control the manufacture, export, import, distribution and sale of firearms, explosives and ammunition. If we fail to comply with these rules and regulations, these agencies may limit our growth or business activities, or, in extreme cases, revoke our licenses to do business. Our business, as well as the business of all producers and marketers of ammunition and firearms, is also subject to numerous federal, state, local and foreign laws, regulations and protocols. Applicable laws: 

&#8226; require the licensing of all persons manufacturing, exporting, importing or selling firearms and ammunition as a business; 

&#8226; require serialization, labeling and tracking the acquisition and disposition of firearms, certain types of ammunition, and certain related products; 

&#8226; 

&#32;require background checks for purchasers of firearms; 

&#8226; impose waiting periods between the purchase of a firearm and the delivery of a firearm; 

&#8226; prohibit the sale of firearms to certain persons, such as those below a certain age and persons with criminal records; 

&#8226; regulate the use and storage of gun powder or other energetic materials; 

&#8226; regulate the interstate sale of certain firearms and ammunition; 

&#8226; prohibit the interstate mail-order sale of firearms; 

&#8226; regulate our employment of personnel with certain criminal convictions; and 

&#8226; restrict access to firearm or ammunition manufacturing facilities for certain individuals from other countries or with criminal convictions. 

In some cases, the handling of our technical data and the international sale of our products is also regulated by the U.S. Department of State and Department of Commerce. These agencies oversee the export of our products including firearms, shotguns, ammunition and night vision devices, amongst other products. In many instances, we must obtain export authorizations for international shipments. In addition, the ITAR requires congressional approval for any firearms export application with a total value of $1 million or higher. To date, most of our requests for export licenses have been approved. These agencies can impose civil and criminal penalties, including denying us from exporting our products, for failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations. 

We are also regulated by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which handles the out-bound and in-bound movement of certain of our products, as well as components, parts, and materials used in our manufacturing processes. The agency can detain and seize shipments, as well as penalize us for failure to comply with applicable regulations. Also, the agency works closely with the Department of State and the Department of Commerce to ensure compliance in protection of national security. 

Foreign regulations, which may affect our products, are numerous and may be ambiguous or otherwise unclear. We prefer to work with distributors who are familiar with the applicable import regulations in our foreign markets. Experience with foreign distributors in the past indicates that restrictions may prohibit certain sales of our products in a number of countries. We rely on our distributors to inform us of those countries where our products are prohibited or restricted.
