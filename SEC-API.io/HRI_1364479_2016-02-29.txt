 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

OUR COMPANY 

We operate our car rental business through the Hertz, Dollar, Thrifty and Firefly brands, as of December 31, 2015, from approximately 9,980 &#32;corporate and franchisee locations in North America, Europe, Latin America, Africa, Asia, Australia, the Middle East and New Zealand. We are one of the largest worldwide airport general use car rental companies and our Hertz brand has approximately 8,510 &#32;corporate and franchisee locations in the U.S. and approximately 150 &#32;countries internationally. Our Dollar and Thrifty brands combined have approximately 1,345 &#32;corporate and franchisee locations in approximately 75 &#32;countries and our Firefly brand has more than 100 &#32;corporate and franchisee locations in approximately 20 &#32;countries. Our Hertz brand name is one of the most recognized in the world, signifying leadership in quality rental services and products. We have an extensive network of rental locations in the United States ("U.S.") and in all major European markets. We believe that we maintain one of the leading airport car rental brand market shares, by overall reported revenues, in the U.S. and at approximately 125 &#32;major airports in Europe where data regarding car rental concessionaire activity is available. Our equipment rental business is operated through the Hertz Equipment Rental brand from approximately 280 &#32;company-operated branches, of which approximately 270 &#32;are in the U.S. and Canada, and the remainder are located in the United Kingdom, China and through joint venture arrangements in Saudi Arabia and Qatar. We also operate our equipment rental business through franchisee owned branches in Greece, Iceland, Portugal and Corsica in Europe, in Afghanistan in the Middle East, in Panama in Central America and in Chile in South America. In addition to car rental and equipment rental businesses, we are a leading provider of comprehensive, integrated fleet leasing and fleet management solutions through our Donlen subsidiary. 

CORPORATE HISTORY 

Hertz Holdings was incorporated in Delaware in 2005 to serve as the top-level holding company for Hertz Investors, Inc. which wholly owns Hertz, our primary operating company. 

We are a successor to corporations that have been engaged in the car and truck rental and leasing business since 1918 and the equipment rental business since 1965. Hertz was incorporated in Delaware in 1967. Ford Motor Company acquired an ownership interest in Hertz in 1987 and in 2001 owned 100% of Hertz through one or more of its subsidiaries. 

In December 2005, certain private investment funds (collectively, the &#8220;Sponsors&#8221;) through Hertz Investors Inc., acquired all of Hertz common stock from Ford Holdings LLC. 

In 2006, we conducted an initial public offering of our common stock and as a result our common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") under the symbol "HTZ". 

The Sponsors sold substantially all of their common stock between 2006 and 2013. 

In March 2014, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved plans to separate Hertz Holdings into two &#32;independent, publicly traded companies. One of the companies, Hertz Rental Car Holding Company, Inc. ("HRCHC") will continue to operate the Hertz, Dollar, Thrifty and Firefly car rental businesses as well as Donlen; and the other, HERC Holdings, Inc. ("HERC Holdings") will operate the Hertz Equipment Rental Corporation ("HERC"). The Company expects to separate the businesses in a tax-efficient manner. In December 2015, HRCHC filed a registration statement on Form 10 with the SEC in respect of the separation. 

In November 2015, the Company completed the relocation of its worldwide headquarters to Estero, Florida from Park Ridge, New Jersey.

OUR BUSINESS SEGMENTS 

We have identified four reportable segments, which are organized based on the products and services provided by our operating segments and the geographic areas in which our operating segments conduct business, as follows: 

&#8226; 

U.S. Car Rental - Rental of cars, crossovers and light trucks, as well as ancillary products and services, in the U.S. We maintain a substantial network of company-operated car rental locations in the U.S., enabling us to provide consistent quality and service. We also have franchisees and associates that operate rental locations under our brands throughout the U.S. 

&#8226; 

International Car Rental - Rental and leasing of cars, crossovers and light trucks, as well as ancillary products and services, internationally. We maintain a substantial network of company-operated car rental locations internationally, a majority of which are in Europe. Our franchisees and associates also operate rental locations in approximately 150 &#32;countries and jurisdictions, including many of the countries in which we also have company-operated rental locations. 

&#8226; 

Worldwide Equipment Rental - Rental of industrial, construction, material handling and other equipment. We believe that HERC is one of the largest equipment rental companies in North America. HERC has a broad portfolio of equipment for rent, including aerial, earthmoving, material handling and specialty equipment such as air compressors, compaction equipment, construction-related trucks, electrical equipment, power generators, contractor tools, pumps, and lighting, studio and production equipment. HERC also derives revenues from the sale of new and used equipment and contractor supplies. 

&#8226; 

All Other Operations - Comprised of our Donlen business, which provides fleet leasing and fleet management services, and other business activities. &#32; Donlen is a leading provider of fleet leasing and fleet management services for corporate fleets. Donlen's fleet management programs provide outsourcing solutions to reduce fleet operating costs and improve driver productivity. These programs include administration of preventive maintenance, advisory services, and fuel and accident management along with other complementary services. Additionally, Donlen provides a specialized consulting and technology expertise that allows us to model, measure and manage fleet performance more effectively and efficiently. 

Set forth below are charts showing revenues by reportable segment and revenues by geographic area for the year ended December 31, 2015 , and revenue earning equipment at net book value as of December 31, 2015 :

For further financial information on our segments for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 , see (i) Note 19 , " Segment Information ," to the Notes to our consolidated financial statements under the caption Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8221; and (ii) Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Results of Operations and Selected Operating Data by Segment" included in this Annual Report. 

U.S. and International Car Rental Segments 

Our U.S. and international car rental segments generated $6,286 million &#32;and $2,148 million , respectively, in revenues during the year ended December 31, 2015 . 

Markets 

We believe that the global car rental industry is approximately $55 billion in estimated annual revenues for 2015. Of this amount, North America represents approximately $23 billion. The average fleet in the U.S. car rental industry grew 5% in 2015 to a high of over 2 million vehicles (revenue per unit of approximately $1,035 was slightly lower than the past five years). Rentals by airline travelers at or near airports (&#8216;&#8216;airport rentals&#8217;&#8217;) are influenced by developments in the travel industry and particularly in airline passenger traffic (&#8216;&#8216;enplanements&#8217;&#8217;) as well as the Gross Domestic Product (&#8216;&#8216;GDP&#8217;&#8217;). The off airport portion of the industry has rental volume primarily driven by local business use, such as vehicle repair shops, leisure travel and insurance replacements. 

Europe represents approximately $14 billion in annual revenues. Because Europe has generally demonstrated a lower historical reliance on air travel, the European off airport car rental market has been significantly more developed than it is in the U.S. Within Europe, the largest markets are France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom. Throughout Europe we do business through company-operated rental locations as well as through our partners or franchisees to whom we have licensed use of our brands. 

Asia Pacific, Australia and New Zealand, represent approximately $12 billion in annual revenues. Within Asia Pacific, the largest markets in which we do business are Australia, China, Japan and South Korea. In each of these markets we have company-operated rental locations or our Hertz brand is present through our partners, franchisees or companies in which we own an equity interest and to whom we have licensed the Hertz brand. 

The Middle East and Africa represent approximately $3 billion in annual revenues. Within these regions, the largest markets in which we do business are United Arab Emirates and South Africa. In each of these markets we do business through our franchisees to whom we have licensed use of our brands. 

HERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

ITEM 1. BUSINESS (Continued) 

The Latin America markets represent approximately $3 billion in annual revenues. Within Latin America the largest markets in which we do business are Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Argentina, Mexico and Aruba. In each of these markets we have company-operated rental locations or our Hertz, Dollar and Thrifty brands are present through our partners or franchisees to whom we have licensed use of the brand. Our newest brand, Firefly, is also currently represented in Costa Rica, Grand Cayman, Mexico and Panama. 

Brands 

Our U.S. and international car rental businesses are primarily operated through four brands - Hertz, Dollar, Thrifty and Firefly. We offer multiple brands in order to provide customers a full range of rental services at different price points, levels of service, offerings and products. Each of our brands generally maintains separate airport counters, reservations, marketing and all other customer contact activities. We achieve synergies across our brands, particularly since the completion of the integration of Dollar Thrifty, by utilizing a single fleet management team and combined maintenance, cleaning and back office functions. 

Our top tier brand, Hertz, is one of the most recognized brands in the world, offering premium services that redefine the industry. This is consistent with numerous published best-in-class car rental awards that we have won, both in the U.S. and internationally, over many years. We have sought to support our reputation for quality and customer service in car rental through a variety of innovative service offerings, such as our customer loyalty program and our global expedited rental program (&#8220;Gold Plus Rewards&#8221;), our one-way rental program (&#8220;Rent-it-Here/Leave-it-There&#8221;), our national-scale luxury rental program (&#8220;Prestige Collection&#8221;), our sports car rental program (&#8220;Adrenaline Collection&#8221;), our environmentally friendly rental program (&#8220;Green Traveler Collection&#8221;), and our elite sports and luxury car rental program (&#8220;Dream Cars&#8221;). We intend to maintain our position as a premier provider of rental services through an intense focus on service, quality and product innovation. 

Our smart value brand, Dollar, is the go-to choice for the discerning value seeker with elevated expectations. The Dollar brand ' s main focus is serving the airport vehicle rental market, which is comprised of business and leisure travelers. The majority of its locations are on or near airport facilities. Dollar operates primarily through company-owned locations in the U.S. and Canada, and also licenses to independent franchisees which operate as a part of the Dollar brand system. Recently, we have been expanding the brand offering internationally, primarily in Europe. 

Our experiential value brand, Thrifty, is the go-to brand for vacationers, tourists and those who see life as the ultimate adventure. Thrifty serves both the airport and off airport markets through company-owned locations in the U.S. and Canada and licenses to independent franchisees which operate as part of the Thrifty brand system. Recently, we have been expanding the brand offering internationally, primarily in Europe. 

Our Firefly brand is a deep value brand for price conscious leisure travelers, providing everything the shopper is seeking with a focus on low price. We have Firefly locations servicing local area airports in select U.S. and international leisure markets where other deep value brands have a significant presence. 

Operations 

Locations 

We operate both airport and off airport locations which utilize common car fleets, are supervised by common country, regional and local area management, use many common systems and rely on common maintenance and administrative centers. Additionally, our airport and off airport locations utilize common marketing activities and have many of the same customers. We regard both types of locations as aspects of a single, unitary, car rental business. Off airport revenues comprised approximately 30% of our worldwide rental car revenues in both 2015 and 2014. 

Airport 

We have approximately 1,635 &#32;airport rental locations in the U.S. and approximately 1,320 &#32;airport rental locations internationally. Our international car rental operations have company-operated locations in Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Puerto Rico, Slovakia, Spain, the United Kingdom and the U.S. Virgin Islands. We believe that our extensive U.S. and international 

HERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

ITEM 1. BUSINESS (Continued) 

network of company-operated locations contributes to the consistency of our service, cost control, fleet utilization, yield management, competitive pricing and our ability to offer one-way rentals. 

For our airport company-operated rental locations, we have obtained concessions or similar leasing, licensing or permitting agreements or arrangements (collectively, &#8220;concessions&#8221;) granting us the right to conduct a car rental business at the respective airport. Our concessions were obtained from the airports' operators, which are typically governmental bodies or authorities, following either negotiation or bidding for the right to operate a car rental business. The terms of an airport concession typically require us to pay the airport's operator concession fees based upon a specified percentage of the revenues we generate at the airport, subject to a minimum annual guarantee. Under most concessions, we must also pay fixed rent for terminal counters or other leased properties and facilities. Most concessions are for a fixed length of time, while others create operating rights and payment obligations that are terminable at any time. 

The terms of our concessions typically do not forbid us from seeking, and in a few instances actually require us to seek, reimbursement from customers of concession fees we pay; however, in certain jurisdictions the law limits or forbids our doing so. Where we are required or permitted to seek such reimbursement, it is our general practice to do so. Certain of our concession agreements require the consent of the airport's operator in connection with material changes in our ownership. A growing number of larger airports are building consolidated airport car rental facilities to alleviate congestion at the airport. These consolidated rental facilities provide a more common customer experience and may eliminate certain competitive advantages among the brands as competitors operate out of one centralized facility for both customer rental and return operations, share consolidated busing operations and maintain image standards mandated by the airports. See Item &#160; 1A, "Risk Factors &#8221; &#32;in this Annual Report. 

Off Airport 

We have approximately 2,800 &#32;off airport locations in the U.S. and approximately 4,225 &#32;off airport rental locations internationally. Our off airport rental customers include people who prefer to rent cars closer to their home or place of work for business or leisure purposes, as well as those needing to travel to or from airports. Our off airport customers also include people who have been referred by, or whose rental costs are being wholly or partially reimbursed by, insurance companies following accidents in which their cars were damaged, those expecting to lease cars that are not yet available from their leasing companies and those needing cars while their vehicle is being repaired or is temporarily unavailable for other reasons ( &#8220; replacement renters &#8221;). 

When compared to our airport rental locations, an off airport rental location typically uses smaller rental facilities with fewer employees, conducts pick-up and delivery services and serves replacement renters using specialized systems and processes. On average, off airport locations generate fewer transactions per period than airport locations. 

Our off airport locations offer us the following benefits: 

&#8226; 

Provide customers a more convenient and geographically extensive network of rental locations, thereby creating revenue opportunities from replacement renters, non-airline travel renters and airline travelers with local rental needs; 

&#8226; 

Provide a more balanced revenue mix by reducing our reliance on air travel and therefore limiting our exposure to external events that may disrupt airline travel trends; 

&#8226; 

Contribute to higher fleet utilization as a result of the longer average rental periods associated with off airport business, compared to those of airport rentals; 

&#8226; 

Insurance replacement rental volume is less seasonal than that of other business and leisure rentals, which permits efficiencies in both fleet and labor planning; and 

&#8226; 

Cross-selling opportunities exist for us to promote off airport rentals among frequent airport Hertz Gold Plus Rewards program renters and, conversely, to promote airport rentals to off airport renters. In view of those benefits, we intend to seek profitable growth in the off airport rental market, both in the U.S. and internationally.

Rates 

We rent a wide variety of makes and models of cars. We rent cars on an hourly (in select markets), daily, weekend, weekly, monthly or multi-month basis, with rental charges computed on a limited or unlimited mileage rate, or on a time rate plus a mileage charge. Our rates vary by brand and at different locations depending on local market conditions and other competitive and cost factors. While cars are usually returned to the locations from which they are rented, we also allow one-way rentals from and to certain locations. In addition to car rentals and franchisee fees, we generate revenues from reimbursements by customers of airport concession fees and vehicle licensing costs, fueling charges, and charges for ancillary customer products and services such as supplemental equipment (child seats and ski racks), loss or collision damage waiver, theft protection, liability and personal accident/effects insurance coverage, premium emergency roadside service, navigation systems and satellite radio services. 

Reservations 

We accept reservations for our cars on a brand-by-brand basis, with each of our brands maintaining, and accepting reservations through, an independent internet site. Our brands generally accept reservations only for a class of vehicles, although Hertz accepts reservations for specific makes and models of vehicles in our Prestige Collection, our Adrenaline Collection, our Green Traveler Collection and our Dream Cars collection with a limited number of models in high-volume, leisure-oriented destinations. 

When customers reserve cars for rental from us and our franchisees, they may seek to do so through travel agents or third-party travel websites. In many of those cases, the travel agent or website will utilize a third-party operated computerized reservation system, also known as a Global Distribution System (&#8220;GDS&#8221;) to contact us and make the reservation. 

In major countries, including the U.S. and all other countries with company-operated locations, customers may also reserve cars for rental from us and our franchisees worldwide through local, national or toll-free telephone calls to our reservations center, directly through our rental locations or, in the case of replacement rentals, through proprietary automated systems serving the insurance industry. Additionally, we accept reservations for rentals worldwide through our websites, for us and our franchisees. We also offer the ability to reserve cars through our smartphone apps for the Hertz, Dollar and Thrifty brands. 

Customer Service Offerings 

At our major airport rental locations, as well as at some smaller airport and off airport locations, customers participating in our Hertz Gold Plus Rewards program are able to rent vehicles in an expedited manner. Participants in our Hertz Gold Plus Rewards program often bypass the rental counter entirely and proceed directly to their vehicles upon arrival at our facility. Participants in our Hertz Gold Plus Rewards program are also eligible to earn Gold Plus Rewards points that may be redeemed for free rental days or converted to awards of other companies' loyalty programs. For the year ended December 31, 2015 , rentals by Hertz Gold Plus Rewards members accounted for approximately 40% of our worldwide rental transactions. We believe the Hertz Gold Plus Rewards program provides a significant competitive advantage to us, particularly among frequent travelers, and we have targeted such travelers for participation in the program. 

Hertz Gold Choice offers Gold Plus Rewards members an option to choose the car they drive. Members' cars are still preassigned but Gold Choice allows the member the option to choose a different model and color from those cars available at the new Gold Choice area. This service is free of charge to Hertz Gold Plus Rewards members who book a midsize class or above. The Gold Choice program is offered at 57 U.S. airport locations and 8 locations in Europe. 

Hertz also offers a Mobile Gold Alerts service, also known as "Carfirmations&#8482;," through which an SMS text message and/or email is sent with the vehicle information and location, with the option to choose another vehicle from their smart phone prior to arrival. It is available to participating Gold Plus Rewards customers approximately 30 minutes prior to their arrival. We also offer Hertz e-Return, which allows customers to drop off their car and go at the time of rental return. Additionally, in select locations customers can bypass the rental line through our ExpressRent Kiosks.

Car-Sharing 

We offer a car-sharing membership service, referred to as Hertz 24/7 TM , which rents cars by the hour and/or by the day, at various locations internationally, primarily in Europe and Australia. Members reserve vehicles online, then pick up the vehicles at various locations, such as a university, corporate campus or a retailer, without the need to visit a Hertz rental office. Members are charged an hourly or daily car-rental fee which includes fuel, insurance, 24/7 roadside assistance and in-car customer service. 

Customers and Business Mix 

We conduct active sales and marketing programs to attract and retain customers. Our sales force calls on companies and other organizations whose employees and associates need to rent cars for business purposes. In addition, our sales force works with membership associations, tour operators, travel companies and other groups whose members, participants and customers rent cars for either business or leisure purposes. Our specialized sales force calls on companies with replacement rental needs, including insurance and leasing companies, automobile repair companies, and car dealers. We also advertise our car rental offerings through a variety of traditional media channels, such as television and newspapers, direct mail and the internet. In addition to advertising, we conduct a variety of other forms of marketing and promotion, including travel industry business partnerships and press and public relations activities. 

We categorize our car rental business based on (i) the purpose for which customers rent from us (business or leisure) and (ii) the type of location from which they rent (airport or off airport). The table below sets forth the percentages of rental revenues and rental transactions in our U.S. and international operations based on these categories.

Customers who rent from us for &#8220;business&#8221; purposes include those who require cars in connection with commercial activities, the activities of governments and other organizations or for temporary vehicle replacement purposes. Most business customers rent cars from us on terms that we have negotiated with their employers or other entities with which they are associated, and those terms can differ substantially from the terms on which we rent cars to the general public. We have negotiated arrangements relating to car rental with many large businesses, governments and other organizations, including most Fortune 500 companies. 

Customers who rent from us for &#8220;leisure&#8221; purposes include not only individual travelers booking vacation travel rentals with us but also people renting to meet other personal needs. Leisure rentals, generally, are longer in duration and generate more revenue per transaction than business rentals. Leisure rentals also include rentals by customers of U.S. and international tour operators, which are usually a part of tour packages that can include air travel and hotel accommodations. 

Our business and leisure customers rent from both our airport and off airport locations. Demand for airport rentals is correlated with airline travel patterns, and transaction volumes generally follow enplanement and GDP trends on a global basis. Customers often make reservations for airport rentals when they book their flight plans, which make our strong relationships with travel agents, associations and other partners (e.g., airlines) a key competitive advantage in generating consistent and recurring revenue streams. 

HERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

ITEM 1. BUSINESS (Continued) 

Off airport rentals include insurance replacements, therefore, we must establish agreements with the referring insurers establishing the relevant rental terms, including the arrangements made for billing and payment. We have identified approximately 192 insurance companies, ranging from local or regional carriers to large, national companies, as our target insurance replacement market. As of December 31, 2015 , we were a preferred or recognized supplier of 179 of these insurance companies and a co-primary for 39 of them. 

Fleet 

We believe we are one of the largest private sector purchasers of new cars in the world. During the year ended December 31, 2015 , we operated a peak rental fleet in the U.S. of approximately 514,000 cars and a peak rental fleet in our international operations of approximately 189,000 cars, and in each case exclusive of our franchisees' fleet and Donlen's leasing fleet. During the year ended December 31, 2015 , our approximate average holding period for a rental car was 20 months in the U.S. and 15 months in our international operations. 

A significant percentage of our car rental fleet is purchased from the following vehicle manufacturers:

Purchases of cars are financed through cash from operations and by active and ongoing global borrowing programs. See Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Liquidity and Capital Resources,&#8221; in this Annual Report. 

The cars we purchase are either program cars or non-program cars. We periodically review the efficiencies of an optimal mix between program and non-program cars in our fleet and adjust the ratio of program and non-program cars in our fleet as needed based on contract negotiations and the economic environment pertaining to our industry. 

For program cars, under our repurchase programs, the manufacturers agree to repurchase cars at a specified price or guarantee the depreciation rate on the cars during established repurchase or auction periods, subject to, among other things, certain car condition, mileage and holding period requirements. Repurchase prices under repurchase programs are based on either a predetermined percentage of original car cost and the month in which the car is returned or the original capitalized cost less a set daily depreciation amount. Guaranteed depreciation programs guarantee on an aggregate basis the residual value of the cars covered by the programs upon sale according to certain parameters which include the holding period, mileage and condition of the cars. These repurchase and guaranteed depreciation programs limit our residual risk with respect to cars purchased under the programs and allow us to determine depreciation expense in advance. 

Program cars as a percentage of all cars purchased within each of our U.S. and International car rental segments were as follows:

Non-program cars are not purchased under repurchase or guaranteed depreciation programs. Rather, we dispose of non-program cars, as well as program cars that become ineligible for manufacturer repurchase or guaranteed depreciation programs, through a variety of disposition channels, including auctions, brokered sales, sales to wholesalers and dealers and, to a lesser extent and primarily in the U.S., sales at retail through a network of 77 

HERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

ITEM 1. BUSINESS (Continued) 

company-operated car sales locations, as of December 31, 2015 , dedicated to the sale of used cars from our rental fleet. 

We also offer Rent2Buy in 35 states and several European countries, an innovative program designed to sell used rental cars. Customers have an opportunity for a test rental of a competitively priced car from our rental fleet. If the customer purchases the car, he or she is credited with a portion of their rental charges, and the purchase transaction is completed through the internet and by mail in those states where permitted. 

During the year ended December 31, 2015 , of the cars sold in our U.S. car rental operations that were not repurchased by manufacturers, we sold approximately 42% at auction, 36% through dealer direct and 22% through our Rent2Buy program or at retail locations. During the year ended December 31, 2015 , of the cars sold in our international car rental operations that were not repurchased by manufacturers, we sold approximately 38% at auction, 55% through dealer direct and 7% through our Rent2Buy program or at retail locations. 

We maintain automobile maintenance centers at or near certain airports and in certain urban and off airport areas, which provide maintenance facilities for our car rental fleet. Many of these facilities include sophisticated car diagnostic and repair equipment and are accepted by automobile manufacturers as eligible to perform and receive reimbursement for warranty work. Collision damage and major repairs are generally performed by independent contractors. 

Franchisees 

In certain U.S. and international markets, we have found it efficient to utilize independent franchisees, which rent cars that they own, under our Hertz, Dollar, Thrifty or Firefly brands. In certain markets and under certain circumstances, franchisees are given the opportunity to acquire franchises for multiple brands. 

We believe that our franchisee arrangements are important to our business because they enable us to offer expanded national and international service and a broader one-way rental program. Licenses are issued principally by our wholly-owned subsidiaries, under franchise arrangements to independent franchisees and affiliates who are engaged in the car rental business in the U.S. and in many other countries. 

Franchisees generally pay fees based on a percentage of their revenues or the number of cars they operate. The operations of all franchisees, including the purchase and ownership of vehicles, are financed independently by the franchisees, and we do not have any investment interest in the franchisees or their fleets. Fees from franchisees are used to, among other things, generally support the cost of our brand awareness programs, reservations system, sales and marketing efforts and certain other services. In return, franchisees are provided the use of the applicable brand name, certain operational support and training, reservations through our reservations channels, and other services. In addition to car rental, certain franchisees outside the U.S. engage in car leasing, chauffeur-driven rentals and renting camper vans. 

U.S. franchisees ordinarily are limited as to transferability without our consent and are terminable by us only for cause or after a fixed term. Franchisees in the U.S. may generally terminate for any reason on 90 days' notice. In Europe and certain other international jurisdictions, franchisees typically do not have early termination rights. Initial license fees or the price for the sale to a franchisee of a company-owned location may be payable over a term of several years. We continue to issue new licenses and, from time to time, purchase franchisee businesses. 

Competition 

In the U.S. and Canada, in addition to local and regional vehicle rental companies, our principal car rental industry competitors are Avis Budget Group, Inc. (&#8220;ABG&#8221;) which currently operates the Avis, Budget, ZipCar and Payless brands and Enterprise Holdings, which operates the Enterprise Rent-A-Car Company ("Enterprise"), National Car Rental and Alamo Rent A Car brands. 

In Europe, the principal pan-European participants in the car rental industry are ABG, operating the Avis, Budget and Zipcar brands, and Europcar, operating the Europcar, Interrent, Keddy and Car2Go brands. In certain European countries, there are also other companies and brands with substantial market shares, including Sixt AG (operating the Sixt brand and DriveNow) in Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland 

HERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

ITEM 1. BUSINESS (Continued) 

and the United Kingdom; and Enterprise (operating the Enterprise brand) in France, Germany, Ireland and the United Kingdom. 

In Asia Pacific, the principal participants in the market place throughout the region are ABG, operating the Avis, Budget and Zipcar brands, and Europcar, operating the Europcar and Keddy brands. 

In Latin America, the principal participants are ABG, operating the Avis, Budget and Zipcar brands, and Enterprise Holdings, which operates the Alamo Rent A Car brand in the region. Other key players in the region are Localiza, Unidas and Movida. 

Competition among car rental industry participants is intense and is primarily based on price, vehicle availability and quality, service, reliability, rental locations, product innovation, competition from on-line travel agents and car rental brokers. We believe that the prominence and service reputation of the Hertz brand, our extensive worldwide ownership of car rental operations and our commitment to innovation and service provide us with a competitive advantage. Additionally, our Dollar, Thrifty and Firefly brands enable us to compete across multiple market segments. 

Seasonality 

Our car rental operations are a seasonal business, with decreased levels of business in the winter months and heightened activity during spring and summer for the majority of countries where we generate our revenues. To accommodate increased demand, we increase our available fleet and staff during the second and third quarters of the year. As business demand declines, fleet and staff are decreased accordingly. Certain operating expenses, including real estate taxes, rent, insurance, utilities, maintenance and other facility-related expenses, the costs of operating our information technology systems and minimum staffing costs, remain fixed and cannot be adjusted for seasonal demand. 

The following chart sets forth this seasonal effect of our car rental operations by presenting quarterly revenues for each of the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 . Amounts are computed independently each quarter, therefore, the s um of the quarterly amounts may not equal the total amount for the respective year due to rounding. 

Worldwide Equipment Rental 

Our worldwide equipment rental segment generated $1,518 million &#32;in revenues during the year ended December 31, 2015 . 

Markets 

Through HERC, we operate the Hertz Equipment Rental brand business in the U.S., Canada, China, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Kingdom, as well as through its international franchises. In October 2015, we finalized the sale 

HERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

ITEM 1. BUSINESS (Continued) 

of our operations in France (other than Corsica) and Spain. Subsequent to the sale of these operations, we generate almost all of our equipment rental revenue in North America with approximately 1% of our equipment rental revenue driven by our remaining international operations. 

The equipment rental industry is highly fragmented with few national competitors and many regional and local operators. We believe, based on market and industry revenue data, that we are one of the leading companies (together with United Rentals, Inc. and Ashtead Group plc&#8217;s Sunbelt Rentals brand) in the North American equipment rental industry. A number of the industry's competitors focus on a subset of equipment rental offerings, making the overall industry fragmented with respect to types of equipment offered, services provided and geographic locations from which such equipment is offered. 

The principal end markets we serve, based on our customers&#8217; Standard Industrial Classification (&#8220;SIC&#8221;) codes, consist of the following: 

&#8226; 

Construction &#8211; Our construction rental operations serve large and small companies in the construction industry, and principally the non-residential construction industry. Non-residential construction consists primarily of private sector rentals relating to the construction, maintenance, and remodeling of commercial facilities. According to Dodge Data &#38; Analytics, U.S. non-residential construction spending remained flat in 2015 &#32;and is estimated to grow at an annual rate of 9% in 2016 . 

&#8226; 

Industrial &#8211; Our industrial rental operations serve renters across a broad range of industries, including large industrial plants, refineries and petrochemical operations, industrial manufacturing, power, pulp, paper and wood and other industrial verticals. According to Industrial Info Resources, spending in the U.S. industrial sector grew at an annual rate of approximately 7% in 2015 &#32;and is estimated to grow at an annual rate of 5% in 2016 . 

&#8226; 

Other Customers &#8211; In addition to the specific markets cited above, we service a variety of other customers across a diverse group of industries, including governmental entities and government contractors, disaster recovery and remediation firms, utility operators, infrastructure, railroad, individual homeowners, entertainment production companies, agricultural producers and special event management firms. 

Operations 

Product Offerings 

Equipment Rental 

We offer equipment for rent, including aerial, earthmoving, material handling, and specialty equipment, such as air compressors, compaction equipment, construction-related trucks, electrical equipment, power generators, contractor tools, pumps, and lighting, studio and production equipment. This equipment is available for rent by our customers on an hourly, daily, weekly, monthly or yearly basis and we provide a suite of comprehensive services to support, maintain and service the equipment we rent to our customers. 

Equipment Re-Rental 

In the event that a customer has a rental need that is not contained within our diversified fleet or an unexpected request, our experienced staff can provide re-rental options to meet that customer&#8217;s needs. In this instance, we will rent a piece of equipment from another company and then provide it to our customer. Our re-rental capabilities help us expand the portfolio of solutions available to our customers, particularly within our national and industrial accounts programs. 

Sales of Rental Equipment 

We routinely sell our used rental equipment through a variety of channels, including retail sales to customers and other third parties, sales to wholesalers, brokered sales and auctions. Our website includes a catalog of equipment for sale to third parties. We also provide a source of potential financing to buyers of our rental equipment, which is designed to promote sales of used equipment to private parties. 

We also sell new equipment for many leading equipment manufacturers in the United States and Canada. 

HERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

ITEM 1. BUSINESS (Continued) 

Contractor Tools and Supplies Sales 

We sell a variety of contractor tools and supplies to our customers, including tools (including hand and power tools), small equipment (such as work lighting, generators, pumps, compaction equipment and power trowels), safety supplies and expendables. 

Service and Support 

We provide repair, maintenance and equipment management services to certain of our customers across a number of industries, but particularly in the industrial sector, including through the sale of parts to customers for use with their equipment. We provide maintenance capabilities for our rental equipment that are available on-site at the customer&#8217;s location or within our operations at the customer&#8217;s direction. We further provide support functions through our dedicated in-plant operations, tool trailers and plant management systems, particularly for industrial customers and those customers who request such services. These support functions include a variety of performance measurement tools that allow our customers to consider key performance indicators in their operations, which we believe enables our customers to reduce their cost and improve overall equipment utilization. 

We also offer a loss damage waiver product for many classes of equipment, which for a fee allows our customers to limit the risk of financial loss in the event our equipment is damaged or lost. 

Locations 

HERC has approximately 280 &#32;company-operated branches, of which approximately 270 &#32;are in the United States and Canada, and the remainder are located in the United Kingdom, China and through joint venture arrangements in Saudi Arabia and Qatar. We also operate our equipment rental business through franchisee owned branches in Greece, Iceland, Portugal and Corsica in Europe, in Afghanistan in the Middle East, in Panama in Central America and in Chile in South America. 

Acquisitions, Joint Ventures and Divestitures 

In addition to our organic growth, we have grown HERC through strategic acquisitions. In recent years, we took certain steps to diversify our portfolio and increase exposure to a variety of niche markets which experience business cycles that may vary in intensity and duration from that of the general economy and that we believe will enable HERC to experience higher levels of growth than the economy in general. Since 2009, we have completed 11 acquisitions to strengthen our position in a variety of specialty rental markets, including the broader industrial market (DW Pumps, Forces, Western Machinery, Pioneer, Delta Rigging &#38; Tools and We Got it Rental) and the motion picture and television production industries (Cinelease, 24/7 and 1st Call Studio Equipment). We also have expanded internationally, including opening company-operated locations in China in 2008, as well as the establishment of joint ventures with Saudi Arabia-based Dayim Holdings Company, Ltd. in February 2010, eventually extending into Qatar in 2014. In October 2015, we sold our operations in France and Spain, which represented approximately $63 million in revenues and $6 million in income before income taxes in 2015. 

Customers 

HERC serves a wide range of customers across the construction, infrastructure, industrial and specialty verticals. Key areas that we serve under these verticals include building services, commercial, engineering, hospitality, oil and gas, petrochemical, railroads and entertainment. We also serve other customers across a fragmented group of industries (such as governmental entities and government contractors, disaster recovery and remediation firms, utility operators, individual homeowners and agricultural producers). Serving a wide range of industries enables us to reduce dependency on a single or limited number of customers and assists in reducing the seasonality of our revenues and its impact from any one segment's cycle. We operate in mid-size and large urban markets which enables us to reduce exposure to any single customer or market, with no single customer making up more than 3% of our worldwide rental revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 . Of our rental revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 &#32;(excluding France and Spain which were sold in October 2015), approximately 38% of equipment rental revenues were derived from construction activity and 23% were derived from industrial activity, while the remaining revenues were generated by rentals to government, railroad, entertainment and other types of customers. 

We enter into rental agreements with companies, governmental entities and agencies or other organizations seeking 

HERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

ITEM 1. BUSINESS (Continued) 

to rent our equipment. We deliver much of our equipment directly to customer job sites and retrieve the equipment from the customer site upon conclusion of the rental. We extend credit terms to many of our customers to pay for rentals. 

Our comprehensive fleet enables us to supply equipment to a wide variety of customers, from individual homeowners to local contractors to large national accounts or industrial plants. Our equipment rental business has a large base of local small to mid-size customers as well as customers looking for specialty solutions or equipment. Many larger companies, particularly those with industrial plant operations, now require single source vendors to manage their total equipment needs, and this fits well within our core competencies. Arrangements with these large national companies include the provision of our repair, maintenance and customized equipment management services. 

Fleet 

HERC acquires its equipment from a variety of original equipment manufacturers, with which we maintain strong relationships. &#32; The equipment is typically new at the time of acquisition and is not subject to any repurchase program. The actual per-unit acquisition cost of rental equipment in our equipment rental fleet varies from under $100 to over $200,000. As of December 31, 2015, the average per-unit acquisition cost (excluding small equipment purchased for less than $5,000 per unit) for our equipment rental fleet was approximately $38,000 &#32; and the average age of our equipment fleet was 46 &#32; months. 

The following table provides a breakdown of the composition of our equipment rental fleet based on original equipment fleet cost, as of December 31, 2015:

We have made meaningful investments in our equipment rental fleet resulting in an average fleet age of 46 months as of December 31, 2015. As of December 31, 2015, our equipment rental fleet portfolio consisted of equipment with a total original equipment cost of approximately $4 billion . 

We routinely sell our used rental equipment in order to manage repair and maintenance costs, as well as the composition and size, of our fleet. We dispose of our used equipment through a variety of channels, including retail sales to customers and other third parties, sales to wholesalers, brokered sales and auctions. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we sold our used rental equipment as follows: approximately 54% through private sales, 27% through sales at auction and 19% through sales to wholesalers. 

Franchisees 

HERC licenses the Hertz name through franchisee owned branches in Greece, Iceland, Portugal and Corsica in Europe, in Afghanistan in the Middle East, in Panama in Central America and in Chile in South America. The terms of those licenses are broadly similar to those we grant to our international car rental franchisees. 

Competition 

Our competitors in the equipment rental industry range from other large national companies to regional and local businesses. In each of the countries where we maintain company-operated locations, the equipment rental industry 

HERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

ITEM 1. BUSINESS (Continued) 

is often highly fragmented, with large numbers of companies operating on a regional or local scale and dealing in a limited number of products. The number of industry participants operating on a national scale is comparatively much smaller, although national participants often have significant breadth in the categories of equipment they rent. We believe, based on market and industry data, that we are one of the leading participants (together with United Rentals, Inc. and Ashtead Group plc&#8217;s Sunbelt Rentals brand) in the North American equipment rental industry, with the remainder comprising a small number of multi-location regional or national operators and a large number of relatively small, independent businesses serving discrete local markets and specialty rental segments. Subsequent to the sale of our operations in France and Spain, we generated almost all of our equipment rental revenue in North America with approximately 1% of our equipment rental revenue generated through our international operations. In North America, the other top national-scale industry participants are United Rentals, Inc., H&#38;E Equipment Services, Inc. and the Ashtead Group plc&#8217;s Sunbelt Rentals brand. Aggreko is a global competitor in the power generation rental markets in the same markets in which we participate. In the United Kingdom, the other principal national-scale industry participant is the Ashtead Group plc&#8217;s A-Plant brand. In China, the other principal national-scale industry participants are Far East Rental and LiLuo. In Saudi Arabia, the other principal national-scale industry participants are Zahid Tractor (CAT Dealer) and Rapid Access Gulf (Lavendon Group). In Qatar, the other principal national-scale industry participants are Byrne Equipment Rental Solutions and Rapid Access Gulf (Lavendon Group). 

Competition in the equipment rental industry is intense, often taking the form of aggressive price competition. Among other factors, we believe that our competitive success is the result of 50 years of experience in the equipment rental industry, our systems and procedures for monitoring, controlling and developing our branch network, our capacity to maintain a comprehensive rental fleet, the reliability and safety of our equipment, the quality and experience of our sales team, our innovative customized rental solutions and our established national and industrial accounts programs. In addition to our historical profile, we believe continued diversification of our customer base and products will provide strategic competitive advantages in the rental industry. 

Seasonality 

Our worldwide equipment rental operation is a seasonal business, with demand for our rental equipment tending to be lower in the winter months. We have the ability to manage fleet capacity, the most significant portion of our cost structure, to meet market demand. For instance, to accommodate increased demand, we increase our available fleet and staff during the second and third quarters of the year. A number of our other major operating costs vary directly with revenues or transaction volumes; however, certain operating expenses, including rent, insurance, and administrative overhead, remain fixed and cannot be adjusted for seasonal demand. Seasonal changes in our revenues do not alter those fixed expenses, typically resulting in higher profitability in periods when our revenues are higher, and lower profitability in periods when our revenues are lower. Our equipment rental business, especially in the construction industry, has historically experienced decreased levels of business from December until late spring and heightened activity during our third and fourth quarter until December. Additionally, in an effort to reduce the impacts of seasonality, we are focused on expanding our customer base through specialty products that have less seasonality and complement other cycles. 

HERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

ITEM 1. BUSINESS (Continued) 

The following chart sets forth this seasonal effect of our equipment rental operations by providing quarterly revenues for each of the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 . Amounts are computed independently each quarter, therefore, the s um of the quarterly amounts may not equal the total amount for the respective year due to rounding. 

All Other Operations 

Through our Donlen subsidiary, we are a leading provider of comprehensive, integrated fleet leasing and fleet management solutions for corporate fleets. Our All Other Operations segment generated $583 million &#32;in revenues during the year ended December 31, 2015 . 

Donlen 

Donlen provides a comprehensive array of fleet leasing, financing, telematics, and fleet management services to commercial fleets in the U.S. and Canada. Products offered by Donlen include: 

&#8226; 

Vehicle financing, acquisition and remarketing; 

&#8226; 

License, title and registration; 

&#8226; 

Maintenance consultation; 

&#8226; 

Fuel management; 

&#8226; 

Accident management; 

&#8226; 

Toll management; 

&#8226; 

Telematics-based location, driver performance and scorecard reporting; and 

&#8226; 

Lease financing. 

Donlen&#8217;s leased fleet consists primarily of passenger cars, cargo vans and light-duty trucks. Vehicles are acquired directly from domestic and foreign manufacturers, as well as dealers. As of December 31, 2015 , more than half of Donlen&#8217;s leased fleet is 2014 model year or newer. 

Donlen&#8217;s primary product for car and light to medium truck fleets is an open-ended terminal rental adjustment clause ("TRAC") lease. For most customers, the vehicle must be leased for a minimum of 12 months, after which the lease converts to a month-to-month lease allowing the vehicle to be surrendered any time thereafter. Our sale of the vehicle following the termination of the lease may result in a TRAC adjustment, through which the customer is credited or charged with the surplus or loss on the vehicle. Approximately 80% of Donlen&#8217;s lease portfolio consists of floating-rate leases which allow lease charges to be adjusted based on benchmark indices. 

HERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

ITEM 1. BUSINESS (Continued) 

Donlen offers financing solutions for heavier-duty trucks and equipment. Lease financing is provided through syndication arrangements with lending institutions. Donlen originates the leases, acquires the assets, and services the lease throughout the term. 

Donlen provides services to leased and non-leased fleets consisting of fuel purchasing and management, preventive maintenance, repair consultation, toll management and accident management. Additionally, Donlen manages license and title, vehicle registration, and regulatory compliance. Donlen&#8217;s telematics products provide enhanced visibility and reporting over driver and vehicle performance. 

The commercial fleet market is one of the largest segments of the U.S. automotive industry, primarily consisting of vehicles utilized in a sales, service, or delivery application. The fleet management industry has experienced significant consolidation over the years and today our principal fleet management competitors in the U.S. and Canada are Enterprise, GE Capital, Automotive Resources International, Element Financial Corporation, Wheels, Inc. and LeasePlan Corporation N.V. 

EMPLOYEES 

As of December 31, 2015 , we employed approximately 30,000 &#32;persons (approximately 4,000 of which are HERC employees), consisting of approximately 23,000 &#32;persons in our U.S. operations and approximately 7,000 &#32;persons in our international operations. International employees are covered by a wide variety of union contracts and governmental regulations affecting, among other things, compensation, job retention rights and pensions. Labor contracts covering the terms of employment of approximately 6,200 &#32;employees in the U.S. (including those in the U.S. territories) are presently in effect under approximately 130 &#32;active contracts with local unions, affiliated primarily with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters and the International Association of Machinists. Labor contracts covering approximately 1,100 &#32;of these employees will expire during 2016. We have had no material work stoppage as a result of labor problems during the last ten years, and we believe our labor relations to be good. Nevertheless, we may be unable to negotiate new labor contracts on terms advantageous to us, or without labor interruption. 

In addition to the employees referred to above, we employ a substantial number of temporary workers, and engage outside services, as is customary in the industry, principally for the non-revenue movement of rental cars and equipment between rental locations and the movement of rental equipment to and from customers' job sites. 

INSURANCE AND RISK MANAGEMENT 

There are three types of generally insurable risks that arise in our operations: 

&#8226; 

legal liability arising from the operation of our cars and on-road equipment (vehicle liability); 

&#8226; 

legal liability to members of the public and employees from other causes (general liability/workers' compensation); and 

&#8226; 

risk of property damage and/or business interruption and/or increased cost of operating as a consequence of property damage. 

In addition, we offer optional liability insurance and other products providing insurance coverage, which create additional risk exposures for us. Our risk of property damage is also increased when we waive the provisions in our rental contracts that hold a renter responsible for damage or loss under an optional loss or damage waiver that we offer. We bear these and other risks, except to the extent the risks are transferred through insurance or contractual arrangements. 

In many cases we self-insure our risks or insure risks through wholly-owned insurance subsidiaries. We mitigate our exposure to large liability losses by maintaining excess insurance coverage, subject to deductibles and caps, through unaffiliated carriers. For our international operations outside of Europe, and for our long-term fleet leasing operations, we maintain some liability insurance coverage with unaffiliated carriers. 

HERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

ITEM 1. BUSINESS (Continued) 

Third-Party Liability 

In our U.S. operations, we are required by applicable financial responsibility laws to maintain insurance against legal liability for bodily injury (including death) or property damage to third parties arising from the operation of our cars and on-road equipment, sometimes called &#8220;vehicle liability,&#8221; in stipulated amounts. In most places, we satisfy those requirements by qualifying as a self-insurer, a process that typically involves governmental filings and demonstration of financial responsibility, which sometimes requires the posting of a bond or other security. In the remaining places, we obtain an insurance policy from an unaffiliated insurance carrier and indemnify the carrier for any amounts paid under the policy. As a result of such arrangements, we bear economic responsibility for U.S. vehicle liability, except to the extent we successfully transfer such liability to others through insurance or contractual arrangements. 

For our car and equipment rental operations in Europe, we have established a wholly-owned insurance subsidiary, Probus Insurance Company Europe Limited (&#8220;Probus&#8221;), a direct writer of insurance domiciled in Ireland. In European countries with company-operated locations, we have purchased from Probus the vehicle liability insurance required by law, and Probus reinsured the risks under such insurance with Hertz International RE, a wholly-owned reinsurer organized in Ireland (&#8220;HIRE&#8221;) and / or HIRE Bermuda Limited, a wholly-owned reinsurance company domiciled in Bermuda. This coverage is purchased from unaffiliated carriers for Spain. We also insure a portion of our European property risk through Probus. Thus, as with our U.S. operations, we bear economic responsibility for vehicle liability in our European car and equipment rental operations, except to the extent that we transfer such liability to others through insurance or contractual arrangements. For our international operations outside of Europe, we maintain some form of vehicle liability insurance coverage with unaffiliated carriers. The nature of such coverage, and our economic responsibility for covered losses, varies considerably. In all cases, though, we believe the amounts and nature of the coverage we obtain is adequate in light of the respective potential hazards. 

In our U.S. and international operations, from time to time in the course of our business, we become legally responsible to members of the public for bodily injury (including death) or property damage arising from causes other than the operation of our cars and on-road equipment, sometimes known as &#8220;general liability.&#8221; As with vehicle liability, we bear economic responsibility for general liability losses, except to the extent we transfer such losses to others through insurance or contractual arrangements. In addition, to mitigate these exposures, we maintain excess liability insurance coverage with unaffiliated insurance carriers. 

In our U.S. car rental operations, we offer an optional liability insurance product, Liability Insurance Supplement (&#8220;LIS&#8221;) that provides vehicle liability insurance coverage substantially higher than state minimum levels to the renter and other authorized operators of a rented vehicle. LIS coverage is primarily provided under excess liability insurance policies issued by an unaffiliated insurance carrier, the risks under which are reinsured with a wholly-owned subsidiary, HIRE Bermuda Limited. 

In our U.S. car rental operations and our company-operated international car rental operations in many countries, we offer optional products providing Personal Accident Insurance / Personal Effects Coverage (&#8220;PAI/PEC&#8221;) and Emergency Sickness Protection ("ESP") insurance coverage to the renter and the renter's immediate family members traveling with the renter for accidental death or accidental medical expenses arising during the rental period or for damage or loss of their property during the rental period. PAI/PEC and ESP coverage is provided under insurance policies issued by unaffiliated carriers or, in Europe, by Probus, and the risks under such policies either are reinsured with HIRE Bermuda Limited or are the subject of indemnification arrangements between us and the carriers. 

Our offering of LIS, PAI/PEC and ESP coverage in our U.S. car rental operations is conducted pursuant to limited licenses or exemptions under state laws governing the licensing of insurance producers. 

Provisions on our books for self-insured public liability and property damage vehicle liability losses are made by charges to expense based upon evaluations of estimated ultimate liabilities on reported and unreported claims. As of December 31, 2015 , this liability was estimated at $402 million &#32;for our combined U.S. and international operations. 

Damage to Our Property 

We bear the risk of damage to our property, unless such risk is transferred through insurance or contractual arrangements. 

HERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

ITEM 1. BUSINESS (Continued) 

To mitigate our risk of large, single-site property damage losses globally, we maintain property insurance with unaffiliated insurance carriers in such amounts as we deem adequate in light of the respective hazards, where such insurance is available on commercially reasonable terms. 

Our rental contracts typically provide that the renter is responsible for damage to or loss (including loss through theft) of rented vehicles or equipment. We generally offer an optional rental product, known in various countries as &#8220;loss damage waiver,&#8221; &#8220;collision damage waiver&#8221; or &#8220;theft protection,&#8221; under which we waive or limit our right to make a claim for such damage or loss. 

Collision damage costs and the costs of stolen or unaccounted-for vehicles and equipment, along with other damage to our property, are charged to expense as incurred. 

Other Risks 

To manage other risks associated with our businesses, or to comply with applicable law, we purchase other types of insurance carried by business organizations, such as worker's compensation and employer's liability, commercial crime and fidelity, performance bonds, directors' and officers' liability insurance and cyber security coverage from unaffiliated insurance companies in amounts deemed by us to be adequate in light of the respective hazards, where such coverage is obtainable on commercially reasonable terms. 

GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS 

Throughout the world, we are subject to numerous types of governmental controls, including those relating to prices and advertising, privacy and data protection, currency controls, labor matters, credit and charge card operations, insurance, environmental protection, used car sales and licensing. 

Environmental 

We are subject to extensive federal, state, local, and foreign environmental and safety laws, regulations, directives, rules and ordinances concerning, among other things, the operation and maintenance of cars, trucks and other vehicles, such as heavy equipment, buses and vans; the ownership and operation of tanks for the storage of petroleum products, including gasoline, diesel fuel and oil; and the generation, storage, transportation and disposal of waste materials, including oil, vehicle wash sludge and waste water. 

As of December 31, 2015 , we have accrued an amount we deem appropriate for environmental remediation. The accrual generally represents the estimated cost to study potential environmental issues at sites deemed to require investigation or clean-up activities, and the estimated cost to implement remediation actions, including ongoing maintenance, as required. Based on information currently available, we believe that the ultimate resolution of existing environmental remediation actions and our compliance in general with environmental laws and regulations will not have a material effect on our earnings or financial condition. However, it is difficult to predict with certainty the potential impact of future compliance efforts and environmental remedial actions and thus future costs associated with such matters may exceed the amount of the current accrual. 

Dealings with Renters 

In the U.S., car and equipment rental transactions are generally subject to Article 2A of the Uniform Commercial Code, which governs &#8220;leases&#8221; of tangible personal property. Car rental is also specifically regulated in more than half of the states of the U.S. and many other international jurisdictions. The subjects of these regulations include the methods by which we advertise, quote and charge prices, the consequences of failing to honor reservations, the terms on which we deal with vehicle loss or damage (including the protections we provide to renters purchasing loss or damage waivers) and the terms and method of sale of the optional insurance coverage that we offer. Some states (including California, New York, Nevada and Illinois) regulate the price at which we may sell loss or damage waivers, and many state insurance regulators have authority over the prices and terms of the optional insurance coverage we offer. See &#8220;Insurance and Risk Management-Damage to Our Property&#8221; above for further discussion regarding the loss or damage waivers and optional insurance coverages that we offer renters. In addition, various consumer protection laws and regulations may generally apply to our business operations. Internationally, regulatory regimes vary greatly by 

HERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

ITEM 1. BUSINESS (Continued) 

jurisdiction, but they do not generally prevent us from dealing with customers in a manner similar to that employed in the U.S. 

Both in the U.S. and internationally, we are subject to increasing regulation relating to customer privacy and data protection. In general, we are limited in the uses to which we may put data that we collect about renters, including the circumstances in which we may communicate with them. In addition, we are generally obligated to take reasonable steps to protect customer data while it is in our possession. Our failure to do so could subject us to substantial legal liability or seriously damage our reputation. 

Changes in Regulation 

Changes in government regulation of our businesses have the potential to materially alter our business practices, or our profitability. Depending on the jurisdiction, those changes may come about through new legislation, the issuance of new laws and regulations or changes in the interpretation of existing laws and regulations by a court, regulatory body or governmental official. Sometimes those changes may have not just prospective but also retroactive effect; this is particularly true when a change is made through reinterpretation of laws or regulations that have been in effect for some time. Moreover, changes in regulation that may seem neutral on their face may have either more or less impact on us than on our competitors, depending on the circumstances. Several U.S. State Attorneys General have taken the position that car rental companies either may not pass through to customers, by means of separate charges, expenses such as vehicle licensing and concession fees or may do so only in certain limited circumstances. Recent or potential changes in law or regulation that affect us relate to insurance intermediaries, customer privacy, data security and rate regulation and our retail car sales operations. 

In addition, our operations, as well as those of our competitors, also could be affected by any limitation in the fuel supply or by any imposition of mandatory allocation or rationing regulations. We are not aware of any current proposal to impose such a regime in the U.S. or internationally. Such a regime could, however, be quickly imposed if there was a serious disruption in supply for any reason, including an act of war, terrorist incident or other problem affecting petroleum supply, refining, distribution or pricing.
