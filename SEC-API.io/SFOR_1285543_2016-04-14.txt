 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

&#160;

We are a software development and services company that offers a suite of integrated computer network security products using proprietary technology. StrikeForce Technical Services Corporation was incorporated in August 2001 under the laws of the S tate of New Jersey . On September 3, 2004, we changed our name to StrikeForce Technologies, Inc. On November 15, 2010, we redomiciled under the laws of the S tate of Wyoming. We initially conducted operations as an integrator and reseller of computer hardware and telecommunications equipment and services until December 2002. In December 2002, and formally memorialized in September 2003, we acquired certain intellectual property rights and patent pending technology from NetLabs.com, Inc. ("NetLabs") including the rights to further develop and sell their principal technology. In addition, certain officers of NetLabs joined our company as officers and directors of our company. Our ongoing strategy is developing and marketing our suite of network security products to the corporate, financial, healthcare, legal, government, technology, insurance, e-commerce and consumer sectors. We plan to continue to grow our business primarily through our globally expanding sales channel and internally generated sales, rather than by acquisitions. We have no subsidiaries and we conduct our operations from our corporate office in Edison, New Jersey. 

&#160;

We began our operations in 2001 as a reseller and integrator of computer hardware and iris biometric technology. From the time we started our operations through the first half of 2003, we derived the majority of our revenues as an integrator. In December 2002, upon the acquisition of the licensing rights to certain intellectual property and patent pending technology from NetLabs, we shifted the focus of our business to developing and marketing our own suite of security products. Based upon our acquired licensing rights and additional research and development, we have developed various identification protection software products to protect computer networks from unauthorized access and to protect users from identity theft. 

&#160;

We completed the development of our ProtectID &#210; platform at the end of June 2006. We completed the core development of our keyboard encryption and anti-keylogger product, GuardedID &#210; , in December 2006 and commenced deployment of our new mobile product, MobileTrust &#210; into the mobile stores in 2014. All are currently being sold and distributed. ProtectID &#210; patent titled "Multi-Channel Device Utilizing a Centralized Out-of-Band Authentication System" is now protected by three patents. The keystroke encryption technology we developed and use in our GuardedID &#210; product is protected by three patents. 

&#160;

In November 2010, we received notice that the United States Patent and Trademark Office ("USPTO") had issued an official Notice of Allowance for the patent application for the technology relating to our ProtectID &#210; product. In January 2011, we received notice that the USPTO issued to us Patent No. 7,870,599. This "Out-of-Band" Patent went through a USPTO Re-Examination process starting on August 16, 2011 and concluded on December 27, 2011, with all of our patent claims remaining intact and eight additional patent claims being added. Since 2011, we submitted additional continuation patents on the "Out-of-Band" Patent, two additional patents granted and a fourth pending. 

&#160;

In January 2013, we were assigned the entire right, title and interest in the "Out-of-Band" Patent from NetLabs, with the agreement of the developer, and the assignment was recorded with the United States Patent and Trademark Office ("USPTO"). 

&#160;

In February 2013, we executed a retainer agreement with our patent attorneys to aggressively enforce our patent rights as "Out-of-Band Authentication" is becoming the standard for authenticating consumers in the financial market and for many Saas application users (e.g., SalesForce, Quickbooks, etc.). In February 2013, our patent attorneys submitted a new "Out-of-Band" Patent continuation, which has been granted. 

&#160;

In March 2013, our patent attorneys submitted a new "Methods and Apparatus for securing user input in a mobile device" Patent, which is now patent pending. Our MobileTrust &#210; product is the invention supporting the patent pending. 

&#160;

In July 2013, we received notice that the USPTO had added approximately sixty additional patent claims for our Out-of-Band patent we received in January 2011, by issuing to us Patent No. 8,484,698 thereby strengthening our position with clients and our current and potential lawsuits. 

&#160;

In October 2013, we received notice that the USPTO issued to us Patent No. 8,566,608 " Methods and apparatus for securing keystrokes from being intercepted between the keyboard and a browser." This protects our GuardedID &#210; product and the keystroke encryption portion of our MobileTrust &#210; products. &#160;

&#160; 4 

&#160; 

&#160; &#160;

In February 2014, we received a Notice of Allowance from the USPTO for our third patent relating to our "Multi-Channel Device Utilizing a Centralized Out-of-Band Authentication System" Patent No. 7,870,599. Upon receipt of this "Out-of-Band" patent we filed another continuation patent. 

&#160;

In March 2014, we received Notice of Allowance from the USPTO for our second patent and first continuation of our Keystroke Encryption patent, which only furthers our protection for all mobile devices when utilizing any keyboard for data entry. Upon receipt of this Notice, we also filed another continuation patent for Patent No. 8,566,608. 

&#160;

In April 2014, we were granted our third patent relating to our "Multi-Channel Device Utilizing a Centralized Out-of-Band Authentication System" Patent No. 8,713,701. 

&#160;

In September 2014, we filed an International Patent for MobileTrust &#210; (PCT/US20114/029905). 

&#160;

In March 2015, we received our third patent from the USPTO, Patent No. 8,973,107, of our Keystroke Encryption patent. This enhances our position for our Keystroke Encryption product, GuardedID &#210; , and our MobileTrust &#210; product. 

&#160;

Our suite of products is targeted to the financial, e-commerce, corporate, government, healthcare, legal, insurance, technology and retail sectors. We seek to locate customers in a variety of ways. These primarily include contracts with value added resellers and distributors (both inside the United States and internationally), direct sales calls initiated by our internal staff, exhibitions at security and technology trade shows, through the media, through consulting agreements, and through our agent relationships. Our sales generate revenue either as an Original Equipment Manufacturer ("OEM") model, through a Hosting/License agreement, bundled with other company's products or through direct purchase by distributors and resellers. We price our products for cloud consumer transactions based on the number of transactions in which our software products are utilized. We also price our products for business applications based on the number of users. These pricing models provide our company with one-time, monthly, quarterly and annual recurring revenues with volume discounts. We are also generating revenues from annual maintenance contracts, renewal fees and expect, but cannot guarantee, an increase in revenues based upon the execution of various agreements that we have recently closed and were implemented during the fourth quarter of 2015, primarily in the retail and insurance sectors. 

&#160;

We generated all of our revenues of $271,559 for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $324,807 for the year ended December 31, 2014, from the sales of our security products. The decrease in revenues was primarily due to the decrease in our software and maintenance sales and a decrease in hardware sales. We have realized delays in revenues from some of our new distributor's that, although there can be no assurances, we anticipate will appear in 2016, and in the delayed rollout of our new mobile security technologies, now rolling out through the Apple and Android markets during the fourth quarter of 2015 and into 2016. In addition, we rolled out our GuardedID &#210; MAC version that we anticipate, but cannot guarantee, that combined with the new mobile security technologies, will increase our revenues during 2016 and thereafter. Additionally, we believe we have opportunities through our sales distribution channels, including current pilots, which we believe should increase revenues in 2016 and thereafter, especially with the addition of our new mobile security products and new multi-marketing partners. 

&#160;

We market our products globally to financial service firms, healthcare related companies, legal services companies, e-commerce companies, gaming, automotive, government agencies, multi-level marketing groups, the enterprise market in general, and with virtual private network companies, as well as technology service companies and retail distributors that service all the above markets. We seek such sales through our own direct efforts, through distributors, resellers and third party agents internationally. We are also seeking to license the technology as original equipment with computer hardware and software manufacturers. We are engaged in multiple production installations and pilot projects with various distributors, resellers and direct customers primarily in the United States. Our GuardedID &#210; product is also being sold directly to consumers, primarily through the Internet as well as distributors, resellers, third party agents, affiliates and potential OEM agreements by bundling GuardedID &#210; with their products (providing a value-add and competitive advantage to their own products and offerings). Currently this is the most active market for us with multiple programs in production. We anticipate, but cannot guarantee, increases in revenues in 2016 from these programs. In addition, we have completed the development and testing of our new mobile products, MobileTrust &#210; and GuardedID &#210; Mobile Software Development Kit (SDK), which is in now in production, by Apple Store and the Android Play Store, with completion of our new sCloud registration process. The mobile products play a major role in our anticipated, but not guaranteed, 2016 revenue projections . Although no assurances can be provided that revenues will increase as anticipated, our GuardedID &#210; MAC version, recently rolled out, is another reason for the anticipated increase in revenues during 2016 and thereafter. &#160;

&#160; 5 

&#160; 

&#160; &#160;

We have incurred substantial losses since our inception. Our management believes that our products provide a cost-effective, more secure and technologically competitive solution to address the problems of cyber security and data breaches in general, especially when considering our new mobile applications. Considering recent public announcements by Symantec and other media sources that anti-virus solutions barely protect against the new malware threats, primarily keylogging malware, we contend that our keystroke encryption patented products are becoming more important, especially in the healthcare and retail markets. However, there can be no assurance that our products will continue to gain increased acceptance and continue to grow in the commercial and retail marketplaces or that one of our competitors will not introduce technically superior products. 

&#160;

Our executive office is located at 1090 King Georges Post Road, Suite 603, Edison, NJ 08837. Our telephone number is (732) 661-9641. We have 7 employees. Our Company's website is www.strikeforcetech.com (w e are not including the information contained in our website as part of, nor should the information be relied upon or incorporated by reference into, this report on Form 10-K). 

&#160;

Our Products 

&#160;

StrikeForce is a software development and services company. We own and are seeking to commercially exploit various identification protection software products that we developed to protect computer networks from unauthorized access, real time, and to protect network owners and users from cyber security attacks and data breaches. Our principal products ProtectID &#210; , GuardedID &#210; , inclusive of our unique CryptoColor &#210; technology and MobileTrust &#210; , are proprietary authentication and keystroke encryption technologies that are intended to eliminate unauthorized access to computer networks and all mobile devices, and to prevent unauthorized individuals from copying (logging) keystrokes. We are increasing our market for our suite of products in the financial services, e-commerce, corporate, healthcare, government and consumer sectors. Our cyber security products are as follows: 

&#160;

o ProtectID &#210; is our multi-patented authentication platform that uses "Out-of-Band" multi-factor in-house installation, cloud service technology and a hybrid to authenticate computer network users by a variety of methods including traditional passwords combined with a telephone, iPhone, Droid, Blackberry, PDA, or multiple computer secure sessions, biometric identification and encrypted devices such as tokens or smartcards as examples. The authentication procedure separates authentication information such as usernames from the pin/passwords or biometric information, which are then provided to or from the network's host server across separate communication channels. The platform allows for corporate control and client choices, per their company's security policies, which evolves over time with newly available and customer requested technologies. (Patent Nos:7,870,599, 8,484,698, and 8,713,701 and one patent pending for Out-of-Band Authentication) 

o GuardedID &#210; creates a 256-bit AES encrypted real time separate pathway for information delivery from a keyboard to a targeted application on a local computer, preventing the use of spyware/malware to collect user information. This product provides keyboard encryption and helps prevent keylogging from occurring in real time, which helps prevent the number one threat to consumers and businesses in today's market: keylogging software, which is stealth software embedded in web sites, emails, pictures, MP3 files, videos, USB's or other software and hardware that, once unknowingly launched, secretly monitors and records all of a user's keystrokes on the computer and sends the data to the cyber thief without the user's awareness. Keylogging has been reported as the one of the major causes of major data breaches that occurred from 2010 to 2014, as reported in the 2010-2014 Verizon Data Breach Repor ts. (Patent No: 8,566,608, 8,732,483 and 8,973,107). 

o MobileTrust &#210; (Patent Pending) is an advanced iPhone/iPad and Android device password vault that includes a strong password generator. MobileTrust &#210; also provides for Mobile Multi-Factor One Time Password authentication, a secured browser and keystroke encryption between its virtual keyboard and secured browser, which is critical to all confidential online transactions and other features, which is now in final Beta. This new feature for mobile devices, which helps prevent data breaches and stolen credentials is a critical and vital addition to all enterprise mobile users, as enterprises transition to "Bring Your Own Devices" (BYOD).

o GuardedID &#210; Mobile SDK is a software development kit that provides developers our patent protected keystroke encryption protection for all Apple and Android mobile device's secure keyboards, allowing our keystroke encryption software to be embedded in any mobile applications, utilizing DES 256 Encryption.

&#160;

Our products sometimes include software and hardware that we contractually license from other vendors. These products include VASCO (an authentication and e-signature solutions company) tokens, as well as additional authentication and telecommunication software devices. ProtectID &#210; also uses a software product for its Voice Biometric Out-of-Band method through a partnership with Trade Harbor &#211; . &#160;

&#160; 6 

&#160; 

&#160; &#160;

The ProtectID &#210; Cloud Service can be hosted by our service provider (we have a strategic arrangement with a third party SAS70 hosting service) as well as the ProtectID &#210; Out-of-Band and Multi-Factor Platform, which can be installed internally in a customer's infrastructure or as a hybrid implementation. With the exception of our free redistributable Microsoft software components, our reseller agreement with VASCO and our partnership with Trade Harbor, none of our contracts for hardware or software are with a sole supplier of that feature or product. 

&#160;

Factors that are considered important to our success include, but are not limited to, the following: 

&#160;

o Our productsaddress the needs of a broad variety of customers for authentication and cyber security overall. One of the biggest problems facing the world is Cyber Theft, the effects of which, our management contends, total an estimated $221 billion per year in business losses and more recently, based on anecdotal evidence provided to management, stated to be in the trillions going forward.

o Symantec reported there were over 401 million new pieces of Spyware found over the past year.

o 48% of all data breaches were caused by key loggers (malware copying keystrokes), as reported by the Verizon 2012 Data Breach Report. Similar percentages are reported in the Verizon 2014 report, recently published. All of the companies breached, per these reports, had an anti-virus program installed.

o In 2011, it was reported that RSA Security's data was breached from which Lockheed Martin and others were affected and lost millions of dollars. This event caused many companies to look to other means of two-factor authentication, such as Out-of-Band. The RSA Data Breach started with a keylogging virus which our GuardedID &#210; product, management believes would most likely would have prevented.

o In February 2013, Computerworld reported that the Federal Government put security on the frontline of IT agendas with its announcement of a new cyber security center in Canberra, AU and an additional $1.46 billion in funding for cyber security as part of a new national security blueprint.

o In respect to the latest version of our keyboard encryption and anti-keylogger Product, GuardedID &#210; , a recent report from a government security group known as CERT states that minimally 80% of the malicious keylogging programs are undetected by the major anti-virus software suites. Our Guarded ID &#210; is designed, we believe, to render the malicious programs useless, in real time.

o In June 2013, PhoneArena.com, The Multiple Threat Center of Juniper Networks, found mobile malware growing exponentially at an alarming rate &#8211; a 614% one year increase reaching a total of just about 280,000 malicious apps.

&#9675; In February 2015, the New York Times reported that a Global Bank heist occurred in banks around the globe from a keylogger. This was the first known time that a large hack was reported with the details which included a keylogger that our management believes GuardedID &#210; would have most likely prevented. The article was noted as caused by keystroke encryption in a picture on the front page of the New York Times.

&#160;

o The Effectiveness of Our Products: Our products have been designed to provide, we believe, a high available level of security for computer networks and individual users. In particular, we believe that the now Patented "Out-of-Band" authentication process is an innovative technology that will greatly prevent unauthorized access to computer networks and will provide effective security products to drastically reduce the incidence of identity fraud for our customers. We have contractually commenced implementation of our products on a large global scale, yet there can be no assurance that they will function in all aspects as intended. Likewise, a high level of innovation characterizes the software industry and there can be no assurance that our competitors will not develop and introduce a superior product. The effective functioning of our products once deployed is an important factor in our future success. To date and our knowledge, all of our clients have reported, per a report by Research 2.0, that our products work as described.

o Ability to Integrate our Software with Customer Environments: There are numerous operating systems that are used by computer networks. The ability of a software product to integrate with multiple operating systems is likely to be a significant factor in customer acceptance of particular products. StrikeForce's ProtectID &#210; operates on an independent Cloud Service platform and is also able to integrate with multiple operating systems and user interfaces for an in-house implementation. ProtectID &#210; has been designed to use multiple authentication devices that are currently on the market (including, but not limited to, biometrics, key-fob tokens, iPhones, iPads, Blackberrys, Androids, PDA's, smart cards and other mobile devices). Our ability to integrate our products with multiple existing and future technologies is currently a key factor in the growth of our product's acceptance and is demonstrated by our success with recent clients and installations referred to in a number of our 2014 and 2015 press releases. Our GuardedID &#210; product currently operates with Windows Internet Explorer (IE), Firefox, Chrome and Safari browsers and our upgraded Premium version works with almost all applications running on a Windows desktop platform, inclusive of Microsoft Office and now also the MAC. New features and functions for both products continue to be developed via our research and development. We are also now live with our MobileTrust &#210; and GuardedID &#210; Mobile SDK products.

&#160;

o Relative Cost: We have attempted to design our products to provide a cost-effective suite of products for financial services, e-commerce, commercial, healthcare, government and direct-consumer customers. Our ability to offer our products at a competitive price and to add to existing installations is likely in our opinion, to be a key factor in the acceptance of our product as we have seen with many of our clients.

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

Business Model 

&#160;

We are focusing primarily on developing sales through "channel" relationships in which our products are offered by other manufacturers, distributors, value-added resellers and agents, internationally. In 2015, we added and publicly announced additions to our global distribution sales channel, which provides additional presence for us in the United States, Canada, Europe and Africa. We continue to add additional channel partners, especially on the consumer side and developed a new retail business. We also sell our suite of security products directly from our Edison, New Jersey office, which also augments our channel partner relationships. It is our strategy that these "channel" relationships will provide the greater percentage of our revenues ongoing, as was the case in the past two years. Examples of the channel relationships that we are seeking include already established original equipment manufacturer ("OEM") and bundled relationships with other security technology and software providers that would integrate or bundle the enhanced security capabilities of ProtectID &#210; , GuardedID &#210; and/or MobileTrust &#210; into their own product lines, thereby providing greater value to their clients. These would include providers of networking software and manufacturers of computer and telecommunications hardware and software that provide managed services, and multi-level marketing groups, as well as all markets interested in increasing the value of their products and packages, such as financial services software, anti-virus, government integrators and identity theft product companies. We signed various new distributors during the fourth quarter of 2015 and have optimistic expectations for 2016, resulting from these distribution relationships. Additionally, in February 2016, Advanced Cyber Security ("ACS") purchased their option to buy our GuardedID &#210; patent, as well as our GuardedID &#210; and MobileTrust &#210; products, while we retain an unlimited license to resell those products. The distributors have already obtained new clients and we expect, but cannot guarantee, that more clients will be obtained during 2016 and thereafter. There is no guarantee as to the timing and success of these business relationships or reaching our self-imposed expectations. 

&#160;

From our MobileTrust &#210; security new mobile application, which is now built and with our sCloud registration process in production, we have created and announced two new products: our new ProtectID &#210; Mobile OTP (One Time Password) to be used with ProtectID &#210; ; and our new GuardedID &#210; Mobile keystroke encryption software development kit (SDK). Both new products are now in production. With the creation of this new GuardedID &#210; Mobile SDK, we now focus the sales of this software product to the development groups of our target markets to be added to their mobile applications. We are in discussions with many large scale parties that are interested in this software. Management has already received requests for this software, including for mobile devices, as keystroke encryption malware grows and remains a major problem for the cyber security market. Particularly, in management's estimation, with anti-virus products being seen as non-effective against malware threats. 

&#160;

Our primary target markets include financial services such as banks and insurance companies, healthcare providers, legal services, government agencies through integrators, technology platforms, e-commerce based services companies, telecommunications and cellular carriers, technology software companies, government agencies and consumers, especially for our mobile and keystroke encryption products. We are focusing our concentration on cyber security and data breach strategic problem areas, such as where compliance with financial, healthcare, legal and government regulations are key and stolen passwords are used to acquire private information illegally. In the fourth quarter of 2015, a number of our channel partners had pilots and client implementations in place that are expected, although no assurances can be provided, to increase our revenues in 2016. With our mobile products commencing production in the first quarter of 2016, we anticipate, but cannot guarantee, increased revenues for the remainder of 2016 and thereafter. There is no guarantee as to the timing and success of these efforts. 

&#160;

Because we are now expecting a continual, recurring growing market demand, especially in the mobility and encryption markets, we continue to develop an increasing global reseller and distribution channel as a strategy to generate, manage and fulfill demand for our products across market segments, minimizing the requirement for an increase in our staff. We continue to minimize the concentration on our initial direct sales efforts as our distribution and reseller channels continue to grow internationally and provide appropriate levels of sales and support in the growing Cyber Security market. 

&#160;

We seek to generate revenue through fees for ProtectID &#210; based on client consumer usage in the financial, healthcare services and legal services markets, as well as enterprises in general, through our Cloud Service, plus one-time and annual per person fees in the enterprise markets which often are for in-house installations of our products, and set-up and recurring transaction fees when the product is accessed in our Cloud Service, along with annual maintenance fees, and other one-time and recurring fees. We also intend to generate revenues through sales of our GuardedID &#210; product. GuardedID &#210; pricing is for an annual license and we discount for volume purchases. GuardedID &#210; pricing models, especially when bundling through OEM contracts, include monthly and quarterly recurring revenues. As more agreements are reached by our distributors, we are experiencing monthly increasing sales growth, through the execution of GuardedID &#210; bundled OEM agreements. We also provide our clients a choice of operating our ProtectID &#210; software internally by licensing it or through our hosted Cloud Service or a hybrid that some clients have implemented and none of our competitors presently offer. GuardedID &#210; requires a download on each and every computer it protects, whether for employees or consumers. We have four GuardedID &#210; products, (i) a standard version which protects browser data entry only, (ii) a premium version which protects almost all the applications running under Microsoft Windows on the desktop, including Microsoft Office Suite and almost all applications running on the desktop, (iii) an Enterprise version which, in addition, provides the Enterprise administrative rights and the use of Microsoft's Enterprise tools for the product's deployment, and (iv) an Apple MAC version for all the latest MAC operating systems and for the browsers and entire desktop. Our MobileTrust &#210; mobile product will be priced for the consumer through the appropriate mobile phone stores, as well as direct, distribution and OEM sales for higher volume enterprises, including volume discounts to the degree allowed by the telecommunications providers. Our GuardedID &#210; Mobile SDK (software development kit) will be priced on an annual recurring fee based on volume and number of users or an enterprise plus maintenance price. We anticipate, but can provide no assurances, that these new product offerings will result in the largest number of sales and related revenues for us in 2016 and thereafter. &#160;

&#160; 8 

&#160; 

&#160; &#160;

Our management believes that our products provide a cost-effective and technologically competitive solution to address the increasing problems of network security and cyber security in general. Updated guidance for the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (" FFIEC") regulations include the requirement for solutions that have Two-Factor Out-of-Band Authentication and products that stop keylogging malware, real time, which our management believes our proprietary products uniquely and directly address. This new updated guidance went into effect as of January 1, 2012. Additionally, the 2014 Verizon Data Breach report, published in April 2015, stated that 80% of all the data breaches they reported would not have occurred if the corporations used two factor authentication, such as our ProtectID &#210; system. The report also indicates that over 79% of the data breaches would most likely not have occurred if the corporations breached used anti-keylogging software, such as our GuardedID &#210; system in addition to the typical anti-virus programs. Based on the FFIEC requirement in the latest FFIEC update that was published in June 2011 (being enforced as of January 2012) the latest Verizon Data Breach Report and the new articles from the White House urging law firms and legal services firms to add two factor authentication, we have recently experienced a growing increase in pilots and sales orders and inquiries specifically in the financial and legal markets. In January 2014, PCI Compliance published an update that includes the requirement for not only encrypting data at rest, but also to encrypt data in motion including the keystrokes users enter in their device. Additionally, Symantec's senior vice-president for information security, Brian Dye, told the Wall Street Journal that anti-virus "is dead", in an article published in May 2014. However, there can be no assurance that our products will continue to gain acceptance and continue to grow in the commercial marketplace or that one of our competitors will not introduce technically superior products. 

&#160;

Marketing 

&#160;

Our multi-channel marketing strategy includes: 

&#160;

1. Direct sales to enterprise and commercial customers. In this effort, we join ACS, in order to meet other companies, at the RSA Security Show annually as well as other security related shows and we are looking at other sales alternatives in order to respond aggressively to inquiries relating to our products.

2. The global addition of resellers, agents &#38; distributors (our strategic sales channel) who distribute and resell our products and services to enterprise and commercial customers globally (technology and software product distributors, systems integrators, managed service companies, other security technology and software vendors, telecom companies, cyber security related product companies, etc.).

3. Application Service Provider (ASP) Partners: Our third party service provides a hosting platform that facilitates faster implementations at competitive prices for our Cloud Service option.

4. Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM): SFT products are sold to other security technology vendors that integrate ProtectID &#210; and GuardedID &#210; and now GuardedID &#210; Mobile SDK into their products (bundling) and services providing for monthly/annual increasing recurring revenues.

5. Internet sites that sell GuardedID &#210; to consumers and small enterprises, such as affiliates.

6. Technology and other providers and resellers, agents and distributors interested in purchasing and or selling our new MobileTrust &#210; cyber solution for all mobile devices, initially for all Apple and Android devices, that we now have in production starting in 2016.

7. Outside Independent consultants selling our products for commission only, focusing on the healthcare, legal and consumer markets.

&#160;

Our sCloud service provider is Hosting.com and we have been under contract with them since December 2007 when we executed an agreement with a nationwide premier data center and co-location services provider who functions as an Application Service Provider for our ProtectID &#210; , GuardedID &#210; and MobileTrust &#210; products, which require a secondary server used for the "Out-of-Band" two-factor authentication technology. We believe that this relationship improves the implementation time, reduces the cost and training requirements, and allows for ease of scalability, with hot backups in multiple locations across the U.S., on an as needed basis. Our sCloud site is also SAS 70 (Statement on Auditing Standards (SAS) No. 70) certified, which is critical to providing a secure compliant service that is required by most of our clients. Our agreement with the services provider was for a one-year (1) term, initially ending in December 2008 and renewing automatically for one-year (1) terms, and is still in effect. The relationship can be terminated by either party on sixty days written notice. The cloud service is based on a flat monthly fee per the terms of the contract that can increase as we require additional services. &#160;

Intellectual Property 

&#160;

We are working with our patent attorneys to aggressively enforce our patent rights per the terms of a retainer agreement executed in February 2013, now that we have successfully settled our first major patent lawsuit. Our patent attorneys also filed our fourth "Out of Band" continuation patents. The third patent was recently granted and the fourth patent is pending . We currently have three patents granted to us for Out-of-Band ProtectID &#210; (Patent Nos.: 7,870,599, 8,484,698 and 8,713,701). In September 2014, we filed an International Patent for MobileTrust &#210; (PCT/US20114/029905), which is pending. 

&#160;

We are also working with our patent attorneys to plan our strategy to aggressively enforce the patent rights relating to our granted Keystroke Encryption patents that help protect our GuardedID &#210; and MobileTrust &#210; products. We were granted three related keystroke encryption patents for which we received the most recent patent on March 3, 2015 (Patent Nos.: 8,566,608, 8,732,483 and 8,973,107). In February 2016, a channel partner exercised their option to purchase our GuardedID &#210; patents, which, if effectuated, requires them to pay us $9,000,000 for the patents before September 30, 2020. 

&#160;

We have four trademarks that have been approved and registered: ProtectID &#210; , GuardedID &#210; , MobileTrust &#210; and CryptoColor &#210; . A portion of our software is licensed from third parties and the remainder is developed by our own team of developers while leveraging some external consultant expertise as necessitated. We rely upon confidentiality agreements signed by our employees, consultants and third parties to protect the intellectual property rights. 

&#160;

We license technology from third parties, including software that is integrated with internally developed software and used in our products to perform key functions. We anticipate that we will continue to license technology from third parties in the future. Although we are not substantially dependent on any individual licensed technology, some of the software that we license from third parties could be difficult for us to replace. The effective implementation of our products depends upon the successful operation of third-party licensed products in conjunction with our suite of products, and therefore any undetected errors in these licensed products could create delays in the implementation of our products, impair the functionality of our products, delay new product introductions, damage our reputation, and/or cause us to provide substitute products. 

&#160;

Business Strategy 

&#160;

While we will most likely continue to post operating deficits, our first quarter 2016 results will show an overall net income, due to the award we received from the confidential settlement of our first major patent remediation litigation. Most of the costs that we incur are related to salaries, professional fees, marketing, sales and research &#38; design. We increased our technology staff by contracting an outsourced firm in 2015. Our operations presently require funding of approximately $130,000 per month. We expect that our monthly cash usage for operations will increase slightly due to contracted and anticipated increased volumes and adding some targeted channel marketing programs. We anticipate that the areas in which we will experience the greatest increase in operating expenses is in marketing, selling, product support, product research and new technology development in the growing cyber security market. We are committed to maintaining our current level of operating costs until we reach the level of revenues needed to absorb any potential increase in costs. 

&#160;

Our primary strategy in 2016 is to focus on the growth and support of our channel partners, including distributors, resellers and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). Our internal sales team targets potential direct sales in industries that management believes provides the greatest potential for short term sales. These include small to medium sized financial institutions, government agencies, e-commerce, healthcare, legal and enterprise businesses. We are also executing agreements with strategic resellers and distributors for marketing, selling and supporting our products internationally. We primarily work with distributors, resellers and agents to generate the bulk of our sales internationally, realizing that this strategy takes longer to nurture, however it is progressing well. We are starting to realize positive results, however slowly, with our sales channel and anticipate, but cannot guarantee a successful 2016, through the sales channel and from our new mobile and GuardedID &#210; MAC products with a concentration of sales already contracted. There can be no assurances, however, that we will succeed in implementing our sales strategy. Although management believes that there is an increasingly strong market for our products as the need for cyber security solutions increases globally, we have not generated substantial revenue from the sale of our products and there is no assurance we can secure a market sufficient to permit us to achieve profitability in the next twelve months. &#160;

Competition 

&#160;

The software development and services market is characterized by innovation and competition. There are several well-established companies within the authentication market that offer network security systems in our product market and newer companies with emerging technologies. We believe that our multi-patented "Out-of-Band" multi-factor identity authentication platform is an innovative, secure, adaptable, competitively priced, integrated network authentication platform. The main features of ProtectID &#210; include: an open architecture "Out-of-Band" platform for user authentication; operating system independence; biometric layering; soft mobile tokens; mobile authentication; secure website logon; Virtual Private Network ("VPN") access; domain authentication; newly added Office 365 authentication and multi-level authentication. Unlike other techniques for increased network security, ProtectID &#210; does not rely on a specific authentication device or method (e.g., phone, tokens, smart cards, digital certificates, soft mobile tokens, or biometrics, such as a retinal or fingerprint scan). Rather ProtectID &#210; has been developed as an "open platform" that incorporates an unlimited number of authentication devices and methods. For example, once a user has been identified to a computer network, a system deploying our ProtectID &#210; authentication system permits the "Out-of-Band" authentication of that user by a telephone, iPhone, iPad, Blackberry, PDA, email, hard token, SSL client software, a biometric device such as a voice biometric, or others, before that user is permitted to access the network. By using "Out-of-Band" authentication methods, management believes that ProtectID &#210; , now patented and protected through our ongoing litigation, with plans for additional litigation, provides a competitive product for customers with security requirements greater than typical name and password schemes for virtual private networks and computer systems with multiple users at remote locations, as examples. We also believe that our multi-patented keystroke encryption product, GuardedID &#210; , offers an additional competitive edge for network security and e-commerce applications that should provide greater levels of security and the ability to evolve over time based on newer technologies when made available. There is less competition for the keystroke encryption product and there are no well-established companies in this space, which explains our current growth in pilots and sales for GuardedID &#210; , especially relating to bundled channel partner programs. GuardedID &#210; is critical to help prevent key logging viruses, one of the largest sources of cyberattacks and data breaches. GuardedID &#210; also is protected with three patents. Our newest product, MobileTrust &#210; , is ideal for bringing the functionality of our other two products, especially including keystroke encryption, to all mobile devices, with initial focus on all Apple and Android devices. This product is also protected with our GuardedID &#210; patents and some of its features and functions are covered by the Out-of-Band Authentication patent. Our other new mobile product is GuardedID &#210; Mobile SDK, which allows our secured keyboard function as a software development kit for developers to purchase and integrate as part of their secured applications. Considering the features and functions, all of our cyber solutions have limited competition based on our products' ability to protect individual identities and computers/devices against some of the most dangerous and increasing threats. We also have great demand for the mobile products, which are being marketed to all potential new clients. 

&#160;

Although we believe that our suite of products offer competitive advantages, there is no assurance that any of these products will continue to increase its market share in the marketplace. Our competitors include established software and hardware companies that are likely to be better financed and to have established sales channels. Due to the high level of innovation in the software development industry, it is also possible that a competitor will introduce a product that provides a higher level of security than our products or which can be offered at prices that are more advantageous to the customer.
