Credit Facility 

&#160;

During fiscal 2016, Bioanalytical Systems, Inc. (&#8220;We&#8221; the &#8220;Company&#8221;, or &#8220;BASi&#8221;) has operated either in default of, or under forbearance arrangements with respect to, its credit agreements with Huntington National Bank (&#8220;Huntington Bank&#8221;), as more fully described under &#34;Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8211; Liquidity and Capital Resources &#8211; Credit Facility.&#34; Effective October 31, 2016, we entered into a Fourth Forbearance Agreement and Fifth Amendment to Credit Agreement (the &#8220;Fourth Forbearance Agreement&#8221;) with Huntington Bank. Pursuant to the Fourth Forbearance Agreement, Huntington Bank agreed to forbear from exercising its rights and remedies under the Company&#8217;s credit facility and from terminating the Company&#8217;s related swap agreement with respect to the Company&#8217;s non-compliance with applicable financial covenants under the credit agreement and any further non-compliance with such covenants until January 31, 2017. If we are unable to refinance our indebtedness before the end of the forbearance period, and were Huntington Bank to demand payment on the outstanding debt under our credit arrangements, we would have insufficient funds to satisfy that obligation. In such case, in addition to the ability to immediately demand payment of the outstanding debt under our term loan and revolving loan, Huntington Bank would have the right to exercise its security interest, to take possession of or sell the underlying collateral, to increase interest accruing on the debt, to refrain from making additional advances under the revolving loan, and to terminate our interest rate swap.

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s Board of Directors has directed management to seek alternatives that will enable the Company to repay its indebtedness to Huntington Bank in full upon the expiration of the forbearance period. The Company continues to pursue liquidity alternatives, including but not limited to, the potential disposition of certain of its assets and the sale of its West Lafayette facilities. Management has been reviewing details of all current account management and marketing programs as well as all invoicing and top line growth initiatives. Management also has been, and continues to be, actively engaged in more effectively controlling operating costs in the short-term as we strive for long-term stabilization. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to resolve our liquidity issues on satisfactory terms, or at all.

General 

&#160;

The Company is an international contract research organization providing drug discovery and development services and analytical instruments. Our mission is to provide drug developers with superior scientific research and innovative analytical instrumentation, which saves time, saves money, and saves lives, to bring revolutionary new drugs to market quickly and safely. Our strategy is to provide services that will generate high-quality and timely data in support of new drug approval or use expansion. Our customers and partners include pharmaceutical, biotechnology, academic and government organizations. We provide innovative technologies and products and a commitment to quality to help customers and partners accelerate the development of safe and effective therapeutics and maximize the returns on their research and development investments. We offer an efficient, variable-cost alternative to our customers' internal product development programs. Outsourcing development work to reduce overhead and speed drug approvals through the Food and Drug Administration (&#34;FDA&#34;) is an established alternative to in-house development among pharmaceutical companies. We derive our revenues from sales of our research services and drug development instruments, both of which are focused on determining drug safety and efficacy. The Company has been involved in the research of drugs to treat numerous therapeutic areas for over 40 years since its formation as a corporation organized in Indiana in 1974.

&#160;

We support the preclinical and clinical development needs of researchers and clinicians for small molecule and large biomolecule drug candidates. We believe our scientists have the skills in analytical instrumentation development, chemistry, computer software development, physiology, medicine, analytical chemistry and toxicology to make the services and products we provide increasingly valuable to our current and potential customers. Our principal customers are scientists engaged in analytical chemistry, drug safety evaluation, clinical trials, drug metabolism studies, pharmacokinetics and basic research from small start-up biotechnology companies to many of the largest global pharmaceutical companies. We are committed to bringing scientific expertise, quality and speed to every drug discovery and development program to help our customers develop safe and effective life-changing medicines.

&#160;

Developments within the industries we serve have a direct, and sometimes material, impact on our operations. Currently, many large pharmaceutical companies have major &#34;block-buster&#34; drugs that are nearing the end of their patent protections. This puts significant pressure on these companies both to develop new drugs with large market appeal, and to re-evaluate their cost structures and the time-to-market of their products. Contract research organizations (&#34;CROs&#34;) have benefited from these developments, as the pharmaceutical industry has turned to out-sourcing to both reduce fixed costs and to increase the speed of research and data development necessary for new drug applications. The number of significant drugs that have reached or are nearing the end of their patent protection has also benefited the generic drug industry. Generic drug companies provide a significant source of new business for CROs as they develop, test and manufacture their generic compounds.

&#160;

A significant portion of innovation in the pharmaceutical industry is now being driven by biotech and small, venture capital funded drug development companies. Many of these companies are &#34;single-molecule&#34; entities, whose success depends on one innovative compound. While several of the biotech companies have reached the status of major pharmaceuticals, the industry is still characterized by smaller entities. These developmental companies generally do not have the resources to perform much of the research within their organizations, and are therefore dependent on the CRO industry for both their research and for guidance in preparing their FDA submissions. These companies have provided significant new opportunities for the CRO industry, including us. They do, however, provide challenges in selling, as they frequently have only one product in development, which causes CROs to be unable to develop a flow of projects from a single company. These companies may expend all of their available funds and cease operations prior to fully developing a product. Additionally, the funding of these companies is subject to investment market fluctuations, which changes as the risk profiles and appetite of investors change.

&#160;

Industry Overview 

&#160;

Drug discovery and development is the process of creating drugs for the treatment of human disease. The drug discovery process aims to identify potential drug candidates, while the drug development process involves the testing of these drug candidates in animals and humans to meet regulatory requirements. The process for researching and developing new medicines is growing in difficulty and length. On average, it takes at least ten years for a new medicine to complete the journey from initial discovery to the marketplace, with clinical trials alone taking six to seven years on average. The average cost to research and develop each successful drug is estimated to be $2.6 billion. This number incorporates the cost of failures &#8211; of the thousands and sometimes millions of compounds that may be screened and assessed early in the R&#38;D process, only a few of which will ultimately receive approval. The overall probability of clinical success (the likelihood that a drug entering clinical testing will eventually be approved) is estimated to be less than 12%.

&#160;

&#160; 4 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

The drug development services industry provides independent product development services to pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, and government organizations. This industry has evolved from providing limited clinical trial services in the 1970s to a full-service industry today characterized by broader relationships with customers and by service offerings that encompass the entire drug development process, including preclinical evaluations, study design, clinical trial management, data collection, biostatistical analyses, regulatory consulting, clinical laboratory and diagnostic services, pre- and post-approval safety analysis, product registration and post-approval support.

&#160; 

Over the past 25 years, technological advances, as well as the emergence of the biotechnology industry, have dramatically changed the drug discovery process. New and improved technologies have evolved such as ultra-high-throughput screening, new in vitro and in vivo preclinical profiling techniques and the gene-based drug research commonly referred to as genomics. The objective of these innovations is to find more drug targets and to screen chemical compounds against targets much more quickly, with literally millions of compounds possible. This process is expected to produce many more molecules having the ability to affect biological activity. These molecules then need to be tested quickly and economically to determine their viability as potentially safe and effective drug candidates.

&#160; 

Trends Affecting the Drug Discovery and Development Industry 

&#160;

Our services and products are marketed globally to pharmaceutical, medical research and biotechnology companies and institutions (academic and governmental) engaged in drug research and development. The research services industry is highly fragmented among many niche vendors led by a small number of larger companies; the latter offer an ever-growing portfolio of start-to-finish pharmaceutical development services. Our services and products may have distinctly different customers (often separate divisions in a single large pharmaceutical company) and requirements. We believe that market trends in the pharmaceutical and biotech industries demonstrate an increasing emphasis towards outsourcing, as companies seek to maintain reduced internal resources in favor of variable models that offer high quality and higher accountability alternatives to meet their drug discovery, development and manufacturing needs. We believe that our customers are facing increased pressure to outsource facets of their research and development activities and that the following factors will increase customer outsourcing.

&#160; 

Accelerated Drug Development 

&#160;

Customers continue to require faster, more efficient, more selective development of an increasing pool of drug candidates. Consequently, our customers require fast, high-quality service in order to make well-informed decisions to quickly exclude poor candidates and speed development of successful ones. The need for additional development capacity to exploit more opportunities, accelerate development, extend market exclusivity and increase profitability drives the demand for outsourced services.

&#160; 

Increase in Potential New Drug Candidates 

&#160;

While research and development spending and the number of drug candidates are increasing, the time and cost required to develop a new drug candidate also have increased. Many pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies do not have sufficient internal resources to pursue development of all of these new drug candidates on their own. Consequently, these companies are looking to the drug discovery and development services industry for cost-effective, innovative and rapid means of developing new drugs.

&#160; 

Cost Pressures of Introducing New Drugs 

&#160;

Market forces, healthcare reform and other governmental initiatives place significant pressures on pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to reduce drug prices. In addition, increased competition as a result of patent expiration, market acceptance of generic drugs, and governmental and privately managed care organization efforts to reduce healthcare costs have added to drug pricing pressures. The industry is responding by consolidating, streamlining operations, decentralizing internal discovery and development processes, and minimizing fixed costs. In addition, increased pressures to differentiate products and justify drug pricing are resulting in an increased focus on healthcare economics, safety monitoring and commercialization services. Moreover, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are attempting to increase the speed and efficiency of internal new drug discovery and development processes.

&#160;

&#160; 5 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Patent Expiration 

&#160;

As exclusivity ends with patent expiry, drug companies defend their proprietary positions against generic competition with various patent extension strategies. Both the drug company creating these extensions and the generic competitors should provide additional opportunities for us.

&#160; 

Alliances 

&#160;

Strategic alliances allow pharmaceutical companies to share research know-how and to develop and market new drugs faster in more diverse, global markets. We believe that such alliances will lead to a greater number of potential drugs in testing, many under study by small companies lacking broad technical resources. Those small companies can add shareholder value by further developing new products through outsourcing, reducing risk for potential allies. Customers seek realistic business partnerships with their service provider in an effort to ensure that costs are controlled as their development programs progress. We have long-standing business relationships with many pharmaceutical companies and continue to offer flexible services and adapt to our customer&#8217;s requirements.

&#160; 

Mergers and Acquisitions 

&#160;

Consolidation in the pharmaceutical industry is commonplace. As firms blend personnel, resources and business activities, we believe they will continue to streamline operations and minimize staffing, which may lead to more outsourcing. Consolidation may result in a disruption in the progress of drug development programs as merging companies rationalize their respective drug development pipelines.

&#160; 

Biotechnology Industry and Virtual Drug Company Growth 

&#160;

The U.S. biotechnology industry has grown rapidly over the last decade and has emerged as a key customer segment for the drug discovery and development services industry. In recent years, this industry has generated significant numbers of new drug candidates that will require development and regulatory approval. Many biotechnology drug developers do not have in-house resources to conduct development. Many new companies choose only to carry a product to a developed stage sufficient to attract a partner who will manufacture and market the drug. Because of the time and cost involved, these companies rely heavily on CROs to conduct research for their drug candidates.

&#160; 

Unique Technical Expertise 

&#160;

The increasing complexity of new drugs requires highly specialized, innovative, solution-driven research not available in all customer labs. We believe that this need for unique technical expertise will increasingly lead to outsourcing of research activity.

&#160; 

Data Management and Quality Expertise 

&#160;

Our customers and the FDA require more data, greater access to that data, consistent and auditable management of that data, and greater security and control of that data. We have made significant investments in software throughout our contract services groups to optimize efficiency and ensure compliance with FDA regulations and market expectations.

&#160; 

Changes in the Regulatory Environment 

&#160;

The drug discovery and development process is heavily regulated by the FDA and its Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. Recent product safety concerns, increases in drug and general healthcare costs and the emergence of importation issues have placed the FDA and other regulatory agencies under increased scrutiny. The war on terror, the risk of global vaccine shortages and the threat of new potential pandemics have elevated the FDA&#8217;s focus on research in the areas of bioterrorism and vaccine development. As a result of these and other events, drug safety, cost and availability are under intense monitoring and review by Congress, the FDA and other government agencies. In 2007, primarily in response to the FDA&#8217;s handling of post market data and recent drug safety concerns, the FDA Act was signed into law. In addition to reauthorizing and amending various provisions that were scheduled to expire, this Act provided the FDA with new regulatory authority to require drug sponsors to run post-approval studies and clinical trials and develop and implement risk evaluation and mitigation strategies. It is also likely that additional legislation will be passed that will impact the FDA and drug development and approval process in the United States. The FDA Act, continued drug safety issues and future legislation could have a lasting and pronounced impact on the drug discovery and development industry.

&#160;

&#160;

Globalization of the Marketplace 

&#160;

Foreign firms rely on independent development companies like ours with experience in the U.S. to provide integrated services through all phases of product development and to assist in preparing complex regulatory submissions. Domestic drug firms are broadening product availability globally, demanding local regulatory approval. We believe that domestic service providers such as us with global reach, established regulatory expertise, and a broad range of integrated development services and products will benefit from this trend.

&#160; 

Our Solution 

&#160;

We address the needs of the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, as well as academic, non-profit and government organizations, for drug discovery and development by providing integrated products and services to help our customers maximize the return on their research and development investments. Our application of innovative technologies and products and our commitment to quality throughout the drug discovery and development process offer our customers a way to identify and develop successful drugs and devices more quickly and cost-effectively. We have obtained significant drug development expertise from more than 40 years of operation.

&#160;

The Company's Role in the Drug Development Process 

&#160;

After a new drug candidate is identified and carried through preliminary screening, the development process for new drugs has three distinct phases.

&#160;

1) The preclinical phase includes safety testing to prepare an Investigational New Drug (&#34;IND&#34;) application for submission to the FDA. The IND must be accepted by the FDA before the drug can be tested in humans. Once a pharmacologically active molecule is fully analyzed to confirm its integrity, the initial dosage form for clinical trials is created. An analytical chemistry method is developed to enable reliable quantification. Stability and purity of the formulation are also determined. 

&#160;

Customers work with our preclinical services group to establish pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD) and safety testing of the new drug. These safety studies range from dose ranging studies, that involve acute safety monitoring of drugs and medical devices to chronic, multi-year oncogenicity and reproductive toxicity studies. Dose formulation analysis is provided by our pharmaceutical analysis group. Bioanalyses of blood sampled under these protocols by our bioanalytical services group provide pharmacokinetic and metabolism data that is used with the safety and toxicity information to determine the exposure required to demonstrate toxicity. A no effect level is then established for the drug and sets the basis for future dose levels in further safety testing and clinical phase I studies. Upon successful completion of preclinical safety studies, an IND submission is prepared and provided to the FDA for review prior to human clinical trials.

&#160;

Many of our products are designed for use in discovery and preclinical development. The Culex &#174; family of robotic automated dose delivery, blood and other biofluids sampling and physiological parameters measurement systems enable researchers to quickly and cost effectively determine PK/PD profiles of drugs in large and small animal models. The Culex &#174; system allows experiments on freely moving conscious animals from early research for therapeutic target validation to lead optimization of compounds. Using the Culex &#174; system, researchers are able to automatically dose and sample in-vivo to develop pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of drugs during early screening in rodents and other animals quickly and cost effectively. Our bioanalytical services group utilizes our depth of expertise in liquid chromatography with detection by mass spectrometry to support research, preclinical and clinical programs. We also offer bioanalytical services that utilize electrochemistry, spectrophotometric (UV/Vis or fluorescence) and Corona Discharge detection as options. We have invested heavily in robotics and mass spectrometry systems. Application of this technology allows us to rapidly develop and validate methods for new compounds and obtain information suitable for regulatory submission.

&#160;

&#160; 7 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

2) The clinical phase further explores the safety and efficacy of the drug candidate in humans. The sponsor conducts Phase I human clinical trials in a limited number of healthy individuals to determine safety and tolerability. Bioanalytical assays determine the availability and metabolism of the active ingredient following administration. Expertise in method development and validation is critical, particularly for new chemical entities.

&#160;

Exhaustive safety, tolerability and dosing regimens are established in sick patients in Phase II trials. Phase III clinical trials verify efficacy and safety. After successful completion of Phase III trials, the sponsor of the new drug submits a New Drug Application (&#34;NDA&#34;) or Product License Application (&#34;PLA&#34;) to the FDA requesting that the product be approved for marketing. Early manufacturing demonstrates production of the substance in accordance with FDA Good Manufacturing Practices (&#34;GMP&#34;) guidelines. Data are compiled in an NDA, or for biotechnology products a PLA, for submission to the FDA requesting approval to market the drug or product. The bioanalytical sample count per study grows rapidly from Phase I through Phase III. Phase II and III studies may take several years to complete, supported by well-proven, consistently applied analytical methods.

&#160;

Our services include evaluation of bioequivalence and bioavailability to monitor the rate and extent to which a drug is available in the body and to demonstrate that the availability is consistent between formulations. We also offer in-vitro bioequivalence testing for non-absorbed oral drugs. We offer support and testing services in clinical sample development, release and stability.

&#160;

3) The Post-approval phase follows FDA approval of the NDA or PLA. This includes production and continued analytical and clinical monitoring of the drug. The post-approval phase also includes development and regulatory approval of product modifications and line extensions, including improved dosage forms. The drug manufacturer must comply with quality assurance and quality control requirements throughout production and must continue analytical and stability studies of the drug during commercial production to continue to validate production processes and confirm product shelf life. Samples from each manufactured batch must be tested prior to release of the batch for distribution to the public. 

&#160;

We also provide services in all areas during the post-approval phase, including bioequivalence studies of new formulations, line extensions, new disease indications and drug interaction studies. Our ability to offer GMP electrochemical detection services has provided increased business opportunities for release testing.

&#160;

Increases in our services offerings have resulted in our ability to provide a broader range of services to our customers, often using combined services of several disciplines to address customer needs. Our ability to solve customer problems by combining our knowledge base, services and products has been a factor in our selection by major pharmaceutical companies to assist in several preclinical through post-approval phases.

&#160;

Company Services and Products 

&#160; 

Overview 

&#160;

We focus on developing innovative services and products that increase efficiency and reduce costs associated with taking new drugs to market. We operate in two business segments &#8211; contract research services and research products, both of which address the bioanalytical, preclinical, and clinical research needs of drug developers. Both segments arose out of our expertise in a number of core technologies designed to quantify trace chemicals in complex matrices.

&#160; 

Contract Research Services 

&#160;

The contract research services segment provides screening and pharmacological testing, preclinical safety testing, formulation development, regulatory compliance and quality control testing. Revenues from the contract research services segment were $15.9 million for fiscal 2016. The following is a description of the services provided by our contract research services segment:

&#160;

&#160; 8 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; Product Characterization, Method Development and Validation : Analytical methods, primarily performed in West Lafayette, Indiana, determine potency, purity, chemical composition, structure and physical properties of a compound. Methods are validated to ensure that data generated are accurate, precise, reproducible and reliable and are used consistently throughout the drug development process and in later product support. 

&#183; Bioanalytical Testing : We analyze specimens from preclinical and clinical trials to measure drug and metabolite concentrations in complex biological matrices. Bioanalysis is performed at our facilities in West Lafayette, Indiana. 

&#183; Stability Testing : We test stability of drug substances and formulated drug products and maintain secure storage facilities in West Lafayette, Indiana to establish and confirm product purity, potency and shelf life. We have validated controlled-climate GMP (Good Manufacturing Practices) systems in place, and the testing capability to complete most stability programs. 

&#183; In Vivo Pharmacology : We provide preclinical in vivo sampling services for the continuous monitoring of chemical changes in life, in particular, how a drug enters, travels through, and is metabolized in living systems. Those services are performed in customized facilities in West Lafayette and Evansville, Indiana using our robotic Culex &#174; APS (Automated Pharmacology System). 

&#183; Preclinical and Pathology Services : We provide pharmacokinetic and safety testing in studies ranging from acute safety monitoring of drugs and medical devices to chronic, multi-year oncogenicity studies in our Evansville, Indiana site. &#160; 

Research Products 

&#160;

We focus our products business on expediting preclinical screening of developmental drugs. We compete in small niches of the multibillion dollar analytical instrument industry. The products business targets unique niches in life science research. We design, develop, manufacture and market state-of-the-art:

&#160;

&#183; In vivo sampling systems and accessories (including disposables, training and systems qualification) 

&#183; Physiology monitoring tools 

&#183; Liquid chromatography and electrochemistry instruments platforms &#160;

Revenues for our products segment were $4.5 million for fiscal 2016. We offer two (2) principal product lines: Analytical Products and In vivo Sampling Products. In addition, we continue to service our Vetronics&#8217; Products line. The following is a brief description of the products offered:

&#160;

&#183; Analytical Products: Analytical products consist of our liquid chromatographic and electrochemical instruments with associated accessories. The critical component of these products is the Epsilon &#174; electrochemical platform. This platform incorporates all the hardware capabilities needed for most electrochemical experiments but can be modified through software development. The market is principally academic institutions and industrial research companies. &#183; In vivo Sampling Products: In vivo sampling products consist of the Culex&#174; family of automated in vivo sampling and dosing instruments. These instruments are used by pharmaceutical researchers to dose animals and collect biological samples (blood, bile, urine, microdialysate, feces or any bio-fluid) from the animals. Since dosing and sample collections are automated, animals are not manually handled, reducing stress on the animals and producing more representative pharmacological data. Behavior and other physiological parameters can also be monitored simultaneously. Compared to manual methods, the Culex &#174; products offer significant reduction in test model use and comparable reduction in labor. The line also includes in vivo sampling devices sold to drug developers and medical research centers to assist in the study of a number of medical conditions including stroke, depression, Alzheimer&#8217;s and Parkinson&#8217;s diseases, diabetes and osteoporosis. &#183; Vetronics&#8217; Products: Vetronics&#8217; products consist of instruments and related software to monitor and diagnose cardiac function (electro-cardiogram) and measure other vital physiological parameters primarily in cats and dogs in veterinary clinics. In late fiscal 2014, we began shifting our market focus and will no longer actively market the Vetronics&#8217; product offering. However, we will continue to service the units in the field. &#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Customers 

&#160;

We have regularly provided our services and/or products to most of the top 25 pharmaceutical companies in the world, as ranked by the number of research and development projects. Approximately 9% of our revenues are generated from customers outside of North America.

&#160;

We balance our business development effort between large pharmaceutical developers and smaller drug development companies.

&#160;

In fiscal 2016 our Services group continued its presence at several important existing customers. In fiscal 2016, one customer accounted for approximately 14.0% of total sales and 13.2% of total trade accounts receivable at September 30, 2016. In fiscal 2015 this customer accounted for approximately 4.0% of total sales and 19.4% of total trade accounts receivable at September 30, 2015. The customer discussed is included in our Services segment. There can be no assurance that our business will move away from dependence upon a limited number of customer relationships.

&#160; 

Sales and Marketing 

&#160;

With both large and small pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as research institutions, we promote our services through concentrated business development efforts, scientist-to-scientist communications and centralized corporate marketing programs. We recognize that our growth and customer satisfaction depend upon our ability to continually improve and create new customer relationships.

&#160;

Our sales and global marketing initiatives include integrated campaigns designed to help differentiate and promote our products and services. Through trade events, online and print advertising in trade publications, direct communication, newsletters, and our website, we provide our perspective on current industry challenges or developments to create an ongoing dialogue with our customers and to promote our industry expertise, quality, technology and innovation. We reinforce key messages and selling points through customer presentations, corporate material and at trade events and industry conferences.

&#160;

We encourage and sponsor the participation of our scientific and technical personnel in a variety of professional endeavors, including via speaking engagements, the presentation of papers at national and international professional trade meetings and the publication of scientific articles in medical and pharmaceutical journals. Through these endeavors we seek to further our reputation for professional excellence.

&#160;

As of September 30, 2016, we had 5 employees on our global sales and marketing staff. We have a network of 16 established distributors covering Japan, the Pacific Basin, South America, the Middle East, India, South Africa and Eastern Europe. All of our distributor relationships are managed from the corporate headquarters in West Lafayette, Indiana.

&#160; 

Contractual Arrangements 

&#160;

Our service contracts typically establish an estimated fee to be paid for identified services. In most cases, some percentage of the contract costs is paid in advance. While we are performing a contract, customers often adjust the scope of services to be provided based on interim project results. Fees are adjusted accordingly. Generally, our fee-for-service contracts are terminable by the customer upon written notice of 30 days or less for a variety of reasons, including the customer's decision to forego a particular study, the failure of product prototypes to satisfy safety requirements, and unexpected or undesired results of product testing. Cancellation or delay of ongoing contracts may result in fluctuations in our quarterly and annual results. We are generally able to recover, at minimum, our invested costs when contracts are terminated.

&#160;

Our products business offers both annual and multi-year service and maintenance agreements as well as capital lease arrangements on many of our product lines.

&#160;

&#160;

Competition 

&#160; 

Services 

&#160;

We compete with in-house research, development, quality control and other support service departments of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies as well as other Contract Research Organizations (&#34;CROs&#34;) that compete in this industry. Several of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources than we do. The largest CRO competitors offering similar research services include:

&#160;

&#183; Covance, Inc. now part of LabCorp; &#183; Pharmaceutical Product Development, Inc.; &#183; Charles River Laboratories, Inc.; and &#183; Quintiles Transnational Holdings, Inc. &#160;

CROs generally compete on:

&#160;

&#183; regulatory compliance record; &#183; reputation for on-time quality performance; &#183; quality systems; &#183; previous experience; &#183; medical and scientific expertise in specific therapeutic areas; &#183; scientist-to-scientist relationships; &#183; quality of contract research; &#183; financial viability; &#183; database management; &#183; statistical and regulatory services; &#183; ability to recruit investigators; &#183; ability to integrate information technology with systems to optimize research efficiency; &#183; quality of facilities; &#183; international presence with strategically located facilities; and &#183; price. &#160;

Products 

&#160;

Though many global analytical instruments competitors exist, we have an extensive, long-standing network of customers who are repeat buyers and recommend our products. In contrast, there are few competitors for our in vivo sampling products. The primary market is large pharmaceutical research departments and academic research institutions. Our differentiators are high quality, flexibility to meet customers&#8217; specific needs and superior technical support and service. We provide equipment that enables our customers to attain premium scientific laboratory information on a reasonable operating investment. As customers&#8217; needs constantly change, we continually refine our products and develop new products which meet our operating objectives.

&#160;

Government Regulation 

&#160;

We are subject to various regulatory requirements designed to ensure the quality and integrity of our data and products. These regulations are promulgated primarily under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, and include Good Laboratory Practice (&#34;GLP&#34;), Good Manufacturing Practice (&#34;GMP&#34;), and Good Clinical Practice (&#34;GCP&#34;) guidelines administered by the FDA. The standards of GLP, GMP, and GCP are required by the FDA and by similar regulatory authorities around the world. These guidelines demand rigorous attention to employee training; detailed documentation; equipment validation; careful tracking of changes and routine auditing of compliance. Noncompliance with these standards could result in disqualification of project data collected by the Company. Material violation of GLP, GMP, or GCP guidelines could result in regulatory sanctions and, in severe cases, could also result in a discontinuance of selected operations. &#160; We have been audited, on a routine basis, by the FDA seventeen times. The FDA has visited twelve times in West Lafayette and five times at the Evansville location. Of the seventeen FDA audits, eleven were without findings. Where the FDA had findings, which have not been significant to our operations, we have taken actions to address the findings.

&#160;

&#160; 11 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

We have not experienced any significant problems to date in complying with the regulations of such agencies and do not believe that any existing or proposed regulations will require material capital expenditures or changes in our method of operation.

&#160; 

Analytical Services 

&#160;

Laboratories that provide information included in INDs, NDAs and PLAs must conform to regulatory requirements that are designed to ensure the quality and integrity of the testing process. Most of our contract research services are subject to government standards for laboratory practices that are embodied in guidelines for GLP. The FDA and other regulatory authorities require that test results submitted to such authorities be based on studies conducted in accordance with GLP. These guidelines are set out to help the researcher perform work in compliance with a pre-established plan and standardized procedures. These guidelines include but are not restricted to:

&#160;

&#183; Resources &#8211; organization, personnel, facilities and equipment; &#183; Rules &#8211; protocols and written procedures; &#183; Characterization &#8211; test items and test systems; &#183; Documentation &#8211; raw data, final report and archives; and &#183; Quality assurance unit &#8211; formalized internal audit function. &#160;

We must also maintain reports for each study for specified periods for auditing by the study sponsor and by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities in other parts of the world. Noncompliance with GLP can result in the disqualification of data collected during the preclinical trial.

&#160;

Preclinical Services 

&#160;

Our animal research facilities are subject to a variety of federal and state laws and regulations, including The Animal Welfare Act and the rules and regulations enforced by the United States Department of Agriculture (&#34;USDA&#34;) and the National Institutes of Health (&#34;NIH&#34;). These regulations establish the standards for the humane treatment, care and handling of animals by dealers and research facilities. Our animal research facilities maintain detailed standard operating procedures and other documentation necessary to comply with applicable regulations for the humane treatment of the animals in our custody. In addition to being licensed by the USDA as a research facility, we are also accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International and have registered assurance with the NIH.

&#160; 

Quality Assurance and Information Technology 

&#160;

To assure compliance with applicable regulations, we have established quality assurance programs at our facilities that audit test data, train personnel and review procedures and regularly inspect facilities. In addition, FDA regulations and guidelines serve as a basis for our Standard Operating Procedures (&#8220;SOPs&#8221;) where applicable. On an ongoing basis, we endeavor to standardize SOPs across all relevant operations. We have both developed and purchased software to ensure compliant documentation, handling and reporting of laboratory-generated study data.

&#160;

We use 21 CFR Part 11 (FDA guidelines on electronic records and electronic signatures that define the criteria under which electronic records and electronic signatures are considered to be trustworthy, reliable and equivalent to paper records). Our contract research operations were compliant with applicable US FDA regulations (including 21 CFR Part 11) in our analytical, bioanalytical, toxicology, lab information management, and document management systems. Systems compliant with 21 CFR Part 11 were formally validated and released for use in regulated studies.

&#160;

We manage our business systems through the use of an Enterprise Resource Planning (&#34;ERP&#34;) system. We are continually refining and adjusting our ERP system to improve efficiency, provide better management tools and address changes in our business. These changes are appropriately documented and tested before implementation. We also test these systems in connection with management&#8217;s annual review of our internal control systems. Management&#8217;s assessment and report on internal controls over financial reporting is included in Item 9A.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Controlled, Hazardous, and Environmentally Threatening Substances 

&#160;

Some of our development and testing activities are subject to the Controlled Substances Act administered by the Drug Enforcement Agency (&#34;DEA&#34;), which strictly regulates all narcotic and habit-forming substances. We maintain restricted-access facilities and heightened control procedures for projects involving such substances due to the level of security and other controls required by the DEA. In addition, we are subject to other federal and state regulations concerning such matters as occupational safety and health and protection of the environment.

&#160;

Our laboratories are subject to licensing and regulation under federal, state and local laws relating to hazard communication and employee right-to-know regulations, the handling and disposal of medical specimens and hazardous waste, as well as the safety and health of laboratory employees. All of our laboratories are subject to applicable federal and state laws and regulations relating to the storage and disposal of laboratory specimens, including regulations of the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Transportation, the National Fire Protection Agency and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. Although we believe that we are currently in compliance in all material respects with such federal, state and local laws, failure to comply could subject us to denial of the right to conduct business, fines, criminal penalties and other enforcement actions.

&#160;

The regulations of the U.S. Department of Transportation, the U.S. Public Health Service and the U.S. Postal Service apply to the surface and air transportation of laboratory specimens. Our laboratories also comply with the International Air Transport Association regulations which govern international shipments of laboratory specimens. Furthermore, when materials are sent to a foreign country, the transportation of such materials becomes subject to the laws, rules and regulations of such foreign country.

&#160; 

Safety 

&#160;

In addition to comprehensive regulation of safety in the workplace, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration has established extensive requirements relating to workplace safety for health care employers whose workers may be exposed to blood-borne pathogens such as HIV and the hepatitis B virus. These regulations, among other things, require work practice controls, protective clothing and equipment, training, medical follow-up, vaccinations and other measures designed to minimize exposure to chemicals, and transmission of blood-borne and airborne pathogens. Furthermore, relevant employees receive initial and periodic training focusing on compliance with applicable hazardous materials regulations and health and safety guidelines.

&#160; 

HIPAA 

&#160;

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has promulgated final regulations under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (&#34;HIPAA&#34;) that govern the disclosure of confidential medical information in the United States. We have had a global privacy policy in place since January 2001 and believe that we are in compliance with HIPAA and current European Union requirements regarding confidential medical information. We continue to monitor our compliance with these regulations, and we intend to take appropriate steps to ensure compliance as these and other privacy regulations are revised or additional regulations come into effect.

&#160;

Product Liability and Insurance 

&#160;

We maintain product liability and professional errors and omissions liability insurance, providing coverage on a claims-made basis. Additionally, in certain circumstances, we seek to manage our liability risk through contractual provisions to be indemnified by the customer or covered by the customer&#8217;s liability insurance policies. Also, in certain types of engagements, we seek to limit our contractual liability to customers to the amount of fees received. The contractual arrangements are subject to negotiation with customers, and the terms and scope of such indemnification, liability limitation and insurance coverage vary by customer and project.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Research and Development 

&#160;

In fiscal 2016 and 2015, we spent $496 thousand and $715 thousand, respectively, on research and development. Separate from our contract research services business, we maintain applications research and development to enhance our products business. Expenditures cover hardware and software engineering costs, laboratory supplies, labor, prototype development and laboratory demonstrations of new products and applications for those products.

&#160;

Intellectual Property 

&#160;

We believe that our patents, trademarks, copyrights and other proprietary rights are important to our business. Accordingly, we actively seek protection for those rights both in the United States and abroad. Where we deem it to be an appropriate course of action, we will vigorously prosecute patent infringements. The loss of any one or more of our patents, trademarks, copyrights or other proprietary rights could be material to our consolidated revenues or earnings.

&#160;

We currently hold four U.S. federally registered trademarks. We also have two issued U.S. patents on the Dried Blood Spot (DBS) sampling card for the Culex &#174; Automated Blood Sampling Instrumentation . There are also pending international patent applications for this technology in Japan, Canada, and Europe. Additionally, we have three issued U.S. patents and one pending application for the No Blood Waste technology for the Culex &#174; instrument. There are thirteen issued international patents for this technology in Europe, Japan and Canada. There are two additional issued U.S. patents and fifteen issued international patents in Germany, Denmark, Europe, Spain, France, Great Britain, Japan, Sweden, and Switzerland relating to the Raturn&#174; technology which can be used with the Culex &#174; system; two issued U.S. patents and one issued Canadian patent relating to pinch valve technology; one pending U.S. patent application and thirteen pending international patent applications in Canada, Japan and Europe relating to a tube assembly system that could potentially be used in the Culex &#174; system.

&#160;

Our issued patents are protected for durations ranging from April of 2017 to October of 2031. In addition to these formal intellectual property rights, we rely on trade secrets, unpatented know-how and continuing applications research which we seek to protect through means of reasonable business procedures, such as confidentiality agreements.

&#160;

Raw Materials 

&#160;

There are no specialized raw materials that are particularly essential to our business. We have a variety of alternative suppliers for the components in our products.

&#160;

Employees 

&#160;

At September 30, 2016, we had 145 full-time employees and 6 part-time employees. All employees enter into confidentiality agreements intended to protect our proprietary information. We believe that our relations with our employees are good. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. Our performance depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified professional, scientific and technical staff. The level of competition among employers for skilled personnel is high. We believe that our employee benefit plans enhance employee morale, professional commitment and work productivity and provide an incentive for employees to remain with the Company.
