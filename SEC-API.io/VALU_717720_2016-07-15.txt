 Item 1. BUSINESS. 

&#160; 

Value Line, Inc. is a New York corporation headquartered in New York City and formed in 1982. The Company&#39;s core business is producing investment periodicals based on underlying research and making available copyright data, including certain Proprietary Ranking System and other proprietary information, to third parties under written agreements for use in third-party managed and marketed investment products and for other purposes. Value Line markets under well-known brands including Value Line &#174; , the Value Line logo&#174;, The Value Line Investment Survey &#174; , Smart Research, Smarter Investing&#8482; and The Most Trusted Name in Investment Research &#174; . The name "Value Line" as used to describe the Company, its products, and its subsidiaries, is a registered trademark of the Company. Prior to December 23, 2010, (see &#8220;Asset Management and Mutual Fund Distribution Businesses&#8221; below), the Company provided investment management services to the Value Line Mutual Funds ("Value Line Funds"), institutional and individual accounts and provided distribution, marketing, and administrative services to the Value Line Funds. Since December 23, 2010, EULAV Asset Management Trust (&#8220;EAM&#8221;) provides the investment management services to the Value Line Funds accounts and provides distribution, marketing, and administrative services to the Value Line Funds. Value Line holds substantial non-voting revenues and non-voting profits interests in EAM. 

&#160; 

The Company is the successor to substantially all of the operations of Arnold Bernhard &#38; Company, Inc. ("AB&#38;Co."). AB&#38;Co. is the controlling shareholder of the Company and, as of April 30, 2016, owns 88.5% of the outstanding shares of the common stock of the Company. 

&#160; 

Asset Management and Mutual Fund Distribution Businesses 

&#160; 

The Company completed a restructuring of its asset management and mutual fund distribution businesses (the &#8220;Restructuring Transaction&#8221;) on December 23, 2010 (the &#8220;Restructuring Date&#8221;) and executed the EAM Declaration of Trust (the &#8220;EAM Declaration of Trust&#8221;). Pursuant to the EAM Declaration of Trust, the Company received an interest in certain revenues of EAM and a portion of the residual profits of EAM but has no voting authority with respect to the election or removal of the trustees of EAM. 

&#160; 

The business of EAM is managed by five individual trustees and a Delaware resident trustee (collectively, the &#8220;Trustees&#8221;) and by its officers subject to the direction of the Trustees. 

&#160; 

Collectively, the holders of the voting profits interests in EAM are entitled to receive 50% of the residual profits of the business, subject to temporary adjustments in certain circumstances. Value Line holds a non-voting profits interest representing 50% of residual profits, subject to temporary adjustments in certain circumstances, and has no power to vote for the election, removal or replacement of the trustees of EAM. Value Line also has a non-voting revenues interest in EAM pursuant to which it is entitled to receive a portion of the non-distribution revenues of the business ranging from 41% at non-distribution fee revenue levels of $9 million or less to 55% at such revenue levels of $35 million or more. In the event the business is sold or liquidated, the first $56.1 million of net proceeds (the value of the business at the time the Restructuring Transaction was approved as determined by the directors of Value Line after reviewing a valuation report by the directors&#8217; financial advisors) plus any additional capital contributions (Value Line or any holder of a voting profits interest, at its discretion, may make future contributions to its capital account in EAM), which contributions would increase its capital account but not its percentage interest in operating profits, will be distributed in accordance with capital accounts; 20% of the next $56.1 million will be distributed to the holders of the voting profits interests and 80% to the holder of the non-voting profits interests (currently, Value Line); and the excess will be distributed 45% to the holders of the voting profits interests and 55% to the holder of the non-voting profits interest (Value Line). EAM has elected to be taxed as a pass-through entity similar to a partnership. 

&#160; 

Also, in connection with the Restructuring Transaction and pursuant to the EAM Declaration of Trust, Value Line (1) granted each Fund use of the name &#8220;Value Line&#8221; so long as EAM remains the Fund&#8217;s adviser and on the condition that the Fund does not alter its investment objectives or fundamental policies from those in effect on the date of the investment advisory agreement with EAM, provided also that the Funds do not use leverage for investment purposes or engage in short selling or other complex or unusual investment strategies that create a risk profile similar to that of so-called hedge funds, (2) agreed to provide EAM its proprietary Ranking System information without charge or expense on as favorable basis as to Value Line&#8217;s best institutional customers and (3) agreed to capitalize the business with $7 million of cash and cash equivalents at inception. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#160; 

EAM is organized as a Delaware statutory trust and has no fixed term. However, in the event that control of the Company&#8217;s majority shareholder changes, or in the event that the majority shareholder no longer beneficially owns 5% or more of the voting securities of the Company, then the Company has the right, but not the obligation, to buy the voting profits interests in EAM at a fair market value to be determined by an independent valuation firm in accordance with the terms of the EAM Declaration of Trust. 

&#160; 

Value Line also has certain consent rights with respect to extraordinary events involving EAM, such as a proposed sale of all or a significant part of EAM, material acquisitions, entering into businesses other than asset management and fund distribution, paying compensation in excess of the mandated limit of 22.5%-30% of non-distribution fee revenues (depending on the level of such revenues), declaring voluntary bankruptcy, making material changes in tax or accounting policies or making substantial borrowings, and entering into related party transactions. These rights were established to protect Value Line&#8217;s non-voting revenues and non-voting profits interests in EAM. 

&#160; 

A. Investment Related Periodicals &#38; Publications 

&#160; 

The investment periodicals and related publications offered by Value Line Publishing LLC (&#8220;VLP&#8221;), a wholly-owned entity of the Company, cover a broad spectrum of investments including stocks, mutual funds, ETFs, options and convertible securities. The Company&#8217;s periodicals and related publications and services are of interest to individual and professional investors, as well as to institutions including municipal and university libraries and investment firms. 

The services generally fall into four categories: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Comprehensive reference periodical publications 

&#160; &#9679; 

Targeted, niche periodical newsletters 

&#160; &#9679; 

Investment analysis software 

&#160; &#9679; 

Current and historical financial databases 

&#160; 

The comprehensive research services ( The Value Line Investment Survey, The Value Line Investment Survey - Small and Mid-Cap, The Value Line 600, The Value Line Small &#38; Mid-Cap 300, and The Value Line Fund Advisor Plus ) provide both statistical and text coverage of a large number of investment securities, with an emphasis placed on Value Line&#8217;s proprietary research, analysis and statistical ranks. The Value Line Investment Survey is the Company&#8217;s flagship service, published each week in print and daily on the web, and covering approximately 1,700 stocks. 

&#160; 

The niche newsletters ( Value Line Select &#174;, Value Line Select : Dividend Income &#38; Growth , and The Value Line Special Situations Service &#174;) provide information on a less comprehensive basis for securities that the Company believes will be of particular interest to subscribers. These services also make use of Value Line&#8217;s proprietary statistical ranks. Value Line Select &#174; is a targeted service with an emphasis on Value Line&#8217;s proprietary in-depth research analysis and statistical selections, highlighting a monthly stock with strong return potential and reasonable risk. Value Line Select : Dividend Income &#38; Growth represents Value Line&#39;s targeted coverage of high dividend yielding stocks. The Value Line Special Situations Service provides in-depth research analysis on small and mid-cap stocks. 

&#160; &#160; &#160; 

Value Line offers digital versions of most of its products through the Company&#8217;s website, www.valueline.com. Subscribers to the print versions have, in some cases, received free access to the corresponding digital versions, although digital subscribers do not receive a free print edition. The most comprehensive of the Company&#8217;s online efforts are The Value Line Research Center and its variations, which allow subscribers to access most of the Company&#8217;s research and publications at a packaged price via the Internet. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Investment analysis software ( The Value Line Investment Analyzer and The Value Line Mutual Fund Survey for Windows &#174; ) includes data sorting and filtering tools. In addition, for institutional and professional subscribers, VLP offers current and historical financial databases ( DataFile, Estimates &#38; Projections, Convertibles and Mutual Funds ) via online. 

&#160; 

The print and digital services include, but are not limited to the following: 

&#160; 

The Value Line Investment Survey 

&#160; 

The Value Line Investment Survey is an investment periodical research service providing both timely articles on economic, financial and investment matters and analysis and ranks for equity securities. Two of the evaluations for covered equity securities are "Timeliness&#8482;" and "Safety&#8482;.&#8221; &#8220;Timeliness&#8221; Ranks relate to the probable relative price performance of one stock over the next six to twelve months, as compared to the rest of the approximately 1,700 stocks covered. Ranks are updated each week and range from Rank 1 for the expected best performing stocks to Rank 5 for the expected poorest performers. "Safety" Ranks are a measure of risk and are based on the issuer&#39;s relative Financial Strength and its stock&#39;s Price Stability. "Safety" ranges from Rank 1 for the least risky stocks to Rank 5 for the riskiest. VLP employs analysts and statisticians who prepare articles of interest for each periodical and who evaluate stock performance and provide future earnings estimates and quarterly written evaluations with more frequent updates when relevant. The Value Line Investment Survey is comprised of three parts: The " Summary &#38; Index " provides updated Timeliness and Safety Ranks, selected financial data, and "screens" of key financial measures; the " Ratings &#38; Reports " section contains updated reports on about 130 stocks each week; and the &#8220; Selection &#38; Opinion &#8221; section provides economic commentary and data, general interest articles, and four model portfolios managed by analysts covering a range of investment approaches. 

&#160; 

The Value Line Investment Survey - Small and Mid-Cap 

&#160; 

The Value Line Investment Survey - Small and Mid-Cap is an investment research product introduced in 1995 that provides short descriptions of and extensive data for approximately 1,800 small and medium-capitalization stocks, many listed on The NASDAQ Exchange, beyond the approximately 1,700 equity securities of generally larger-capitalization companies covered in The Value Line Investment Survey . Like The Value Line Investment Survey , the Small and Mid-Cap has its own " Summary &#38; Index " providing updated performance ranks and other data, as well as "screens" of key financial measures and two model portfolios. The " Ratings and Reports " section, providing updated reports on about 140 equity securities each week, has been organized to correspond closely to the industries reviewed in The Value Line Investment Survey . One unique feature of the Small and Mid-Cap is The Performance Ranking System, which incorporates many of the elements of the Value Line Timeliness Ranking System, modified to accommodate the approximately 1,800 equity securities in the Small and Mid-Cap Survey . The Performance Rank is based on earnings growth and price momentum, and is designed to predict relative price performance over the next six to twelve months. The principal differences between the Small and Mid-Cap Survey and The Value Line Investment Survey are that the Small and Mid-Cap Survey does not include Value Line&#8217;s Timeliness Ranks, financial forecasts, analyst commentary, or a Selection &#38; Opinion section. These modifications allow VLP to offer this service at a lower price. 

&#160; 

The Value Line Fund Advisor 

&#160; 

The Value Line Mutual Fund Ranking System was introduced in 1993. It is the system utilized in the Fund Advisor product, a 48-page newsletter featuring load, no-load, and low-load open-end mutual funds. This product was originally introduced as The Value Line No-Load Fund Advisor in 1994 and augmented in 2009. Each issue offers strategies for maximizing total return, and highlights of specific mutual funds. It also includes information about retirement planning and industry news. A full statistical review, including latest performance, ranks, and sector weightings, is updated each month on approximately 800 leading load, no-load and low-load funds. Included with this product is online access to Value Line&#8217;s database of more than 12,000 mutual funds, including screening tools and full-page printable reports on each fund. Fund Advisor Plus subscribers have access to the entire population of up to approximately 20,000 funds. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

The Value Line Special Situations Service 

&#160; 

The Value Line Special Situations Service &#8217;s core focus is on smaller companies whose equity securities are perceived by Value Line&#8217;s analysts as having exceptional appreciation potential. This publication was introduced in 1951. A second portfolio of stocks for more conservative investors seeking small company exposure was added in 2009. 

&#160; 

The Value Line Options Survey 

&#160; 

The Value Line Options Survey is an online only service that evaluates and ranks approximately 200,000 U.S. equity and equity index options. Features include an interactive database, spreadsheet tools, and a weekly email newsletter. This product is only offered as an online subscription due to the volatility in pricing of options. 

&#160; 

The Value Line Convertibles Survey 

&#160; 

Introduced in 1972, this service evaluates and ranks over 550 convertible securities (bonds and preferred stocks) for future market performance. In fiscal 2010, The Value Line Convertibles Survey became an online only service. By moving to online only delivery, all of the service&#8217;s subscribers benefit from an enhanced website that includes daily price updates, individual analysis of each security with a printable fact sheet, and a weekly email newsletter alerting subscribers to recent rank changes. 

&#160; 

Value Line Select 

&#160; 

Value Line Select , is a monthly stock selection service and was first published in 1998. It focuses each month on a single company that the Value Line Research Department has selected from a group of high-quality companies whose stocks are viewed as having a superior risk/reward ratio. Recommendations are backed by in-depth research and are subject to ongoing monitoring by research personnel. 

&#160; 

Value Line Select: Dividend Income &#38; Growth 

&#160; 

Value Line Select: Dividend Income &#38; Growth (formerly Value Line Dividend Select ), a monthly stock selection service, was introduced in June 2011. This product focuses on companies with dividend yields greater than the average of all stocks covered by Value Line, with a preference for companies that have consistently increased their dividends above the rate of inflation over the longer term and, based on Value Line analysis, have the financial strength both to support and increase dividend payments in the future. Value Line Select: Dividend Income and Growth is available online and in print. 

&#160; 

The Value Line 600 

&#160; 

The Value Line 600 is a monthly publication, which contains full-page research reports on approximately 600 equity securities. Its reports provide information on many actively traded, larger capitalization issues as well as some smaller growth stocks. As a lower priced service, it offers investors who want the same type of analysis provided in The Value Line Investment Survey , but who do not want or need coverage of the approximately 1,700 companies covered by that product a suitable alternative. In fiscal 2016, most retail marketing and new orders in terms of numbers were accounted for by The Value Line 600 service. Readers also receive supplemental reports as well as a monthly Index, which includes updated statistics, including proprietary ranks and ratings. A model portfolio, delivered via a weekly email newsletter, was added to this service in January 2015. 

&#160; 

The Value Line Small &#38; Mid-Cap 300 and Investor 900 

&#160; 

In January 2016, we launched The Value Line Small &#38; M id-Cap 300. It is a monthly publication and details a select group of about 300 of the approximately 1,700 companies that comprise The Value Line Investment Survey. The 300 company reports included in this service are a smaller selection of the same full-page reports that are published in The Value Line Investment Survey . The 300 stocks all have market capitalizations of under $5.0 billion, and most industries are represented by at least two stocks. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Although the 300 can be purchased separately, our main goal is to provide this service to current Value Line 600 subscribers, who are predominantly receiving research on only larger cap stocks. Thus, the 300 is a companion service to the 600. When 600 subscribers add the 300 service, they are then subscribed to the print Value Line 900 or on the web The Value Line Investment Survey - Investor 900 . In addition to the stock reports, 900 subscribers receive monthly Summary &#38; Index sections, which include updated company statistics, screens, and Supplementary Reports. The online 900 service provides many of our updates on a more timely basis, and two model portfolios are delivered via weekly email newsletters. &#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; Value Line Investment Analyzer 

&#160; 

Value Line Investment Analyzer is a powerful menu-driven software program with fast filtering, ranking, reporting and graphing capabilities utilizing more than 230 data fields for various industries and indices and for the approximately 1,700 stocks covered in VLP&#8217;s flagship publication, The Value Line Investment Survey . Value Line Investment Analyzer allows subscribers to apply numerous charting and graphing variables for comparative research. In addition to containing digital replicas of the entire Value Line Investment Survey , the Value Line Investment Analyzer includes 20-minute delayed data updates through its integration with the Value Line databases via the Internet.

B. Copyright Data Fees Programs 

&#160; 

The Company has copyright data, which include certain proprietary Ranking System information and other proprietary information made available for use in third party products, such as unit investment trusts, variable annuities, managed accounts and exchange traded funds, which it distributes under copyright data agreements. The sponsors of these products act as wholesalers and distribute the products generally by syndicating them through an extensive network of national and regional brokerage firms. The sponsors of these products will typically receive copyright data for one or more proprietary ranking systems, which may include Value Line Timeliness, Safety, Technical and Performance ranks, as screens for their portfolios. The sponsors are also given permission to associate Value Line&#8217;s trademarks with the products. Value Line collects a copyright fee from each of the product sponsors/managers primarily based upon the market value of assets invested in each product&#8217;s portfolio utilizing the Value Line proprietary data. Since these fees are based on the market value of the respective portfolios using the Value Line proprietary data, the payments to Value Line, which are typically received on a quarterly basis, will fluctuate. 

&#160; 

Value Line&#8217;s primary copyright data products are structured as ETFs, Unit Investment Trusts, variable annuity products and separately managed accounts, all of which have in common some degree of reliance on the Value Line Ranking System for their portfolio creation. These products are offered and distributed by independent sponsors. 

&#160;

&#160; 

C. Investment Management Services 

&#160; 

Until December 23, 2010, the Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary EAM LLC, was the investment adviser for the Value Line Funds. Since December 23, 2010, EAM has acted as the Adviser to the Value Line Funds. 

&#160; 

Until December 23, 2010, the Company through its wholly-owned subsidiary ESI, was the distributor for the Value Line Funds. Since December 23, 2010, EULAV Securities has acted as the Distributor for the Value Line Funds. State Street Bank, an unaffiliated entity, is the custodian of the assets of the Value Line Funds and provides them with fund accounting and administrative services. Shareholder services for the Value Line Funds are provided by Boston Financial Data Services, an affiliate of State Street Bank. 

&#160; 

On December 23, 2010, the Company deconsolidated its asset management and mutual fund distribution businesses and its interests in these businesses were restructured as non-voting revenues and non-voting profits interests in EAM. Accordingly, the Company no longer reports this operation as a separate business segment, although it still maintains a significant interest in the cash flows generated by this business and will continue to receive ongoing payments in respect of its non-voting revenues and non-voting profits interests, as discussed below. Total assets in the Value Line Funds managed and/or distributed by EAM at April 30, 2016, were $2.2 billion, which is $128 million, or 5.4%, below total assets of $2.4 billion in the Value Line Funds managed and/or distributed by EAM at April 30, 2015. 

&#160; &#160; 

Total net assets of the Value Line Funds at April 30, 2016, were:

Investment management fees and distribution service fees (which we refer to as &#8220;12b-1fees&#8221;) vary among the Value Line Funds and may be subject to certain limitations. Certain investment strategies among the equity funds include, but are not limited to, reliance on the Value Line Timeliness &#8482; Ranking System (the &#8220;Ranking System&#8221;) and/or the Value Line Performance Ranking System in selecting securities for purchase or sale. The Ranking System for Timeliness compares an estimate of the probable market performance of each stock during the next six to twelve months to that of all of the approximately 1,700 stocks under review and ranks stocks on a scale of 1 (highest) to 5 (lowest). All the stocks followed by the Ranking System are listed on U.S. stock exchanges or traded in the U.S. over-the-counter markets. Prospectuses and annual reports for each of the Value Line open end mutual funds are available on the Funds&#8217; website www.vlfunds.com . Each mutual fund may use "Value Line" in its name only to the extent permitted by the terms of the EAM Declaration of Trust.

H. Principal Business Segments 

&#160; 

The information with respect to revenues from external customers and profit and loss of the Company&#39;s identifiable principal business segments is incorporated herein by reference to Note 15 of the Notes to the Company&#39;s Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K. 

&#160; 

Prior to December 23, 2010, the Company&#8217;s businesses consolidated into two reportable business segments. The investment periodicals and related publications (retail and institutional) and fees from copyright data, including the proprietary Ranking System information and other proprietary information, consolidated into one segment called Publishing, and the investment management services to the Value Line Funds and other managed accounts were consolidated into a second business segment called Investment Management. Subsequent to December 23, 2010, the Publishing segment constitutes the Company&#8217;s only reportable business segment. 

&#160; 

I. Competition 

&#160; 

The investment information and publishing business conducted by the Company and the investment management business conducted by EAM are very competitive. There are many competing firms and a wide variety of product offerings. Some of the firms in these industries are substantially larger and have greater financial resources than the Company and EAM. The Internet continues to increase the amount of competition in the form of free and paid online investment research. With regard to the investment management business conducted by EAM, the prevalence of broker supermarkets or platforms permitting easy transfer of assets among mutual funds, mutual fund families, and other investment vehicles tends to increase the speed with which shareholders can leave or enter the Value Line Funds based, among other things, on short term fluctuations in performance. 

&#160;
