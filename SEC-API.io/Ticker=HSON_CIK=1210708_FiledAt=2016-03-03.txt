On June 15, 2015, the Company completed the sale of substantially all of the assets (excluding working capital) of its Hudson Information Technology (US) business (the "US IT business") to Mastech, Inc. As a result, the Company no longer has an Americas' Information Technology temporary contracting practice. The Company also completed the sale of its Netherlands business to InterBalanceGroup BV effective April 30, 2015. The results of both the US IT business and Netherlands were included in the Company's continuing operations as they did not meet the criteria for discontinued operations under the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") No. 205, "Presentation of Financial Statements." 

On November 7, 2014, the Company completed the sale of substantially all of the assets and liabilities of its Legal eDiscovery business in the United States and United Kingdom. The Company no longer has operations in the Legal eDiscovery business. In addition, the Company ceased operations in Sweden, which was included within the Hudson Europe segment during the third quarter of 2014. The Company concluded that the divestiture of its Legal eDiscovery business and the cessation of operations in Sweden meet the criteria for discontinued operations set forth in ASC No. 205, &#32;"Presentation of Financial Statements." &#32;The Company reclassified its discontinued operations for all periods presented and has excluded the results from continuing operations and from segment results for all periods presented.
