&#160; 

Introduction 

&#160; 

First Busey Corporation (&#147;First Busey&#148; or the &#147;Company&#148;), a Nevada Corporation, is a $4.0 billion financial holding company which was initially organized as a bank holding company in 1980. First Busey conducts a broad range of financial services through its banking and non-banking subsidiaries at multiple locations in Illinois, Florida, Indiana and Missouri. First Busey has one wholly-owned bank subsidiary, Busey Bank (&#147;Busey Bank&#148; or the &#147;Bank&#148;), which has locations in Illinois, Indiana and Florida. First Busey is headquartered in Champaign, Illinois, and its common stock is traded on The Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol &#147;BUSE.&#148; 

&#160; 

On January 8, 2015, First Busey acquired Herget Financial Corp. (&#147;Herget Financial&#148;), headquartered in Pekin, Illinois and its wholly-owned bank subsidiary, Herget Bank, National Association (&#147;Herget Bank&#148;). First Busey operated Herget Bank as a separate banking subsidiary from January 9, 2015 until March 13, 2015, when it was merged with and into Busey Bank. At that time, Herget Bank&#146;s branches in Pekin, Illinois became branches of Busey Bank. The operating results of Herget Financial are included with the Company&#146;s results of operations since the date of acquisition. See &#147; Note 2 &#151;Acquisitions &#148; in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information relating to this acquisition. 

&#160; 

On May 20, 2015, the Company&#146;s stockholders approved a resolution to authorize the board of directors to implement a reverse stock split of the Company&#146;s common stock at a ratio of one-for-three (the &#147;Reverse Stock Split&#148;). On August 17, 2015, the board of directors authorized the Reverse Stock Split, which became effective on September 8, 2015. All share and per share information has been restated for all prior periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to give retroactive effect to the Reverse Stock Split. 

&#160; 

On December 3, 2015, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the &#147;Merger Agreement&#148;) with Pulaski Financial Corp., a Missouri corporation (&#147;Pulaski&#148;), pursuant to which Pulaski will merge into First Busey, with First Busey as the surviving corporation (the &#147;Merger&#148;). It is anticipated that Pulaski Bank, National Association, Pulaski&#146;s wholly-owned bank subsidiary (&#147;Pulaski Bank&#148;), will be merged with and into Busey Bank, at a date following the completion of the holding company merger. At the time of the bank merger, Pulaski Bank&#146;s branches will become branches of Busey Bank. As of December 31, 2015, Pulaski had total consolidated assets of $1.65 billion, total loans of $1.41 billion and total deposits of $1.21 billion. The Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago has approved the Merger and it is anticipated to be completed in the first half of 2016, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions in the Merger Agreement and the approval of the stockholders of both Pulaski and First Busey. See &#147; Note 2 &#151;Acquisitions &#148; in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information relating to this acquisition.

&#160; 

Economic Conditions of Markets 

&#160; 

Our primary markets, which are generally in micro-urban communities in downstate Illinois, are distinct from the smaller rural populations of Illinois and have strong industrial, academic or healthcare employment bases. Our primary downstate Illinois markets of Champaign, Macon, McLean and Peoria counties are anchored by several strong, familiar and stable organizations. 

&#160; 

Champaign County is home to the University of Illinois &#151; Urbana/Champaign (&#147;U of I&#148;), the University&#146;s primary campus. U of I has in excess of 44,000 students. Additionally, Champaign County healthcare providers serve a significant area of downstate Illinois and western Indiana. Macon County is home to the North American headquarters for Archer Daniels Midland (&#147;ADM&#148;), a Fortune 100 company and one of the largest agricultural processors in the world. ADM&#146;s presence in Macon County supports many derivative businesses in the agricultural processing arena. Additionally, Macon County is home to Millikin University, and its healthcare providers serve a significant role in the market. McLean County is home to State Farm, Country Financial, Illinois State University and Illinois Wesleyan University. State Farm, a Fortune 100 company, is the largest employer in McLean County, and Country Financial and the universities provide additional stability to a growing area of downstate Illinois. Peoria County is home to Caterpillar, a Fortune 100 company, and Bradley University, in addition to a large healthcare presence serving much of the western portion of downstate Illinois. Caterpillar announced significant restructuring and cost cutting initiatives that began in the third quarter of 2015 and while no substantial direct exposure exists, we will continue to monitor the potential impact to the surrounding community and our customers. The institutions noted above, coupled with a large agricultural sector, anchor the communities in which they are located, and have provided a comparatively stable foundation for housing, employment and small business. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

The State of Illinois, where the largest portion of the Company&#146;s customer base is located, continues to be one of the most troubled of any state in the United States with pension under-funding, a current budget impasse, continued budget deficits and a declining credit outlook. Additionally, the Company is located in markets with significant universities and healthcare companies, which rely heavily on state funding and contracts. A temporary income tax increase passed in 2011 began phasing out in 2015, which may affect the State&#146;s revenue. Payment lapses by the State of Illinois to its vendors and government sponsored entities may have negative effects on our primary market areas. 

&#160; 

During 2015, downward pressure on commodity prices were muted in many areas by above average yields of corn and soybeans in local markets in Illinois. Loans to finance agricultural production and other loans to farmers do not represent a significant portion of our total loan portfolio, with balances of $60.6 million or approximately 2.3% of total loans as of December 31, 2015. Additionally, loans secured by farmland totaled $131.3 million or approximately 5.0% of total loans for the same period. The financial condition of these customers and the agriculture base in our communities is monitored by management on an ongoing basis as appropriate for prudent risk management. 

&#160; 

The Company has one banking center in the Indianapolis, Indiana area, which is the most populous city of Indiana with a diverse economy. Many large corporations are headquartered in Indianapolis and it is the host to numerous conventions and sporting events annually. 

&#160; 

The Company has six banking centers in southwest Florida. Southwest Florida has shown continuing signs of improvement in areas such as job growth and the housing market over the last few years. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

The Bank competes actively with national and state banks, savings and loan associations and credit unions for deposits and loans mainly in downstate Illinois (primarily Champaign, Ford, Livingston, Macon, McLean, Peoria, and Shelby counties), southwest Florida (primarily Charlotte, Lee and Sarasota counties), and central Indiana (primarily Hamilton and Marion counties). In addition, First Busey and its non-bank subsidiaries compete with other financial institutions, including asset management and trust companies, security broker/dealers, personal loan companies, insurance companies, finance companies, leasing companies, mortgage companies, remittance processing companies, and certain governmental agencies, all of which actively engage in marketing various types of loans, deposit accounts, and other products and services. The Bank competes for real estate and other loans primarily on the basis of the interest rates and loan fees it charges, the types of loans it originates and the quality of services it provides to borrowers. 

&#160; 

The Bank faces substantial competition in attracting deposits from other commercial banks, savings institutions, money market and mutual funds, credit unions, insurance agencies, brokerage firms, and other investment vehicles. The ability of the Bank to attract and retain deposits depends on its ability to provide investment opportunities that satisfy the requirements of investors as to rate of return, liquidity, risk and other factors. The Bank attracts a significant amount of deposits through its branch offices, primarily from the communities in which those branch offices are located; therefore, competition for those deposits is principally from other commercial banks, savings institutions, and credit unions located in the same communities. The Bank competes for these deposits by offering a variety of deposit accounts at competitive rates, high-quality customer service, convenient business hours, internet and mobile banking, and convenient branch locations with interbranch deposit and withdrawal privileges at each. 

&#160; 

Based on information obtained from FDIC Summary of Deposits dated June 30, 2015, First Busey ranked in the top ten in total deposits in eight Illinois counties: first in Champaign County; fourth in Ford County; eighth in Livingston County; second in Macon County; fifth in McLean County; ninth in Peoria County; second in Shelby County; and third in Tazewell County. Customers for banking services are generally influenced by convenience, quality of service, personal contacts, price of services and availability of products. Although the market share of First Busey varies in different markets, First Busey believes that it effectively competes with other banks, thrifts and financial institutions in the relevant market areas. 

&#160; 

Supervision, Regulation and Other Factors 

&#160; 

General 

&#160; 

Institutions insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the &#147;FDIC&#148;), like the Bank, as well as their holding companies and their affiliates, are extensively regulated under federal and state law. As a result, First Busey&#146;s growth and earnings performance may be affected not only by management decisions and general economic conditions, but also by the requirements of federal and state statutes and by the regulations and policies of various bank regulatory agencies, including the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation (the &#147;DFPR&#148;), the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the &#147;Federal Reserve&#148;), the FDIC, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the &#147;OCC&#148;) (upon the anticipated acquisition of Pulaski Bank) and the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (the &#147;CFPB&#148;). 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Furthermore, taxation laws administered by the Internal Revenue Service and state taxing authorities, accounting rules developed by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#147;FASB&#148;), securities laws administered by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#147;SEC&#148;) and state securities authorities, and anti-money laundering laws enforced by the U.S. Department of the Treasury (the &#147;Treasury&#148;) have an impact on the business of First Busey and the Bank. 

&#160; 

The effect of these statutes, regulations, regulatory policies and accounting rules are significant to the operations and results of First Busey and the Bank, and the nature and extent of future legislative, regulatory or other changes affecting financial institutions are impossible to predict with any certainty. 

&#160; 

Federal and state banking laws impose a comprehensive system of supervision, regulation and enforcement on the operations of FDIC-insured institutions, their holding companies and affiliates that is intended primarily for the protection of the FDIC-insured deposits and depositors of banks, rather than stockholders. These federal and state laws, and the regulations of the bank regulatory agencies issued under them, affect, among other things, the scope of First Busey&#146;s business, the kinds and amounts of investments they may make, bank reserve requirements, capital levels relative to assets, the nature and amount of collateral for loans, the establishment of branches, First Busey&#146;s ability to merge, consolidate and acquire, dealings with insiders and affiliates and the Bank&#146;s payment of dividends. In the last several years, First Busey and the Bank have experienced heightened regulatory requirements and scrutiny following the global financial crisis and as a result of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the &#147;Dodd-Frank Act&#148;). Although the reforms primarily targeted systemically important financial service providers, their influence filtered down in varying degrees to community banks over time, and the reforms have caused First Busey&#146;s compliance and risk management processes, and the costs thereof, to increase. 

&#160; 

This supervisory and regulatory framework subjects FDIC-insured institutions and their holding companies to regular examination by their respective regulatory agencies, which results in examination reports and ratings that are not publicly available and that can impact the conduct and growth of their business. These examinations consider not only compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but also capital levels, asset quality and risk, management ability and performance, earnings, liquidity, and various other factors. The regulatory agencies generally have broad discretion to impose restrictions and limitations on the operations of a regulated entity where the agencies determine, among other things, that such operations are unsafe or unsound, fail to comply with applicable law or are otherwise inconsistent with laws and regulations or with the supervisory policies of these agencies. 

&#160; 

The following is a summary of the material elements of the supervisory and regulatory framework applicable to First Busey and the Bank, beginning with a discussion of the continuing regulatory emphasis on capital levels. It does not describe all of the statutes, regulations and regulatory policies that apply, nor does it restate all of the requirements of those that are described. The descriptions are qualified in their entirety by reference to the particular statutory and regulatory provision. 

&#160; 

Regulatory Emphasis on Capital 

&#160; 

Regulatory capital represents the net assets of a banking organization available to absorb losses. Because of the risks attendant to their business, FDIC-insured institutions are generally required to hold more capital than other businesses, which directly affects First Busey&#146;s earnings capabilities. Although capital has historically been one of the key measures of the financial health of banks, its role became fundamentally more important in the wake of the global financial crisis, as the banking regulators recognized that the amount and quality of capital held by banks prior to the crisis was insufficient to absorb losses during periods of severe stress. Certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and Basel III, discussed below, establish strengthened capital standards for banking organizations, require more capital to be held in the form of common stock and disallow certain funds from being included in capital determinations. These standards represent regulatory capital requirements that are meaningfully more stringent than those in place previously. 

&#160; 

Minimum Required Capital Levels 

&#160; 

Bank holding companies have historically had to comply with less stringent capital standards than their bank subsidiaries and have been able to raise capital with hybrid instruments such as trust preferred securities. The Dodd-Frank Act mandated that the Federal Reserve establish minimum capital levels for holding companies on a consolidated basis as stringent as those required for FDIC-insured institutions. As a consequence, the components of holding company permanent capital known as &#147;Tier 1 Capital&#148; were restricted to those capital instruments that were considered Tier 1 Capital for FDIC-insured institutions. A result of this change is that the proceeds of hybrid instruments, such as trust preferred securities, are being excluded from Tier 1 Capital over a phase-out period. However, if such securities were issued prior to May 19, 2010 by bank holding companies with less than $15 billion of assets, they may be retained, subject to certain restrictions. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Because First Busey has assets of less than $15 billion, First Busey is able to maintain its trust preferred proceeds as Tier 1 Capital but First Busey has to comply with new capital mandates in other respects and will not be able to raise Tier 1 Capital in the future through the issuance of trust preferred securities. 

&#160; 

The capital standards for First Busey and the Bank changed on January 1, 2015 to add the requirements of Basel III, discussed below. The minimum capital standards effective prior to and including December 31, 2014 were: 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; A leverage requirement, consisting of a minimum ratio of Tier 1 Capital to total adjusted average quarterly assets of 3% for the most highly-rated banks with a minimum requirement of at least 4% for all others, and

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; A risk-based capital requirement, consisting of a minimum ratio of Total Capital to total risk-weighted assets of 8% and a minimum ratio of Tier 1 Capital to total risk-weighted assets of 4%.

&#160; 

For these purposes, Tier 1 Capital consisted primarily of common stock, noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus less intangible assets (other than certain loan servicing rights and purchased credit card relationships). Total Capital consisted primarily of Tier 1 Capital plus Tier 2 Capital, which included other non-permanent capital items, such as certain other debt and equity instruments that do not qualify as Tier 1 Capital, and the Bank&#146;s allowance for loan losses, subject to a limitation of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets. Further, risk-weighted assets for the purpose of the risk-weighted ratio calculations were balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet exposures to which required risk weightings of 0% to 100% were applied. 

&#160; 

The Basel International Capital Accords 

&#160; 

The risk-based capital guidelines described above are based upon the 1988 capital accord known as &#147;Basel I&#148; adopted by the international Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, a committee of central banks and bank supervisors, as implemented by the U.S. federal banking regulators on an interagency basis. In 2008, the banking agencies collaboratively began to phase-in capital standards based on a second capital accord, referred to as &#147;Basel II,&#148; for large or &#147;core&#148; international banks (generally defined for U.S. purposes as having total assets of $250 billion or more, or consolidated foreign exposures of $10 billion or more). On September 12, 2010, the Group of Governors and Heads of Supervision, the oversight body of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, announced agreement on a strengthened set of capital requirements for banking organizations around the world, known as Basel III, to address deficiencies recognized in connection with the global financial crisis. Because of Dodd-Frank Act requirements, Basel III essentially layers a new set of capital standards on the previously existing Basel I standards. 

&#160; 

The Basel III Rule 

&#160; 

In July 2013, the U.S. federal banking agencies approved the implementation of the Basel III regulatory capital reforms in pertinent part, and, at the same time, promulgated rules effecting certain changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act (the &#147;Basel III Rule&#148;). In contrast to capital requirements historically, which were in the form of guidelines, Basel III was released in the form of regulations by each of the regulatory agencies. The Basel III Rule is applicable to all banking organizations that are subject to minimum capital requirements, including federal and state banks and savings and loan associations, as well as to bank and savings and loan holding companies, other than &#147;small bank holding companies&#148; (generally bank holding companies with consolidated assets of less than $1 billion which are not publically traded companies). 

&#160; 

The Basel III Rule not only increased most of the required minimum capital ratios effective January 1, 2015, but it introduced the concept of Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, which consists primarily of common stock, related surplus (net of treasury stock), retained earnings, and Common Equity Tier 1 minority interests subject to certain regulatory adjustments. The Basel III Rule also expanded the definition of capital by establishing more stringent criteria that instruments must meet to be considered Additional Tier 1 Capital (Tier 1 Capital in addition to Common Equity) and Tier 2 Capital. A number of instruments that qualified as Tier 1 Capital do not qualify, or their qualifications will change. For example, noncumulative perpetual preferred stock, which qualified as simple Tier 1 Capital, does not qualify as Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, but qualifies as Additional Tier 1 Capital. The Basel III Rule also constrained the inclusion of minority interests, mortgage-servicing assets, and deferred tax assets in capital and requires deductions from Common Equity Tier 1 Capital in the event that such assets exceed a certain percentage of a banking organization&#146;s Common Equity Tier 1 Capital. 

&#160; 

The Basel III Rule requires minimum capital ratios beginning January 1, 2015, as follows: 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; A new ratio of minimum Common Equity Tier 1 Capital equal to 4.5% of risk-weighted assets;

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; An increase in the minimum required amount of Tier 1 Capital to 6% of risk-weighted assets;

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; A continuation of the current minimum required amount of Total Capital (Tier 1 plus Tier 2) at 8% of risk-weighted assets; and

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; A minimum leverage ratio of Tier 1 Capital to total quarterly adjusted average assets equal to 4% in all circumstances.

&#160; 

&#160; 

Not only did the capital requirements change but the risk weightings (or their methodologies) for bank assets that are used to determine the capital ratios changed as well. For nearly every class of assets, the Basel III Rule requires a more complex, detailed and calibrated assessment of credit risk and calculation of risk weightings. 

&#160; 

Banking organizations (except for large, internationally active banking organizations) became subject to the new rules on January 1, 2015. However, there are separate phase-in/phase-out periods for: (i) the capital conservation buffer; (ii) regulatory capital adjustments and deductions; (iii) nonqualifying capital instruments; and (iv) changes to the Prompt Corrective Action rules. The phase-in periods commenced on January 1, 2016 and extend until 2019. 

&#160; 

Well-Capitalized Requirements 

&#160; 

The ratios described above are minimum standards in order for banking organizations to be considered &#147;adequately capitalized&#148; under the Prompt Corrective Action rules discussed below. Bank regulatory agencies uniformly encourage banking organizations to hold more capital and be &#147;well-capitalized&#148; and, to that end, federal law and regulations provide various incentives for such organizations to maintain regulatory capital at levels in excess of minimum regulatory requirements. For example, a banking organization that is well-capitalized may: (i) qualify for exemptions from prior notice or application requirements otherwise applicable to certain types of activities; (ii) qualify for expedited processing of other required notices or applications; and (iii) accept, roll-over or renew brokered deposits. Higher capital levels could also be required if warranted by the particular circumstances or risk profiles of individual banking organizations. Moreover, the Federal Reserve&#146;s capital guidelines contemplate that additional capital may be required to take adequate account of, among other things, interest rate risk, or the risks posed by concentrations of credit, nontraditional activities or securities trading activities. Further, any banking organization experiencing or anticipating significant growth would be expected to maintain capital ratios, including tangible capital positions ( i.e. , Tier 1 Capital less all intangible assets), well above the minimum levels. 

&#160; 

Under the capital regulations of the FDIC and Federal Reserve, in order to be well-capitalized, a banking organization must maintain: 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; A new Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio to risk-weighted assets of 6.5% or more;

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; A minimum ratio of Tier 1 Capital to total risk-weighted assets of 8% (6% under Basel I);

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; A minimum ratio of Total Capital to total risk-weighted assets of 10% (the same as Basel I); and

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; A leverage ratio of Tier 1 Capital to total quarterly adjusted average assets of 5% or greater.

&#160; 

In addition, banking organizations that seek the freedom to make capital distributions (including for dividends and repurchases of stock) and pay discretionary bonuses to executive officers without restriction must also maintain 2.5% in Common Equity Tier 1 attributable to a capital conservation buffer to be phased in over three years beginning in 2016. The purpose of the conservation buffer is to ensure that banking organizations maintain a buffer of capital that can be used to absorb losses during periods of financial and economic stress. Factoring in the fully phased-in conservation buffer increases the minimum ratios depicted above to: 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio to risk-weighted assets of 7%,

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Tier 1 Capital to total risk-weighted assets of 8.5%; and

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Total Capital to total risk-weighted assets of 10.5%.

&#160; 

It is possible under the Basel III Rule to be well-capitalized while remaining out of compliance with the capital conservation buffer. As of December 31, 2015: (i) the Bank was not subject to a directive from the FDIC to increase its capital and (ii) the Bank was well-capitalized, as defined by FDIC regulations. As of December 31, 2015, First Busey had regulatory capital in excess of the Federal Reserve&#146;s requirements and met the Basel III Rule requirements to be well-capitalized. 

&#160; 

Prompt Corrective Action 

&#160; 

An FDIC-insured institution&#146;s capital plays an important role in connection with regulatory enforcement as well. Federal law provides the federal banking regulators with broad power to take &#147;prompt corrective action&#148; to resolve the problems of undercapitalized institutions. The extent of the regulators&#146; powers depends on whether the institution in question is &#147;adequately capitalized,&#148; &#147;undercapitalized,&#148; &#147;significantly undercapitalized&#148; or &#147;critically undercapitalized,&#148; in each case as defined by regulation. Depending upon the capital category to which an institution is assigned, the regulators&#146; corrective powers include: (i) requiring the institution to submit a capital restoration plan; (ii) limiting the institution&#146;s asset growth and restricting its activities; (iii) requiring the institution to issue additional capital stock (including additional voting stock) or to sell itself; (iv) restricting transactions between the institution and its affiliates; (v) restricting the interest rate that the institution may pay on deposits; (vi) ordering a new election of directors of the institution; (vii) requiring dismissal of senior executive officers or directors; (viii) prohibiting the institution from accepting deposits from correspondent banks; (ix) requiring the institution to divest certain subsidiaries; (x) prohibiting the payment of principal or interest on subordinated debt; and (xi) ultimately, appointing a receiver for the institution. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Regulation and Supervision of First Busey 

&#160; 

General 

&#160; 

First Busey, as the sole stockholder of the Bank, is a bank holding company. It will also be the sole stockholder of Pulaski Bank when that acquisition is consummated. As a bank holding company, First Busey is registered with, and subject to regulation by, the Federal Reserve under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the &#147;BHCA&#148;). First Busey is legally obligated to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to its bank subsidiaries and to commit resources to support its banks in circumstances where it might not otherwise do so. First Busey is subject to periodic examination by the Federal Reserve and is required to file with the Federal Reserve periodic reports of its operations and such additional information regarding its operations as the Federal Reserve may require. 

&#160; 

Acquisitions, Activities and Change in Control 

&#160; 

The primary purpose of a bank holding company is to control and manage banks. The BHCA generally requires the prior approval of the Federal Reserve for any merger involving a bank holding company or any acquisition by a bank holding company of another bank or bank holding company. Subject to certain conditions (including deposit concentration limits established by the BHCA), the Federal Reserve may allow a bank holding company to acquire banks located in any state of the United States. In approving interstate acquisitions, the Federal Reserve is required to give effect to applicable state law limitations on the aggregate amount of deposits that may be held by the acquiring bank holding company and its FDIC-insured institution affiliates in the state in which the target bank is located (provided that those limits do not discriminate against out-of-state institutions or their holding companies) and state laws that require that the target bank have been in existence for a minimum period of time (not to exceed five years) before being acquired by an out-of-state bank holding company. Furthermore, in accordance with the Dodd-Frank Act, bank holding companies must be well-capitalized and well-managed in order to effect interstate mergers or acquisitions. For a discussion of the capital requirements, see &#147;Regulatory Emphasis on Capital&#148; above. 

&#160; 

The BHCA generally prohibits First Busey from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any company that is not a bank and from engaging in any business other than that of banking, managing and controlling banks or furnishing services to banks and their subsidiaries. This general prohibition is subject to a number of exceptions. The principal exception allows bank holding companies to engage in, and to own shares of companies engaged in, certain businesses found by the Federal Reserve prior to November 11, 1999 to be &#147;so closely related to banking ... as to be a proper incident thereto.&#148; This authority would permit First Busey to engage in a variety of banking-related businesses, including the ownership and operation of a savings association, or any entity engaged in consumer finance, equipment leasing, the operation of a computer service bureau (including software development) and mortgage banking and brokerage services. The BHCA does not place territorial restrictions on the domestic activities of nonbank subsidiaries of bank holding companies. 

&#160; 

Additionally, bank holding companies that meet certain eligibility requirements prescribed by the BHCA and elect to operate as financial holding companies may engage in, or own shares in companies engaged in, a wider range of nonbanking activities, including securities and insurance underwriting and sales, merchant banking and any other activity that the Federal Reserve, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, determines by regulation or order is financial in nature or incidental to any such financial activity or that the Federal Reserve determines by order to be complementary to any such financial activity and does not pose a substantial risk to the safety or soundness of FDIC-insured institutions or the financial system generally. First Busey has elected to be, and continues to operate as, a financial holding company. 

&#160; 

Federal law also prohibits any person or company from acquiring &#147;control&#148; of an FDIC-insured depository institution or its holding company without prior notice to the appropriate federal bank regulator. &#147;Control&#148; is conclusively presumed to exist upon the acquisition of 25% or more of the outstanding voting securities of a bank or bank holding company, but may arise under certain circumstances between 10% and 24.99% ownership. 

&#160; 

Capital Requirements 

&#160; 

Bank holding companies are required to maintain capital in accordance with Federal Reserve capital adequacy requirements, as impacted by the Dodd-Frank Act and Basel III. For a discussion of capital requirements, see &#147;&#151;Regulatory Emphasis on Capital&#148; above. 

&#160; 

SBLF Redemption 

&#160; 

Under the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010, the Treasury established a Small Business Lending Fund (the &#147;SBLF&#148;), a $30 billion fund that encouraged lending to small businesses by providing capital to qualified community banks with assets of less than $10 billion. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

First Busey applied for the SBLF program, was accepted, and on August 25, 2011, entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with the Treasury, pursuant to which it issued and sold to the Treasury 72,664 shares of its Senior Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series C, having a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share, for aggregate proceeds of $72.7 million. First Busey redeemed the shares on December 18, 2015 and exited the SBLF program. 

&#160; 

Dividend Payments 

&#160; 

First Busey&#146;s ability to pay dividends to its stockholders may be affected by both general corporate law considerations and the policies of the Federal Reserve applicable to bank holding companies . As a Nevada corporation, First Busey is subject to the limitations of Nevada law, which allows First Busey to pay dividends unless, after such dividend, (i) First Busey would not be able to pay its debts as they become due in the usual course of business or (ii) First Busey&#146;s total assets would be less than the sum of its total liabilities plus any amount that would be needed, if First Busey were to be dissolved at the time of the dividend payment, to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution of stockholders whose rights are superior to the rights of the stockholders receiving the distribution. 

&#160; 

As a general matter, the Federal Reserve has indicated that the board of directors of a bank holding company should eliminate, defer or significantly reduce dividends to stockholders if: (i) its net income available to stockholders for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid during that period, is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends; (ii) the prospective rate of earnings retention is inconsistent with its capital needs and overall current and prospective financial condition; or (iii) it will not meet, or is in danger of not meeting, its minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios. The Federal Reserve also possesses enforcement powers over bank holding companies and their non-bank subsidiaries to prevent or remedy actions that represent unsafe or unsound practices or violations of applicable statutes and regulations. Among these powers is the ability to proscribe the payment of dividends by banks and bank holding companies. In addition, under the Basel III Rule, institutions that seek the freedom to pay dividends will have to maintain 2.5% in Common Equity Tier 1 attributable to the capital conservation buffer to be phased in over three years beginning in 2016. See &#147;&#151;Regulatory Emphasis on Capital&#148; above. 

&#160; 

Monetary Policy 

&#160; 

The monetary policy of the Federal Reserve has a significant effect on the operating results of financial or bank holding companies and their subsidiaries. Among the tools available to the Federal Reserve to affect the money supply are open market transactions in U.S. government securities, changes in the discount rate on bank borrowings and changes in reserve requirements against bank deposits. These means are used in varying combinations to influence overall growth and distribution of bank loans, investments and deposits, and their use may affect interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits. 

&#160; 

Federal Securities Regulation 

&#160; 

First Busey&#146;s common stock is registered with the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#147;Exchange Act&#148;). Consequently, First Busey is subject to the information, proxy solicitation, insider trading and other restrictions and requirements of the SEC under the Exchange Act. 

&#160; 

Corporate Governance 

&#160; 

The Dodd-Frank Act addressed many investor protection, corporate governance and executive compensation matters that affect most U.S. publicly traded companies. The Dodd-Frank Act increased stockholder influence over boards of directors by requiring companies to give stockholders a non-binding vote on executive compensation and so-called &#147;golden parachute&#148; payments, and authorized the SEC to promulgate rules that would allow stockholders to nominate and solicit voters for their own candidates using a company&#146;s proxy materials. The legislation also directed the Federal Reserve to promulgate rules prohibiting excessive compensation paid to executives of bank holding companies, regardless of whether such companies are publicly traded. 

&#160; 

Regulation and Supervision of the Bank 

&#160; 

General 

&#160; 

The Bank is an Illinois-chartered bank. As an Illinois-chartered FDIC-insured bank, the Bank is subject to the examination, supervision, reporting and enforcement requirements of the DFPR, the chartering authority for Illinois banks, and the FDIC, designated by federal law as the primary federal regulator of insured state banks that, like the Bank, are not members of the Federal Reserve System (&#147;nonmember banks&#148;). Pulaski Bank, as a national bank, will add the OCC as a bank regulatory agency for that bank upon its anticipated acquisition until the time Pulaski Bank is merged with and into the Bank. The deposit accounts of the Bank and Pulaski Bank are insured by the FDIC&#146;s Deposit Insurance Fund (&#147;DIF&#148;) to the maximum extent provided under federal law and FDIC regulations. Except as otherwise indicated, Pulaski Bank is subject to virtually the same regulatory system as the Bank and the discussion below will be equally applicable to it as a subsidiary of First Busey upon acquisition, which is subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions and the approval of the appropriate regulatory authorities. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Deposit Insurance 

&#160; 

FDIC-insured institutions are required to pay deposit insurance premium assessments to the FDIC. The FDIC has adopted a risk-based assessment system whereby FDIC-insured institutions pay insurance premiums at rates based on their risk classification. An institution&#146;s risk classification is assigned based on its capital levels and the level of supervisory concern the institution poses to the regulators. For deposit insurance assessment purposes, an FDIC-insured institution is placed in one of four risk categories each quarter. An institution&#146;s assessment is determined by multiplying its assessment rate by its assessment base. The total base assessment rates range from 2.5 basis points to 45 basis points. The assessment base is calculated using average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity. At least semi-annually, the FDIC will update its loss and income projections for the DIF and, if needed, will increase or decrease the assessment rates, following notice and comment on proposed rulemaking. 

&#160; 

Amendments to the Federal Deposit Insurance Act revised the assessment base against which an FDIC-insured institution&#146;s deposit insurance premiums paid to the DIF are calculated to be its average consolidated total assets less its average tangible equity. This change shifted the burden of deposit insurance premiums toward those large depository institutions that rely on funding sources other than U.S. deposits. Additionally, the Dodd-Frank Act altered the minimum designated reserve ratio of the DIF, increasing the minimum from 1.15% to 1.35% of the estimated amount of total insured deposits and eliminating the requirement that the FDIC pay dividends to FDIC-insured institutions. In lieu of dividends, the FDIC has adopted progressively lower assessment rate schedules that will take effect when the reserve ratio exceeds 1.15%, 2%, and 2.5%. As a consequence, premiums will decrease once the 1.15% threshold is exceeded. The FDIC has until September 30, 2020 to meet the 1.35% reserve ratio target. Several of these provisions could increase the Bank&#146;s FDIC deposit insurance premiums. The Dodd-Frank Act also permanently established the maximum amount of deposit insurance for banks, savings institutions and credit unions to $250,000 per insured depositor. 

&#160; 

FICO Assessments 

&#160; 

In addition to paying basic deposit insurance assessments, FDIC-insured institutions must pay Financing Corporation (&#147;FICO&#148;) assessments. FICO is a mixed-ownership governmental corporation chartered by the former Federal Home Loan Bank Board pursuant to the Competitive Equality Banking Act of 1987 to function as a financing vehicle for the recapitalization of the former Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation. FICO issued 30-year noncallable bonds of approximately $8.1 billion that mature in 2017 through 2019. FICO&#146;s authority to issue bonds ended on December 12, 1991. Since 1996, federal legislation has required that all FDIC-insured institutions pay assessments to cover interest payments on FICO&#146;s outstanding obligations. The FICO assessment rate is adjusted quarterly and for the fourth quarter of 2015 was 0.60 basis points (60 cents per $100 dollars of assessable deposits). 

&#160; 

Supervisory Assessments 

&#160; 

All Illinois banks are required to pay supervisory assessments to the DFPR to fund the operations of that agency and national banks pay supervisory assessments to the OCC. The amount of the assessment is calculated on the basis of the Bank&#146;s total assets. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Bank paid supervisory assessments to the DFPR totaling $0.3 million. 

&#160; 

Capital Requirements 

&#160; 

Banks are generally required to maintain capital levels in excess of other businesses. For a discussion of capital requirements, see &#147;&#151;Regulatory Emphasis on Capital&#148; above. 

&#160; 

Liquidity Requirements 

&#160; 

Liquidity is a measure of the ability and ease with which assets may be converted to cash. Liquid assets are those that can be converted to cash quickly if needed to meet financial obligations. To remain viable, FDIC-insured institutions must have enough liquid assets to meet their near-term obligations, such as withdrawals by depositors. Because the global financial crisis was in part a liquidity crisis, Basel III also includes a liquidity framework that requires FDIC-insured institutions to measure their liquidity against specific liquidity tests. One test, referred to as the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (&#147;LCR&#148;), is designed to ensure that the institution has an adequate stock of unencumbered high-quality liquid assets that can be converted easily and immediately in private markets into cash to meet liquidity needs for a 30-calendar day liquidity stress scenario. The other test, known as the Net Stable Funding Ratio, is designed to promote more medium- and long-term funding of the assets and activities of institutions over a one-year horizon. These tests provide an incentive for institutions to increase their holdings in Treasury securities and other sovereign debt as a component of assets, increase the use of long-term debt as a funding source and rely on stable funding like core deposits (in lieu of brokered deposits). 

&#160; 

&#160; 

In addition to liquidity guidelines already in place, the U.S. bank regulatory agencies implemented the Basel III LCR in September 2014, which requires large financial firms to hold levels of liquid assets sufficient to protect against constraints on their funding during times of financial turmoil. While the LCR only applies to the largest banking organizations in the country, certain elements are expected to filter down to all FDIC-insured institutions. The Bank continues to monitor regulatory developments with consideration for potential applicability to financial institutions below the current regulatory thresholds. 

&#160; 

Stress Testing 

&#160; 

A stress test is an analysis or simulation designed to determine the ability of a given FDIC-insured institution to deal with an economic crisis. In October 2012, U.S. bank regulators unveiled new rules mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act that require the largest U.S. banks to undergo stress tests twice per year, once internally and once conducted by the regulators, and began recommending portfolio stress testing as a sound risk management practice for community banks. Although stress tests are not officially required for banks with less than $10 billion in assets, they have become part of annual regulatory exams even for banks small enough to be officially exempted from the process. The FDIC now recommends stress testing as means to identify and quantify loan portfolio risk and the Bank is reviewing this process. 

&#160; 

Dividend Payments 

&#160; 

The primary source of funds for First Busey is dividends from the Bank. Under the Illinois Banking Act, the Bank generally may not pay dividends in excess of its net profit. Notwithstanding the availability of funds for dividends, the FDIC and the DFPR may prohibit the payment of dividends by the Bank if either or both determine such payment would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice. In addition, under the Basel III Rule, institutions that seek the freedom to pay dividends will have to maintain 2.5% in Common Equity Tier 1 attributable to the capital conservation buffer to be phased in over three years beginning in 2016. See &#147;Regulatory Emphasis on Capital&#148; above. As described above, the Bank exceeded its minimum capital requirements under applicable guidelines as of December 31, 2015. However, as of December 31, 2015, the Bank was in a retained deficit position and no amount was available to be paid as dividends by the Bank. With prior approval from its regulators, however, an Illinois state-chartered bank in this situation may be able to reduce its capital stock, by amending its charter to decrease the authorized number of shares, and then make a subsequent distribution to its holding company. Using this approach, and with the approval of its regulators, Busey Bank distributed $50.0 million to the Company on January 22, 2013, distributed $60.0 million to the Company on October 22, 2014 and distributed $60.0 million to the Company on December 8, 2015. The Company will continue to evaluate the appropriateness of future capital distributions. 

&#160; 

State Bank Investments and Activities 

&#160; 

The Bank is permitted to make investments and engage in activities directly or through subsidiaries as authorized by Illinois law. However, under federal law and FDIC regulations, FDIC-insured state banks are prohibited, subject to certain exceptions, from making or retaining equity investments of a type, or in an amount, that are not permissible for a national bank. Federal law and FDIC regulations also prohibit FDIC-insured state banks and their subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions, from engaging as principal in any activity that is not permitted for a national bank unless the Bank meets, and continues to meet, its minimum regulatory capital requirements and the FDIC determines that the activity would not pose a significant risk to the DIF. These restrictions have not had, and are not currently expected to have, a material impact on the operations of the Bank. 

&#160; 

Insider Transactions 

&#160; 

FDIC-insured banks are subject to certain restrictions imposed by federal law on &#147;covered transactions&#148; between the bank and its &#147;affiliates.&#148; First Busey is an affiliate of the Bank for purposes of these restrictions, and covered transactions subject to the restrictions include extensions of credit to First Busey, investments in the stock or other securities of First Busey and the acceptance of the stock or other securities of First Busey as collateral for loans made by the Bank. The Dodd-Frank Act enhanced the requirements for certain transactions with affiliates, including an expansion of the definition of &#147;covered transactions&#148; and an increase in the amount of time for which collateral requirements regarding covered transactions must be maintained. 

&#160; 

Limitations and reporting requirements are also placed on extensions of credit by the Bank to its directors and officers, to directors and officers of First Busey and its subsidiaries, to principal stockholders of First Busey and to &#147;related interests&#148; of such directors, officers and principal stockholders. In addition, federal law and regulations may affect the terms upon which any person who is a director or officer of First Busey or the Bank, or a principal stockholder of First Busey, may obtain credit from banks with which the Bank maintains a correspondent relationship. 

&#160; 

Safety and Soundness Standards/Risk Management 

&#160; 

The federal banking agencies have adopted guidelines that establish operational and managerial standards to promote the safety and soundness of FDIC-insured institutions. The guidelines set forth standards for internal controls, information systems, internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth, compensation, fees and benefits, asset quality and earnings. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

In general, the safety and soundness guidelines prescribe the goals to be achieved in each area, and each institution is responsible for establishing its own procedures to achieve those goals. If an institution fails to comply with any of the standards set forth in the guidelines, the FDIC-insured institution&#146;s primary federal regulator may require the institution to submit a plan for achieving and maintaining compliance. If an FDIC-insured institution fails to submit an acceptable compliance plan, or fails in any material respect to implement a compliance plan that has been accepted by its primary federal regulator, the regulator is required to issue an order directing the institution to cure the deficiency. Until the deficiency cited in the regulator&#146;s order is cured, the regulator may restrict the FDIC-insured institution&#146;s rate of growth, require the FDIC-insured institution to increase its capital, restrict the rates the institution pays on deposits or require the institution to take any action the regulator deems appropriate under the circumstances. Noncompliance with the standards established by the safety and soundness guidelines may also constitute grounds for other enforcement action by the federal bank regulatory agencies, including cease and desist orders and civil money penalty assessments. 

&#160; 

During the past decade, the bank regulatory agencies have increasingly emphasized the importance of sound risk management processes and strong internal controls when evaluating the activities of the FDIC-insured institutions they supervise. Properly managing risks has been identified as critical to the conduct of safe and sound banking activities and has become even more important as new technologies, product innovation, and the size and speed of financial transactions have changed the nature of banking markets. The agencies have identified a spectrum of risks facing a banking institution including, but not limited to, credit, market, liquidity, operational, legal, and reputational risk. In particular, recent regulatory pronouncements have focused on operational risk, which arises from the potential that inadequate information systems, operational problems, breaches in internal controls, fraud, or unforeseen catastrophes will result in unexpected losses. New products and services, third-party risk management and cybersecurity are critical sources of operational risk that FDIC-insured institutions are expected to address in the current environment. The Bank is expected to have active board and senior management oversight; adequate policies, procedures, and limits; adequate risk measurement, monitoring, and management information systems; and comprehensive internal controls. 

&#160; 

Branching Authority 

&#160; 

Illinois banks, such as the Bank, have the authority under Illinois law to establish branches anywhere in the State of Illinois, subject to receipt of all required regulatory approvals. Federal law permits state and national banks to merge with banks in other states subject to: (i) regulatory approval; (ii) federal and state deposit concentration limits; and (iii) state law limitations requiring the merging bank to have been in existence for a minimum period of time (not to exceed five years) prior to the merger. The establishment of new interstate branches has historically been permitted only in those states the laws of which expressly authorize such expansion. The Dodd-Frank Act permits well-capitalized and well-managed banks to establish new interstate branches or the acquisition of individual branches of a bank in another state (rather than the acquisition of an out-of-state bank in its entirety) without impediments. 

&#160; 

Transaction Account Reserves 

&#160; 

Federal Reserve regulations require FDIC-insured institutions to maintain reserves against their transaction accounts (primarily NOW and regular checking accounts). For 2016: the first $15.2 million of otherwise reservable balances are exempt from reserves and have no reserve requirement; for transaction accounts aggregating more than $15.2 million to $110.2 million, the reserve requirement is 3% of total transaction accounts; and for net transaction accounts in excess of $110.2 million, the reserve requirement is 3% up to $110.2 million plus 10% of the aggregate amount of total transaction accounts in excess of $110.2 million. These reserve requirements are subject to annual adjustment by the Federal Reserve. 

&#160; 

Federal Home Loan Bank Membership 

&#160; 

The Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago (the &#147;FHLB&#148;), which serves as a central credit facility for its members. The FHLB is funded primarily from proceeds from the sale of obligations of the FHLB system. It makes loans to member banks in the form of FHLB advances. All advances from the FHLB are required to be fully collateralized as determined by the FHLB. 

&#160; 

Community Reinvestment Act Requirements 

&#160; 

The Community Reinvestment Act requires FDIC-insured banks to have a continuing and affirmative obligation in a safe and sound manner to help meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. Federal regulators regularly assess the Bank&#146;s record of meeting the credit needs of its communities. Applications for additional acquisitions would be affected by the evaluation of the Bank&#146;s effectiveness in meeting its Community Reinvestment Act requirements. 

&#160; 

Anti-Money Laundering 

&#160; 

The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (the &#147;USA Patriot Act&#148;), along with anti-money laundering and bank secrecy laws (&#147;AML-BSA&#148;), are designed to deny terrorists and criminals the ability to obtain access to the U.S. financial system and has significant implications for 

&#160; 

&#160; 

FDIC-insured institutions, brokers, dealers and other businesses involved in the transfer of money. The laws mandate financial services companies to have policies and procedures with respect to measures designed to address any or all of the following matters: (i) customer identification and ongoing due diligence programs; (ii) money laundering; (iii) terrorist financing; (iv) identifying and reporting suspicious activities and currency transactions; (v) currency crimes; and (vi) cooperation among FDIC-insured institutions and law enforcement authorities. 

&#160; 

Concentrations in Commercial Real Estate 

&#160; 

Concentration risk exists when FDIC-insured institutions deploy too many assets to any one industry or segment. A concentration in commercial real estate is one example of regulatory concern. The interagency Concentrations in Commercial Real Estate Lending, Sound Risk Management Practices guidance (&#147;CRE Guidance&#148;) provides supervisory criteria, including the following numerical indicators, to assist bank examiners in identifying banks with potentially significant commercial real estate loan concentrations that may warrant greater supervisory scrutiny: (i) commercial real estate loans exceeding 300% of capital and increasing 50% or more in the preceding three years; or (ii) construction and land development loans exceeding 100% of capital. The CRE Guidance does not limit banks&#146; levels of commercial real estate lending activities, but rather guides institutions in developing risk management practices and levels of capital that are commensurate with the level and nature of their commercial real estate concentrations. On December 18, 2015, the federal banking agencies issued a statement to reinforce prudent risk-management practices related to CRE lending, having observed substantial growth in many CRE asset and lending markets, increased competitive pressures, rising CRE concentrations in banks, and an easing of CRE underwriting standards. The federal bank agencies reminded FDIC-insured institutions to maintain underwriting discipline and exercise prudent risk-management practices to identify, measure, monitor, and manage the risks arising from CRE lending. In addition, FDIC-insured institutions must maintain capital commensurate with the level and nature of their CRE concentration risk. Based on the Bank&#146;s loan portfolio as of December 31, 2015, the Bank does not exceed these guidelines.

&#160; 

Consumer Financial Services 

&#160; 

The historical structure of federal consumer protection regulation applicable to all providers of consumer financial products and services changed significantly on July 21, 2011, when the CFPB commenced operations to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws. The CFPB has broad rulemaking authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all providers of consumer products and services, including the Bank, as well as the authority to prohibit &#147;unfair, deceptive or abusive&#148; acts and practices. The CFPB has examination and enforcement authority over providers with more than $10 billion in assets. FDIC-insured institutions with $10 billion or less in assets, like the Bank, continue to be examined by their applicable bank regulators. 

&#160; 

Because residential mortgages were a significant factor contributing to the global financial crisis, many new rules issued by the CFPB and required by the Dodd-Frank Act address mortgage and mortgage-related products, their underwriting, origination, servicing and sales. The Dodd-Frank Act significantly expanded underwriting requirements applicable to loans secured by 1-4 family residential real property and augmented federal law combating predatory lending practices. In addition to numerous disclosure requirements, the Dodd-Frank Act imposed new standards for mortgage loan originations on all lenders, including all FDIC-insured institutions, in an effort to strongly encourage lenders to verify a borrower&#146;s &#147;ability to repay,&#148; while also establishing a presumption of compliance for certain &#147;qualified mortgages.&#148; In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act generally required lenders or securitizers to retain an economic interest in the credit risk relating to loans that the lender sells, and other asset-backed securities that the securitizer issues, if the loans have not complied with the ability-to-repay standards. First Busey does not currently expect the CFPB&#146;s rules to have a significant impact on its operations, except for higher compliance costs. 

&#160; 

Busey Wealth Management 

&#160; 

Busey Wealth Management is an Illinois corporation that operates under a certificate of authority to exercise trust powers issued by the DFPR. As such, Busey Wealth Management is subject to the examination, supervision, reporting and enforcement requirements established for trust companies by the DFPR. Additionally, because Busey Wealth Management is a wholly-owned subsidiary of First Busey, the Federal Reserve, as the primary federal regulator of First Busey, has the authority to conduct such examinations of Busey Wealth Management as the Federal Reserve deems necessary. Busey Wealth Management is required to maintain capital at the level determined by the DFPR to be necessary for the safe and sound operation of Busey Wealth Management. Like Busey Bank, Busey Wealth Management is required to pay supervisory assessments to the DFPR, which, for the year ended December 31, 2015, were insignificant. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, First Busey and its subsidiaries had a total of 795 employees (full-time equivalents).

Special Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 

&#160; 

Certain statements contained in or incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K that are not historical facts may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the &#147;Securities Act&#148;), and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. These forward-looking statements are covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements, which are based on certain assumptions and estimates and describe our future plans, strategies and expectations, can generally be identified by the use of the words &#147; may,&#148; &#147;will,&#148; &#147;should,&#148; &#147;could,&#148; &#147;would,&#148; &#147;goal,&#148; &#147;plan,&#148; &#147;potential,&#148; &#147;estimate,&#148; &#147;project,&#148; &#147;believe,&#148; &#147;intend,&#148; &#147;anticipate,&#148; &#147;expect,&#148; &#147;target,&#148; &#147;aim&#148; and similar expressions. These forward-looking statements include statements relating to our projected growth, anticipated future financial performance, financial condition, credit quality and management&#146;s long-term performance goals, as well as statements relating to the anticipated effects on results of operations and financial condition from expected developments or events, our business and growth strategies and any other statements that are not historical facts.

&#160; 

These forward-looking statements are subject to significant risks, assumptions and uncertainties, and could be affected by many factors. Factors that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and future prospects can be found under Item 1A &#145;&#145;Risk Factors&#146;&#146; in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and elsewhere in our periodic and current reports filed with the SEC. These factors include, but are not limited to, the following: 

&#160; 

&#183; the strength of the local and national economy;

&#183; changes in state and federal laws, regulations and governmental policies concerning First Busey&#146;s general business (including the impact of the Dodd-Frank Act and the extensive regulations to be promulgated thereunder, as well as the Basel III Rules);

&#183; changes in interest rates and prepayment rates of First Busey&#146;s assets;

&#183; increased competition in the financial services sector and the inability to attract new customers;

&#183; changes in technology and the ability to develop and maintain secure and reliable electronic systems;

&#183; the loss of key executives or employees;

&#183; changes in consumer spending;

&#183; unexpected results of acquisitions (including the planned acquisition of Pulaski), which may include failure to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition, possible termination of the Merger Agreement causing the acquisition to not be completed and the possibility that the transaction costs may be greater than anticipated;

&#183; unexpected outcomes of existing or new litigation involving First Busey;

&#183; the economic impact of any future terrorist threats or attacks;

&#183; the economic impact of exceptional weather occurrences such as tornadoes, hurricanes, floods, and blizzards;

&#183; changes in accounting policies and practices; and

&#183; other factors and risks described under &#145;&#145;Risk Factors&#146;&#146; herein.

&#160; 

Because of those risks and other uncertainties, our actual future results, performance or achievement, or industry results, may be materially different from the results indicated by these forward-looking statements. In addition, our past results of operations are not necessarily indicative of our future results. 

&#160; 

You should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the dates on which they were made. We are not undertaking an obligation to update these forward-looking statements, even though circumstances may change in the future, except as required under federal securities law. We qualify all of our forward-looking statements by these cautionary statements.
