BUSINESS

Corporate Structure

NOW Inc. (&#8220;NOW&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;), headquartered in Houston, Texas, was incorporated in Delaware on November 22, 2013. On May 30, 2014, the spin-off from National Oilwell Varco, Inc. (&#8220;NOV&#8221;) was completed and NOW became an independent, publicly traded company (the &#8220;Spin-Off&#8221; or &#8220;Separation&#8221;). In accordance with a separation and distribution agreement between NOV and NOW, the two companies were separated by NOV distributing to its stockholders 107,053,031 shares of common stock of NOW Inc. with each NOV stockholder receiving one share of NOW common stock for every four shares of NOV common stock held at the close of business on the record date of May 22, 2014 and not sold prior to close of business on May 30, 2014. We filed a registration statement on Form 10, as amended through the time of its effectiveness, describing the Spin-Off, which was declared effective by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220;SEC&#8221;) on May 13, 2014. On June 2, 2014, NOW stock began trading &#8220;regular-way&#8221; on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol &#8220;DNOW&#8221;.

Overview

We are a global distributor to energy and industrial markets with a legacy of over one-hundred and fifty years. We operate primarily under the DistributionNOW and Wilson Export brands. Through our network of over 300 locations and approximately 5,000 employees worldwide, we stock and sell a comprehensive offering of energy products as well as an extensive selection of products for industrial applications. Our energy product offering is consumed throughout all sectors of the oil and gas industry &#8211; from upstream drilling and completion, exploration and production (&#8220;E&#38;P&#8221;), midstream infrastructure development to downstream petroleum refining &#8211; as well as in other industries, such as chemical processing, utilities and industrial manufacturing operations. The industrial distribution portion of our business targets a diverse range of end markets, including manufacturing, engineering and construction and refineries. We also provide supply chain management to drilling contractors, E&#38;P operators, midstream operators and downstream energy and industrial manufacturing companies around the world.

Our global product offering includes consumable maintenance, repair and operating (&#8220;MRO&#8221;) supplies, pipe, valves, fittings, flanges, electrical, artificial lift solutions, pumps, mill tools, safety supplies and spare parts to support customers&#8217; operations. We provide a one-stop shop value proposition within the energy market and particularly in targeted areas of artificial lift, pumping solutions, measurement and controls and valve actuation. We also offer warehouse and inventory management solutions as part of a comprehensive supply chain and materials management offering. Through focused effort, we have developed expertise in providing application systems and parts integration, optimization solutions and after-sales support.

Our supply chain solutions include outsourcing the functions of procurement, inventory and warehouse management, logistics, point of issue technology, project management, business process and performance metrics reporting. This solution allows us to leverage the infrastructure of our SAP TM Enterprise Resource Planning (&#8220;ERP&#8221;) system and others to streamline our customers&#8217; purchasing process, from requisition to procurement to payment, by digitally managing workflow, improving approval routing and providing robust reporting functionality.

We support land and offshore operations for all the major oil and gas producing regions around the world through our comprehensive network of energy branch locations. Our key markets, beyond North America, include Latin America, the North Sea, the Middle East, 

&#160;

Asia Pacific and the Former Soviet Uni on (&#8220;FSU&#8221;). Products sold through our energy branch locations support greenfield and expansion upstream capital projects, midstream infrastructure and MRO and manufacturing consumables used in day-to-day production. We provide downstream energy and industr ial products for petroleum refining, chemical processing, power generation and industrial manufacturing operations through Supply Chain and customer on-site locations. 

We stock or sell more than 300,000 stock keeping units (&#8220;SKUs&#8221;) through our branch network. Our supplier network consists of thousands of vendors in approximately 40 countries. From our operations in over 20 countries we sell to customers operating in over 90 countries. The supplies and equipment stocked by each of our branches is customized to meet varied and changing local customer demands. The breadth and scale of our offering enhances our value proposition to vendors, customers and shareholders.

We employ advanced information technologies, including a common ERP platform across substantially all of our business, to provide complete procurement, materials management and logistics coordination to our customers around the globe. Having a common ERP platform allows immediate visibility into the financials and operations of our branches worldwide, enhancing decision-making and efficiency. 

Global Operations

&#160;

&#160;

Demand for our products is driven primarily by the level of oil and gas drilling, servicing and production, transmission, refining and petrochemical activities. It is also influenced by the global economy in general and by government policies. Several factors drive spending, such as investment in energy infrastructure, the North American shale plays and market expectations of future developments in the oil, natural gas, liquids, refined products, petrochemical, plant maintenance and other industrial, manufacturing and energy sectors. Approximately half of our revenue is historically attributable to multi-year MRO arrangements. These arrangements are generally repetitive activities that address recurring maintenance, repair, operational work, well hookups and drilling activities. Project activities, including facility maintenance (turnarounds), expansions, exploration and new construction projects, are usually associated with customers&#8217; capital expenditure budgets, sometimes in association with their construction partners. We mitigate our exposure to price volatility by limiting the length of price protection on such projects which allows us to adjust pricing depending on factors that influence our supply chain.

We have benefited from several strategic acquisitions during the past several years, including Wilson International, Inc. (&#8220;Wilson&#8221;) and CE Franklin Ltd. (&#8220;CE Franklin&#8221;), both of which were completed in 2012. We have also expanded globally, through acquisitions and organic investments, into Australia, Azerbaijan, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, England, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Netherlands, Norway, Philippines, Russia, Scotland, Singapore, United Arab Emirates and the United States.

United States

We have more than 200 locations in the U.S., which are geographically positioned to best serve the upstream, midstream and downstream energy and industrial markets.

We also have extensive one-stop shop specialty operations in the U.S. that provide our customers a unique opportunity to purchase artificial lift, pumps, valves and valve actuation, measurement and controls and fluid transfer products which enables them to better focus on their core business. In these businesses, we provide additional value to our customers through the design, assembly, fabrication and optimization of products and equipment essential to the safe and efficient production of oil and gas and industrial manufacturing processes.

In 2015, we grew our footprint in the U.S. energy and industrial markets with the acquisitions of Challenger Industries, Inc., Machine Tools Supply (&#8220;MTS&#8221;) and Odessa Pumps and Equipment, Inc. that expanded our tool supply and pumping solutions businesses.

Canada

We have a network of approximately 60 locations in the Canadian oilfield, predominantly in the oil rich provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan in Western Canada. Our Canada segment primarily serves the energy exploration, production and drilling business, offering customers the same products and value-added solutions that we perform in the U.S. In Canada, we also provide training for and supervise the installation of fiberglass pipe, supported by substantial inventory and product expertise to serve our customers.

International

We operate in over 20 countries and serve the needs of our international customers from approximately 40 locations outside of the U.S. and Canada, all of which are strategically located in major oil and gas development areas. Our approach in these markets is similar to our approach in the U.S., as our customers turn to us to provide inventory and support closer to their drilling and exploration activities. Our long legacy of operating in many international regions, combined with significant expansion into several new key markets, provides a competitive advantage as few of our competitors have a presence in the U.S., Canada and international markets.

In 2015, we grew our international presence in the United Kingdom and Norway with the acquisitions of John MacLean &#38; Sons Electrical, North Sea Cables and Oaasis Group that expanded our electrical and mill, tool and safety businesses.

Distribution Industry Overview

The distribution industry is highly fragmented, comprised of large companies with global reach and numerous small, local and regional competitors that present substantial opportunities for consolidation and product extensions.

Distribution companies act both as supply stores and supply chain management providers for their customers. Distributors deliver value to their customers by serving as a supply chain partner by managing vendor networks and aggregating, carrying and distributing a wide range of product inventory from numerous vendors in locations close to the end user.

&#160;

Our Distribution Channels 

We offer a diverse range of products across the energy and industrial markets in the U.S., Canada and internationally. There are thousands of manufacturers of the products used in the markets in which we operate and customers demand a high level of service, responsiveness and availability across a broad set of products and vendors. These market dynamics make the distributor an essential element in the value chain. Our product offering is aligned to meet the needs of our customer base.

Energy Branches

Our energy branches are the legacy brick and mortar supply store operations that provide products to multiple upstream and midstream customers from a single location. These branches serve repeat account and walk-in retail customers, across a variety of pricing models. Products are inventoried in our branch warehouses based on local market needs and are delivered or available for pick-up as needed. The branches serve a geographical radius providing delivery of products and solutions.

Our energy branches primarily serve the upstream and midstream sectors of the energy industry with locations in major land and offshore areas. Within our branch network, we have a team of sales and operations professionals trained in the products, applications and customer service required to support our customers as they drill, explore, produce, transport and refine oil and gas products. Our locations offer a comprehensive line of products, including line pipe, valves, fittings and flanges, pumps, original equipment manufacturer (&#8220;OEM&#8221;) spare parts, mill supplies, tools, safety supplies, personal protective equipment and miscellaneous expendable items. We also have a team of technical professionals who provide expertise in applied products and applications, such as artificial lift systems, coatings, pumps, electrical products, gas meter runs and valve actuation.

Supply Chain

Our Supply Chain group targets the upstream and downstream energy, industrial and manufacturing end markets, in which our customers are generally contractually incentivized through mutually beneficial financial incentives to source from us under a single business model that includes a fixed pricing structure. We reach a broader customer segment to include downstream, industrial and manufacturing; are typically integrated into our customers&#8217; facilities; have on-site NOW branches and inventory committed to a specific customer; perform duties otherwise managed by our customers; manage third party materials on behalf of our customers; employ vending machines and/or tool cribs to store and dispense materials on-demand; and have technology to enable efficiencies and key performance indicators to be measured and reported specifically to each customer.

Our Supply Chain locations serve the upstream and downstream energy, industrial and manufacturing end markets at our customers&#8217; on-site locations. Through our network of downstream and industrial facilities staffed by skilled personnel, we provide products primarily to refineries, chemical companies, utilities, manufacturers and engineering and construction companies in the areas of the country where these markets are situated. Our primary product offering for the downstream, industrial and manufacturing markets includes various grades of pipe, valves, fittings, mill supplies, machine and cutting tools, power and hand tools and safety supplies. Additionally, our downstream and industrial focused locations offer safety equipment, including repair and maintenance, and also provide planning, sourcing and expediting of orders throughout the lifecycle of large capital projects. Our Supply Chain locations serve many oil and gas operators, drilling contractors and industrial manufacturers. Supply Chain customers outsource procurement functions to us, which brings our sizeable vendor network to their doorstep and enables them to benefit from on-site management of their warehouses, inventory, materials, projects, logistics and manufacturing tool cribs. Customers engage our Supply Chain solutions to improve their bottom lines and accelerate their time to market through the identification and implementation of measurable operational efficiencies. To achieve this, we partner with our customers to evaluate their current operations, which allows us to make informed recommendations regarding the restructuring of processes and inventories. Our Supply Chain solutions are customized to each customer&#8217;s requirements and guided by a strategic framework.

Customers

Our primary customers are companies active in the upstream, midstream and downstream sectors of the energy industry, including drilling contractors, well servicing companies, independent and national oil and gas companies, midstream operators, refineries, petrochemical, chemical, utilities and other downstream energy processors. We also serve a diverse range of industrial and manufacturing companies across a broad spectrum of industries and end markets. We partner with our customers to continually meet or exceed their expectations and add value as a supply chain partner in the locations where they operate. Our products are typically critical to our customers&#8217; operations, yet represent only a small fraction of the total project or facility cost. As a result, our customers seek suppliers with established qualifications and an operational history to deliver high quality and reliable products that meet their requirements in a timely manner.

&#160;

As customers, particularly in the energy industry, increasingly aggregate purchases to improve efficiency and reduce costs, they partner with large distributors who can meet their needs for products in multiple locations around the world. W e believe we could benefit from consolidation among the energy companies we serve, as the larger resulting companies look to large distributors as their source for products and related solutions. 

No single customer represents more than 10% of our revenue. Our top 20 customers in aggregate represent approximately one-third of our revenue.

Competition

The distribution companies serving the energy and industrial end markets are both numerous and competitive. This industry is highly fragmented, comprised of large distributors, each with many locations, who aggregate and distribute several product lines, or the distributor could be a product line specialist, as well as numerous smaller regional and local companies, many of which operate from a single location and either aggregate and distribute several product lines or focus on a single product line. While some large distributors compete in both markets, most companies focus on either the energy or industrial end market. In the energy market, some of the larger companies against whom we compete include Ferguson Enterprises, Inc. (a subsidiary of Wolseley, plc), MRC Global, Inc., Russell Metals, Inc., DXP Enterprises, Inc. and Shale-Inland Holdings LLC. In the industrial market, some of the larger companies against whom we compete include Ferguson Enterprises, Inc. (a subsidiary of Wolseley, plc), W.W. Grainger, Inc., HD Supply, Inc., MSC Industrial Direct Co., Inc., Applied Industrial Technologies, Inc., DXP Enterprises, Inc. and Fastenal Company.

Seasonal Nature of the Company&#8217;s Business

Historically, a portion of our business has experienced seasonal trends, to some degree, which have varied by geographic region. In the U.S., activity has historically been higher during the summer and fall months. In Canada, certain E&#38;P activities have declined in the spring due to seasonal thaws and regulatory restrictions limiting the ability of drilling rigs and transportation to operate effectively and safely during these periods. However, these activities have typically rebounded during the third and fourth quarters.

Employees

At December 31, 2015 we had approximately 5,000 employees, of which approximately 300 were temporary employees. Some of our employees in various foreign locations are subject to collective bargaining agreements. Less than one percent of our employees in the U.S. are subject to collective bargaining agreements. We offer market competitive benefits for employees and opportunities for growth and advancement. We believe our relationship with our employees is good.

Environmental Matters

We are subject to a variety of federal, state, local, foreign and provincial environmental, health and safety laws, regulations and permitting requirements, including those governing the discharge of pollutants or hazardous substances into the air, soil or water, the generation, handling, use, management, storage and disposal of, or exposure to, hazardous substances and wastes, the responsibility to investigate, remediate, monitor and clean up contamination and occupational health and safety. Fines and penalties may be imposed for non-compliance with applicable environmental, health and safety requirements and the failure to have or to comply with the terms and conditions of required permits. Historically, the costs to comply with environmental and health and safety requirements have not been material to our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We are not aware of any pending environmental compliance or remediation matters that, in the opinion of management, are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our business, financial position or results of operations or cash flows.
