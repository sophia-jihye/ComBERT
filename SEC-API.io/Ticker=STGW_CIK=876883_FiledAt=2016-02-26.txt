MDC and its Partner Firms (as defined below) deliver a wide range of customized services, including (1) global advertising and marketing services, (2) media buying, planning and optimization, (3) interactive and mobile marketing, (4) direct marketing, (5) database and customer relationship management, (6) sales promotion, (7) corporate communications, (8) market research, (9) data analytics and insights, (10) corporate identity, design and branding services, (11) social media communications, (12) product and service innovation and (13) e-commerce management. 

Market Strategy 

MDC&#8217;s strategy is to build, grow and acquire market-leading businesses that deliver innovative, value-added marketing, activation, communications and strategic consulting services to their clients. By doing so, MDC strives to be a partnership of marketing communications and consulting companies (or &#8220;Partner Firms&#8221;) whose strategic, creative and innovative solutions are media-agnostic, challenge the status quo, achieve measurable superior returns on investment, and drive transformative growth and business performance for its clients and stakeholders. 

The MDC model is driven by three key elements: 

Perpetual Partnership. The perpetual partnership model creates ongoing alignment of interests between MDC and its Partner Firms to drive the Company's overall performance by (1) identifying the &#8220;right&#8221; Partner Firms with a sustainable differentiated position in the marketplace, (2) creating the &#8220;right&#8221; partnership structure by taking a majority ownership position and leaving a substantial noncontrolling equity or economic ownership position in the hands of operating management to incentivize long-term growth, (3) providing succession planning support and compensation models to incentivize future leaders and second-generation executives, (4) leveraging the network's scale to provide access to strategic resources and best practices and (5) focusing on delivering financial results. 

Entrepreneurialism. The entrepreneurial spirit of both MDC and its Partner Firms is optimized through (1) its unique perpetual partnership model that incentivizes senior-level involvement and ambition, (2) access to shared resources within the Corporate Group that allow individual firms to focus on client business and company growth and (3) MDC&#8217;s collaborative creation of customized solutions to support and grow Partner Firm businesses. 

Human and Financial Capital. The perpetual partnership model balances accountability with financial flexibility and meaningful incentives to support growth. 

Financial Reporting Segments 

MDC operates through a network of Partner Firms. Beginning in 2015, MDC streamlined its reporting structure to improve efficiency and resource prioritization. The Company now reports as one reportable segment which is the Advertising and Communications Segment. 

The Advertising and Communications reportable segment consists of integrated marketing consulting services to Partner Firms that offer a full complement of advertising, marketing, media, communications solutions, and specialized consumer insights and analytics including (1) global advertising and marketing services, (2) media buying, planning and optimization, (3) interactive and mobile marketing, (4) direct marketing, (5) public relations, (6) corporate communications, (7) market research, (8) corporate identity and branding services, (9) sales promotion, (10) the design, development, research and implementation of consumer services and (11) direct marketing services. 

In addition, certain firms also provide consumer activation services, investor relation services and/or general public insights. 

MDC also reports results for the &#8220;Corporate Group&#8221;. The Corporate Group provides shared services to the Company and the Partner Firms, including accounting, administrative, strategic, financial, human resource and legal functions. The Corporate Group ensures that MDC is the most partner-responsive marketing services network through its strategic mandate to help Partner Firms 

accelerate their growth. The Corporate Group leverages the collective expertise and scale of MDC&#8217;s network to (1) provide business development support, talent, business planning, IT, procurement, real estate, communications, and legal to the Partner Firms, (2) help the Partner Firms source and execute tuck-under acquisitions, (3) facilitate cross-selling among the Partner Firms and (4) expand the Partner Firms' service offerings and geographic footprints.

Competition 

In the competitive, highly fragmented marketing and communications industry, MDC's Partner Firms compete for business and talent with the operating subsidiaries of large global holding companies such as Omnicom Group Inc., Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc., WPP plc, Publicis Groupe SA, Dentsu Inc. and Havas SA. These global holding companies generally have greater resources than those available to MDC and its subsidiaries, and such resources may enable them to aggressively compete with the Company&#8217;s marketing communications businesses. Each of MDC&#8217;s Partner Firms also faces competition from numerous independent agencies that operate in multiple markets, as well as newer competitors such as IT consulting, tech platforms, and other services firms that have begun to offer marketing-related services. MDC&#8217;s Partner Firms must compete with all of these other companies to maintain existing client relationships and to obtain new clients and assignments. MDC&#8217;s Partner Firms compete at this level by providing clients with disruptive marketing ideas and strategies that are focused on increasing clients&#8217; revenues and profits. These existing and potential clients include multinational corporations and national companies with mid-to-large sized marketing budgets. MDC also benefits from cooperation among its entrepreneurial Partner Firms through referrals and the sharing of both services and expertise, which enables MDC to service clients&#8217; varied marketing needs around the world by crafting custom integrated solutions. 

A Partner Firm&#8217;s ability to compete for new clients is affected in some instances by the policy, which many advertisers and marketers impose, of not permitting their agencies to represent competitive accounts in the same market. In the vast majority of cases, however, MDC&#8217;s consistent maintenance of separate, independent operating companies has enabled MDC to represent competing clients across its network. 

Industry Trends 

There are several recent economic and industry trends that affect or may be expected to affect the Company&#8217;s results of operations. Historically, advertising has been the primary service provided by the marketing communications industry. However, as clients aim to establish one-to-one relationships with customers, and more accurately measure the effectiveness of their marketing expenditures, specialized and digital communications services and database marketing and analytics are consuming a growing portion of marketing dollars. The Company believes these changes in the way consumers interact with media is increasing the demand for a broader range of non-advertising marketing communications services (i.e., direct marketing, sales promotion, interactive, mobile, strategic communications and public relations), which we expect could have a positive impact on our results of operations. In addition, the rise of technology and data solutions have rendered scale less crucial as it once was in areas such as media buying, creating significant opportunities for agile and modern players. Global marketers now demand breakthrough and integrated creative ideas, and no longer require traditional brick-and-mortar communications partners in every market to optimize the effectiveness of their marketing efforts. Combined with the fragmentation of the media landscape, these factors provide new opportunities for small to mid-sized communications companies like those in the MDC network. In addition, marketers now require ever greater speed-to-market to drive financial returns on their marketing and media investment, causing them to turn to more nimble, entrepreneurial and collaborative communications firms like MDC Partner Firms. 

As client procurement departments have focused increasingly on marketing services company fees in recent years, the Company has invested in resources to work with client procurement departments to ensure that we are able to deliver against client goals in a mutually beneficial way. For example, the Company has explored new compensation models, such as performance-based incentive payments and equity, in order to greater align our success with our clients. These incentive payments may offset negative pricing pressure from client procurement departments. 

Clients 

The Company serves clients in virtually every industry, and in many cases, the same clients in various locations, and through several Partner Firms and across many disciplines. Representation of a client rarely means that MDC handles marketing communications for all brands or product lines of the client in every geographical location. For further information regarding revenues and long-lived assets on a geographical basis for each of the last three years, see Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

MDC&#8217;s agencies have written contracts with many of their clients. As is customary in the industry, these contracts generally provide for termination by either party on relatively short notice, usually 90 days. See &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8212; Executive Overview&#8221; for a further discussion of MDC&#8217;s arrangements with its clients. 

During 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , the Company did not have a client that accounted for 5% or more of revenues. In addition, MDC&#8217;s ten largest clients (measured by revenue generated) accounted for 24% , 24% and 27% of 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 &#32;revenues, respectively. 

Employees 

As of December 31, &#32; 2015 , MDC and its subsidiaries had the following number of employees:

See &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; for a discussion of the effect of cost of services sold on MDC&#8217;s historical results of operations. Because of the personal service character of the marketing communications businesses, the quality of personnel is of crucial importance to MDC&#8217;s continuing success. MDC considers its relations with its employees to be satisfactory. 

Effect of Environmental Laws 

MDC believes it is substantially in compliance with all regulations concerning the discharge of materials into the environment, and such regulations have not had a material effect on the capital expenditures or operations of MDC.
