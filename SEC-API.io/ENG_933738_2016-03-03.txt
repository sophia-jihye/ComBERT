 IT EM 1. BUSINESS 

Overview 

ENGlobal Corporation (which may be referred to as &#8220;ENGlobal,&#8221; the &#8220;Company,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us&#8221; or &#8220;our&#8221;), incorporated in the State of Nevada in June 1994, is a leading provider of engineering and professional services principally to the energy industry. All of the information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K relates to the annual periods ended December 26, 2015 and December 27, 2014. We have positioned ourselves as a leading, reliable, high quality service provider to our customers. To that end, in the fourth quarter of 2012, we implemented a strategic plan that included divesting our non-core assets, implementing process improvements and cost cutting. In late 2012 and early 2013, we discontinued our Electrical Services division and sold our Field Solutions segment. In August 2013, we sold a significant portion of our Engineering Procurement and Construction Management business. The result is a smaller company that is focused on our two remaining segments, (1) Engineering, Procurement and Construction Management (&#8220;EPCM&#8221;) and (2) Automation engineering and integration. The impact of these strategic moves and a severe decline in overall market conditions with respect to the oil and gas industry in 2015 was a decline in our revenue from continuing operations to $79.6 million in 2015 from $169.0 million in 2013. As a result, we have been reducing the amount of risk we are accepting in the work we are currently performing, which has resulted in less construction management and the associated procurement services, while enhancing project execution. This reduction in procurement services has resulted in reduced revenues as compared to 2012 levels, but has had a positive impact on our gross profit margin as procurement services are typically provided at lower mark-ups. Our gross profit margins in 2014 and 2015 improved over 20% as compared to gross profit margins of 12.6% and 8.2% in 2013 and 2012, respectively. Additionally, we have reduced our expenses by reducing employee headcount, closing offices and implementing cost controls. We have reduced our employee count from approximately 1,700 employees as of December 29, 2012 to approximately 344 employees as of December 26, 2015 in five offices located in the following cities: Houston, Texas; Tulsa, Oklahoma; Denver, Colorado; and Mobile, Alabama. As a result, selling, general and administrative expenses (&#8220;SG&#38;A&#8221;) in our core businesses were reduced from $25.2 million to $14.2 million, or 43.7% from 2012 to 2015 and we continue to look for ways to reduce our overhead in 2016 while maintaining a high level of service. These changes generated a net income of $6.0 million in 2014 versus a net loss of $3.0 million in 2013. We continued to be profitable in 2015 reporting $2.3 million of income before income taxes while facing a strong downward market trend. See &#8220;Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8211; Liquidity and Capital Resources.&#8221; Through these efforts, we have created a foundation on which we can again begin to grow our company. 

&#160;

&#160; 

We have access to a Line of Credit Facility with Regions Bank of up to $10 million, depending on the borrowing base (see Note 6 &#8211; Credit Facilities). We had no loans outstanding as of December 26, 2015 and had cash on hand of approximately $7.8 million and $6.2 million at December 26, 2015 and December 27, 2014, respectively, which is sufficient to conduct our ongoing operations and fund growth.

Business Segments 

Our segments are strategic business units that offer different services and products and therefore require different marketing and management strategies. Below is the percentage of revenue for each operating segment:

The decline in the percentage of revenue contributed by the Automation segment is the result of significant order cancellations in the upstream oil and gas industry in the beginning of 2015 and a strong decline on the overall energy industry. 

Engineering, Procurement and Construction Management (&#8220;EPCM&#8221;) Segment 

Selected financial data for this segment for the years ended December 26, 2015 and December 27, 2014, respectively, is summarized as follows (dollars in thousands):

The EPCM segment provides multi-disciplined engineering services relating to the development, management and execution of projects requiring professional engineering and related project management services primarily to the energy industry throughout the United States and to the US Government globally. Our EPCM segment offers feasibility studies, engineering, design, procurement, and construction management. The EPCM segment includes the government services group, which provides engineering, design, installation and operation and maintenance of various government, public sector and international facilities. 

&#160;

&#160; 

The EPCM segment offers a wide range of services as a single source provider. ENGlobal's engineering staff has the capability of developing a project from the initial planning stages through detailed design and construction management. Our services include conceptual studies, project definition, cost estimating, engineering design, environmental compliance, material procurement, project management and construction management. The EPCM segment currently operates through ENGlobal's wholly-owned subsidiaries, ENGlobal U.S., Inc. (&#8220;ENGlobal U.S.&#8221;) and ENGlobal Government Services, Inc. (&#8220;EGS&#8221;). ENGlobal U.S. focuses on providing its services to the energy industry, chemical and petrochemical manufacturers and utilities. 

The EPCM segment has existing blanket service contracts under which it provides clients with services either on a time-and-material or fixed-price basis. We strive to establish longer term &#8220;alliance&#8221; or &#8220;preferred provider&#8221; relationships with our clients that can be expected to provide a steadier stream of work. In addition, this segment provides outsourced personnel to ENGlobal clients, a service that contributes to a more stable business mix for us. 

EGS primarily provides automated fuel handling systems and maintenance services to branches of the U.S. military and public sector entities. Other clients of this division are government agencies, refineries, petrochemical and process industry customers worldwide. EGS provides electrical and instrument installation, technical services, and ongoing maintenance, calibration and repair services. 

As a service-based business, the EPCM segment is more labor than capital intensive. This segment&#8217;s results primarily depend on our ability to generate revenue and collect cash in excess of any cost for employees and benefits, material, equipment and subcontracts, plus our selling, general and administrative (&#8220;SG&#38;A&#8221;) expenses. 

The EPCM segment derives revenue primarily on contracts from time-and-material fees charged for professional and technical services. Its net income is derived primarily from services it provides to the oil and gas industry and to the US government. The segment sometimes enters into contracts providing for the execution of projects on a fixed-price basis, whereby some, or all, of the project activities related to engineering, material procurement and construction management are performed for a fixed amount. 

&#160; 

Our EPCM segment competes with a large number of public and private firms of various sizes, ranging from the industry's largest firms, which operate on a worldwide basis to much smaller regional and local firms. Many of our competitors are larger than we are and have significantly greater financial and other resources available to them than we do. However, the largest firms in our industry are sometimes our clients, performing as program managers for very large scale projects who subcontract a portion of their work to us. We also have many competitors who are smaller than us and who, as a result, may be able to offer services at more competitive prices. 

Competition is centered on performance and the ability to provide the engineering, planning and project delivery skills required for completing projects in a timely, cost-efficient manner. The expertise of our management and technical personnel and the timeliness and quality of our support services are key competitive factors. 

&#160; 

Automation Segment

The Automation segment provides services related to the design, integration and implementation of process distributed control and analyzer systems, advanced automated data gathering systems and information technology primarily to the energy industry throughout the United States, as well as a specific project in Central Asia. This segment also designs, assembles, integrates and services control and instrumentation systems for specific applications in the energy and processing related industries. These services are offered to clients in the petroleum refining, petrochemical, pipeline, production, process and pulp and paper industries throughout the United States and in Kazakhstan and Russia. 

&#160;

&#160; 

Currently, we are working on a significant project in Kazakhstan and Russia, the Caspian Pipeline Consortium Project (&#8220;CPC Project&#8221;). Under the Russian Federation contract pursuant to the CPC Project, ENGlobal&#8217;s scope includes engineering, procuring equipment, integrating, programming, and fabricating of 230 control system panels for eight new pump stations and the upgrade of three existing pump stations, storage facilities, and a marine terminal. The contract for the Republic of Kazakhstan pursuant to the CPC Project consists of engineering, procuring equipment, integrating, and fabricating 78 control system panels for two new and two existing pump stations, in addition to start-up and commissioning services for the local control systems and valves. The CPC Project generated $11.8 million and $17.7 million of revenues in 2015 and 2014, respectively. Total revenues of approximately $14.0 million are expected from this project in 2016 and 2017. 

The Automation segment operates through ENGlobal's wholly-owned subsidiary, ENGlobal U.S. and derives revenue from both time-and-material fees and fees charged for professional and technical services on a fixed-price basis. As a service provider, our Automation segment is more labor than capital intensive. The segment's results primarily depend on our ability to accurately estimate costs on fixed-price contracts, generate revenue and collect amounts due under time-and-material contracts in excess of the cost of employees and benefits, material, equipment, subcontracts, and applicable SG&#38;A expenses. Our Automation segment primarily operates out of our offices in Houston, Texas, and Mobile, Alabama. 

&#160; 

Our Automation segment competes with a large number of public and private firms of various sizes, ranging from the industry's largest firms, which operate on a worldwide basis to much smaller regional and local firms. Many of our competitors are larger than we are and have significantly greater financial and other resources available to them than we do. We also have many competitors who are smaller than us and who, as a result, may be able to offer services at more competitive prices. 

Competition is centered on performance and the ability to provide the engineering, assembly and integration required to complete projects in a timely and cost-efficient manner. The technical expertise of our management team and technical personnel and the timeliness and quality of our support services are key competitive factors. 

&#160;

Acquisitions and Divestitures 

Historically, we have expanded our business through both internal initiatives and through strategic acquisitions. During 2012 and early 2013, we discontinued our Electrical Services division and sold our Field Solutions segment and the Gulf Coast portion of our ongoing EPCM business. During 2015, we focused on operating our core EPCM and Automation business, processes and infrastructure to position ourselves to take advantage of growth opportunities as they are presented, both organic and external and which may be outside of the energy industry. 

Seasonality 

&#160; 

Our revenues are primarily generated by services, and therefore holidays and employee vacations during our first and fourth quarter negatively impact revenues in those quarters, which is only partially offset by the year-end efforts on the part of many clients to spend any remaining funds budgeted for services and capital expenditures during the year. Our clients' annual budget process is normally completed in the first quarter, which can slow the award of new work at the beginning of the year. In addition, weather conditions have been more difficult in the geographic markets where we operate during the winter months. Principally due to these factors, our first and fourth quarters are typically less robust than our second and third quarters. 

Business Strategy 

Our primary objective continues to be to develop our own proprietary products and services in addition to strengthening our position as a leading full service provider of project delivery services by enhancing our overall range of capabilities in the areas of engineering and construction management and automation services. While our focus on restructuring and downsizing our operations, in 2012 and 2013, resulted in an improvement in our operating results and financial position for 2014, the decline in the energy industry has slowed our progress in 2015. We continue to maintain our core business strengths, monitor cost saving opportunities and maintain a good financing relationship with our lender. Specifically, we are focused on the following: 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Business Strengths &#8211; We have focused our efforts on our core business segments, EPCM and Automation. We have significantly reduced our lower margin procurement services and are focused on attaining higher margins on our existing proprietary products and services in addition to those in development. Going forward, we expect to continue our relationships with our repeat clients; forge new relationships within our core expertise and experience; and develop additional proprietary products. 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Financial Relationships &#8211; In 2014, we entered into a credit facility which provides access to up to $10 million of revolving loans, based on our eligible accounts receivable. See &#8220;Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8211; Liquidity and Capital Resources.&#8221; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

Sales and Marketing 

ENGlobal derives revenues primarily from three sources: (1) business development, (2) preferred provider or alliance agreements with strategic clients, and (3) referrals from existing customers and industry members. Our Senior Vice President of Business Development supervises our in-house business development professionals assigned to clients and territories within the United States. Client relationships are nurtured by our geographic advantage of having office locations near our larger customers. By having clients in close proximity, we are able to provide single, dedicated points of contact. Our growth depends in large measure on our ability to attract and retain qualified business development managers and business development personnel with a respected reputation in the energy industry. Management believes that in-house marketing allows for more accountability and control, thus increasing profitability. 

&#160; 

Our business development focuses on building long-term relationships with customers and clients in order to provide solutions throughout the life-cycle of their facilities. Additionally, we seek to capitalize on cross-selling opportunities between our EPCM and Automation segments. Sales leads are often jointly developed and pursued by our business development personnel from both of these segments. 

Products and services are also promoted through trade advertising, participation in industry conferences and on-line Internet communication via our corporate home page at www.englobal.com . The ENGlobal website provides information about our operating segments and illustrates our Company's full range of services and capabilities. We use internal and external resources to maintain and update our website on an ongoing basis. Through the ENGlobal website, we seek to provide visitors and investors with a single point of contact for obtaining information about our company. We develop preferred provider and alliance agreements with clients in order to facilitate repeat business. These preferred provider agreements, also known as master services agreements or umbrella agreements, are typically two to three years in length. Although the agreement is not a guarantee for work under a certain project, ENGlobal generally offers a slightly reduced billing structure to clients willing to commit to arrangements that are expected to provide a steady stream of work. With the terms of the contract settled, add-on projects with these customers are easier to negotiate and can be accepted quickly, without the necessity of a bidding process. Management believes that these agreements can serve to stabilize project-centered operations. 

Much of our business is repeat business and we are introduced to new customers in many cases by referrals from existing customers and industry members. Management believes referral marketing provides the opportunity for increased profitability because referrals do not involve direct selling. Rather, they allow satisfied customers to sell our services and products on our behalf. ENGlobal strives to develop our clients' trust and then benefit by word-of-mouth referrals. 

&#160; 

Customers 

Our customer base consists primarily of Fortune 500 companies in the energy industry. While we do not have continuing dependence on any single client or a limited group of clients, one or a few clients may contribute a substantial portion of our revenue in any given year or over a period of several consecutive years due to the longevity of major projects, such as facility upgrades or expansions. ENGlobal may work for many different subsidiaries or divisions of our clients, which involves multiple parties to material contracts. The loss of a single large customer, including all of its subsidiaries or divisions, or the reduction in demand for our services by several customers in the same year could have a material impact on our financial results. We continue to focus substantial attention on improving customer services in order to enhance satisfaction and increase customer retention. Revenue generated through sources such as preferred provider relationships are longer-term in nature and are not typically limited to one project. 

&#160; 

A significant long-term trend among our clients and their industry counterparts has been outsourcing engineering services. This trend has fostered the development of ongoing, longer-term client arrangements, rather than one-time limited engagements. These arrangements vary in scope, duration and degree of commitment. While there is typically no guarantee that work will result from these agreements, often the arrangements form the basis for a longer-term client relationship. Despite their variety, we believe that these partnering relationships have a stabilizing influence on our revenue. These engagements may provide for any of the following: 

&#160;

&#183; 

a minimum number of work man-hours over a specified period; 

&#183; 

the provision of at least a designated percentage of the client's requirements; 

&#183; 

the designation of the Company as the client's sole or preferred source of services at specific locations or on specific projects; or 

&#183; 

a non-binding preference or intent, or a general contractual framework, for what the parties expect will be an ongoing relationship. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Overall, our ten largest customers, who vary from one period to the next, accounted for 70.9% of our total revenues for 2015 and 78.9% of our total revenues for 2014. Most of our projects are specific in nature and we generally have multiple projects with the same clients. If we were to lose one or more of our significant clients and were unable to replace them with other customers or other projects, our business could be materially adversely affected. Our top two clients in 2015 were the Caspian Pipeline Consortium and the US Government. Even though we frequently receive work from repeat clients, our client list may vary significantly from year to year. Our potential revenue in all segments is dependent on continuing relationships with our customers. 

For the years ended December 26, 2015 and December 27, 2014, we had approximately 121 and 127 active customers, respectively. 

&#160; 

Contracts 

We generally enter into two principal types of contracts with our clients: time-and-material contracts and fixed-price contracts. Our mix of net revenue between time-and-material and fixed-price contracts is shown in the table below. Our clients typically determine the type of contract to be utilized for a particular engagement, with the specific terms and conditions of a contract resulting from a negotiation process between us and our client.

Time-and-Material - Under our time-and-material contracts, we are paid for labor at either negotiated hourly billing rates, a multiple of our actual labor rate or through reimbursement for allowable hourly rates and other expenses. We are paid for material and contracted services at an agreed upon multiplier of our cost, and at times we pass non-labor costs for equipment, materials and subcontractor services through with little or no profit. Profitability on these contracts is driven by billable headcount, the amount of non-labor related services and cost control. Many of these contracts have upper limits, referred to as &#8220;not-to-exceed&#8221; amounts. Generally, our scope is not defined under a &#8220;not-to-exceed&#8221; agreement, and we are not under any obligation to provide services beyond the limits of the contract, but if we generate costs and billings that exceed the upper limits of the contract ceiling or are not allowable, we may be unable to obtain reimbursement for the excess cost. Further, the continuation of each contract partially depends upon the customer's discretionary periodic assessment of our performance on that contract. 

Fixed-Price - Under a fixed-price contract, we provide the customer a total project for an agreed-upon price, subject to project circumstances and changes in scope. Fixed-price projects vary in size and may include engineering activities and related services, responsibility for the procurement of materials and equipment, and oversight of any construction through a subcontractor. Fixed-price contracts carry certain inherent risks, including risks of losses from underestimating costs, delays in project completion, problems with new technologies, the impact of the economy on labor shortages, increases in equipment and materials costs, natural disasters, and other events and changes that may occur over the contract period. Another risk is our ability (or inability) to secure written change orders prior to commencing work on contract changes in scope, without which we may not receive payment for work performed. Consequently, the profitability of fixed-price contracts may vary substantially. 

Generally, a fixed-price project in excess of $250,000 contract value contains a contingency amount in its estimated cost at the beginning of the project. This contingency amount effectively reduces the amount of revenue recognized on the project as costs are incurred. The contingency amount is used to cover unforeseen costs incurred during the project, if any. When a project is approximately 70% complete and any remaining cost over-runs become quantifiable or unlikely, any remaining contingency is released over the remainder of the project. Our project durations range from less than one month to several years, therefore, if no contingency were used during the life of a project, the profit margin reflected in our financial statements at the end of the project could be higher than at the beginning of the project. 

&#160;

&#160; 

Backlog 

Backlog represents an estimate of gross revenues of all awarded contracts that have not been completed and will be recognized as revenue over the life of the project. Although backlog reflects business that we consider to be firm, cancellations or scope adjustments may occur. Further, most contracts with clients may be terminated by either party at will, in which case the client would only be obligated to us for services provided through the termination date. As a result, no assurances can be given that the amounts included in backlog will ultimately be realized. In addition, it is not clear how our backlog will be impacted by current or future economic conditions. 

&#160; 

At December 26, 2015, our backlog was approximately $36 million, including approximately $14 million on the CPC Project, compared to approximately $68 million, including approximately $23 million on the CPC Project at December 27, 2014. This decrease in backlog is primarily due to completion of work on the CPC Project and the cancellation of orders from the upstream oil and gas industry at the beginning of 2015. We expect the majority of our backlog to be completed during 2016. The backlog at December 26, 2015 and December 27, 2014 consisted of approximately $33 million and $57 million with commercial customers and approximately $3 million and $11 million with the US Government. Backlog on federal programs includes only the portion of the contract award that has been funded. In 2015, the US Government delayed awarding certain contracts due to internal changes in the award process. We expect that a portion of the delayed awards from 2015 will be awarded in 2016, in addition to the amount of contract awards expected in 2016. As a result, we believe our awards in 2016 will increase. The backlog for each of our segments at December 26, 2015 and December 27, 2014 was as follows (in millions):

Backlog includes contracts for which work authorizations have been received on a fixed-price basis or time-and-material projects that are well defined. There is no assurance as to the percentage of backlog that will be recognized under these contracts. 

&#160; 

Suppliers 

Our ability to provide clients with services and systems in a timely and competitive manner depends on the availability of products and parts from our suppliers at competitive prices and on reasonable terms. Our suppliers are not obligated to have products on hand for timely delivery nor can they guarantee product availability in sufficient quantities to meet our demands. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain necessary supplies at prices or on terms we find acceptable. However, in an effort to maximize availability and maintain quality control, we generally procure components from multiple distributors on our clients' behalf and in some cases we can take advantage of national agreements our clients may have entered into. 

&#160; 

For example, all of the product components used by our Automation segment are assembled using components and materials that are available from numerous domestic manufacturers and suppliers. There are approximately five principal suppliers of distributed control systems, each of which can be replaced by an equally viable competitor, and our clients typically direct the selection of their preferred supplier. Thus, in the vast majority of cases, we anticipate little or no difficulty in obtaining components in sufficient quantities and in a timely manner to support our installation and assembly operations in the Automation segment. Units produced through the Automation segment are not produced for inventory and component parts; rather, they are typically purchased on an as-needed basis. By being vendor neutral, ENGlobal is able to provide quality technology and platforms for the design of plant systems such as 3D modeling, process simulation and other technical applications. 

Despite the foregoing, our Automation segment relies on certain suppliers for necessary components and there can be no assurance that these components will continue to be available on acceptable terms. If a vendor does not continue to contract with us, it may be difficult to obtain alternative sources of supply without a material disruption in our ability to provide products and services to our customers. While we do not believe that such a disruption is likely, if it did occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

There can be no assurance that the protective measures we currently employ will be adequate to prevent the unauthorized use or disclosure of our technology, or the independent third party development of the same or similar technology. Although our competitive position to some extent depends on our ability to protect our proprietary and trade secret information, we believe that other factors, such as the technical expertise and knowledge base of our management and technical personnel, as well as the timeliness and quality of the support services we provide, will also help us to maintain our competitive position.

Employees 

As of December 26, 2015, we employed approximately 344 individuals on a full-time equivalent basis compared to approximately 459 individuals on a full-time equivalent basis as of December 27, 2014. The 25% decrease in personnel in 2015 was primarily attributable to the attrition of employees as upstream oil and gas industry projects were canceled and the awards for new projects declined overall. We believe that our ability to recruit and retain highly skilled and experienced professional and technical personnel has been and will continue to be critical to our ability to execute our business plan. While the overall number of employees has declined, during 2015 we strategically hired several talented, experienced individuals with significant connections with our current and new customers to expand our product offerings to our existing customers and to gain market share. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or is subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that relations with our employees are good. 

&#160; 

Government Regulations 

ENGlobal and certain of its subsidiaries are subject to various foreign, federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to our business and operations, and various health and safety regulations established by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). We are subject to a variety of state, local and foreign licensing, registration and other regulatory requirements governing the practice of engineering and other professional disciplines. For example, OSHA requires Process Safety Management to prevent the release of hazardous chemicals, the Department of Transportation (DOT) requires that pipeline operators are in full compliance with pipeline safety regulations, and the Environmental and Protection Agency (EPA) provides incentives to reduce chemical emissions. Currently, we are not aware of any situation or condition relating to the regulation of the Company, its subsidiaries, or personnel that we believe is likely to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. 

&#160; 

Benefit Plans 

ENGlobal sponsors a 401(k) retirement plan for its employees. The Company, at the direction of the Board of Directors, may make discretionary contributions. Our employees may elect to make contributions pursuant to a salary reduction agreement upon meeting age and length-of-service requirements. For active participants, we match 33.3% of elective deferrals up to 6%, for a maximum of 2% of an employee&#8217;s compensation. We have made contributions totaling $358,279 and $386,377 to the plan for the years ended December 26, 2015 and December 27, 2014, respectively. 

Geographic Areas 

In 2015 and 2014, substantially all of our operations were in the United States except for the project located in Russia and Kazakhstan known as the CPC Project. The CPC Project is engineering, procurement, and commissioning services agreement with the Caspian Pipeline Consortium. Granted under two contracts, one in the Russian Federation and one in the Republic of Kazakhstan, the three-phase project are expected to have a total value of approximately $86 million over the life of the contract, of which approximately $14.0 million remains in our backlog as of December 26, 2015, and is expected to be completed in 2016 and 2017. This project contributed revenues of approximately $11.8 million and $17.7 million for the years ended December 26, 2015 and December 27, 2014, respectively.
