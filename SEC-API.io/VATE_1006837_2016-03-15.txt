 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

Unless the context otherwise requires, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, &#8220;HC2,&#8221; means HC2 Holdings, Inc. and the &#8220;Company,&#8221; &#8220;we&#8221; and &#8220;our&#8221; mean HC2 together with its consolidated subsidiaries. 

General 

We are a diversified holding company that seeks opportunities to acquire and grow businesses that can generate long-term sustainable free cash flow and attractive returns in order to maximize value for all stakeholders. As of December 31, 2015, our seven reportable operating segments based on management&#8217;s organization of the enterprise included Manufacturing, Marine Services, Insurance, Telecommunications, Utilities, Life Sciences and Other, which includes operations that do not meet the separately reportable segment thresholds. 

Our principal operating subsidiaries include the following assets: 

(i) 

Schuff International, Inc. (Manufacturing), a leading structural steel fabricator and erector in the United States; 

(ii) 

Global Marine Systems Limited (Marine Services), a leading provider of engineering and underwater services on submarine cables; 

(iii) 

Continental Insurance Inc. (Insurance), a platform for our run-off long-term care business, through its two insurance companies, United Teacher Associates Insurance Company ("UTA") and Continental General Insurance Company ("CGI", and together with UTA, the "Insurance Companies"); 

(iv) 

PTGi-International Carrier Services ("PTGi-ICS") (Telecommunications), a provider of internet-based protocol and time-division multiplexing access and transport of long distance voice minutes; 

(v) 

American Natural Gas (Utilities), a compressed natural gas fueling company; and 

(vi) 

Pansend Life Sciences, Ltd. (Life Sciences), our subsidiary focused on supporting healthcare and biotechnology product development. 

We expect to continue to focus on acquiring and investing in businesses with attractive assets that we consider to be undervalued or fairly valued and growing our acquired businesses. 

The Company has made other investments in start-up companies that operate in the technology and interactive gaming industries. 

Overall Business Strategy 

We evaluate strategic and business alternatives, which may include the following: acquiring assets or businesses unrelated to our current or historical operations, operating, growing or acquiring additional assets or businesses related to our current or historical operations, or winding down or selling our existing operations. We generally pursue either controlling positions in durable, cash-flow generating businesses or companies we believe exhibit substantial growth potential. We may choose to actively assemble or re-assemble a company&#8217;s management team to ensure the appropriate expertise is in place to execute the operating objectives of such business. We view ourselves as strategic and financial partners and seek to align our management teams&#8217; incentives with our goal of delivering sustainable long-term value to our shareholders. 

As part of any acquisition strategy, we may raise capital in the form of debt or equity securities (including preferred stock) or a combination thereof. We have broad discretion in selecting a business strategy for the Company. If we elect to pursue an acquisition, we have broad discretion in identifying and selecting both the industries and the possible acquisition or business combination opportunities. We have not identified a specific industry to focus on and there can be no assurance that we will, or we will be able to, identify or successfully complete any such transactions. In connection with evaluating these strategic and business alternatives, we may at any time be engaged in ongoing discussions with respect to possible acquisitions, business combinations and debt or equity securities offerings of widely varying sizes. There can be no assurance that any of these discussions will result in a definitive agreement and if they do, what the terms or timing of any agreement would be. While we search for additional acquisition opportunities, we manage a portion of our available cash and acquire interests in possible acquisition targets through our wholly-owned subsidiary, HC2 Investment Securities, Inc., a Delaware corporation. 

Competition 

HC2 could encounter competition for acquisition and business opportunities from other entities having similar business objectives, such as strategic investors and private equity firms, which could lead to higher prices for acquisition targets. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and executing transactions directly or through affiliates. Our financial resources and human resources may be relatively limited when contrasted with many of these competitors which may place us at a competitive disadvantage. Finally, managing rapid growth could create higher corporate expenses, as compared to many of our competitors who may be at a different stage of growth. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately 1,970 employees. We consider our relations with our employees to be satisfactory. 

Our Operating Subsidiaries 

Manufacturing Segment (Schuff) 

Schuff is a fully integrated fabricator and erector of structural steel and heavy steel plate. Schuff fabricates and erects structural steel for commercial and industrial construction projects such as high- and low-rise buildings and office complexes, hotels and casinos, convention centers, sports arenas, shopping malls, hospitals, dams, bridges, mines and power plants. Schuff also fabricates trusses and girders and specializes in the fabrication and erection of large-diameter water pipe, water storage tanks, pollution control scrubbers, tunnel liners, pressure vessels, strainers, filters, separators and a variety of customized products. Schuff&#8217;s operations make up our Manufacturing segment. 

Schuff&#8217;s results of operations are affected primarily by (i) the level of commercial and industrial construction in its principal markets; (ii) its ability to win project contracts; (iii) the number and complexity of project changes requested by customers or general contractors; (iv) its success in utilizing its resources at or near full capacity; and (v) its ability to complete contracts on a timely and cost-effective basis. The level of commercial and industrial construction activity is related to several factors, including local, regional and national economic conditions, interest rates, availability of financing, and the supply of existing facilities relative to demand. 

&#160; 

Strategy 

Schuff&#8217;s objective is to achieve and maintain a leading position in the geographic regions and project segments that it serves by providing timely, high-quality services to its customers. Schuff is pursuing this objective with a strategy comprised of the following components: 

&#8226; 

Pursue Large, Value-Added Design-Build Projects . Schuff&#8217;s unique ability to offer design-build services, a full range of steel construction services and project management capabilities makes it a preferred partner for complex, design-build fabrication projects in the geographic regions it serves. This capability often enables Schuff to bid against fewer competitors in a less traditional, more negotiated selection process on these projects, thereby offering the potential for higher margins while providing overall cost savings and project flexibility and efficiencies to its customers; 

&#8226; 

Expand and Diversify Revenue Base . Schuff is seeking to expand and diversify its revenue base by leveraging its long-term relationships with national and multi-national construction and engineering firms, national and regional accounts and other customers. Schuff also intends to continue to grow its operations by targeting smaller projects that carry higher margins and less risk of large margin fluctuations. Schuff believes that continuing to diversify its revenue base by completing smaller projects-such as low-rise office buildings, healthcare facilities and other commercial and industrial structures-could reduce the impact of periodic adverse market or economic conditions as well as potential margin slippage that may accompany larger projects; 

&#8226; 

Emphasize Innovative Services . Schuff focuses its design-build, engineering, detailing, fabrication and erection expertise on larger, more complex projects, where it typically experiences less competition and more advantageous negotiated contract opportunities. Schuff has extensive experience in providing services requiring complex fabrication and erection techniques and other unusual project needs, such as specialized transportation, steel treatment or specialty coating applications. These service capabilities have enabled Schuff to address such design-sensitive projects as stadiums and uniquely designed hotels and casinos; and 

&#8226; 

Diversify Customer and Product Base . Although Schuff seeks to garner a leading share of the geographic and product markets in which it competes, it also seeks to diversify its construction projects across a wide range of commercial, industrial, and specialty projects, including projects related to the oil &#38; gas and alternative energy industries. 

Services and/or Products and Customers 

Schuff operates primarily within the over $600 billion non-residential construction industry, which serves a diverse set of end markets. As shown on the chart below, while non-residential construction has shown only a small rebound since 2011, industry experts expect that it will follow the already significant rebound in residential construction spending. Despite only a modest increase in non-residential construction spending, Schuff&#8217;s backlog has already rebounded to pre-economic crisis levels. 

Historical U.S. Total Construction Spend 

Schuff consists of three business units spread across diverse steel markets: Schuff Steel Company (steel fabrication and erection), Schuff Steel Management Company (management of smaller projects, leveraging subcontractors) and the Aitken product line ("Aitken") (manufacturing of equipment for the oil &#38; gas industry). For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, Schuff Steel&#8217;s revenues of $470 million account for 92% of Schuff&#8217;s total revenue. Schuff Steel Management Company&#8217;s revenues of $26 million account for 5% of Schuff&#8217;s total revenue. Aitken's revenues of $6 million account for 1% of Schuff&#8217;s total revenue. Schuff also provides fabricated steel to Canada and other select countries, including Panama, where Schuff owns 49% of Panama-based Schuff Hopsa Engineering, Inc., an engineering design, steel fabrication and erection company, Empresas Hopsa, S.A. Schuff Hopsa Engineering, Inc.&#8217;s revenues of $12 million account for 2% of Schuff&#8217;s total revenue. In 2015, Schuff's single largest customer represented approximately 23% of revenues. 

Schuff&#8217;s size gives it production capacity to complete large-scale, demanding projects, with typical utilization per facility ranging from 50%-70% and a sales pipeline that includes over $455 million in potential revenue generation. Schuff has benefited from being one of the largest players in a market that is highly fragmented across many small firms. Schuff outperformed many of its competitors in the recent downturn due to its strong financial position and continued access to bonding facilities, whereas many competitors were forced to close their doors. 

Schuff ensures a highly efficient and cost-effective construction process by focusing on collaborating with all project participants and utilizing its extensive design-build and design-assist capabilities with its clients. Additionally, Schuff enjoys in-house fabrication and erection combined with access to a network of subcontractors for smaller projects in order to provide high quality solutions for its customers. Schuff offers a range of services across a broad geography through its 9 fabrication shops and 9 sales and management facilities located in the United States and Panama. 

Schuff operates with minimal bonding requirements, with the current balance of less than 11% of Schuff's backlog as of December 31, 2015, and bonding is reduced as projects are billed, rather than upon completion. Schuff has limited raw material cost exposure by securing fixed prices from mills at contract bid, and utilizing its purchasing power as the largest domestic buyer of wide flange beam in the United States. 

Products 

Schuff Steel offers a variety of services to its customers which it believes enhances our ability to obtain and successfully complete projects. These services fall into six distinct groups: design-assist/design-build, pre-construction design &#38; budgeting, steel management, fabrication, erection, and Building Information Modeling (&#8220;BIM&#8221;). 

&#8226; 

Design-Assist/Design-Build: &#32;Using the latest technology and BIM, Schuff works to provide clients with cost-effective steel designs. The end result is turnkey structural steel solutions for its diverse client base. 

&#8226; 

Pre-construction Design &#38; Budgeting: &#32;Clients who contact Schuff in the early stages of planning can receive a Schuff-performed analysis of the structure and cost breakdown. Both of these tools allow clients to accurately plan and budget for any upcoming project. 

&#8226; 

Steel Management: &#32;Using Schuff&#8217;s proprietary Schuff Steel Integrated Management System (&#8220;SSIMS&#8221;), Schuff can track any piece of steel and instantly know its location. Additionally, Schuff can help clients manage steel subcontracts, providing clients with savings on raw steel purchases and giving them access to variety of Schuff-approved subcontractors. 

&#8226; 

Fabrication: &#32;Through its nine fabrication shops in California, Arizona, Texas, Kansas and Georgia, Schuff has one of the highest fabrication capacities in America. Schuff has over 1.1 million square feet of steel under roof and a maximum annual fabrication capacity of approximately 300,000 tons. 

&#8226; 

Erection: &#32;Named the nation&#8217;s top steel erector in 2007, 2008, 2011, 2013, 2014 and 2015 by Engineering News-Record, Schuff knows how to add value to its project through safe and efficient erection of steel structures. 

&#8226; 

BIM: &#32;Schuff is experienced in using BIM on every project to manage its role efficiently. Additionally Schuff&#8217;s use of SSIMS in conjunction with BIM allows for real-time reporting of a project&#8217;s progress and information-rich model review. 

Schuff Steel Management Company provides turn-key steel fabrication and erection services with an expertise in project management. Using these skills, Schuff Steel Management Company uses its relationships with reliable subcontractors and erectors, along with state-of-the-art management systems, to deliver excellence to clients.

Customers 

Schuff offers its integrated steel construction services primarily to general contractors and engineering firms that specialize in a wide variety of projects, including the following: hotels and casinos, office complexes, hospitals, manufacturing plants, shopping malls and centers, sports stadiums, power plants, restaurants, convention facilities, entertainment complexes, airports, schools, churches and warehouses. In 2015, Schuff's single largest customer represented approximately 23% of revenues. In 2014, the same customer represented approximately 12% of revenues. 

Suppliers 

Schuff currently purchases a majority of its steel from various foreign and domestic steel producers but is not dependent on any one producer. 

Sales and Distributions 

Schuff offers its services primarily to general contractors and engineering firms that focus on a wide array of projects such as airports, malls, power plants, stadiums, shopping malls and centers. Schuff obtains these contracts through competitive bidding or negotiation, which generally are fixed-price, cost-plus, or unit cost arrangements. Bidding and negotiations require Schuff to estimate the costs of the project up front with most projects typically lasting from one to 12 months. However, large, complex projects can often last two years or more. 

Marketing 

Sales managers lead Schuff&#8217;s domestic sales and marketing efforts. Each sales manager is responsible primarily for estimating, sales, and marketing efforts in defined geographic areas. In addition, Schuff employs full-time project estimators and chief estimators. Schuff&#8217;s sales representatives maintain relationships with general contractors, architects, engineers, and other potential sources of business to determine potential new projects under consideration. Schuff generates future project reports to track the weekly progress of new opportunities. Schuff&#8217;s sales efforts are further supported by most of its executive officers and engineering personnel, who have substantial experience in the design, fabrication, and erection of structural steel and heavy steel plate. 

Schuff competes for new project opportunities through its relationships and interaction with its active and prospective customer base, which provides valuable current market information and sales opportunities. In addition, Schuff is contacted by governmental agencies in connection with public construction projects, and by large private-sector project owners, general contractors and engineering firms in connection with new building projects such as plants, warehouse and distribution centers, and other industrial and commercial facilities. 

Upon selection of projects to bid or price, Schuff&#8217;s estimating division reviews and prepares projected costs of shop, field, detail drawing preparation and crane hours, steel and other raw materials, and other costs. On bid projects, a formal bid is prepared detailing the specific services and materials Schuff plans to provide, payment terms and project completion timelines. Upon acceptance, Schuff&#8217;s bid proposal is finalized in a definitive contract. 

Backlog 

Schuff&#8217;s backlog was $380.8 million &#32;( $252.7 million &#32;under contracts or purchase orders and $128.1 million &#32;under letters of intent) at December 31, 2015. Schuff&#8217;s backlog increases as contract commitments, letters of intent, notices to proceed and purchase orders are obtained, decreases as revenues are recognized and increases or decreases to reflect modifications in the work to be performed under the contracts, notices to proceed, letters of intent or purchase orders. Schuff&#8217;s backlog can be significantly affected by the receipt, or loss, of individual contracts. Approximately $167.8 million , representing 44.1% &#32;of Schuff&#8217;s backlog at December 31, 2015, was attributable to five contracts, letters of intent, notices to proceed or purchase orders. If one or more of these large contracts or other commitments are terminated or their scope reduced, Schuff&#8217;s backlog could decrease substantially. Schuff's backlog at December 31, 2014 was $357.0 million ($305.3 million under contracts or purchase orders and $51.7 million under letters of intent). At December 29, 2013, its backlog was $426.9 million ($370.1 million under contracts or purchase orders and $56.8 million under letters of intent). 

Competition 

The principal geographic and product markets Schuff serves are highly competitive, and this intense competition is expected to continue. Schuff competes with other contractors for commercial, industrial and specialty projects on a local, regional, or national basis. Continued service within these markets requires substantial resources and capital investment in equipment, technology and skilled personnel, and certain of Schuff&#8217;s competitors have financial and operating resources greater than Schuff. Competition also places downward pressure on Schuff&#8217;s contract prices and margins. Among the principal competitive factors within the industry are price, timeliness of completion of projects, quality, reputation, and the desire of customers to utilize specific contractors with whom they have favorable relationships and prior experience. While Schuff believes that it maintains a competitive advantage with respect to these factors, failure to continue to do so or to meet other competitive challenges could have a material adverse effect on Schuff&#8217;s results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015, Schuff employed approximately 1,500 people across the country. The number of persons Schuff employs on an hourly basis fluctuates directly in relation to the amount of business Schuff performs. Certain of the fabrication and erection personnel Schuff employs are represented by the United Steelworkers of America and the International Association of Bridge, Structural, Ornamental and Reinforcing Iron Workers Union. Schuff is a party to several separate collective bargaining agreements with these unions in certain of its current operating regions, which expire (if not renewed) at various times in the future. Approximately 31% of Schuff&#8217;s employees are covered under various collective bargaining agreements. Most of Schuff&#8217;s collective bargaining agreements are subject to automatic annual or other renewal unless either party elects to terminate the agreement on the scheduled expiration date. Approximately 9% of Schuff&#8217;s employees are covered under a collective bargaining agreement that has expired but is currently being renegotiated. Schuff considers its relationship with its employees to be good and, other than sporadic and unauthorized work stoppages of an immaterial nature, none of which have been related to its own labor relations, Schuff has not experienced a work stoppage or other labor disturbance. 

Schuff strategically utilizes third-party fabrication and erection subcontractors on many of its projects and also subcontracts detailing services from time to time when economically beneficial and/or Schuff requires additional capacity for such services. Schuff&#8217;s inability to engage fabrication, erection and detailing subcontractors on terms favorable to it could limit its ability to complete projects in a timely manner or compete for new projects and could have a material adverse effect on its operations. 

Legal, Environmental and Insurance 

On July 9, 2015, a putative class action wage and hour lawsuit was filed against Schuff Steel Company ("SSC"), a subsidiary of Schuff, and Schuff International (collectively &#8220;Schuff&#8221;) in the Los Angeles County Superior Court [BC587322], captioned Dylan Leonard, individually and on behalf of other members of the general public v. Schuff Steel Company and Schuff International, Inc . The complaint makes generic allegations of numerous violations of California wage and hour laws and claims that Schuff failed to pay for overtime; failed to pay for meal and rest breaks; violated the minimum wage; failed to timely pay business expenses, wages and final wages; failed to keep requisite payroll records; and had non-compliant wage statements. On August 11, 2015, another putative class action wage and hour lawsuit was filed against SSC in San Joaquin County Superior Court [39-2015-0032-8373-CU-OE-STK], captioned Pablo Dominguez, on behalf of himself and all other similarly situated v. Schuff Steel Company . The Complaint alleges non-compliant wage statements and demands penalties pursuant to California Labor Code. On October 11, 2015, an amended complaint was filed in the Dominguez &#32;claim pursuing only the statutory claim based on the non-compliant wage statement. By Order dated December 17, 2015, the matters were designated as the Schuff Steel Wage and Hour Cases &#32;and assigned a coordination trial judge. No discovery schedule or trial date has been set. The Company believes that the allegations and claims set forth in the Complaints are without merit and intends to defend them vigorously. 

On December 28, 2015, The Chemours Company Mexico S. de R.L de C.V. (&#8220;Chemours&#8221;) filed a Demand for Arbitration (the &#8220;Demand&#8221;) against SSC with the American Arbitration Association, International Centre for Dispute Resolution, Case No. 01-15-0006-0956. Schuff had a purchase order to provide fabricated steel for the Line 2 Expansion of DuPont&#8217;s chemical plant in Altamira, Mexico (the &#8220;Project&#8221;). The Demand seeks recovery of an alleged mistaken payment of approximately $5,033,000 to SSC and additional damages in excess of $18 million for, among other reasons, alleged delays, failure to expedite, breach of assignment of subcontracting clauses, and backcharges for additional costs and rework of fabricated steel provide for the Project. On January 25, 2016, SSC filed an Answer and Counterclaim denying liability alleged by Chemours and seeking to recover the principal sum of approximately $311,000 for unpaid work on the Project as well as an additional sum for damages due to delays, impacts, and other wrongful conduct by Chemours and its agents. No Arbitration schedule or hearing date has been set. The Company believes that the allegations and claims set forth in the Demand are without merit and intends to defend them vigorously and aggressively pursue Chemours for additional monies owed and damages sustained. 

Schuff is subject to other claims and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. Such matters are inherently uncertain, and there can be no guarantee that the outcome of any such matter will be decided favorably to Schuff or that the resolution of any such matter will not have a material adverse effect upon Schuff or the Company&#8217;s business, consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Neither Schuff nor the Company believes that any of such pending claims and legal proceedings will have a material adverse effect on its business, consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 

Schuff&#8217;s operations and properties are affected by numerous federal, state and local environmental protection laws and regulations, such as those governing discharges to air and water and the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. Compliance with these laws and regulations has become increasingly stringent, complex and costly. There can be no assurance that such laws and regulations or their interpretation will not change in a manner that could materially and adversely affect Schuff&#8217;s operations. Certain environmental laws, such as the CERCLA and its state law counterparts, provide for strict and joint and several liability for investigation and remediation of spills and other releases of toxic and hazardous substances. These laws may apply to conditions at properties currently or formerly owned or operated by an entity or its predecessors, as well as to conditions at properties at which wastes or other contamination attributable to an entity or its predecessors come to be located. Although Schuff has not incurred any material environmental related liability in the past and believes that it is in material compliance with environmental laws, there can be no assurance that Schuff, or entities for which it may be responsible, will not incur such liability in connection with the investigation and remediation of facilities it currently operates (or formerly owned or operated) or other locations in a manner that could materially and adversely affect its operations. 

Schuff maintains commercial general liability insurance in the amount of $1.0 million per occurrence and $2.0 million in the aggregate. In addition, Schuff maintains umbrella coverage limits of $25.0 million. Schuff also maintains insurance against property damage caused by fire, flood, explosion and similar catastrophic events that may result in physical damage or destruction of its facilities and property. All policies are subject to various deductibles and coverage limitations. Although Schuff&#8217;s management believes that its insurance is adequate for its present needs, there can be no assurance that it will be able to maintain adequate insurance at premium rates that management considers commercially reasonable, nor can there be any assurance that such coverage will be adequate to cover all claims that may arise. 

Marine Services Segment (GMSL) 

GMSL is a global offshore engineering company focused on specialist subsea services across three market sectors, namely telecommunications, oil &#38; gas and offshore power. GMSL&#8217;s operations make up our Marine Services segment. 

Strategy Overview 

GMSL is a leading independent operator in the subsea cable installation and maintenance markets. GMSL aims to maintain its leading market position in the telecommunications maintenance segment and will look for opportunities to grow the installation activities in the three main segments of the market and installation in the telecommunications sector while capitalizing on high market growth in the offshore power sector through expansion of its installation and maintenance services in that sector. In order to accomplish these goals GMSL has crafted a comprehensive strategy which includes: 

&#8226; 

Developing opportunities in the offshore power market following the expiration of the Prysmian UK Group Limited ("Prysmian") non-compete agreement in November 2015 (see "Offshore Power" below); 

&#8226; 

Diversify the business by pursuing growth within GMSL&#8217;s three market segments (telecommunications, oil &#38; gas, and offshore power) which we believe will strengthen GMSL&#8217;s quality of earnings and reduce exposure to one particular market segment; 

&#8226; 

Retain and build its leading position in telecommunications maintenance and installation; 

&#8226; 

Work to develop convergence of GMSL&#8217;s maintenance services across all three market segments; and 

&#8226; 

Encourage overall consolidation in the wider subsea cables market by pursuing targeted mergers &#38; acquisitions, joint ventures or partnerships, allowing a larger operating platform and benefitting from increased operating efficiencies. 

GMSL has a highly experienced management team with a proven track record and has demonstrated the ability to enter new markets and generate returns for investors. The senior management team has in excess of 70 years combined experience within the telecommunications, oil &#38; gas, and offshore power segments. 

GMSL&#8217;s three sectors of focus for providing subsea cable services are telecommunications installation and maintenance, oil &#38; gas installation and offshore power installation. 

Telecommunications: GMSL provides maintenance and installation to its global telecommunications customers. GMSL has a long, well-established reputation in the telecommunications sector and is considered a leading provider of subsea services in the industry. It operates in a mature market and is the largest independent provider in the maintenance segment. GMSL provides vessels on standby to repair fiber optic telecommunications cables in defined geographic zones, and its maintenance business is provided through contracts with consortia of up to 60 global telecommunications providers. Typically, GMSL enters into five to seven year contracts to provide maintenance to cable systems that are located in specific geographical areas. These contracts provide highly stable, predictable and recurring revenue and earnings. Additionally, GMSL provides installation of cable systems including route planning, mapping, route engineering, cable-laying, trenching and burial. GMSL&#8217;s installation business is project-based with contracts typically lasting one to five months. 

&#160; 

Oil &#38; Gas: GMSL provides installation, maintenance and repair of fiber optic communication and power infrastructure to offshore platforms, through which it realizes higher margins due to implementation complexity. Its primary activities include providing power from shore, enabling fiber-based communication between platforms and shore-based systems and installing permanent reservoir monitoring systems which allow customers to monitor subsea seismic data. The majority of GMSL&#8217;s oil &#38; gas business is contracted on a project-by-project basis with major energy producers or Tier I engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contractors. 

Offshore Power: GMSL&#8217;s former subsidiary Global Marine Energy (&#8220;GME&#8221;) was established in 2011 as the vehicle for GMSL&#8217;s significant offshore power activities, which include installing inter-array power cables for use in offshore wind farms and in the offshore wind market. GME was sold to Prysmian in November 2012 in anticipation of a temporary downturn in the offshore power market and the onerous contracting regime present at the time. As part of this sale, GMSL entered into a non-compete agreement regarding offshore power operations with Prysmian but retained certain key personnel and assets to ensure that GMSL maintained its core capabilities and experience in the offshore power sector. Following entry into this non-compete agreement, GMSL continued to install offshore power cables on behalf of Prysmian with chartered vessels through June 2014. The non-compete agreement expired in November 2015. Since November 2015, due to the expiration of the Prysmian non-compete agreement, GMSL has been able to recommence bidding for projects in the high-growth, high-margin offshore power market. Given that renewable energy production is predicted to grow over the next decade, with a substantial proportion of that 

energy to be harvested offshore, GMSL is well positioned to capitalize on this anticipated growth of the offshore alternative energy market in both construction and operations &#38; maintenance, with a strong presence in Northern Europe and Asia, especially China. 

Services and/or Products and Customers 

GMSL is a pioneer in the subsea cable industry having laid the first subsea cable in the 1850s and installed the first transatlantic fiber optic cable (TAT-8) in 1988. Over the last 30 years, GMSL estimates that it has installed approximately 300,000 kilometers of cable, which management believes represents almost a quarter of all the fiber optic cable on the global seabed today. GMSL is positioned as a global independent market leader in subsea cable installation and maintenance services and derives approximately 50% of its total revenue from long term, recurring maintenance contracts. GMSL has a strong financial position with a modest level of debt (consisting only of vessel financing), has delivered substantial growth during recent years, generates a substantial amount of cash and serves a diverse mix of global, blue-chip clients with excellent credit profiles. It has started a new phase of growth through applying its capabilities to the rapidly expanding offshore power sector into which GMSL re-entered in November 2015, as discussed above, while retaining a leading position in the telecommunications sector. As a result of this growth, GMSL has major offices in the United Kingdom and Singapore, and has additional presence in Bermuda, Canada, China, Indonesia and the Philippines. See Item IA-&#8220;Risk Factors-Risks Related to GMSL-GMSL derives a significant amount of its revenues from sales to customers in non-U.S. countries, which pose additional risks including economic, political and other uncertainties&#8221; for a description of risks attendant to such foreign operations. GMSL operates one of the largest specialist cable laying fleets in the world, consisting of seven vessels (five owned and two operated through long-term leases). 

Growth Opportunities 

Today, GMSL is positioned as a leading global independent market leader in subsea cable installation and maintenance services. GMSL has a strong financial position, has delivered substantial profit growth during recent years, and generates a substantial amount of cash. It has started a new phase of growth through transferring its capabilities to the rapidly expanding demand in the offshore power sector into which GMSL re-entered in November 2015, as discussed above, while retaining its leading position in the telecommunications sector. GMSL believes it has installed more offshore wind inter-array cables than any other provider and, following the sale of GME in November 2012, remains well positioned as one of the leading installers of cables in the offshore power sector. Management believes the offshore wind farm operations and maintenance sub-sector represents a significant opportunity for GMSL and is developing strategies to realize that opportunity. 

&#160; 

Following the sale of GME, GMSL has remained one of the leading installers of cables in relation to supporting the growth in the offshore power market and GMSL&#8217;s track record in these types of projects includes the following: 

&#8226; 

Experimental UK farm, Blythe, for Shell 

&#8226; 

London Array Ltd: inter-array cables for London Array project 

&#8226; 

RWE: 4 export cables for Gwynt y Mor project 

&#8226; 

C-Power: inter-array cables for Thornton Bank project (Belgium) 

&#8226; 

Dong Energy: Inter-array cables for Horns Rev project, Denmark (three phases) 

&#8226; 

Vattenfall: 3 export cables for Kentish Flats project 

&#8226; 

EON/Shell: power and fiber optic cables for Blythe project 

&#8226; 

GT1: largest German wind farm to date 

Fleet Overview 

GMSL operates one of the largest, specialist cable laying fleets consisting of 7 vessels (5 owned, 2 operated through long-term leases). The average age of GMSL&#8217;s owned and operated fleet is 22 years, which is approximately the same as the industry average. Each vessel is equipped with specialist inspection, burial, and survey equipment. By providing oil &#38; gas, offshore power, and telecommunications installation as well as telecommunications maintenance, GMSL can retain vessels throughout their asset lives by cascading them through different uses as they age. This provides a significant competitive advantage as GMSL can retain vessels for longer and reduce the frequency of capital expenditure requirements with a longer amortization period. GMSL&#8217;s fleet is operated by GMSL employees or long-term contractors.

Product Research &#38; Development 

Drawing on its long experience in the subsea cable market, over the years GMSL has provided many important innovations to the subsea cable market. One such innovation was GEOCABLE, GMSL&#8217;s proprietary Geographical Information System (GIS), which GMSL believes to be the largest cable database in the market and was developed specifically to meet the needs of the cable industry. GEOCABLE is an important tool to any vendor planning subsea cable installation and GMSL sells data from GEOCABLE to third-party customers. 

In addition to GEOCABLE, GMSL also developed and owns intellectual property associated with the Universal Joint in a consortium with other industry participants, a product which easily and effectively links together cables from different manufacturers. The Universal Joint has gained such prevalence in the industry that new fiber optic cables may be certified to meet the specifications of the Universal Joint, which is a service provided by GMSL among others, so that the subsea cable manufacturer can ensure compatibility of its subsea cable with other existing subsea cables and the standardized equipment on board cable repair vessels. GMSL benefits from its sales of the Universal Joint, and proceeds from GMSL sponsored training of jointing skills, but GMSL also enjoys the industry leadership and brand enhancement that come with creation of an industry leading product. 

Intellectual Property 

GMSL is looking to protect its interests in intellectual property and closely monitors industry changes, including with respect to GEOCABLE and Universal Joint. 

Customers 

GMSL&#8217;s customer base is made up primarily of blue-chip companies. Within the two kinds of services provided by GMSL, maintenance and repair and installation, contract length varies. Maintenance and repair contracts tend to be long-term upon inception (5-7 years), with a relatively high level of expected renewal rates and the customer is typically a consortium of different cable owners such as national, regional and international telecommunication companies and others who have an ownership interest in the subsea cables covered by the maintenance contract. GMSL charges a standing fee for cost of vessels in port plus margin, paid in advance proportionally by each member, and an additional daily call out fee for repairs paid by the specific cable owner(s). All four maintenance vessels are engaged on GMSL&#8217;s three current long term telecommunications maintenance contracts with ACMA, SEAIOCMA, and NAZ. Installation contracts tend to be much shorter term (30-150 days) and the counterparty tends to be a single 

client. Contracts are typically bid for on a fixed-sum basis with an initial upfront payment plus subsequent installments providing working capital support. Due to the added complexity of cable installation as opposed to maintenance, GMSL generally realizes higher margins on its installation contracts in the oil &#38; gas and offshore power sectors. In 2015, GMSL experienced lower margins on its installation contracts as a result of competitive pressures supporting the aggressive market share expansion of GMSL&#8217;s most significant customer and the operations of GMSL's joint venture with Huawei Marine Networks, a turnkey installer of fiber optic cable and telecommunications systems. 

Sales and Distributions 

In the telecommunications cable market, cable maintenance is most often accomplished by zone maintenance contracts in which a consortium of telecommunications operators or cable owners contract with a maintenance provider like GMSL, over a long-term period of approximately five to seven years. GMSL has three cable maintenance agreements and these are a steady, high-quality source of income for GMSL. These maintenance contracts are usually re-awarded to incumbent providers unless there are significant performance issues which ultimately may mean that GMSL likely need not expend extra capital on retaining these contracts. GMSL constantly has a focused sales plan to build relationships with current and potential customers at regional and corporate offices and readily leverages Huawei Technologies&#8217; large sales organization. 

&#160; 

Marketing 

In the oil &#38; gas sector, GMSL has a focused sales and marketing plan to create relationships with major players in the oil &#38; gas industries. In particular and despite the prevailing low oil price market conditions, GMSL hopes to use its expertise in installing PRM systems to forge new contacts with both the end users of PRM services, such as oil majors, and the PRM suppliers themselves. Additionally GMSL hopes to pursue a strategy of specialization in installing the small power and fiber optic cables that its competitors in the oil &#38; gas and offshore power sectors find unprofitable and lack installation experience in. 

In order to aid these plans for expansion, GMSL plans on increasing its fleet of maintenance and installation vessels anywhere from one to three vessels over the next several years. In particular, GMSL purchased a remotely operated vehicle (&#8220;ROV&#8221;) in 2015. Furthermore, it intends to acquire an installation vessel in 2016, to replace one of its older maintenance vessels in 2016, and purchase both a new hard-ground trencher machine in 2017 as well as a new build vessel in 2018, as funded 75/25 through vessel-financing. 

Competition 

GMSL is one of the few companies that provide subsea cable installation and maintenance services on a worldwide basis. GMSL competes for contracts with companies that have worldwide operations, as well as numerous others operating locally in various areas. There are a number of players, mainly Asian based, who focus primarily on their countries of origin. Competition for GMSL&#8217;s services historically has been based on vessel availability, location of or ability to deploy these vessels and associated subsea equipment, quality of service and price. The relative importance of these factors can vary depending on the customer or specific project and also over time based on the prevailing market conditions. The ability to develop, train and retain skilled engineering personnel is also an important competitive factor in GMSL&#8217;s markets. 

GMSL believes that its ability to provide a wide range of subsea cable installation and maintenance services in the telecommunications, oil &#38; gas and offshore power sectors on a worldwide basis enables it to compete effectively in the industry in which it operates. However, in some cases involving projects that require less sophisticated vessel and subsea equipment, smaller companies may be able to bid for contracts at prices uneconomical to GMSL. In addition, GMSL&#8217;s competitors generally have the capability to move their vessels to where GMSL operates from other locations with relative ease, which may impact competition in the markets it serves. 

Management and Employees 

As of December 31, 2015, GMSL employed 316 people. GMSL&#8217;s employees are not formally represented by any labor union or other trade organization although the majority of the seafarers are members of an established trade union. GMSL considers relations with its employees to be satisfactory and it has never experienced a work stoppage or strike. GMSL regularly uses independent consultants and contractors to perform various professional services in different areas of the business, including in its installation and fleet operations and in certain administrative functions. Dick Fagerstal is a 3% interest holder, chairman and chief executive officer of Global Marine Holdings LLC, the parent holding company of Bridgehouse Marine Limited, and he is executive chairman of Global Marine Systems Limited. Mr. Fagerstal has served in an executive capacity for companies operating in various industries including energy, marine services, and their related infrastructure. 

Legal, Environmental and Insurance 

GMSL is from time to time subject to claims and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. Such matters are inherently uncertain, and there can be no guarantee that the outcome of any such matter will be decided favorably to GMSL or that the resolution of any such matter will not have a material adverse effect upon GMSL&#8217;s business, consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. GMSL does not believe that any of such pending claims and legal proceedings will have a material adverse effect on its business, consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 

GMSL has various kinds of insurance coverage including protection and indemnity, hull and machinery, war risk, and property insurances, directors and officers liability insurance, contract warranty insurance for the maintenance contracts, and all other necessary corporate insurances. GMSL&#8217;s liability is capped and insured under each of its installation contracts. 

Insurance Segment (Continental Insurance, Inc.) 

On December 24, 2015, we completed the acquisitions of Insurance Companies for aggregate consideration of approximately $18.6 million , subject to post-closing adjustments. The operations of the acquired companies were consolidated into our insurance operating segment, CIG. 

Strategy 

CIG currently provides long-term care, life and annuity coverage to approximately 99,000 individuals through its two Insurance Companies. The benefits provided by CIG's insurance operations help protect policy and certificate holders from the financial hardships associated with illness, injury, loss of life, or income discontinuation. In conjunction with the purchase of the Insurance Companies on December 24, 2015, an Administrative Services Agreement was entered into under which Great American Life Insurance Company ("GALIC") has agreed to continue to administer the Insurance Companies' life and annuity businesses. 

Employees and Operations . 

CIG has a concentrated focus on long-term care insurance and is committed to the continued delivery of the best-practices services established by our insurance operations to its policy and certificate holders. Through investments in technology, a commitment to attracting, developing and retaining best-in-class insurance professionals, a dedication to continuing process improvements, and a focus on strategic growth, we believe CIG will be well equipped to maintain and improve the level of service provided to its customers and assume a leading role in the long-term care industry. 

CIG&#8217;s plan is to leverage its existing platform and industry expertise to identify strategic growth opportunities for managing closed blocks of long-term care business. Growth opportunities are expected to come from: 

&#8226; 

future acquisitions of long-term care businesses and/or closed blocks of long-term care policies; 

&#8226; 

reinsurance arrangements; and 

&#8226; 

third party administration arrangements. 

Products 

Long Term Care Insurance 

CIG's long-term care insurance products pay a benefit which is either a specified daily indemnity amount or reimbursement of actual charges up to a daily maximum for long-term care services provided in the insured&#8217;s home or in assisted living or nursing facilities. Benefits begin after a waiting period, usually 90 days or less, and are generally paid for a period of three years, six years, or lifetime. 

Substantially all of the in-force long-term care insurance policies were sold after 1995 with all sales then being discontinued in January of 2010. Policies were issued in all states except for New York with Texas being the largest issue state with over 20% of the business. The existing block of policies include both individual and group products, but all individuals were individually underwritten. CIG's long-term care insurance products were sold on a guaranteed renewable basis which allows us to re-price in-force policies, subject to regulatory approval. As part of CIG's strategy for its long-term care insurance business, management has been implementing, and expects to continue to pursue, significant premium rate increases on its blocks of business as actuarially justified. Premium rates vary by age and are based on assumptions concerning morbidity, mortality, persistency, administrative 

expenses, and investment yields. CIG develops its assumptions based on its own claims and persistency experience and published industry tables. 

Life Insurance and Annuities 

CIG's life insurance products include Traditional, Term, Universal, and Interest Sensitive Life Insurance. Its annuity products include Flexible and Single Premium Deferred Annuities. CIG's life insurance business provides a personal financial safety net for individuals and their families. These products provide protection against financial hardship after the death of an insured. Some of these products also offer a savings element that can help accumulate funds to meet future financial needs. Annuities are long-term retirement saving instruments that benefit from income accruing on a tax-deferred basis. The issuer of the annuity collects premiums, credits interest or earnings on the policy and pays out a benefit upon death, surrender or annuitization. All life insurance and annuity products are closed to new business. The life insurance products were issued with both full and simplified underwriting. 

Customers 

CIG's long-term care insurance policies were marketed and sold to individuals between 1986 and 2010 for the purpose of providing defined levels of protection against the significant and escalating costs of long-term care services provided in the insured&#8217;s home or in assisted living or nursing facilities. Though CIG no longer actively markets new long-term care insurance products, it continues to service and receive net renewal premiums ($73.9 million in 2015, $74.0 million in 2014 and $76.8 million in 2013) on our in-force block of approximately 56,000 lives. Similarly, CIG continues to service and receive net renewal premiums ($13.1 million in 2015, $14.0 million in 2014 and $16.2 million in 2013) on its in-force block of approximately 43,000 life and annuity policies representing $326.1 million of net life face amount and $217.4 million of net annuity cash value at December 31, 2015. 

Employees and Operations 

As of December 31, 2015, CIG employed 77 people full-time, the majority of whom are employed on a salaried basis but some are on an hourly basis. Except for 2 remote employees working in California and Indiana, all other employees work out of the home office in Austin, TX. CIG considers its relations with its employees to be good and has never experienced a work stoppage or other labor disturbance. All operating centers maintain a cost effective and efficient operating model. 

Upon the purchase of UTA and CGI on December 24, 2015 a Transition Services Agreement was entered into with the prior owner, Great American Financial Resources ("Great American") in Cincinnati, OH, pursuant to which Great American agreed to continue to perform certain business functions such as IT, Finance, Investment, and Accounting for a period of 12 to 16 months to allow us time to secure the resources needed to take over those duties. Simultaneously, an Administrative Services Agreement was also entered into with Great American pursuant to which GALIC agreed to continue to administer the companies' life and annuity businesses for a period of no less than 5 years. 

Reinsurance 

CIG reinsures a significant portion of its insurance business with unaffiliated reinsurers. In a reinsurance transaction, a reinsurer agrees to indemnify another insurer for part or all of its liability under a policy or policies it has issued for an agreed upon premium. CIG participates in reinsurance activities in order to minimize exposure to significant risks, limit losses, and provide additional capacity for future growth. CIG also obtains reinsurance to meet certain capital requirements. 

Under the terms of the reinsurance agreements, the reinsurer agrees to reimburse CIG for the ceded amount in the event a claim is paid. Cessions under reinsurance agreements do not discharge CIG's obligations as the primary insurer. In the event that reinsurers do not meet their obligations under the terms of the reinsurance agreements, reinsurance recoverable balances could become uncollectible. CIG's amounts recoverable from reinsurers represent receivables from and/or reserves ceded to reinsurers. As of December 31, 2015, $294.1 million of total CIG long-term care insurance reserves and liabilities and $90.3 million of life and annuity reserves and liabilities were reinsured. 

Reserves for Policy Contracts and Benefits 

The applicable insurance laws under which insurance companies operate require that they report, as liabilities, policy reserves to meet future obligations on their outstanding policies. These reserves are the amounts which, with the additional premiums to be received and interest thereon compounded annually at certain assumed rates, are calculated to be sufficient to meet the various policy and contract obligations as they mature. These laws specify that the reserves shall not be less than reserves calculated using certain specified mortality and morbidity tables, interest rates, and methods of valuation required for statutory accounting. 

CIG calculates reserves in conformity with GAAP which differ from those specified by the laws of the various states and reported in the statutory financial statements. These differences result from the use of mortality and morbidity tables and interest assumptions which CIG believes are more representative of the expected experience for these policies than those required for statutory accounting purposes and also result from differences in actuarial reserving methods. 

The assumptions CIG uses to calculate its reserves are intended to represent an estimate of experience for the period that policy benefits are payable. If actual experience is not less favorable than our reserve assumptions, then reserves should be adequate to provide for future benefits and expenses. If experience is less favorable than the reserve assumptions, additional reserves may be required. The key experience assumptions include claim incidence rates, claim resolution rates, mortality and morbidity rates, policy persistency, interest rates, crediting spreads, and premium rate increases. CIG periodically reviews its experience and updates its policy reserves and reserves for all claims incurred, as it believes appropriate. 

The statements of income include the annual change in reserves for future policy and contract benefits. The change reflects a normal accretion for premium payments and interest buildup and decreases for policy terminations such as lapses, deaths, and benefit payments. If policy reserves using best estimate assumptions as of the date of a test for loss recognition are higher than existing policy reserves net of any deferred acquisition costs, the increase in reserves necessary to recognize the deficiency is also included in the change in reserves for future policy and contract benefits. 

For further discussion of reserves, refer to "Risk Factors" contained herein in Item 1A, "Critical Accounting Estimates" and the discussion of segment operating results included in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" contained herein in Item 7, and Notes 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies &#32; and 13. Life, Accident and Health Reserves &#32;of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" contained herein in Item 8. 

Investments 

CIG manages its cash and invested assets using an approach that is intended to balance quality, diversification, asset/liability matching, liquidity needs and investment return. The goals of the investment process are to optimize after-tax, risk-adjusted investment income and after-tax, risk-adjusted total return while managing the assets and liabilities on a cash flow and duration basis. CIG&#8217;s liabilities are primarily supported by investments in investment grade, fixed maturity securities reflected on the Company&#8217;s consolidated balance sheets. 

Upon the purchase of UTA and CGI on December 24, 2015 a Transition Services Agreement was entered into with the prior owner, Great American Financial Resources in Cincinnati, OH, a subsidiary of American Financial Group, under which American Money Management, a subsidiary of American Financial Group, has agreed to continue to perform investment management services related to UTA and CGI for a period of 12 to 16 months. 

Regulation 

The Company&#8217;s insurance company subsidiaries are subject to regulation in the jurisdictions where they do business. In general, the insurance laws of the various states establish regulatory agencies with broad administrative powers governing, among other things, premium rates, solvency standards, licensing of insurers, agents and brokers, trade practices, forms of policies, maintenance of specified reserves and capital for the protection of policyholders, deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders, investment activities and relationships between insurance subsidiaries and their parents and affiliates. Material transactions between insurance subsidiaries and their parents and affiliates generally must receive prior approval of the applicable insurance regulatory authorities and be disclosed. In addition, while differing from state to state, these regulations typically restrict the maximum amount of dividends that may be paid by an insurer to its shareholders in any twelve-month period without advance regulatory approval. Such limitations are generally based on net earnings or statutory surplus. 

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (&#8220;Dodd-Frank Act&#8221;), among other things, established a Federal Insurance Office (&#8220;FIO&#8221;) within the U.S. Treasury. Under this law, regulations will need to be created for the FIO to carry out its mandate to focus on systemic risk oversight. The FIO gathered information regarding the insurance industry and submitted a report to Congress in December 2013. The report concluded that a hybrid approach to regulation, involving a combination of state and federal government action, could improve the U.S. insurance system by attaining uniformity, efficiency and consistency, particularly with respect to solvency and market conduct regulation. We cannot predict the extent to which the report&#8217;s recommendations might result in changes to the current state-based system of insurance industry regulation or ultimately impact the Company&#8217;s operations. 

Most states have created insurance guaranty associations that assess solvent insurers to pay claims of insurance companies that become insolvent. Annual guaranty assessments for the Company&#8217;s insurance companies have not been material. 

Telecommunications Segment (PTGI-International Carrier Services ("PTGi-ICS")) 

Services and Customers 

Our PTGi-ICS business unit provides customers with internet-based protocol and time-division multiplexing (TDM) access and transport of long distance voice minutes. 

Competition 

PTGi-ICS competes for the business of other telecommunications carriers and resellers on the basis of price, service quality, financial strength, relationship and presence. Sales of wholesale long distance voice minutes are generated by connecting one telecom operator to another and charging a fee to do so. 

Network 

General . PTGi-ICS operates a global telecommunications network consisting of international gateway and domestic switching and related peripheral equipment, carrier-grade routers and switches for Internet and circuit based services. To ensure high-quality communications services, PTGi-ICS' network employs digital switching and fiber optic technologies, incorporates the use of VOIP protocols, SS7/C7 signaling and is supported by comprehensive network monitoring and technical support services. 

Switching Systems . PTGi-ICS' network makes use of a carrier-grade international gateway and domestic switch system, Internet routers and media gateways in the U.S with points of presence throughout the world via third party interconnections. 

Foreign Carrier Agreements . In selected countries where competition with the traditional Post Telegraph and Telecommunications companies (&#8220;PTTs&#8221;) is limited, PTGi-ICS has entered into foreign carrier agreements with PTTs or other service providers which permit us to provide traffic into and receive return traffic from these countries. 

Network Management and Control . PTGi-ICS owns and operates network management systems in Herndon, Virginia which are used to monitor and control our switching systems, global data network, and other digital transmission equipment used in our network. Additional network monitoring, network management, and traffic management services are supported from our contingent Network Management Center located in Guatemala City, Guatemala. The network management control centers operate seven days per week and 24 hours per day. 

Sales and Marketing 

PTGi-ICS markets its services through a variety of sales channels, as summarized below: 

&#8226; 

Trade Shows. PTGi-ICS attends industry trade shows around the globe throughout the year. At each trade show PTGi-ICS markets to both existing and potential new customers through prearranged meetings, social gatherings and networking. 

&#8226; 

Business Development. A world class sales team globally focuses on developing PTGi-ICS&#8217;s business potential through ongoing communication and face to face meetings 

Management Information and Billing Systems 

PTGi-ICS operates management information, network and customer billing systems supporting the functions of network and traffic management, customer service and customer billing. For financial reporting, PTGi-ICS consolidates information from each of our markets into a single database. 

PTGi-ICS believes that its financial reporting and billing systems are generally adequate to meet its business needs. However, in the future, PTGi-ICS may determine that it needs to invest additional capital to purchase hardware and software, license more specialized software and increase its capacity. 

Government Regulation 

PTGi-ICS is subject to varying degrees of regulation in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates. Local laws and regulations, and the interpretation of such laws and regulations, differ among those jurisdictions. There can be no assurance that (1) future regulatory, judicial and legislative changes will not have a material adverse effect on it; (2) domestic or international regulators 

or third parties will not raise material issues with regard to its compliance or noncompliance with applicable regulations; or (3) regulatory activities will not have a material adverse effect on it. 

Regulation of the telecommunications industry continues to change rapidly in many jurisdictions. Privatization, deregulation, changes in regulation, consolidation, and technological change have had, and will continue to have, significant effects on the industry. Although we believe that continuing deregulation with respect to portions of the telecommunications industry will create opportunities for firms such as us, there can be no assurance that deregulation and changes in regulation will be implemented in a manner that would benefit PTGi-ICS. 

The regulatory frameworks in certain jurisdictions in which we provide services as of December 31, 2015 are described below: 

United States. In the United States, PTGi-ICS' services are subject to the provisions of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the &#8220;Communications Act&#8221;), and other federal laws, the Federal Communications Commission (&#8220;FCC&#8221;) regulations, and the applicable laws and regulations of the various states. 

PTGi-ICS' interstate telecommunications services are subject to various specific common carrier telecommunications requirements set forth in the Communications Act and the FCC&#8217;s rules, including operating, reporting and fee requirements. Both federal and state regulatory agencies have broad authority to impose monetary and other penalties on PTGi-ICS for violations of regulatory requirements. 

International Service Regulation . The FCC has jurisdiction over common carrier services linking points in the U.S. to points in other countries. PTGi-ICS provides such services. Providers of such international common carrier services must obtain authority from the FCC under Section 214 of the Communications Act. PTGi-ICS has obtained the authorizations required to use, on a facilities and resale basis, various transmission media for the provision of international switched services and international private line services on a non-dominant carrier basis. The FCC is considering a number of possible changes to its rules governing international common carriers. We cannot predict how the FCC will resolve those issues or how its decisions will affect PTGi-ICS's international business. FCC rules permit non-dominant carriers such as PTGi-ICS to offer some services on a detariffed basis, where competition can provide consumers with lower rates and choices among carriers and services. 

On November 29, 2012, the FCC released an order removing the requirement for facilities-based U.S. carriers, like PTGi-ICS, with operating agreements with dominant foreign carriers, to abide by the FCC&#8217;s International Settlements Policy by following uniform accounting rates, an even split in settlement rates, and proportionate return of traffic, for agreements with carriers on all remaining U.S.-international routes with the exception of Cuba, thereby allowing carriers to negotiate market-based arrangements on those routes. The November 29, 2012 order also adopted a requirement for U.S. carriers to provide information about any above-benchmark settlement rates to the FCC on an as-needed basis in connection with an investigation or competition problems on selected routes or review of high consumer rates on either multiple or selected routes. PTGi-ICS may take advantage of these more flexible arrangements with non-dominant foreign carriers, and the greater pricing flexibility that may result, but PTGi-ICS may also face greater price competition from other international service carriers. On November 9, 2015, the FCC issued a Public Notice indicating that it has begun the process of including Cuba within the liberalized settlements policy established in 2012. We cannot predict the actions the FCC will take in the future or their potential effect on PTGi-ICS's international termination rates, costs, or revenues. 

Domestic Service Regulation . With respect to PTGi-ICS domestic U.S. telecommunications services, PTGi-ICS is considered a non-dominant interstate carrier subject to regulation by the FCC. FCC rules provide PTGi-ICS significant authority to initiate or expand its domestic interstate operations, but PTGi-ICS is required to obtain FCC approval to assume control of another telecommunications carrier or its assets, to transfer control of our operations to another entity, or to discontinue service. PTGi-ICS is also required to file various reports and pay various fees and assessments to the FCC and various state commissions. Among other things, interstate common carriers must offer service on a nondiscriminatory basis at just and reasonable rates. The FCC has jurisdiction to hear complaints regarding our compliance or non-compliance with these and other requirements of the Communications Act and the FCC&#8217;s rules. Among other regulations, PTGi-ICS is subject to the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (&#8220;CALEA&#8221;) and associated FCC regulations which require telecommunications carriers to configure their networks to facilitate law enforcement authorities to perform electronic surveillance. 

On November 8, 2013, the FCC released an order related to the completion of calls to rural areas. The order applies recordkeeping, retention and reporting obligations to certain providers of retail long-distance voice service. The rules require those providers to collect and retain information on long distance call attempts such as, but not limited to, the called number, the date and time of the call, the use of an intermediate provider, etc. The order also prohibits false audible ringing (the premature triggering of audible ring tones to the caller before the call setup request has reached the terminating service provider). While PTGi-ICS is not directly subject to these rules, PTGi-ICS may function as an intermediate provider within the meaning of these 

rules, which may require PTGi-ICS to provide information to its customers regarding calls that it carries on their behalf. We do not expect the costs of providing that information to be material. 

Interstate and international telecommunications carriers are required to contribute to the federal Universal Service Fund (&#8220;USF&#8221;). Carriers providing wholesale telecommunications services are not required to contribute with respect to services sold to customers that provide a written certification that the customers themselves will make the required contributions. If the FCC or the Universal Service Fund Administrator were to determine that the USF reporting for the Company, including PTGi-ICS, is not accurate or in compliance with FCC rules, PTGi-ICS could be subject to additional contributions, as well as to monetary fines and penalties. In addition, the FCC is considering revising its USF contribution mechanisms and the services considered when calculating the contribution. PTGi-ICS cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings or their potential effect on our contribution obligations. Some changes to the USF under consideration by the FCC may affect certain entities more than others, and we may be disadvantaged as compared to our competitors as a result of FCC decisions regarding USF. In addition, the FCC may extend the obligation to contribute to the USF to certain services that PTGi-ICS offers but that are not currently assessed USF contributions. 

&#160; 

FCC rules require providers that originate interstate or intrastate traffic on or destined for the PSTN to transmit the telephone number associated with the calling party to the next provider in the call path. Intermediate providers, such as PTGi-ICS, must pass calling party number (&#8220;CPN&#8221;) or charge number (&#8220;CN&#8221;) signaling information they receive from other providers unaltered, to subsequent providers in the call path. While PTGi-ICS believes that it is in compliance with this rule, to the extent that it passes traffic that does not have appropriate CPN or CN information, PTGi-ICS could be subject to fines, cease and desist orders, or other penalties.

Utilities Segment (American Natural Gas) 

American Natural Gas (&#8220;ANG&#8221;) is a premier retailer of compressed natural gas (&#8220;CNG&#8221;) that designs, builds, owns, operates and maintains natural gas fueling stations for the transportation industry. ANG&#8217;s principal business is supplying CNG for light-, medium- and heavy-duty vehicles and providing operation, repair and maintenance services for vehicle fleet customer stations. 

ANG focuses its efforts on customers in a variety of markets, including heavy-duty trucking, airports, refuse, industrial and institutional energy users and government fleets. ANG seeks to retain its customers by offering state of the art fueling stations with exemplary service levels. 

Market for Natural Gas as an Alternative Fuel for Vehicles 

As of December 2015, Natural Gas Vehicles for America ("NGV America") estimates that there were approximately 1,640 CNG fueling stations in the United States and about 153,000 natural gas vehicles on American roads, including 39,500 heavy-duty vehicles (e.g. tractors, refuse trucks and buses), 25,800 medium-duty vehicles (e.g. delivery vans and shuttles) and 87,000 light-duty vehicles (e.g. passenger cars, sport utility vehicles, trucks and vans). 

ANG believes that natural gas is an attractive alternative to gasoline and diesel for use as a vehicle fuel in the United States as it is plentiful, domestically produced, cleaner and generally cheaper than gasoline or diesel. Historically, oil, gasoline, and diesel prices have been highly volatile, while natural gas prices have generally been stable and lower than the cost of oil, gasoline and diesel on an energy equivalent basis. ANG also expects increasingly stringent federal, state and local air quality regulations, expanding initiatives by fleet operators to lower greenhouse gas emissions and increase fuel diversity and additional regulations mandating low carbon fuels, all of which supports increased market adoption of natural gas as an alternative to gasoline and diesel as a vehicle fuel. ANG believes these factors support current opportunities to market natural gas as a vehicle fuel in the United States. 

Benefits of Natural Gas Fuel 

Domestic and Plentiful Supply. Technological advances in natural gas drilling and production, including the widespread deployment of horizontal drilling techniques and the use of hydraulic fracturing, have unlocked vast natural gas reserves. The U.S. is now the number one producer of natural gas in the world, with proven, abundant and growing reserves of natural gas. 

Less Expensive. Due to the abundance of natural gas, the cost of natural gas in the U.S. is less than the cost of crude oil, on an energy equivalent basis. 

Based on projections from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, ANG believes that natural gas used as a transportation fuel will remain cheaper than gasoline and diesel for the foreseeable future. In addition, because the price of the natural gas 

commodity makes up a smaller portion of the cost of a gasoline gallon equivalent (&#8220;GGE&#8221;) of CNG relative to the commodity portion of the cost of a GGE of diesel or gasoline, the price of a GGE of CNG is less sensitive to increases in the underlying commodity cost. 

Cleaner. Natural gas contains less carbon than any other fossil fuel and thus produces fewer carbon dioxide emissions when burned. The California Air Resources Board ("CARB") has concluded that a CNG fueled vehicle emits 20 to 29 percent fewer greenhouse gas ("GHG") emissions than a comparable gasoline or diesel fueled vehicle on a well-to-wheel basis. Additionally, a study from Argonne National Laboratory, a research laboratory operated by the University of Chicago for the U.S. Department of Energy, indicates that natural gas vehicles produce at least 13 to 21 percent fewer GHG emissions than comparable gasoline and diesel fueled vehicles. 

Safer. As reported by NGV America, CNG is relatively safer than gasoline and diesel because it dissipates into the air when spilled or in the event of a vehicle accident. When released, CNG is less combustible than gasoline or diesel as it ignites only at relatively high temperatures. The fuel tanks and systems used in natural gas vehicles are subjected to a number of federally required safety tests, such as fire, environmental hazard, burst pressures, and crash testing, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. In addition, CNG is stored in above ground tanks and therefore the risk of soil or groundwater contamination is reduced. Currently, over 153,000 vehicles in the U.S. and 15.2 million worldwide, fuel safely with natural gas. 

Natural Gas Vehicles 

Natural gas vehicles use internal combustion engines similar to those used in gasoline or diesel powered vehicles. A natural gas vehicle uses sealed storage cylinders to hold CNG, specially designed fuel lines to deliver natural gas to the engine, and an engine tuned to run on natural gas. Natural gas fuels have higher octane content than gasoline or diesel, and the acceleration and other performance characteristics of natural gas vehicles are similar to those of gasoline or diesel powered vehicles of the same weight and engine class. Natural gas vehicles running on CNG are refueled using a hose and nozzle that makes an airtight seal with the vehicle's gas tank. For heavy-duty vehicles, spark ignited natural gas vehicles have proven to operate more quietly than diesel powered vehicles. Natural gas vehicles typically cost more than gasoline or diesel powered vehicles, primarily due to the higher cost of the storage systems that hold the CNG. 

Virtually any car, truck, bus or other vehicle is capable of being manufactured or modified to run on natural gas. Approximately 50 different manufacturers in the U.S. produce 100 models of heavy-, medium- and light-duty natural gas vehicles and engines. These vehicles include long-haul tractors, refuse trucks, regional tractors, transit buses, cement trucks, delivery trucks, vocational work trucks, school buses, shuttles, passenger sedans, pickup trucks and cargo and passenger vans. ANG expects that additional models and types of natural gas vehicles will become available as natural gas becomes more widely accepted as a vehicle fuel in the U.S. 

Products and Services 

CNG Sales. ANG sells CNG through fueling stations. CNG fueling station sales are made through stations located either on ANG owned or on ANG&#8217;s customers' properties and through ANG&#8217;s network of public access fueling stations. At these CNG fueling stations, ANG procures natural gas from local utilities or third-party marketers under standard, floating-rate or locked-in rate arrangements and then compresses and dispenses it into customers' vehicles. ANGs CNG fueling station sales are made primarily through contracts with customers. Under these contracts, pricing is principally determined on a cost plus basis, which is calculated by adding a margin to the utility price for natural gas. As a result, CNG total sales revenues increase or decrease as a result of an increase or decrease in the price of natural gas. The balance of ANG&#8217;s CNG fueling station sales are on a per fill-up basis at prices set at public access stations based on prevailing market conditions. 

O&#38;M Services. ANG performs operate and maintain (&#8220;O&#38;M&#8221;) services for CNG stations that are owned by their customers. For these services, ANG generally charges either a monthly or per-GGE fee based on the volume of CNG dispensed at the station. 

Station Construction and Engineering. ANG builds state of the art fueling stations, either serving as general contractor or supervising qualified third-party contractors, for themselves or their customers. ANG has also acquired existing stations that they did not build from third parties. Equipment for a CNG station typically consists of dryers, compressors, dispensers and storage tanks. 

Half of ANG&#8217;s fueling stations have separate public access areas for retail customers, which generally have comparable 

dispensing rates of traditional gasoline and diesel fueling stations. 

Sales and Marketing 

ANG focuses its sales and marketing efforts within the continental United States and targets such efforts primarily through direct sales. ANG&#8217;s sales and marketing group stays informed of proposed and newly adopted regulations in order to provide education on the value of natural gas as a vehicle fuel to current and future customers. 

Key Markets and Customers 

ANG targets customers in a variety of markets, such as trucking, airports, refuse, public transit and food and beverage distributors. In 2015, approximately 90% of ANG&#8217;s revenues from CNG sales came from customers with multi-year contracts based on committed fueling volumes. 

Trucking and Food and Beverage Distributors. ANG believes that heavy-duty trucking represents one of the greatest opportunities for natural gas to be used as a vehicle fuel in the U.S. Fleets with high-mileage trucks consume significant amounts of fuel and can benefit from the lower cost of natural gas. Many shippers, manufacturers, retailers and other truck fleet operators have started to adopt natural gas fueled trucks to move their freight. 

Refuse Haulers. According to INFORM, there are 179,000 waste collection, waste transfer and recycling vehicles on U.S. roads today - 91% of them diesel-fueled and most of them old. Refuse haulers are increasingly adopting trucks that run on CNG to realize operating savings and to address their customers' demands for reduced emissions and quieter performance. ANG serves several large independent waste haulers in the northeast. ANG believes that refuse companies are ideal customers as they can be served by centralized fueling infrastructure supported by a consistent monthly volume of fuel. 

Corporate Information; Acquisitions and Divestitures 

ANG was originally formed in 2011. In August 2014, HC2 acquired a 51% interest in ANG. In October 2014, ANG acquired Northville Natural Gas, which owned three stations in Indiana. ANG intends to continue to pursue additional acquisitions, divestitures, partnerships and investments as ANG becomes aware of opportunities that it believes will increase its competitive advantage, take advantage of industry developments, or enhance their market position. 

Tax Incentives 

Since October 2012, ANG has been eligible to receive the volumetric excise tax credit (&#8220;VETC&#8221;) federal alternative fuel tax credit of $0.50 per GGE of CNG sold as vehicle fuel. ANG will continue to be eligible to receive the VETC through 2016. The VETC is a renewable tax incentive and therefore may not be available after 2016. In addition, other U.S. federal and state government tax incentives are available to offset the cost of acquiring natural gas vehicles, converting vehicles to use natural gas or construct natural gas fueling stations. 

Grant Programs 

ANG continues to seek out and apply for, and help its fleet customers apply for federal, state and regional grant programs. These programs provide funding for natural gas vehicle conversions and purchases, natural gas fueling station construction and vehicle fuel sold. 

Competition 

The market for vehicle fuels is highly competitive. The biggest competition for CNG is gasoline and diesel, as the vast majority of vehicles in the are powered by gasoline and diesel. Many of the producers and sellers of gasoline and diesel fuels are large entities that have significantly greater resources than ANG has. ANG also competes with suppliers of other alternative vehicle fuels, including ethanol, biodiesel and hydrogen fuels, as well as providers of hybrid and electric vehicles. New technologies and improvements to existing technologies may make alternatives other than natural gas more attractive to the market, or may slow the development of the market for natural gas as a vehicle fuel if such advances are made with respect to oil and gas usage. 

A significant number of established businesses, including oil and gas companies, alternative vehicle and alternative fuel companies, natural gas utilities and their affiliates, industrial gas companies, truck stop and fuel station operators, fuel providers 

and other organizations have entered or are planning to enter the market for natural gas and other alternatives for use as vehicle fuels. Many of these current and potential competitors have substantially greater financial, marketing, research and other resources than ANG has. Several natural gas utilities and their affiliates own and operate public access CNG stations that compete with ANG&#8217;s stations. 

ANG competes for vehicle fuel users based on price of fuel, availability and price of vehicles that operate on natural gas, convenience and accessibility of its fueling stations, quality, cleanliness and safety of its fuel, and brand recognition. ANG expects competition to increase, particularly if and to the extent the demand for natural gas vehicle fuel increases. Increased competition would lead to amplified pricing pressure, reduced operating margins and fewer expansion opportunities. 

Government Regulation and Environmental Matters 

Certain aspects of ANG&#8217;s operations are subject to regulation under federal, state, local and foreign laws. If ANG were to violate these laws or if the laws were to change, it would have a material adverse effect on ANG&#8217;s business, financial condition and results of operations. Regulations that significantly affect ANG&#8217;s operations are described below. 

CNG Stations. To construct a CNG fueling station, ANG must satisfy permitting and other requirements and either ANG or a third party contractor must be licensed as a general engineering contractor. Each CNG fueling station must be constructed in accordance with federal, state and local regulations pertaining to station design, environmental health, accidental release prevention, above-ground storage tanks, hazardous waste and hazardous materials. ANG is also required to register with certain state agencies as a retailer/wholesaler of CNG. 

ANG believes it is in material compliance with environmental laws and regulations and other known regulatory requirements. Compliance with these regulations has not had a material effect on ANG&#8217;s capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position but new laws or regulations or amendments to existing laws or regulations to make them more stringent, such as more rigorous air emissions requirements, proposals to make waste materials subject to more stringent and costly handling, disposal and clean-up requirements or regulations of greenhouse gas emissions, could require ANG to undertake significant capital expenditures in the future. 

Life Sciences Segment (Pansend Life Sciences, Ltd. (&#8220;Pansend&#8221;)) 

Pansend is HC2&#8217;s life sciences segment focusing on the development of innovative technologies and products in the world of healthcare. Pansend has invested in the following four companies: 

&#8226; 

BeneVir Biopharm, Inc. (&#8220;BeneVir&#8221;), a development stage company focused on the development of a patent protected oncolytic virus, BV-2711, for the treatment of cancer. BeneVir's pre-clinical pipeline consists of oncolytic viruses delivered locally or systemically. Once inside tumors, the viruses are designed to selectively destroy cancer cells, evade elimination by the immune system, and activate multiple classes of anti-tumor immune cells. This multi-mechanistic approach builds upon key elements of both oncolytic virus and immune-checkpoint inhibitor approaches to cancer treatment and is designed to block the major methods that tumors use to subvert the immune system. BeneVir holds an exclusive worldwide license for BV-2711, a patent-protected novel compound; 

&#8226; 

R2 Dermatology, Incorporated, a company developing medical devices for the treatment of aesthetic and medical skin conditions. The device utilizes exclusive licensing rights to a novel technology developed at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School; 

&#8226;

&#8226; 

MediBeacon, Inc. (&#8220;MediBeacon&#8221;), a company developing a proprietary non-invasive real-time monitoring system for the evaluation of kidney function. The MediBeacon system uses an optical skin sensor combined with a proprietary agent that glows in the presence of light. It provides clinicians continuous real-time monitoring of a patient&#8217;s kidney function. MediBeacon recently completed its first human clinical trials. In August 2015, Pansend agreed to provide MediBeacon with $22.4 million in staged financing. 

Other Businesses and Investments 

Outside of the above listed operating subsidiaries, which collectively represent $ 1,118.7 million , or 99.8% &#32;of our net revenue for 2015, we acquired DMi, Inc. (&#8220;DMi&#8221;), which owns licenses to create and distribute NASCAR&#174; video games, for $6.0 million. Currently, DMi is working on several games including an all-new NASCAR racing simulation game for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, 

PC and mobile games that are expected to be released in 2016. We also have made several noncontrolling investments, including $14.2 million for an approximate 25% ownership interest in Novatel, a publicly listed company that designs and develops wireless communications technologies and software-as-a-service solutions for the Internet of Things, and $5.6 million for a 40% interest in Nervve Technologies, Inc. (&#8220;Nervve Technologies&#8221;), an information technology company with a unique capability to search video footage, which is able to search an hour of video in less than five seconds. Nervve Technologies&#8217; core technology utilizes a search by example methodology to automatically search massive amounts of video and image data for objects of interest. 

See Note 20. Operating Segment and Related Information &#32; for additional detail regarding our operating segments and financial information by geographic area. 

Environmental Regulation 

Our operations and properties, including those of Schuff and GMSL, are subject to a wide variety of increasingly complex and stringent foreign, federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including those concerning emissions into the air, discharge into waterways, generation, storage, handling, treatment and disposal of waste materials and health and safety of employees. Sanctions for noncompliance may include revocation of permits, corrective action orders, administrative or civil penalties and criminal prosecution. Some environmental laws provide for strict, joint and several liability for remediation of spills and other releases of hazardous substances, as well as damage to natural resources. In addition, companies may be subject to claims alleging personal injury or property damage as a result of alleged exposure to hazardous substances. These laws and regulations may also expose us to liability for the conduct of or conditions caused by others, or for our acts that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time such acts were performed. 

Compliance with federal, state and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or relating to the protection of the environment has not had a material impact on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. Based on our experience to date, we do not currently anticipate any material adverse effect on our business or consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows as a result of future compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations. However, future events, such as changes in existing laws and regulations or their interpretation, more vigorous enforcement policies of regulatory agencies, or stricter or different interpretations of existing laws and regulations, may require additional expenditures by us, which may be material. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will not incur significant environmental compliance costs in the future.
