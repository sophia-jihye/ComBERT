Sales, Marketing and Distribution 

We sell our products directly to OEMs, distributors and end-users. We have multiple business units and each unit typically has its own branded product offering and sales organization. These sales organizations consist of varying combinations of our own internal direct sales people as well as exclusive and non-exclusive manufacturers' representative organizations. 

We operate large distribution facilities in Indianapolis, Indiana; Florence, Kentucky; and LaVergne, Tennessee which serve as hubs for our North American distribution and logistics operations. Products are shipped from these facilities to our customers utilizing common carriers and our limited fleet of trucks and trailers. We also operate numerous warehouse and distribution facilities in our global markets to service the needs of our customers. In addition, we have many manufacturer representatives' warehouses located in specific geographic areas to serve local customers. 

We derive a significant portion of revenue from our OEM customers. In our HVAC business, our reliance on sales to key OEM customers makes our relationship with each of these customers important to our business, and we expect this customer concentration will continue for the foreseeable future in this portion of our business. Despite this relative concentration, we had no customer that accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated net sales in fiscal 2015, fiscal 2014 or fiscal 2013. 

Many of our motors are incorporated into residential applications that OEMs sell to end users. The number of installations of new and replacement HVAC systems, pool pumps and related components is higher during the spring and summer seasons due to the increased use of air conditioning and swimming pools during warmer months. As a result, our revenues tend to be higher in the second and third quarters.

With our emphasis on product development and innovation, our businesses filed 43 Non-Provisional United States patents, four Provisional United States patents and an additional 85 Non-Provisional foreign patents in fiscal 2015. 

Each of our business units has its own, as well as shared, product development and design teams that continuously work to enhance our existing products and develop new products for our growing base of customers that require custom and standard solutions. We believe we have state of the art product development and testing laboratories. We believe these capabilities provide a significant competitive advantage in the development of high quality motors, electric generators, controls and mechanical products incorporating leading design characteristics such as low vibration, low noise, improved safety, reliability, sustainability and enhanced energy efficiency. 

We are continuing to expand our business by developing new, differentiated products in each of our business units. We work closely with our customers to develop new products or enhancements to existing products that improve performance and meet their needs. 

For fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, research and development expenses, which are solely focused on products or processes that are entirely innovative to our Company or to our industry, were $30.1 million , $32.9 million and $28.3 million, respectively. For the same periods, total research and development and other engineering expenses, which include product and process improvements, were $78.7 million, $85.0 million and $84.4 million, respectively. 

Manufacturing and Operations 

We have developed and acquired global operations in locations such as China, Mexico, India and Thailand so that we can sell our products in these faster growing markets, follow our multinational customers, take advantage of global talent and complement our flexible, rapid response operations in the United States, Canada and Europe. Our vertically integrated manufacturing operations, including our own aluminum die casting and steel stamping operations, are an important element of our rapid response capabilities. In addition, we have an extensive internal logistics operation and a network of distribution facilities with the capability to modify stock products to quickly meet specific customer requirements in many instances. This gives us the ability to efficiently and 

promptly deliver a customer's unique product to the desired location. 

We manufacture a majority of the products that we sell, but also strategically outsource components and finished goods from an established global network of suppliers. We aggressively pursue global sourcing to reduce our overall costs. We generally maintain a dual sourcing capability in our existing domestic facilities to ensure a reliable supply source for our customers, although we do depend on a limited number of key suppliers for certain materials and components. We regularly invest in machinery and equipment to improve and maintain our facilities. Additionally, we have typically obtained significant amounts of quality capital equipment as part of our acquisitions, often increasing overall capacity and capability. Base materials for our products consist primarily of steel, copper and aluminum. Additionally, significant components of our product costs consist of bearings, electronics, permanent magnets and ferrous and non-ferrous castings. 

We use our Compass&#8482; operating system to drive Performance Excellence. Compass&#8482; provides us with a common language and a common set of business processes, disciplines and Lean Six Sigma tools. It consists of a set of standard reviews throughout the year to assess team progress in serving our customers, shareholders and employees. It is a significant part of our culture and fuels our continuous performance improvements. We believe our people are at the core of everything we do, and their deployment of these tools lead to operational excellence. We have invested in training hundreds of high energy teams, which have generated significant benefits and driven improvements in safety, speed, quality and cost. 

Facilities 

We have manufacturing, sales and service facilities in the United States, Mexico, China, Europe, India and Australia, as well as a number of other locations throughout the world. Our Commercial and Industrial Systems segment currently includes 105 manufacturing, service, office and distribution facilities of which 39 are principal manufacturing facilities. The Commercial and Industrial Systems segment's present operating facilities contain a total of approximately 7.9 million square feet of space, of which approximately 33% are leased. Our Climate Solutions segment includes 41 manufacturing, service, office and distribution facilities, of which 17 are principal manufacturing facilities. The Climate Solutions segment's present operating facilities contain a total of approximately 3.2 million square feet of space, of which approximately 49% are leased. The Power Transmission Solutions segment's present operating facilities (including facilities acquired in the PTS Acquisition) contain a total of approximately 2.7 million square feet of space which currently includes 35 manufacturing, service and distribution facilities, of which 18 are principal manufacturing facilities. Approximately 13% of the Power Transmission Solutions segment's facilities are leased. Our principal executive offices are located in Beloit, Wisconsin in an approximately 50,000 square foot owned office building. We believe our equipment and facilities are well maintained and adequate for our present needs. 

Backlog 

Our business units have historically shipped the majority of their products in the month the order is received. As of January 2, 2016, our backlog was $372.7 million, as compared to $400.2 million on January 3, 2015. We believe that virtually all of our backlog will be shipped in 2016. 

Patents, Trademarks and Licenses 

We own a number of United States patents and foreign patents relating to our businesses. While we believe that our patents provide certain competitive advantages, we do not consider any one patent or group of patents essential to our business as a whole. We also use various registered and unregistered trademarks, and we believe these trademarks are significant in the marketing of most of our products. However, we believe the successful manufacture and sale of our products generally depends more upon our technological, manufacturing and marketing skills. 

Employees 

At the end of fiscal 2015, we employed approximately 26,200 employees worldwide. Of those employees, approximately 10,600 were located in Mexico; approximately 6,100 in the United States; approximately 4,300 in China; approximately 2,300 in India; and approximately 2,900 in the rest of the world. We consider our employee relations to be very good.
