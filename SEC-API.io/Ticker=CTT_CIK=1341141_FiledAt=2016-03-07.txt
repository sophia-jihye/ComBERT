 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

General 

CatchMark Timber Trust, Inc. (" CatchMark Timber Trust ") (NYSE: CTT), a Maryland corporation, is a self- administered and self-managed real estate company that invests in timberlands and has elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust ("REIT") for federal income tax purposes. CatchMark Timber Trust &#32;incorporated in 2005, commenced operations in 2007, and conducts substantially all of its business through CatchMark Timber Operating Partnership, L.P. (&#8220; CatchMark Timber OP &#8221;), a Delaware limited partnership. CatchMark Timber Trust &#32;is the general partner of CatchMark Timber OP , possesses full legal control and authority over its operations, and owns 99.99% &#32;of its common partnership units. CatchMark LP Holder, LLC (&#8220; CatchMark LP Holder &#8221;), a wholly-owned subsidiary of CatchMark Timber Trust , is the sole limited partner of CatchMark Timber OP &#32;(See Note 7 &#8211; Noncontrolling Interest of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for more information). In addition, CatchMark Timber TRS, Inc. (&#8220;CatchMark TRS&#8221;), a Delaware corporation, was formed as a wholly owned subsidiary of CatchMark Timber OP . Unless otherwise noted, references to CatchMark Timber Trust , "we", "us", or "our" herein shall include CatchMark Timber Trust &#32;and all of its subsidiaries, including CatchMark Timber OP , and the subsidiaries of CatchMark Timber OP , including CatchMark TRS . 

We primarily engage in the ownership, management, acquisition, and disposition of timberland properties located in the United States. The focus of our business is to invest in timberlands and to actively manage such assets to provide current income and attractive long-term returns to our stockholders. We generate recurring income and cash flow from the harvest and sale of timber, as well as from non-timber related revenue sources, such as rent from hunting and recreational leases. 

When and where we believe it is appropriate, we also periodically generate income and cash flow from timberland sales, including the sale of higher-and-better use, or HBU, properties. HBU properties are timberland properties that have a higher-value use beyond growing timber, such as properties that can be sold for development, conservation, recreational or other rural purposes at prices in excess of traditional timberland values. We also expect to realize additional long-term returns from the potential appreciation in value of our timberlands as well as from the potential biological growth of our standing timber inventory in excess of our timber harvest. 

For each of the three years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , our revenues from timber sales, timberland sales, and non-timber related sources, as a percentage of our total revenue, are set forth in the table below:

As of December 31, 2015 , approximately 397,200 &#32;acres, or 93% &#32;of our timberland available for hunting and recreational uses, had been leased to tenants under operating leases that expire between March and June 2016. 

Current Timberland Holdings 

As of December 31, 2015 , we owned interests in approximately 425,000 &#32;acres of timberland in the U.S. South, consisting of approximately 401,200 &#32;acres held in fee-simple interests, or our fee timberlands, and approximately 23,800 &#32;acres held in leasehold interests, or our leased timberlands. As of December 31, 2015 , our timberlands were comprised of approximately 74% pine stands and 26% hardwood stands (by acreage) and contained an estimated 16.8 &#32;million tons of merchantable inventory.

Our Business and Growth Strategies 

Our objective is to produce long-term cash flow and value growth from carefully managing our existing portfolio, participating in ongoing timber product price recovery, and undertaking timberland acquisitions and selective timberland dispositions through the ongoing implementation of the following business and growth strategies: 

Actively Manage Our Timberlands for Long-Term Results. We seek to maximize long-term returns by actively managing our timberlands to achieve an optimum balance among biological timber growth, current harvest cash flow, and responsible environmental stewardship. Further, we expect to continue making investments in forest technology, including improved seedlings, in order to increase the sustainable yield of our timberlands over the long-term. 

Maximize Profitability on Timber Sales. We actively manage our log merchandising efforts together with delivered and stumpage sales with the goal of achieving the highest available price for our timber products. We compete with other timberland owners on the basis of the quality of our logs, the prices of our logs, our reputation as a reliable supplier and our ability to meet customer specifications. We will continue to work diligently and proactively with our third-party contractors to ensure that we optimize our logging, hauling, sorting, and merchandising operations to extract the maximum profitability from each of our logs based on the foregoing considerations. 

Pursue Attractive Timberland Acquisitions. &#32;We seek to identify and acquire high&#173; quality timberland properties, with our average deal size ranging from 10,000 to 40,000 acres. Generally, we expect to focus our acquisition efforts in the most commercially desirable timber-producing regions of the U.S. South, although we may also pursue opportunistic acquisitions outside of these regions. Critical evaluation of prospective property acquisitions is an essential component of our acquisition strategy. When evaluating acquisition opportunities, we assess a full range of matters relating to the prospective timberland property or properties, including, but not limited to: 

&#8226; 

Local market dynamics 

&#8226; 

Predominantly pine merchantable inventory mix 

&#8226; 

Sustainable productivity (on a tons per-acre, per-year basis) 

&#8226; 

Quality of existing and prospective customers 

&#8226; 

Target unlevered cash yields 

Due to the expected liquidation of the ownership positions of a number of timberland investment management organizations over the next several years, we expect there will be a robust supply of attractive timberlands available for sale. We may also enter into additional fiber supply agreements with respect to acquired properties in order to ensure a steady source of demand for our incremental timber production. 

Opportunistically Sell HBU Lands. &#32;We continuously assess potential alternative uses of our timberlands, as some of our properties may be more valuable for development, conservation, recreational or other rural purposes than for growing timber. We intend to capitalize on the value of our timberland portfolio by opportunistically monetizing HBU timberlands. When evaluating our HBU opportunities, we assess a full range of matters relating to the timberland property or properties, including, but not limited to: 

&#8226; 

Suboptimal inventory stocking 

&#8226; 

Predominantly hardwood merchantable inventory mix 

&#8226; 

Substandard productivity 

The close proximity of our existing timberlands to several major population centers provides us with opportunities to periodically sell parcels of our land at favorable valuations. We generally expect to monetize 1% to 2% of our fee timberland acreage on an annual basis pursuant to our land sales program, although such results may vary. We may 

Index to Consolidated Financial Statements 

also decide to pursue various land entitlements on certain properties in order to realize higher long-term values on such properties. 

Practice Sound Environmental Stewardship. &#32;We will remain committed to responsible environmental stewardship and sustainable forestry. Our timberlands, except those that have been recently acquired, have been are third-party audited and certified in accordance with the 2015-2019 SFI (Sustainable Forest Initiative) standard. We are currently taking the necessary procedures to get our recently acquired timberlands third-party audited and certified in accordance with the SFI standards within the next 12 months. SFI standards promote sustainable forest management through recognized core principles, including measures to protect water quality, biodiversity, wildlife habitat and at-risk species. Our timberlands are further managed to meet or exceed all state regulations through the implementation of best management practices as well as internal policies designed to ensure compliance. We believe our continued commitment to environmental stewardship will allow us to maintain our timberlands&#8217; productivity, grow our customer base and enhance our reputation as a preferred timber supplier. 

Financing Strategy 

Our long-term financing strategy seeks to maximize balance sheet liquidity and operational flexibility for the purpose of generating current income and attractive long-term returns for our stockholders. We intend to employ prudent amounts of equity and debt financing as a means of providing additional funds for the selective acquisitions of timber assets, to refinance existing debt or for general corporate purposes. In particular, we seek to maximize balance sheet liquidity and flexibility by: 

&#8226; 

Maintaining sufficient liquidity through borrowing capacity under our credit facilities and cash-on-hand; 

&#8226; 

Minimizing the amount of near-term debt maturities in a single year; 

&#8226; 

Maintaining low to modest leverage; and 

&#8226; 

Maintaining access to diverse sources of capital. 

We finance our timber assets using a variety of methods and determine the amount of equity and debt financing to be used when acquiring an asset by evaluating terms available in the credit markets (such as interest rate, repayment provisions and maturity), our cost of equity capital and our assessment of the particular asset&#8217;s risk. Historically, a significant portion of our debt has consisted of long-term borrowings secured by our timber assets. 

We anticipate that we will continue to use a number of different sources to finance our operations and selective acquisitions going forward, including cash from operations, proceeds from asset dispositions, funds available under bank credit facilities (which may or may not be secured by our assets), potential future issuances of common or preferred equity or partnership interests in our operating partnership or any combination of these sources, to the extent available to us, or other sources that may become available from time to time. 

Transaction Activity 

In connection with furthering our investment and operating objectives, we have executed the following timberland transactions: 

Acquisitions 

During the year ended December 31, 2015 , we completed eight timberland acquisitions in Georgia, Louisiana, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas, totaling approximately 42,900 acres for $73.3 million , exclusive of closing costs. The acquisitions were funded with a combination of cash on hand as well as borrowings under our existing credit agreement. The timberlands acquired in 2015 are well stocked with merchantable pine inventory, located in strong pulpwood and sawtimber markets, and complement our existing timberland portfolio while expanding into new subregional markets within the U.S. South. The 2015 acquisitions added approximately 1.8 million tons to our merchantable timber inventory, comprised of 80% pine plantations by acreage and 49% sawtimber by tons. 

Index to Consolidated Financial Statements 

Since our initial listed public offering (the "IPO") in December 2013, we have acquired a total of approximately 164,500 acres of timberland and expanded our timberland ownership into Florida, Louisiana, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas. The acquisitions since our IPO have added 6.6 million tons to our merchantable timber inventory, comprised of 77% pine plantations by acreage and 56% sawtimber by tons. 

Dispositions 

During the year ended December 31, 2015 , we sold approximately 6,400 &#32;acres of timberland in Alabama, Georgia, and Texas, for $11.8 million . The timberland dispositions represented approximately 1.6% of our timberland acreage (measured based on average monthly timberland acreage in 2015). 

Mahrt Timber Agreements 

We are party to a master stumpage agreement and a fiber supply agreement (collectively, the &#8220;Mahrt Timber Agreements&#8221;) with a wholly owned subsidiary of WestRock Company ("WestRock"). The master stumpage agreement provides that we will sell specified amounts of timber and make available certain portions of our timberlands to CatchMark TRS &#32;for harvesting. The fiber supply agreement provides that WestRock will purchase specified tonnage of timber from CatchMark TRS &#32;at specified prices per ton, depending upon the type of timber product. The prices for the timber purchased pursuant to the fiber supply agreement are negotiated every two years but are subject to quarterly adjustments based on an index published by Timber Mart-South, a quarterly trade publication that reports raw forest product prices in 11 southern states. The initial term of the Mahrt Timber Agreements is October 9, 2007 through December 31, 2032, subject to extension and early termination provisions. The Mahrt Timber Agreements ensure a long-term supply of wood fiber products for WestRock in order to meet its paperboard and lumber production requirements at specified mills and provide us with a reliable consumer for the wood products from our timberlands. 

For the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 , approximately 23% , 34% , and 60% , respectively, of our net timber sales revenue was derived from the Mahrt Timber Agreements. For 2016, we are required to make available for purchase by WestRock, and WestRock is required to purchase, a minimum of approximately 0.4 million &#32;tons of timber at fiber supply agreement pricing. 

Economic Dependency and Credit Risk of Customers 

We are dependent upon the ability of our timber customers to pay their contractual amounts as they become due. The inability of a customer to pay future supply agreement amounts would have a negative impact on our results of operations. We are not aware of any reason why our current customers will not be able to pay their contractual amounts as they become due in all material respects. Situations preventing our customers from paying contractual amounts could result in a material adverse impact on our results of operations. 

For the year ended December 31, 2015, our largest customer, WestRock, represented 31% &#32;of our consolidated revenues. No other customer represented more than 10% of our consolidated revenues. The loss of WestRock would have a material adverse effect on our operating results. We sold timber to 42 customers in 2015, compared to 30 in 2014, an increase predominantly driven by recent timberland acquisitions (See Transaction Activity under &#32;Item 1 &#8211; Business ). 

Competition 

We compete with various private and industrial timberland owners as well as governmental agencies that own or manage timberlands in the U.S. South. Due to transportation and delivery costs, pulp, paper and wood products manufacturing facilities typically purchase wood fiber within a 100-mile radius of their location, which thereby limits, to some degree, the number of significant competitors in any specific regional market. Factors affecting the level of competition in our industry include price, species, grade, quality, proximity to the mill customer, and our reliability and consistency as a supplier. Also, as we seek to acquire assets, we are in competition for targeted timberland tracts with other similar timber investment companies, as well as investors in land for purposes other than growing timber. As a result, we may have to pay more for the timberland tracts to become the purchaser if another suitable tract cannot 

be substituted. When it becomes time to dispose of timberland tracts, we will again be in competition with sellers of similar tracts to locate suitable purchasers of timberland. 

Seasonality 

We typically experience seasonally lower harvest activity during the winter and early spring due to weather conditions, as rains limit operations. 

Recent Tax Legislation 

On December 18, 2015, President Obama signed into law the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016, an omnibus spending bill, with a division referred to as t he Protecting Americans From Tax Hikes Act of 2015, which changes certain of the rules affecting REIT qualification and taxation of REITs and REIT stockholders described under the heading &#8220;Certain United States Federal Income Tax Considerations&#8221; in our Prospectus included in our Registration Statement on Form S-3 filed June 20, 2014. These changes are briefly summarized as follows: 

&#8226; 

For taxable years beginning after 2017, the percentage of a REIT&#8217;s total assets that may be represented by securities of one or more TRSs is reduced from 25% to 20%. 

&#8226; 

For distributions in taxable years beginning after 2014, the preferential dividend rules no longer apply to us as a &#8220;publicly offered REIT,&#8221; as defined in new Code Section 562(c)(2). 

&#8226; 

For taxable years beginning after 2015, debt instruments issued by publicly offered REITs are treated as real estate assets for purposes of the 75% asset test, but interest on debt of a publicly offered REIT will not be qualifying income under the 75% gross income test unless the debt is secured by real property. Under a new asset test, not more than 25% of the value of a REIT&#8217;s assets may consist of debt instruments that are issued by publicly offered REITs and would not otherwise be treated as qualifying real estate assets. 

&#8226; 

For taxable years beginning after 2015, to the extent rent attributable to personal property is treated as rents from real property (because rent attributable to the personal property for the taxable year does not exceed 15% of the total rent for the taxable year for such real and personal property) , the personal property will be treated as a real estate asset for purposes of the 75% asset test. Similarly, debt obligation secured by a mortgage on both real and personal property will be treated as a real estate asset for purposes of the 75% asset test, and interest thereon will be treated as interest on an obligation secured by real property, if the fair market value of the personal property does not exceed 15% of the fair market value of all property securing the debt. 

&#8226; 

For taxable years beginning after 2015, a 100% excise tax will apply to &#8220;redetermined services income,&#8221; i.e., non-arm&#8217;s-length income of a REIT&#8217;s TRS attributable to services provided to, or on behalf of, the REIT (other than services provided to REIT tenants, which are potentially taxed as redetermined rents) . 

&#8226; 

For taxable years beginning after 2014, the period during which dispositions of properties with net built-in gains acquired from C corporations in carry-over basis transactions will trigger the built-in gains tax is reduced from ten years to five years. We are no longer subject to the built-in gains tax with respect to properties we held as of January 1, 2009. 

&#8226; 

REITs are subject to a 100% tax on net income from &#8220;prohibited transactions,&#8221; i.e., sales of dealer property (other than &#8220;foreclosure property&#8221;). These rules also contain safe harbors under which certain sales of real estate assets will not be treated as prohibited transactions. One of the requirements for the current safe harbors is that (I) the REIT does not make more than seven sales of property (subject to specified exceptions) during the taxable year at issue, or (II) the aggregate adjusted bases (as determined for purposes of computing earnings and profits) of property (other than excepted property) sold during the taxable year does not exceed 10% of the aggregate bases in the REIT&#8217;s assets as of the beginning of the taxable year, or (III) the fair market value of property (other than excepted property) sold during the taxable year does not exceed 10% of the fair market value of the REIT&#8217;s total assets as of the beginning of the taxable year. If a REIT relies on clause (II) or (III), substantially all of the marketing and certain development expenditures with respect to the properties sold must be made through an independent contractor. For taxable years beginning after December 18, 2015, c lauses (II) and (III) are liberalized to permit the REIT to sell properties with an aggregate adjusted basis (or 

fair market value) of up to 20% of the aggregate bases in (or fair market value of) the REIT&#8217;s assets as long as the 10% standard is satisfied on average over the three-year period comprised of the taxable year at issue and the two immediately preceding taxable years. In addition, for taxable years beginning after 2015, for REITs that rely on clauses (II) or (III), a TRS may make the marketing and development expenditures that previously had to be made by independent contractors . 

&#8226; 

A number of changes applicable to REITs are made to the FIRPTA rules for taxing non-US persons on gains from sales of US real property interests (&#8220;USRPIs&#8221;): 

&#8226; 

For dispositions and distributions on or after December 18, 2015, the stock ownership thresholds for exemption from FIRPTA taxation on sale of stock of a publicly traded REIT and for recharacterizing capital gain dividends as ordinary dividends is increased from not more than 5% to not more than 10%. 

&#8226; 

Effective December 18, 2015, new rules will simplify the determination of whether we are a &#8220;domestically controlled qualified investment entity.&#8221; 

&#8226; 

For dispositions and distributions after December 18, 2015, &#8220;qualified foreign pension funds&#8221; as defined in new Code Section 897(l)(2) and entities that are wholly owned by a qualified foreign pension fund are exempted from FIRPTA and FIRPTA withholding. New FIRPTA rules also apply to &#8220;qualified shareholders&#8221; as defined in new Code Section 897(k)(3). 

&#8226; 

For sales of USRPIs occurring after February 16, 2016, the FIRPTA withholding rate for sales of USRPIs and certain distributions generally increases from 10% to 15%.
