 ITEM 1. 

BUSINESS 

The Company 

Urban Edge Properties (&#8220;UE&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) (NYSE: UE) is a Maryland real estate investment trust focused on managing, developing, redeveloping, and acquiring retail real estate in urban communities, primarily in the New York metropolitan region. Urban Edge Properties LP (&#8220;UELP&#8221; or the &#8220;Operating Partnership&#8221;) is a Delaware limited partnership formed to serve as UE&#8217;s majority-owned partnership subsidiary and to own, through affiliates, all of our real estate properties and other assets. UE and UELP were created to own the majority of Vornado Realty Trust&#8217;s (&#8220;Vornado&#8221;) (NYSE: VNO) former shopping center business. The Company owns 80 shopping centers, three malls and a warehouse park adjacent to one of its centers. The portfolio totals 14.8 million square feet. The consolidated retail portfolio occupancy was 96.2% &#32;as of December 31, 2015. 

Prior to the separation, the portfolio is referred to as &#8220;UE Businesses.&#8221; On January 15, 2015, pursuant to a separation and distribution agreement between UE and Vornado (the &#8220;Separation Agreement&#8221;), the interests in certain properties held by Vornado&#8217;s operating partnership, Vornado Realty L.P. (&#8220;VRLP&#8221;), were contributed or otherwise transferred to UE in exchange for 100% of our outstanding common shares. Following that contribution, VRLP distributed 100% of our outstanding common shares to Vornado and the other common limited partners of VRLP, pro rata with respect to their ownership of common limited partnership units in VRLP. Vornado then distributed all of the UE common shares it had received from VRLP to Vornado common shareholders on a pro rata basis. As a result, VRLP common limited partners and Vornado common shareholders all received common shares of UE in the spin-off at a ratio of one common share of UE to every two VRLP common units and every two common shares of Vornado. 

Substantially concurrently with such distribution, the interests in certain properties held by VRLP, including interests in entities holding properties, were contributed or otherwise transferred to UELP in exchange for approximately 5.4% of UELP&#8217;s outstanding common limited partnership interests in the Operating Partnership (&#8220;OP Units&#8221;). 

As part of the separation transaction, Vornado capitalized UE with $225 million of cash and agreed to provide transition services to UE including human resources, information technology, risk management, public reporting and tax services for up to two years pursuant to a transition services agreement between UE and Vornado (the &#8220;Transition Services Agreement&#8221;). The fees charged to us by Vornado for these transition services approximate the actual cost incurred by Vornado in providing such transition services to us. Pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement, UE provides leasing, property management and development services to Vornado for certain of Vornado&#8217;s shopping center properties for which we receive management and other fees believed to be at a market rate. 

We review operating and financial information for each property on an individual basis and, therefore, each property represents an individual operating segment. We aggregate all of our properties into one reportable segment due to their similarities with regard to the nature and economics of the properties, tenants and operational process. 

Unless the context otherwise requires, &#8220;we&#8221;, &#8220;us&#8221; and &#8220;our&#8221; refer to UE after giving effect to the transfer of assets and liabilities from Vornado as well as to the UE Businesses prior to the date of completion of the separation. 

We will elect to be treated as a real estate investment trust (&#8216;&#8216;REIT&#8217;&#8217;) in connection with the filing of our federal income tax return as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015, subject to our ability to meet the requirements of becoming a REIT at the time of election, and we intend to maintain this status in future periods. 

Company Strategies 

Our goal is to become the leading owner of retail real estate in and on the edges of major urban markets. We believe urban markets offer attractive investment opportunities resulting from a unique interplay of demographic, supply/demand and redevelopment/development trends. To achieve this goal, our primary strategies include: 

Maximizing the value of existing properties through proactive management. We intend to maximize the value of each of our assets through a comprehensive, proactive management strategy encompassing: continuous asset evaluation for highest-and-best-use; efficient and cost-conscious day-to-day operations that minimize retailer operating expense and preserve property quality; and thoughtful leasing. Leasing is a critical value-creation function and includes the following: 

&#8226; 

Monitoring retailer sales, merchandising, store operations, timeliness of payments, overall financial condition and related factors; 

&#8226; 

Being constantly aware of each asset&#8217;s competitive positioning within its trade area and making physical improvements or adjusting merchandising if circumstances warrant; 

&#8226; 

Continuously canvassing trade areas to identify unique operators that can distinguish a property and enhance its offerings; 

&#8226; 

Maintaining regular contact with the brokerage community to stay abreast of new merchants, potential relocations, new supply and overall trade area dynamics; 

&#8226; 

Conducting regular portfolio reviews with key tenants; 

&#8226; 

Building and nurturing broad and deep relationships with retailer decision-makers; 

&#8226; 

Focusing on spaces with below-market leases that might be recaptured; 

&#8226; 

Understanding the potential impact of options, exclusives, co-tenancy and other restrictive lease provisions; and 

&#8226; 

Optimizing required capital investment in every transaction. 

Actively investing. We intend to invest in redeveloping existing properties, selectively developing new shopping centers and acquiring properties in targeted markets. Each investment must meet our standards for expected risk-adjusted return and overall quality compared to our existing portfolio. 

Investment considerations include: 

&#8226; 

Geography : The primary focus is on the New York metropolitan area and the DC to Boston corridor. 

&#8226; 

Product : As part of our focus on urban markets, we generally target retail properties that serve local communities with necessity and convenience-oriented retailers. We also seek large shopping centers (including a grocer where possible) in our targeted markets where significant density and supply constraints provide attractive market rent dynamics. 

&#8226; 

Tenancy : We consider tenant mix, sales performance and related occupancy cost, lease term, lease provisions and other factors. Our current tenant base comprises a diverse group of merchants including department stores, grocers, category killers, discounters, entertainment offerings, health clubs, DIY stores, in-line specialty shops, restaurants and other food and beverage vendors and service providers. We believe that this diversification provides stability to our cash flows as no specific retail category constitutes more than 20% of our portfolio&#8217;s annual base rental revenue and no one retailer contributed more than 7% of our annual base rental revenue in 2015. 

&#8226; 

Rent : We consider existing rents relative to market rents. Additionally, we target submarkets that have potential for market rent growth as evidenced by strong retailer performance. 

&#8226; 

Competition and Barriers-to-Entry : We are seeking assets in underserved, high barrier-to-entry markets in densely populated, affluent trade areas. We believe that retail properties located in such markets present a more attractive risk-return profile relative to other markets. We intend to invest in our existing core markets, and, over time, may expand into new markets that have similar characteristics. 

&#8226; 

Access and Visibility : We seek assets with convenient access and good visibility. 

&#8226; 

Physical Condition : We seek assets in good physical condition taking into account aesthetic, functional, structural and environmental considerations. 

Constantly evaluating our portfolio and, where appropriate, engaging in selective dispositions. We intend to regularly evaluate the future prospects for each property and, where appropriate, to dispose of those properties that do not meet our investment criteria. We intend to reinvest a large part of the proceeds from any dispositions into redevelopment, development and acquisitions, or we may use such proceeds to reduce outstanding debt. 

Maintaining capital discipline. We intend to keep our balance sheet flexible and capable of supporting growth. We also expect to generate increasing levels of cash from internally generated funds, borrowing under our existing line of credit as well as selective asset sales. 

Significant Tenants 

None of our tenants accounted for more than 10% of total revenues in any of the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 . &#32;As of December 31, 2015, The Home Depot was our largest tenant and accounted for approximately $19.0 million, or 5.9% of our total revenue. 

Employees 

Our headquarters are located at 888 Seventh Avenue, New York, NY 10019. As of December 31, 2015, we had 124 employees and believe that our relationships with our employees are good.
