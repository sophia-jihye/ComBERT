 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

&#160; 

The Company 

&#160; 

Lifelogger Technologies, Inc. (&#8220;we&#8221;, &#8220;us&#8221;, the &#8220;Company&#8221;, &#8220;Lifelogger&#8221;) was incorporated in Nevada on June 4, 2012 under the name Snap Online Marketing Inc. We changed our name effective January 31, 2014. 

&#160; 

Lifelogger provides an enhanced media experience for consumers by augmenting videos, livestreams and photos with additional context information and providing a platform that makes it easy to find and use that data when viewing or sharing media. The first iteration of that context information is focused on geo-location, face-detection, and different options for tagging. For example, a video shared from a customer&#8217;s vacation in Europe is played with an interactive map showing the viewer where the video is taking place, allowing the viewer to seamlessly switch to the map view and even show additional views of those locations and other media taken by other people nearby. The end result is an enhanced media experience much richer than just sharing the video alone. 

&#160; 

Our Vision 

&#160; 

Our mission is to connect people with the media that matters to them. To accomplish this, we envision collecting as much data as possible about the captured device agnostic media allowing users to get videos from their iOS or Android device, or other wearable camera and/or sensor solutions. In addition to the data we collect to augment the video, our plan is to anonymously collect viewing data and evaluate habits to determine what is most relevant to our customers as we intersect those patterns with the customer&#8217;s connected social media networks. Between the data we add to users&#8217; media and data that is publicly available (e.g. street views, mapping, other people&#8217;s videos), users are able to access other media that&#8217;s relevant to their photos and/or video. We believe that the end result is a much richer experience for our users and a data network that facilitates finding media that is relevant to our customers. 

&#160; 

Our Business 

&#160; 

Lifelogging is a way of journaling one&#8217;s life using media, often through the use of wearable electronic devices. We make lifelogging accessible to the mass market by taking videos and images right from users&#8217; smart phones, wearable camera and/or sensor solutions, and adding geographic, visual and test data designed to enhance the relevance and context of the information collected. We make it easier for users to retrieve and share their media with family and friends without having to be an expert in using advanced functions in real time, using live stream or recording, at the user&#8217;s option. We allow consumers to easily capture and live stream videos with geographic coordinates and automatic face detection and to tag special moments while recording. The video playback features an interactive map and ability to skip to in-video frames with faces detected and added tags. Search features allow users the ability to retrieve videos beyond the basic title and description, including location, face or in-line video tags. Sharing videos on popular social channels like Facebook and Twitter using links makes it easy to manage large media files. 

&#160; 

Our vision is to seamlessly integrate with a wide range of wearable cameras. To realize this vision, our plan is to integrate with selected leading camera manufacturers. We refer to this integrated eco-system as the LifeLogger Platform. In addition, we plan to offer our LifeLogger Platform on a &#8220;white-label&#8221; license basis to device manufacturers and leading companies in our selected industries. The LifeLogger video cloud storage solution and applications are architected for scalability with high availability designed for use with widely available third party cloud based data providers. 

&#160; 

Software Development Milestones 

&#160; 

The LifeLogger Platform offers smart phone users the ability to capture videos with geo location with a play back option that shows an interactive map of when and where it was taken. 

&#160; 

Following the successful launch of our private beta version of the LifeLogger Platform in August 2015 to users who expressed interest for exclusive testing with their iOS and Android devices, we launched an open public version during the first quarter of 2016. This release of the platform has the primary value proposition built in with geo-coordinates, face detection and playback with interactive map and easy sharing. The iOS and Android apps are available with ongoing updates with new features. We are actively collecting and monitoring the usage and feedback to launch future releases that will be designed to increase engagement with added features for social engagement and continuous improvements to the user interface and experience.

Development Resources 

&#160; 

We rely on third party product development and software engineering and consulting providers for the development and support of our LifeLogger Platform. Our development activities are guided by Andr&#233;s Espineira, B.S., M.M., an entrepreneur with a strong background in product strategy, marketing and software development who joined our company in November 2015 as our Chief Marketing Officer and by Indra Dosanjh, MBA, who has served as our Chief Technical Officer since September 2014.Based on the availability of our working capital, we intend to commit significant resources to product research and development to ensure that we can offer a device-agnostic platform that provides the market with a truly universal online media service, taking advantage of the growth in wearable cameras and sensors. 

&#160; 

We completed a prototype of our integrated Lifelogger wearable video camera for testing and continue to market this product to potential distributors and joint venture and strategic alliance partners. We will evaluate opportunities from these marketing efforts to determine the extent of our future development and marketing of this device. 

&#160; 

Sales and Marketing 

&#160; 

Our marketing strategies in 2016 will focus on (i) dissemination of videos and other marketing media demonstrating the Lifelogger Platform&#8217;s relevance for specific uses, including methods for recording lectures, capturing news in the making and other timely and socially relevant activities, and (ii) reaching out to travel bloggers and freelance journalists. We expect that the unique geolocation and interactive mapping features provided by the LifeLogger Platform will appeal to these groups. We have chosen to take a focused, data-driven approach to our market strategy for the LifeLogger Platform to include the following: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Improve search engine optimization rankings to drive organic growth. Use traffic and rankings from benchmark service providers to improve Lifelogger&#8217;s rankings by strategically redirecting traffic. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Develop a data-driven understanding of user growth and customer engagement. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Focus on a vertical to drive tailored engagement. We have chosen to focus on travel among the general population, where we observe a sweet spot of increased capture, sharing and preservation. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Optimize platform to drive new user signups through a rich media sharing experience. Nothing sells a service better thank customers, and nothing is more compelling than their own photos and videos. &#160; 

Revenue Model 

&#160; 

We plan to implement a freemium revenue model with viral marketing of free plans leading to paid upgrades and subscriptions for advanced software features and additional storage. Our plan is to add a paid model following testing of the open beta platform, which we expect to complete in the third or fourth quarter of 2016. 

&#160; 

Principal Suppliers 

&#160; 

We believe we will have adequate access to a qualified development team for the LifeLogger Platform. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

We will initially license our platform exclusively via the Internet. Our competition includes other Internet based sellers of lifelogger services. Some of our competitors may have significantly greater financial, marketing and other resources than we do. Our competitors may undertake more far-reaching marketing campaigns, including print and television advertisements, and adopt more aggressive pricing policies that may allow them to build larger customer and distribution bases than ours. Our competitor&#8217;s services may be equal or superior to our proposed platform or that achieve greater market acceptance than ours. 

&#160; 

Government Regulation 

&#160; 

Our LifeLogger Platform business operates in a regulated environment under various federal and state consumer protection and other laws, rules and regulations, including the federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and the federal Telemarketing and Consumer Fraud and Abuse Prevention Act. Some of the more significant regulations that we will become subject are described below. 

&#160; 

Our LifeLogger Platform is subject to a number of U.S. federal and state, and foreign laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business on the Internet. Many of these laws and regulations are still evolving and being tested in courts, and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. These may involve user privacy, rights of publicity, data protection, content, intellectual property, distribution, electronic contracts and other communications, competition, protection of minors, consumer protection, taxation and online payment services. In particular, we will become subject to federal, state, and foreign laws regarding privacy and protection of user data. Foreign data protection, privacy, and other laws and regulations can be more restrictive than those in the United States. U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change. In addition, the application and interpretation of these laws and regulations are often uncertain, particularly in the new and rapidly-evolving industry in which we intend to operate, and may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country and inconsistently with our current policies and practices. There are also a number of legislative proposals pending before the U.S. Congress, various state legislative bodies, and foreign governments concerning data protection which could affect us. For example, the European Commission is currently considering a data protection regulation that may include operational requirements for companies that receive personal data that are different than those currently in place in the European Union, and that may also include significant penalties for non-compliance. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

We believe we are in substantial compliance with all governmental regulations applicable to our business. We will employ a number of external resources to assist us in complying with our regulatory obligations. These external resources will include outside technology providers and consultants. As we expand our business, we will be required to raise additional capital to cover the expected increase in costs to hire and train additional internal and external resources to ensure we remain in substantial compliance with our governmental obligations. 

&#160;

Our Corporate History and Recent Developments 

&#160; 

We were incorporated in Nevada on June 4, 2012 under the name Snap Online Marketing Inc.

Pixorial&#8217;s software offers online user-friendly tools and applications to access, download, edit, tag, process, store, organize and share videos, photos and music from any device, services. We are in discussions with Pixorial to amend the agreement to limit the scope of the assets we acquire as we have determined that we no longer need to acquire the Pixorial software.
