Overview 

California Water Service Group is a holding company incorporated in Delaware in 1999 with six operating subsidiaries: California Water Service Company (Cal Water), New Mexico Water Service Company (New Mexico Water), Washington Water Service Company (Washington Water), Hawaii Water Service Company, Inc. (Hawaii Water), and CWS Utility Services and HWS Utility Services LLC (CWS Utility Services and HWS Utility Services LLC being referred to collectively in this annual report as Utility Services). Cal Water, New Mexico Water, Washington Water, and Hawaii Water are regulated public utilities. The regulated 

utility entities also provide some non-regulated services. Utility Services provides non-regulated services to private companies and municipalities. Cal Water was the original operating company and began operations in 1926. 

Our business is conducted through our operating subsidiaries. The bulk of the business consists of the production, purchase, storage, treatment, testing, distribution and sale of water for domestic, industrial, public and irrigation uses, and for fire protection. We also provide non-regulated water-related services under agreements with municipalities and other private companies. The non-regulated services include full water system operation, billing and meter reading services. Non-regulated operations also include the lease of communication antenna sites, lab services, and promotion of other non- regulated services. Earnings may be significantly affected by the sale of surplus real properties if and when they occur. 

During the year ended December 31, 2015 , there were no significant changes in the kind of products produced or services rendered or those provided by our operating subsidiaries, or in the markets or methods of distribution.

Regulated Business 

California water operations are conducted by the Cal Water and CWS Utility Services entities, which provide service to approximately 480,300 &#32;customers in 83 California communities through 25 separate districts. Of these 25 districts, 23 districts are regulated water systems, which are subject to regulation by the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC). Cal Water operates two leased water systems, the City of Hawthorne and the City of Commerce, which are governed through their respective city councils and are outside of the CPUC's jurisdiction. California water operations accounted for approximately 94% of our total customers and approximately 94% of our total consolidated operating revenue during the 3 year period ended December 31, 2015. 

Hawaii Water provides service to approximately 4,300 &#32;water and wastewater customers on the islands of Maui and Hawaii, including several large resorts and condominium complexes. Hawaii's regulated operations are subject to the jurisdiction of the Hawaii Public Utilities Commission. Hawaii Water accounts for approximately 1% of our total customers and approximately 3% of our total operating revenue. 

Washington Water provides domestic water service to approximately 16,500 &#32;customers in the Tacoma and Olympia areas. Washington Water's utility operations are regulated by the Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission. Washington Water accounts for approximately 3% of our total customers and approximately 2% of our total consolidated operating revenue. 

New Mexico Water provides service to approximately 7,900 &#32;water and wastewater customers in the Belen, Los Lunas and Elephant Butte areas in New Mexico. New Mexico's regulated operations are subject to the jurisdiction of the New Mexico Public Regulation Commission. New Mexico Water accounts for approximately 2% of our total customers and approximately 1% of our total consolidated operating revenue. 

The state regulatory bodies governing our regulated operations are referred to as the Commissions in this annual report. Rates and operations for regulated customers are subject to the jurisdiction of the respective state's regulatory Commission. The Commissions require that water and wastewater rates for each regulated district be independently determined based on the cost of service. The Commissions are expected to authorize rates sufficient to recover normal operating expenses and allow the utility to earn a fair and reasonable return on invested capital. 

We distribute water in accordance with accepted water utility methods. Where applicable, we hold franchises and permits in the cities and communities where we operate. The franchises and permits allow us to operate and maintain facilities in public streets and right-of-ways as necessary. 

We operate the City of Hawthorne and the City of Commerce water systems under lease agreements. In accordance with the lease agreements, we receive all revenues from operating the systems and are responsible for paying the operating costs. The City of Hawthorne and the City of Commerce lease revenues are governed through their respective city councils and are considered non-regulated because they are outside of the CPUC's jurisdiction. We report revenue and expenses for the City of Hawthorne and 

City of Commerce leases in operating revenue and operating expenses because we are entitled to retain all customer billings and are responsible for all operating expenses. These leases are considered "nontariffed products and services (NTPS)" by the CPUC and require a 10% revenue sharing with regulated customers. 

In October 2011, an agreement was negotiated with the City of Hawthorne to lease and operate its water system. The system, which is located near the Hermosa Redondo district, serves about half of Hawthorne's population. The capital lease agreement required an up-front $8.1 million lease deposit to the city that is being amortized over the lease term. Additionally, annual lease payments will be adjusted based on changes in rates charged to customers. Under the lease we are responsible for all aspects of system operation and capital improvements, although title to the system and system improvements reside with the city. Capital improvements are recorded as depreciable plant and equipment and depreciated per the asset lives set forth in the agreement. In exchange, we receive all revenue from the water system, which was $8.0 million, $7.8 million and $7.7 million in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. At the end of the lease, the city is required to reimburse us for the unamortized value of capital improvements made during the term of the lease. The City of Hawthorne capital lease is a 15-year lease and expires in 2026. 

In July 2003, an agreement was negotiated with the City of Commerce to lease and operate its water system. The lease requires us to pay $0.8 million per year in monthly installments and pay $200 per acre-foot for water usage exceeding 2,000 acre-feet per year plus a percentage of certain operational savings that may be realized. Under the lease agreement, we are responsible for all aspects of the system's operations. The city is responsible for capital expenditures, and title to the system and system improvements resides with the city. We bear the risks of operation and collection of amounts billed to customers. The agreement allows Cal Water to request a rate change in order to recover costs. In exchange, we receive all revenue from the water system, which was $2.0 million, $2.1 million, and $2.0 million in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. The City of Commerce lease is a 15-year lease and expires in 2018. 

Non-Regulated Activities 

Fees for non-regulated activities are based on contracts negotiated between the parties. Under our non-regulated contract arrangements, we operate municipally owned water systems, privately owned water and recycled water distribution systems, but are not responsible for all operating costs. Non-regulated revenue received from water system operations is generally determined on a fee-per-customer basis. 

Non-regulated revenue and expense consists primarily of operating water systems under lease agreements which are owned by other entities, leasing communication antenna sites on our properties, billings of optional third-party insurance programs to our residential customers, and unrealized gains or losses on benefit plan insurance investments. 

Effective June 30, 2011, the CPUC adopted new rules surrounding provision of non-regulated services using utility assets and employees. As a result, nearly all California non-regulated activities are now considered NTPS. The prescribed accounting for these NTPS is incremental cost allocation plus revenue sharing with regulated customers. Non-regulated services determined to be "active activities" require a 10% revenue sharing and "passive activities" require a 30% revenue sharing. The amount of non-regulated revenues subject to revenue sharing is the total billed revenues less any authorized pass through costs. Some examples of CPUC authorized pass through costs are purchased water, purchased power, and pump taxes. All of our non-regulated services, except for leasing communication antenna sites on our properties and unrealized gains or losses on benefit plan insurance investments, are "active activities" subject to a 10% revenue sharing. Leasing communication antenna sites on our properties are "passive activities" subject to a 30% revenue sharing. Any significant change in revenue sharing due to the new rules will be reflected in adopted rates after the next general rate case. Cal Water's annual revenue sharing with regulated customers was $2.2 million, $2.3 million, and $2.1 million in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. 

Operating Segment 

We operate in one reportable segment, the supply and distribution of water and providing water-related utility services. For information about revenue from external customers, net income and total assets; see "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data." 

Growth 

We intend to continue exploring opportunities to expand our regulated and non-regulated water and wastewater activities in the western United States. The opportunities could include system acquisitions, lease arrangements similar to the City of Hawthorne and City of Commerce contracts, full service system operation and maintenance agreements, meter reading, billing contracts and other utility-related services. 

Geographical Service Areas and Number of Customers at Year-end 

Our principal markets are users of water within our service areas. The approximate number of customers served in each regulated district, the City of Hawthorne and the City of Commerce, at December 31 is as follows:

Rates and Regulation 

The Commissions have plenary powers setting rates and operating standards. As such, the Commissions' decisions significantly impact the Company's revenues, earnings, and cash flows. The amounts discussed herein are generally annual amounts, unless otherwise stated, and the financial impact to recorded revenue is expected to occur over a 12-month period from the effective date of the decision. In California, water utilities are required to make several different types of filings. Most filings result in rate changes that remain in place until the next General Rate Case (GRC). As explained below, surcharges and surcredits to recover balancing and memorandum accounts as well as general rate case interim rate relief are temporary rate changes, which have specific time frames for recovery. 

GRCs, escalation rate increase filings, and offset filings change rates to amounts that will remain in effect until the next GRC. The CPUC follows a rate case plan, which requires Cal Water to file a GRC for each of its regulated operating districts every three years. In a GRC proceeding, the CPUC not only considers the utility's rate setting requests, but may also consider other issues that affect the utility's rates and operations. The CPUC is generally required to issue its GRC decision prior to the first day of the test year or authorize interim rates. In accordance with the CPUC's rate case plan for Class A water utilities, Cal Water filed a GRC on July 9, 2015, which is applicable to all regulated California Districts. Any rate change as a result of that filing is expected to be effective on January 1, 2017. 

Between GRC filings, Cal Water may file escalation rate increases, which allows Cal Water to recover cost increases, primarily from inflation and incremental investments, during the second and third years of the rate case cycle. However, escalation rate increases are subject to an earnings test on a district-by-district basis. Under the earnings test, the CPUC may reduce the escalation rate increase if, in the most recent 13-month period, this earnings test reflects earnings in excess of what was authorized for that district. 

In addition, California water utilities are entitled to make offset filings. Offset filings may be filed to adjust revenues for construction projects authorized in GRCs when the plant is placed in service (referred to as "ratebase offsets"), or for rate changes charged to Cal Water for purchased water, purchased power, and pump taxes (referred to as "offsettable expenses"). Such rate changes approved in offset filings remain in effect until the next GRC is approved. 

In pursuit of the CPUC's water conservation goals, the CPUC decoupled Cal Water's revenue requirement from customer consumption levels in 2008 by authorizing a Water Revenue Adjustment Mechanism (WRAM) and Modified Cost Balancing Account (MCBA) for each ratemaking area. The WRAM and MCBA ensure that Cal Water recovers revenues authorized by the CPUC regardless of customer consumption. This removes the Company's historical disincentive against promoting lower water usage among customers. Through an annual advice letter filing, Cal Water recovers any uncollected metered revenue amounts authorized, or refunds over-collected quantity revenues, via surcharges and surcredits. The advice letters are filed between February and April of each year and address the net WRAM and MCBA balances collected for the previous calendar year. The majority of WRAM and MCBA balances are collected or refunded through surcharges/surcredits over 12 and 18 months. The WRAM and 

MCBA amounts are cumulative, so if they are not amortized in a given calendar year, the balance is carried forward and included with the following year balance. 

2016 Regulatory Activity - California 

Expense Offset filings 

Expense offsets are dollar-for-dollar increases in revenue to match increased expenses, and therefore do not affect net operating income. In December 2015, Cal Water filed advice letters to offset increased purchased water and pump taxes in 6 of its regulated districts totaling $4.8 million. The new rates were effective on January 1, 2016. 

Escalation Increase filings 

As a part of the decision of the 2012 GRC, Cal Water was authorized to file annual escalation rate increases for 2016 for those districts that passed the earnings test. In December 2015, Cal Water filed for escalation rate increases in 17 districts. The annual adopted gross revenue associated with the December 2015 filing was $5.0 million. The new rates were effective on January 1, 2016. 

2015 &#32;Regulatory Activity - California 

2015 GRC filing 

On July 9, 2015, Cal Water filed a GRC application seeking rate increases in all regulated operating districts in California beginning January 1, 2017 (the "2015 GRC"). The 2015 GRC application requested an increase of $94.8 million in rates for 2017, $23.0 million in rates for 2018 and $22.6 million in rates for 2019. As part of its application, Cal Water requested approval to invest $693.0 million in districts throughout California over the three-year period from January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2018 in order to provide a safe and reliable water supply to its customers. Cal Water expects to work with the CPUC's Office of Ratepayers Advocates (ORA) and intervening parties to reach a settlement or litigate the case. 

Expense Offset filings 

Expense offsets are dollar-for-dollar increases in revenue to match increased expenses, and therefore do not affect net operating income. In 2015, Cal Water filed advice letters to offset increased purchased water and pump taxes in 9 of its regulated districts totaling $28.2 million. The new rates were effective in June, July and September of 2015. 

Escalation Increase filings 

As a part of the decision of the 2012 GRC, Cal Water was authorized to file annual escalation rate increases for 2015 for those districts that passed the earnings test. In January 2015, Cal Water filed for escalation rate increases in 16 districts. The annual adopted gross revenue associated with the January 2015 filing was $4.8 million. The new rates were effective on January 2, 2015. 

Ratebase Offset filings 

For construction projects authorized in GRCs as advice letter projects, Cal Water is allowed to file rate base offsets to increase revenues after the plant is placed into service. Cal Water filed $2.9 million of annual revenue increases for rate base offsets in 2015. The new rates were effective in July and September of 2015. 

WRAM/MCBA filings 

In April 2015, Cal Water filed two advice letters to true up the revenue over- and under-collections in the 2014 annual WRAMs/MCBAs of its regulated districts. A net under-collection of $30.5 million is being recovered from customers over 12, 18 or 20+ month surcharges. This surcharge is in some cases in addition to surcharges authorized in prior years which have not yet expired. The new rates were effective on April 1, 2015. 

Drought Memorandum Account 

In 2014, the CPUC authorized Cal Water to track its incremental costs related to its drought program in a drought memorandum account. On April 1, 2015, the Governor of the State of California issued Executive Order B-29-15 due to severe drought conditions and mandated, among other requirements, restrictions on urban water suppliers like Cal Water to achieve a statewide 25% reduction in potable urban usage, as compared with the amount used in 2013, by February 2016. Pursuant to the Executive Order, the State Water Resources Control Board (&#8220;Water Board&#8221;) adopted a specific restriction for each urban water system. On April 28, 2015, Cal Water filed Schedule 14.1 with the CPUC to establish household and business water budgets and associated enforcement measures, effective June 1, 2015, in order to achieve the state-mandated water reductions. All monies collected by Cal Water through waste-of-water penalties for water use violations are recorded in the drought 

memorandum account and are used to offset the incremental expenses. As of December 31, 2015, total incremental costs tracked in the drought memorandum account since inception were $5.8 million, of which $0.9 million was spent on capital. In addition, all monies collected by Cal Water through drought surcharges for exceeding water budgets are recorded in the appropriate WRAM account and used to offset under-collected revenues. In 2015, customer drought surcharges were $36.9 million and waste-of-water penalties were less than $0.1 million. The 2015 customer drought surcharges and waste-of-water penalties were extended in 2016. 

Federal Income Tax Bonus Depreciation 

&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;In 2011, Cal Water filed for and received approval to track the benefits from federal income tax accelerated depreciation in a memorandum account due to the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010. Additional federal income tax deductions for assets placed in service after September 8, 2010, and before December 31, 2011, were $41.6 million, $0.1 million, $16.5 million, $14.4 million, and $10.6 million were taken in 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013, respectively. The 2015 income tax deduction is estimated at $6.0 million. The memorandum account may result in a surcredit because of the impact to Cal Water&#8217;s revenue requirement for changes to working cash estimates, reductions to federal income tax qualified U.S. production activities deductions (QPAD), and changes to contributions-in-aid-of-construction. As of December 31, 2015, the estimated surcredit range is between $1.0 million and $1.5 million. The CPUC will determine the disposition of amounts recorded in the memorandum account in Cal Water&#8217;s next GRC proceeding. 

Asbestos Memorandum Account Application 

On September 3, 2014, Cal Water filed an application with the CPUC requesting an asbestos litigation memorandum account to track expenses associated with current and future asbestos lawsuits against Cal Water. On February 6, 2015, Cal Water and the ORA filed a settlement resolving all issues, and authorized Cal Water to track all uninsured losses on asbestos litigation cases, settlements, and judgments in a memorandum account for a 5-year period beginning January 1, 2015. The CPUC approved the settlement on May 21, 2015. 

&#32;2015 Regulatory Activity - Other States 

2015 Ka'anapali (Hawaii) GRC Filing 

&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;In December 2015, Hawaii water filed a GRC for its Ka&#8217;anapali water system requesting an additional $1.7 million in revenues for 2016. The application requests recovery for approximately $3.0 million in capital investments in the system since 2012. If approved, the Company anticipates rates would become effective in the fourth quarter of 2016. 

2014 Kona (Hawaii) GRC Filing 

&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;In August 2014, Hawaii Water filed a GRC for Kona water and wastewater requesting $3.3 million. In 2015, Hawaii Water reached a comprehensive and conceptual settlement with the Consumer Advocate and on June 29, 2015 received a Decision and Order from the Hawaii Public Utilities Commission (HPUC) for the Kona water and wastewater rate case approving $2.1 million in additional annual revenues to be phased in over a six month period. The new rates were effective in August 2015. 

2012 Waikoloa (Hawaii) GRC Filings 

&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;In August 2012, Hawaii Water filed GRCs for the Waikoloa Village Water, Waikoloa Village Wastewater, and Waikoloa Resort Utilities requesting $6.3 million in additional annual revenues. The GRCs were processed on separate schedules. Hawaii Water and the Consumer Advocate reached settlements on the rate filings for Waikoloa Village Water, Waikoloa Village Wastewater, and Waikoloa Resort Utilities. On June 22, 2015, the HPUC approved a rate increase for the Waikoloa Village Wastewater rate case authorizing annual revenue increase of $0.7 million and the new rates were effective in August 2015. On July 23, 2014, the HPUC approved the Waikoloa Resort Utilities, Inc. rate case authorizing annual revenue increase of $2.0 million phased in over a two year period. On February 19, 2015, the HPUC issued an order approving the Waikoloa Village Water rate case and then on April 17, 2015, the HPUC issued a corrected order approving an annual revenue increase of $0.1 million effective June 30, 2015. 

2011 Pukalani (Hawaii) GRC Filing 

&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;In August 2011, Hawaii Water filed a GRC for Pukalani wastewater system. On January 15, 2014, Hawaii Water received a Decision and Order for the GRC for the Pukalani wastewater system rate case approving $0.6 million in additional annual revenues. Hawaii Water reached a comprehensive and conceptual settlement with the Consumer Advocate. This decision approved an increase of $0.3 million in 2014, another increase of $0.2 million in 2015, and another increase of $0.2 million in 2016. Each increase is separated by one year. The new rates for 2015 were effective February 1, 2015. 

2014 Washington Water GRC Filing 

&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;On August 14, 2014, Washington Water filed a GRC requesting $1.5 million. On January 15, 2015, the Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission approved the rate case authorizing annual revenue increase of $1.4 million, in part due to updated information. New rates were effective February 1, 2015. 

Water Supply 

Our source of supply varies among our operating districts. Certain districts obtain all of their supply from wells; some districts purchase all of their supply from wholesale suppliers; and other districts obtain supply from a combination of wells and wholesale suppliers. A small portion of supply comes from surface sources and is processed through Company-owned water treatment plants. To the best of management's knowledge, we are meeting water quality, environmental, and other regulatory standards for all company-owned systems. 

Historically, approximately 49% of our annual water supply is pumped from wells. State groundwater management agencies operate differently in each state. Some of our wells extract ground water from water basins under state ordinances. These are adjudicated groundwater basins, in which a court has settled the dispute between landowners or other parties over how much annual groundwater can be extracted by each party. All of our adjudicated groundwater basins are located in the State of California. Our annual groundwater extraction from adjudicated groundwater basins approximates 6.7 billion gallons or 13% of our total annual water supply pumped from wells. Historically, we have extracted less than 100% of our annual adjudicated groundwater rights and have the right to carry forward up to 20% of the unused amount to the next annual period. All of our remaining wells extract ground water from managed or unmanaged water basins. There are no set limits for the ground water extracted from these water basins; however, the state or local water management agencies have the authority to regulate the groundwater extraction quantity whenever there are unforeseen large decreases to water basin levels. Our annual groundwater extraction from managed groundwater basins approximates 32.6 billion gallons or 61% of our total annual water supply pumped from wells. Our annual groundwater extraction from unmanaged groundwater basins approximates 13.7 billion gallons or 26% of our total annual water supply pumped from wells. Most of the managed groundwater basins we extract water from have groundwater recharge facilities. We are required to pay well pump taxes to financially support these groundwater recharge facilities. Our well pump taxes for the 12 months ending December 31, 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 was $11.5 million, $12.9 million, and $10.8 million, respectively. In 2014, the State of California enacted the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act of 2014. The law and its implementing regulations will require most basins to select a sustainability agency by 2017, develop a sustainability plan by 2022, and show progress toward sustainability by 2027. We expect that in the future, groundwater will be produced mainly from managed and adjudicated basins. 

California's normal weather pattern yields little precipitation between mid-spring and mid-fall. The Washington Water service areas receive precipitation in all seasons, with the heaviest amounts during the winter. New Mexico Water's rainfall is heaviest in the summer monsoon season. Hawaii Water receives precipitation throughout the year, with the largest amounts in the winter months. Water usage in all service areas is highest during the warm and dry summers and declines in the cool winter months. Rain and snow during the winter months in California replenish underground water aquifers and fill reservoirs, providing the water supply for subsequent delivery to customers. As of February 3, 2016, the State of California snowpack water content during the 2015&#8212;2016 water year is 130% of long-term averages (per the California Department of Water Resources, Northern Sierra Precipitation Accumulation report). While precipitation and snowfall in the winter of 2016 is encouraging as of February 3, 2016, further precipitation is needed to mitigate drought conditions statewide and lift the California State of Emergency declared by Governor Brown. Management believes that supply pumped from underground aquifers and purchased from wholesale suppliers will be adequate to meet customer demand during 2016 and beyond. However, water budgets are expected to continue for Cal Water customers as required by the state or local jurisdictions. Long-term water supply plans are developed for each of our districts to help assure an adequate water supply under various operating and supply conditions. Some districts have unique challenges in meeting water quality standards, but management believes that supplies will meet current standards using current treatment processes. 

The following table shows the estimated quantity of water purchased and the percentage of purchased water to total water production in each California operating district that purchased water in 2015 . Other than noted below, all other districts receive 100% of their water supply from wells.

The Bear Gulch district obtains a portion of its water supply from surface runoff from the local watershed. The Oroville district in the Sacramento Valley, the Bakersfield district in the San Joaquin Valley, and the Kern River Valley district in the Los Angeles Area purchase water from a surface supply. Surface sources are processed through our water treatment plants before being delivered to the distribution system. The Bakersfield district also purchases treated water as a component of its water supply. 

The Chico, Marysville, Dixon, and Willows districts in the Sacramento Valley, the Salinas and King City districts in the Salinas Valley, and the Selma and Visalia districts in the San Joaquin Valley obtain their entire supply from wells. In the Salinas district, which solely depends upon ground water, several wells were taken out of service in the last five years, primarily due to poor water quality. Treatment systems have been installed on some of these wells to meet customer demand. Management believes water supply issues in the Salinas district will be adequately resolved in the future by seeking additional sources or additional treatment. 

Purchases for the Los Altos, Livermore, Oroville, Redwood Valley, Stockton, and Bakersfield districts are pursuant to long-term contracts expiring on various dates after 2015 . The water supplies purchased for the Dominguez, East Los Angeles, Hermosa Redondo, Palos Verdes, and Westlake districts as well as the Hawthorne and Commerce systems are provided by public agencies pursuant to a statutory obligation of continued non- preferential service to purveyors within the agencies' boundaries. Purchases for the Bayshore and Bear Gulch districts are in accordance with long-term contracts with the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission (SFPUC) until June 30, 2034. 

Management anticipates water supply contracts will be renewed as they expire though the price of wholesale water purchases is subject to pricing changes imposed by the various wholesalers. 

Shown below are wholesaler price rates and increases that became effective in 2015 &#32;and estimated wholesaler price rates and percent changes for 2016 . In 2015 , several districts experienced significant purchased water cost increases resulting in a significant impact in the 2015 &#32;MCBA balance and the filing of several purchased water offsets.

We work with all local suppliers and agencies responsible for water supply to insure adequate, long-term supply for each system. 

See Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Water Supply" concerning more information on adequacy of supplies. 

Seasonal Fluctuations 

In California, our customers' consumption pattern of water varies with the weather, in terms of rainfall and temperature. In the WRAM and MCBA design, the CPUC considers the historical pattern in determining the adopted sales and production costs. With a majority of our sales being subject to the WRAM and production costs being covered by the MCBA, fluctuations in financial results have been minimized. However, cash flows from operations and short-term borrowings on our credit facilities can be significantly impacted by seasonal fluctuations including recovery of the WRAM and MCBA. 

Our water business is seasonal in nature. Weather conditions can have a material effect on customer usage. Customer demand for water generally is lower during the cooler and rainy, winter months. Demand increases in the spring when warmer weather returns and the rains end, and customer use more water for outdoor purposes, such as landscape irrigation. Warm temperatures during the generally dry summer months result in increased demand. Water usage declines during the fall as temperatures decrease and the rainy season begins. During years in which precipitation is especially heavy or extends beyond the spring into the early summer, customer demand can decrease from historic normal levels, generally due to reduced outdoor water usage. Likewise, an 

early start to the rainy season during the fall can cause a decline in customer usage. As a result, seasonality of water usage has a significant impact on our cash flows from operations and borrowing on our short-term facilities. 

Utility Plant Construction 

We have continually extended, enlarged, and replaced our facilities as required to meet increasing demands and to maintain the water systems. We obtain construction financing using funds from operations, short-term bank borrowings, long-term financing, advances for construction and contributions in aid of construction that are funded by developers. Advances for construction are cash deposits from developers for construction of water facilities or water facilities deeded from developers. These advances are generally refundable without interest over a period of 40 years in equal annual payment amounts. Contributions in aid of construction consist of nonrefundable cash deposits or facilities transferred from developers, primarily for fire protection and relocation projects. We cannot control the amounts received from developers. This amount fluctuates from year-to-year as the level of construction activity carried on by developers varies. This activity is impacted by the demand for housing, commercial development, and general business conditions, including interest rates. 

See Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Liquidity and Capital Resources" for additional information. 

Energy Reliability 

We continue to use power efficiently to minimize the power expenses passed on to our customers, and maintain backup power systems to continue water service to our customers if the power companies' supplies are interrupted. Many of our well sites are equipped with emergency electric generators designed to produce electricity to keep the wells operating during power outages. Storage tanks also provide customers with water during blackout periods. 

Impact of Climate Change Legislation 

Our operations depend on power provided by other public utilities and, in emergencies, power generated by our portable and fixed generators. If future legislation limits emissions from the power generation process, our cost of power may increase. Any increase in the cost of power will be passed along to our California customers through the MCBA or included in our cost of service paid by our customers as requested in our general rate case filings. 

We maintain a fleet of vehicles to provide service to our customers, including a number of heavy duty diesel vehicles that were retrofitted to meet California emission standards. If future legislation further impacts the cost to operate the fleet or the fleet acquisition cost in order to meet certain emission standards, it will increase our cost of service and our rate base. Any increase in fleet operating costs associated with meeting emission standards will be included in our cost of service paid by our customers as requested in our general rate case filings. While recovery of these costs is not guaranteed, we would expect recovery in the regulatory process. 

Under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), all capital projects of a certain type (primarily wells, tanks, major pipelines and treatment facilities) require mitigation of green house gas emissions. The cost to prepare the CEQA documentation and permit will be included in our capital cost and added to our rate base, which will be requested to be paid for by our customers. Any increase in the operating cost of the facilities will also be included in our cost of service paid by our customers as requested in our general rate case filings. While recovery of these costs is not guaranteed, we would expect recovery in the regulatory process. 

Cap and trade regulations were implemented in 2012 with the goal of reducing emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2020. These regulations have not impacted water utilities at this time. In the future, if we are required to comply with these regulations, any increase in operating costs associated with meeting these standards will be included in our cost of service paid by our customers as requested in our general rate case filings. While recovery of these costs is not guaranteed, we would expect recovery in the regulatory process. 

Security at Company Facilities 

Due to terrorism and other risks, we have heightened security at our facilities and have taken added precautions to protect our employees and the water delivered to customers. In 2002, federal legislation was enacted that resulted in new regulations concerning security of water facilities, including submitting vulnerability assessment studies to the federal government. We have complied with regulations issued by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) pursuant to federal legislation concerning vulnerability assessments and have made filings to the EPA as required. In addition, communication plans have been developed as a component of our procedures. While we do not make public comments on our security programs, we have been in contact with federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies to coordinate and improve our water delivery systems' security. 

Quality of Water Supply 

Our operating practices are designed to produce potable water in accordance with accepted water utility practices. Water entering the distribution systems from surface sources is treated in compliance with federal and state Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) standards. Most well supplies are chlorinated or chloraminated for disinfection. Water samples from each water system are analyzed on a regular, scheduled basis in compliance with regulatory requirements. We operate a state-certified water quality laboratory at the San Jose General Office that provides testing for most of our California operations. Certain tests in California are contracted with independent certified labs qualified under the Environmental Laboratory Accreditation Program. Local independent state certified labs provide water sample testing for the Washington, New Mexico and Hawaii operations. 

In recent years, federal and state water quality regulations have resulted in increased water sampling requirements. The SDWA continues to be amended to address public health concerns. We monitor water quality standard changes and upgrade our treatment capabilities to maintain compliance with the various regulations. 

Competition and Condemnation 

Our principal operations are regulated by the Commission of each state. Under state laws, no privately owned public utility may compete within any service territory that we already serve without first obtaining a certificate of public convenience and necessity from the applicable Commission. Issuance of such a certificate would only be made upon finding that our service is deficient. To management's knowledge, no application to provide service to an area served by us has been made. 

State law provides that whenever a public agency constructs facilities to extend a utility system into the service area of a privately owned public utility, such an act constitutes the taking of property and requires reimbursement to the utility for its loss. State statutes allow municipalities, water districts and other public agencies to own and operate water systems. These agencies are empowered to condemn properties already operated by privately owned public utilities. The agencies are also authorized to issue bonds, including revenue bonds, for the purpose of acquiring or constructing water systems. However, if a public agency were to acquire utility property by eminent domain action, the utility would be entitled to just compensation for its loss. In Washington, annexation was approved in February 2008 for property served by us on Orcas Island; however, we continue to serve the customers in the annexed area and do not expect the annexation to impact our operations. In November 2015, Cal Water received a letter from the City of Visalia stating that the City had decided to appraise the Visalia District Water System as an initial step that could lead to an offer to purchase that system by the City of Visalia. On January 7, Cal Water received a subsequent letter from the City of Visalia stating that the City has decided not to pursue an acquisition of the Visalia District Water System at this time. To management's knowledge, other than the Orcas Island property and the City of Visalia, no municipality, water district, or other public agency is contemplating or has any action pending to acquire or condemn any of our systems. 

Environmental Matters 

Our operations are subject to environmental regulation by various governmental authorities. Environmental health and safety programs have been designed to provide compliance with water discharge regulations, underground and aboveground fuel storage tank regulations, hazardous materials management plans, hazardous waste regulations, air quality permitting requirements, wastewater discharge limitations and employee safety issues related to hazardous materials. Also, we actively investigate alternative technologies for meeting environmental regulations and continue the traditional practices of meeting environmental regulations. 

For a description of the material effects that compliance with environmental regulations may have on us, see Item 1A. "Risk Factors&#8212;Risks Related to Our Regulatory Environment." We expect environmental regulation to increase, resulting in higher operating costs in the future, and there can be no assurance that the commissions would approve rate increases to enable us to recover these additional compliance costs. 

Employees 

At December 31, 2015 , we had 1,155 employees, including 54 at Washington Water, 44 at Hawaii Water, and 14 at New Mexico Water. In California, most non-supervisory employees are represented by the Utility Workers Union of America, AFL-CIO, except certain engineering and laboratory employees who are represented by the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers, AFL-CIO. 

At December 31, 2015, we had 731 union employees. In January 2015, we negotiated a six year contract that included 2015, 2016, and 2017 wage increases with both of our unions of 3.25% and 2.75%, and 2.75%, respectively. Annual wage increases for 2018, 2019, and 2020 are estimated to be in the range from 2.5% to 3.25%. The wage changes will fluctuate with the changes to the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for the Los Angeles area. In the event an annual wage increase is determined to be greater than 3.25% or less that 2.0%, either party may request to re-open negotiations for wages only. Such notice must be served on the other 

party no later than 60 days after the publication of such CPI data. The current agreement with the unions is effective through 2020. Management believes that it maintains good relationships with the unions. 

Employees at Washington Water, New Mexico Water, and Hawaii Water are not represented by unions.
