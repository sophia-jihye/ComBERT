Overview 

&#160; 

LRAD Corporation develops and delivers innovative directed acoustic products that beam, focus and control sound over relatively short and long distances. By placing sound only where needed, we not only enhance many typical speaker applications, but we offer novel sound applications that conventional speakers cannot achieve. We have developed a broad product line of directional LRAD &#174; products using our proprietary technologies. Over the years, we redesigned and enhanced our directional LRAD products, improving quality and functionality. In 2012, using the technology that we developed for our directional speakers, we designed and developed a new line of omnidirectional LRAD ONE VOICE &#174; speakers. Unlike our directional products, which have a narrow 15 to 30 degree beam of sound, the omnidirectional line offers products that project sound from 60 to 360 degrees to meet the needs of the global mass notification marketplace. We now offer a variety of directional and omnidirectional sound products which meet a broad range of requirements from communicating with and deterring threats over distances up to 600 meters with our hand-held LRAD 100X to distances up to 5,500 meters with our LRAD 2000X. Our Long Range Acoustic Device &#174; or LRAD pioneered a new worldwide market for directional long-range acoustic hailing devices (&#8220;AHDs&#8221;) which we have sold into over 70 countries. We have been at the forefront developing new acoustic innovations and we believe we have established a significant competitive advantage in our principal markets. 

&#160; 

Technology and Products 

&#160; 

Our LRAD products represent a technological breakthrough that creates a directed acoustic beam using minimal power to communicate at operational ranges with authority and superior intelligibility even in high ambient noise environments. Our LRAD was initially developed for the U.S. Navy to fulfill a capability gap identified after the USS Cole attack in 2000 and has been deployed by the U.S. Army, Navy, Marine Corps and Coast Guard, as well as international military services and commercial maritime, commercial security, and public safety organizations around the globe since early 2003. Over the years, we redesigned and enhanced our LRAD products, including improved voice intelligibility, output and durability. Our LRAD hailing, notification and warning systems feature a 15 to 30 degree acoustic beam and a broadcast range up to 5,500 meters. Our LRAD systems also feature a rugged construction that allows our products to meet the stringent environmental requirements of military applications. Our LRAD systems broadcast highly-intelligible voice communications, prerecorded messages in multiple languages and warning tones to establish large safety zones allowing operators more time and distance to determine the intent, influence the behavior and gain compliance from approaching vessels, vehicles or personnel. 

&#160; 

Our LRAD product line provides a complete range of systems from single user portable to permanently installed, remotely operated units. In recent years, we have added new models to meet specific customer requirements and to enable us to expand our technology into new markets. We have also added new features such as wireless capability, recordable microphones, integrated and remote electronics packages, and various amplifier configurations. 

&#160; 

In 2012, utilizing our advanced speaker technology developed for our directed products, we designed and developed an omnidirectional speaker, the LRAD 360X. Unlike most of the mass notification systems currently on the market, which are primarily sirens, our mass notification products provide the same highly intelligible voice clarity as the rest of the LRAD product line. The LRAD 360X is designed to transmit highly intelligible voice communications and warnings over a 360-degree area, unlike the more directional LRAD products. Since the initial product launch, we have expanded our omnidirectional product line to include various size offerings, a 60-degree unit, a mobile unit mounted on a trailer, and various configurations of amplifiers, power sources, software and other products to meet the needs of the mass notification market. We expect this expanded product line will make us more competitive in the large and growing mass notification market. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

In 2014, we introduced the LRAD 450XL, which uses new, patent pending XL speaker technology and is designed to be the most powerful acoustic hailing device in the market today for its size and weight. In 2015, we introduced the LRAD 500RX, which is engineered and designed on our proprietary pan and tilt system and is a lighter, more compact version of our successful LRAD 1000RX. In 2016, we launched the LRAD RXL which combines the new patent pending speaker technology of our LRAD 450XL with the remotely operated pan and tilt system of our LRAD 500RX. We continue to enhance our product design and manufacturing capabilities to improve the durability and performance of our units. Our LRAD products have been competitively selected over other commercially available systems by U.S. and several foreign militaries. Our LRAD product line currently includes the following:

&#160; 

We continue to develop additional products to expand our omnidirectional product offering to meet the needs of the growing global mass notification market. 

&#160; 

Strategy 

&#160; 

We believe we have been instrumental in developing a market and increasing demand for AHDs in a number of business segments and markets. We believe we have a strong brand in this market and a reputation for producing quality products. We are building on our leadership position in the field of directed or focused sound for both short-range and long-range communication with high quality, clarity and intelligibility. Our overall strategy is to offer an increasing variety of directional and omnidirectional sound and other products for an increasing range of applications. In executing our strategy, we use direct sales to governments, military, large end-users, system integrators and defense-related companies, and we have built a worldwide distribution channel consisting of partners and resellers that have significant expertise and experience selling integrated communications solutions into our various target markets. Since our primary sales opportunities are with militaries and governments, we are subject to each customer&#8217;s unique budget cycle, which leads to extremely long selling cycles and uneven revenue flow, complicating our product planning. 

&#160; 

In 2017, we plan to continue pursuing global market opportunities with the support of new business development consultants added in late 2015 and 2016, and additional planned market specific consultants for fiscal year 2017. Our plan is to grow revenue through increased direct sales to domestic and international militaries, and large commercial and defense-related companies, who desire to use our directed sound technology in their integrated product offerings. This includes a continued strong effort to pursue U.S. military opportunities where we have seen improvement in the past year. Our focus will be primarily on government, military, law enforcement, homeland and international security, private and commercial security, border security, maritime security, and wildlife preservation and control markets. Asia has been a strong market for our products in recent years, but declined in fiscal 2016 due to the timing of programs. We plan to continue to pursue these programs and others in the region to increase revenues. We also plan to focus efforts in Europe and the Middle East where we believe there is a significant opportunity for growth. While we have been developing these markets for several years, we have only begun to realize the significant potential in these worldwide market opportunities. 

&#160; 

We plan to continue expanding our presence and increase our market share in the global mass notification market. We entered the large mass notification market with the introduction of the LRAD 360X omnidirectional product. We have designed and developed a complimentary omnidirectional product line to increase our presence in this global market. We intend to continue expanding our product and system offerings and obtain qualifying certificates to allow access to more markets around the world. While this is a more mature marketplace with established manufacturers and suppliers, we believe that our superior technology and product and system offerings give us an opportunity to penetrate and succeed in this large, expanding market. We also plan to continue our focus on expanding and strengthening domestic and international sales channels by adding key channel partners, distributors and dealers that focus on the mass notification market. 

&#160; 

Our research and development strategy is to continue developing innovative directed acoustic solutions to meet the needs of our target markets, as well as to continue to expand our omnidirectional offerings to include a more comprehensive, integrated solution. Our enhanced, patent pending speaker technology introduced in 2014 was designed to provide almost twice the output of our current speakers in a significantly smaller and lighter weight form factor, with the same, highly-intelligible clarity of our original speakers. This technology was initially launched in our LRAD 450XL system and then utilized in our LRAD RXL system in fiscal year 2016. We plan to continue to incorporate this technology into additional products in the future. We continue to expand our omnidirectional product line to include new speakers in different sizes, as well as various configurations of amplifiers, mounts, power sources and software. We have begun to pursue certain certifications, which are often required when bidding on military opportunities. We are also configuring alternative solutions to achieve lower price points to meet the needs of certain customers or applications. We also engage in ongoing value engineering to reduce the cost and simplify the manufacturing of our products. Our mass notification products represent a much more complex, integrated offering. We plan to continue investing engineering resources and capital to develop products and software to further expand our omnidirectional product line. 

&#160; 

We intend to continue operating with financial discipline in order to create value for our shareholders. We are focused on growing our top line revenue, which we believe will translate into increased net profit growth by successfully entering into new markets and expanding our market share in the mass notification market. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Manufacturing and Suppliers 

&#160; 

Manufacturing . We believe maintaining quality manufacturing capacity is essential to the performance of our products and the growth of our business. Our technologies are different from mass produced designs, and our manufacturing and assembly involves unique processes and materials. We contract with third party suppliers to produce various components and sub-assemblies. At our San Diego, California facility, we complete the final assembly, test and ship our products for both commercial and government systems. We have refined our internal processes to improve how we design, test and qualify product designs. We continue to implement rigorous manufacturing and quality processes to track production and field failures. We also perform third party testing and certification of our products to ensure that they meet rigorous military and commercial specifications. We have developed custom manufacturing equipment used to automate the production of key sub-assemblies reducing the labor component and permitting higher volume production. We implement design and component changes periodically to reduce our product costs and improve product reliability and manufacturability. 

&#160; 

Suppliers . Our products have a large number of components and sub-assemblies produced by outside suppliers mostly located within 50 miles of our facility to take advantage of flexible turnaround, minimize inventories and to maximize the efficiency of our supply chain. We purchase a number of key components and sub-assemblies from foreign suppliers. Consequently, we are subject to the impact economic conditions can have on such suppliers and the fluctuations of foreign currency exchange rates which could impact our lead times and product cost. We have developed strong relationships with a number of our key suppliers. If these suppliers should experience quality problems or part shortages, our production schedules could be significantly delayed or our costs significantly increased. 

&#160; 

Sales and Marketing 

&#160; 

We market and sell products and services through our sales force based in California, Colorado, Minnesota, Texas and Wisconsin. Our corporate and administrative offices are located in San Diego, California. 

&#160; 

We sell directly to governments, military, large end-users and defense-related companies. We use independent representatives on a commission basis to assist us in our direct sales efforts. We also use a channel distribution model in which we sell our products directly to independent resellers and system integrators around the world, who then sell our products (or our products integrated with other systems) to end-user customers. We are focusing our internal business development resources on building relationships with defense integrators and other large direct customers. In addition, we utilize several part-time consultants with expertise in various areas of U.S. government and defense, to advise us in procedures and budget processes in an effort to be successful in these areas. 

&#160; 

We have established a global reputation for providing high quality, innovative sound solutions that has made LRAD an internationally recognized product brand. We actively promote our brands and our products through trade shows and advertising, and we intend to continue increasing the use of our trademarks throughout our product distribution chain and believe growing brand awareness will assist in expanding our business. We believe our reputation for technological expertise, experienced personnel, and strong service and support will also keep us competitive. 

&#160; 

Customer Concentration 

&#160; 

For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016, we did not have any single customer accounting for more than 10% of revenues. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015, revenues from one customer accounted for 15% of revenues, with no other single customer accounting for more than 10% of revenues. 

&#160; 

Our revenues to date have relied on a few major customers. The loss of any customer could have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We have made progress diversifying sound technology revenues and expect to continue to do so in future periods. 

&#160; 

Backlog 

&#160; 

Our order backlog for products that are deliverable in the next 12 months was approximately $3,065,597 at September 30, 2016, compared to $4,451,016 at September 30, 2015. The amount of backlog at any point in time is dependent upon scheduled delivery dates to our customers and product lead times. Our backlog orders are supported by firm purchase orders. 

&#160; 

Warranties 

&#160; 

We generally warrant our products to be free from defects in materials and workmanship for a period up to one year from the date of purchase. The warranty is generally a limited warranty, and in some instances imposes certain shipping costs on the customer. We generally provide direct warranty service, but at times we may establish warranty service through third parties. Our international warranties are generally similar to the warranties we offer in the U.S. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

We also provide repair and maintenance agreements and extended warranty contracts at market rates, with terms ranging from one year to several years, as an additional source of revenue and to provide increased customer satisfaction. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

Our technologies and products compete with those of other companies. The commercial and government audio industry markets are fragmented and include numerous manufacturers with audio products that vary widely in price, quality and distribution channels. Many of our present and potential future competitors have, or may have, substantially greater resources to devote to product development. We believe we compete primarily on the originality of our products, the uniqueness of our technology and designs, our responsiveness to customers and our ability to meet their needs and, most importantly, the quality, ruggedness and superior performance of our products which have been developed by incorporating feedback from our customers and our desire to provide the highest quality product to our markets. 

&#160; 

Our directional LRAD products are the leading acoustic hailing and warning products in the market today for military and commercial applications. The broad category of government audio industry speakers includes competitors such as Ultra Electronics USSI, IML Sound Commander, and others. We do not believe these competitors have achieved significant global market penetration in the government or commercial directed hailing markets to date. We believe our LRAD product line has demonstrated acceptance and has performed extremely well in harsh environments and can continue to compete on the basis of technical features, performance, ease of use, quality and cost. As we continue to grow this market, future competitors with greater resources may enter with new technologies and capabilities, which could impact our competitiveness. 

&#160; 

With the introduction of the omnidirectional LRAD products, we entered the more mature and established mass notification market, which has a number of large competitors including Federal Signal Corporation, Whelen Engineering Company Inc., Siemens AG, Acoustic Technology, Inc., Eaton Corporation, and others. In addition to powerful warning tones and sirens, the omnidirectional LRAD products provide the same vocal clarity, intelligibility and quality over long distances as our directed LRAD products. We believe the highly intelligible voice of our omnidirectional products gives us a competitive advantage against these larger organizations. We believe the domestic and international markets for mass notification systems are substantial and growing. 

&#160; 

Seasonality 

&#160; 

Government business tends to be seasonal due to government procurement and budget cycles, with the quarter ending September 30, which coincides with the United States government budget year, usually producing relatively higher sales, and the quarter ending December 31, usually producing relatively lower sales. International budget years vary by country. Since our sales are primarily to governments, governmental departments or agencies, our selling cycles tend to be long and difficult to forecast. We have not experienced any significant seasonality trends to date, but we may experience increased seasonality in the future. 

&#160; 

Government Regulation 

&#160; 

We are subject to a variety of government laws and regulations that apply to companies engaged in international operations, including, among others, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, U.S. Department of Commerce export controls, local government regulations and procurement policies and practices (including regulations relating to import-export control, investments, exchange controls and repatriation of earnings). We maintain controls and procedures to comply with laws and regulations associated with our international operations. If we are unable to remain compliant with such laws and regulations, our business may be adversely affected. 

&#160; 

Our products are produced to comply with standard product safety requirements for sale in the United States and similar requirements for sale in Europe and Canada. We expect to meet the electrical and other regulatory requirements for electronic systems or components we sell throughout the world. 

&#160; 

Financial Information about Segments and Geographic Areas 

&#160; 

Financial information regarding our segments and the geographic areas in which we operate is contained in Note 15, Major Customers, Suppliers, Segment and Related Information, to our consolidated financial statements. 

&#160; 

Intellectual Property Rights and Proprietary Information 

&#160; 

We operate in an industry where innovation, investment in new ideas and protection of resulting intellectual property rights are important drivers of success. We rely on a variety of intellectual property protections for our products and technologies, including patent, trademark and trade secret laws and contractual obligations, and we pursue a policy of vigorously enforcing such rights. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

In addition to such factors as innovation, technological expertise and experienced personnel, we believe that a strong product offering that is continually upgraded and enhanced will keep us competitive, and we will seek patent protection on important technological improvements that we make. We have an ongoing policy of filing patent applications to seek protection for novel features of our products and technologies. Prior to the filing and granting of patents, our policy is to disclose key features to patent counsel and maintain these features as trade secrets prior to product introduction. Patent applications may not result in issued patents covering all-important claims and could be denied in their entirety. We also file for trade name and trademark protection when appropriate. We are the owner of federally registered trademarks including LRAD &#174; , LONG RANGE ACOUSTIC DEVICE &#174; , LRAD-X &#174; , LRAD-RX &#174; , SOUNDSABER &#174; , ONE VOICE &#174;, and have filed for registration of SOUND SHIELD TM , many of which have earned worldwide brand recognition. 

&#160; 

Our policy is to enter into nondisclosure agreements with each employee and consultant or third party to whom any of our proprietary information is disclosed. These agreements prohibit the disclosure of confidential information to others, both during and subsequent to employment or the duration of the working relationship. These agreements may not prevent disclosure of confidential information or provide adequate remedies for any breach. 

&#160; 

Research and Development 

&#160; 

The sound reproduction market is subject to rapid changes in technology and design with frequent improvements and new product introductions, as well as customized solutions for specific customer applications. We believe our future success will depend on our ability to enhance and improve existing technologies and to introduce new technologies and products on a competitive basis that meet the needs of our customers. Accordingly, we are continuing to engage in significant research and new product development activities. 

&#160; 

For the fiscal years ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we spent approximately $2.4 million and $2.0 million, respectively, on company-sponsored research and development. Future levels of research and development expenditures will vary depending on the timing of further new product development and the availability of funds to carry on additional research and development on currently owned technologies or in other areas.
