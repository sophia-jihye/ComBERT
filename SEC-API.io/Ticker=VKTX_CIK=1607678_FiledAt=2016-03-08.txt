 Item 1. Business.

Overview

We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of novel, first-in-class or best-in-class therapies for metabolic and endocrine disorders. We have exclusive worldwide rights to a portfolio of five drug candidates in clinical trials or preclinical studies, which are based on small molecules licensed from Ligand Pharmaceuticals Incorporated, or Ligand. Details regarding our license agreement with Ligand are discussed under the heading &#8220;Agreements with Ligand&#8221; under Part I, &#8220;Item 1. Business&#8221; of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Our lead clinical program is VK5211, an orally available drug candidate, currently in a Phase 2 clinical trial for acute rehabilitation following non-elective hip fracture surgery. Hip fracture is a common injury among persons aged 60 and older. The acute recovery period post-injury is characterized by significant and rapid declines in bone mineral density, or BMD, and lean body mass, or LBM, which contributes to substantial morbidity and mortality in these patients. VK5211 is a non-steroidal selective androgen receptor modulator, or SARM. A SARM is designed to selectively interact with a subset of receptors that have a normal physiologic role of interacting with naturally-occurring hormones called androgens. Broad activation of androgen receptors with drugs, such as exogenous testosterone, can stimulate muscle growth and improve BMD, but often results in unwanted side effects such as prostate growth, hair growth and acne. VK5211 is expected to selectively produce the therapeutic benefits of testosterone in muscle and bone tissue, potentially accelerating rehabilitation and improving patient outcomes. 

We expect VK5211 to produce the therapeutic benefits of testosterone, including increased LBM and BMD, with improved safety, tolerability and patient acceptance due to a tissue-selective mechanism of action and an oral route of administration. Tissue selectivity is particularly important in treating patients recovering from non-elective hip fracture surgery, as these patients experience abnormally elevated losses of muscle tissue and BMD. This results in a loss of muscle strength, an increased risk of additional fractures and increased mortality. We believe the selective stimulation of androgen receptors in muscle and bone provides an attractive therapeutic approach for patients recovering from hip fractures. In Phase 1 clinical trials, VK5211 demonstrated statistically significant increases in LBM among treated subjects following 21 days of treatment. Statistically significant refers to a low probability, generally regarded as less than or equal to 5%, of obtaining the observed result under a hypothesis that assumes no difference between treatment groups. We also observed positive dose-dependent trends in functional exercise and strength measures consistent with anabolic activity. In addition, no drug-related serious adverse events were reported. In an established animal model of osteoporosis, treatment with VK5211 resulted in significant increases in BMD and bone strength. In October 2015, we commenced enrollment for a Phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical trial in patients recovering from non-elective hip fracture surgery, and we expect to enroll a total of 120 patients 

&#160;

and complete enrollment in this clinical trial in th e second half of 2016. We also plan to discuss with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, potential clinical development of VK5211 in other acute use settings, such as cancer cachexia. 

Hip fractures occur in over 300,000 persons in the U.S. annually. Most hip fractures occur in the elderly, often resulting from minimal trauma, such as a fall from standing height. Unfortunately, elderly individuals are at higher risk of substantial morbidity and mortality due to these fractures as a result of higher rates of frailty and undernourishment. Furthermore, the rate of hip fracture is known to increase with age, doubling every 5-6 years after age 60. Hip fractures can lead to devastating consequences. Disability frequently results from persistent pain and limited physical mobility. Hip fractures are associated with substantial morbidity and mortality, with approximately 15%-20% of patients dying within one year of fracture. There are currently no approved therapies in the U.S. for restoration or preservation of LBM, BMD or physical function in patients who have suffered a hip fracture. Pharmacological interventions, including with steroids, have demonstrated limited clinical benefit or expose patients to the risk of undesirable side-effects, such as virilization in women and prostate growth in men. We believe the potential size of the worldwide hip fracture treatment market for a SARM exceeds $1.0 billion annually.

Our second program is focused on the development of orally available small molecule thyroid hormone receptor beta, or TR&#223;, agonists. Our two lead molecules are VK2809 and VK0214. We believe selective thyroid receptor agonists have the potential to treat a variety of lipid disorders. Thyroid hormone receptors are found in several tissues throughout the body. The TR&#223; isoform is the major receptor subtype expressed in the liver and the TR &#97; isoform is the major subtype expressed in the heart. Selective activation of the TR&#223; receptor in liver tissue is believed to favorably affect cholesterol and lipoprotein levels via multiple mechanisms, including increasing the expression of low-density lipoprotein receptors, or LDL, receptors and increasing mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation. These characteristics in turn lead to reductions of LDL cholesterol, or LDL-C, plasma and liver triglycerides. We are developing VK2809 for the potential treatment of hypercholesterolemia and fatty liver disease. We are developing VK0214 for the potential treatment of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy, or X-ALD. We believe our selective TR&#223; agonists are capable of achieving this unique lipid lowering profile without eliciting unwanted effects on the heart and thyroid hormone axis.

VK2809 is an orally available, tissue and receptor-subtype selective agonist of the thyroid beta receptor that is entering Phase 2 development for the treatment of patients with hypercholesterolemia and fatty liver disease. VK2809 belongs to a family of novel prodrugs which are cleaved in vivo to release potent thyromimetics. 

In a Phase 1 multiple ascending dose clinical trial, patients with mild hypercholesterolemia who were treated with VK2809 at doses of 5 mg and above experienced significant placebo-adjusted LDL-C reductions from baseline, ranging from approximately 15%-41%. In addition, placebo-adjusted triglyceride levels were reduced by more than 30% at doses of 2.5 mg and above. There were no serious adverse events observed in this trial, and no differences in heart rate, heart rhythm or blood pressure were observed between VK2809 and placebo-treated patients. In addition, VK2809 has demonstrated significant reductions in liver fat content in multiple animal models of fatty liver disease, suggesting potential efficacy in the setting of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH. We plan to commence a Phase 2 clinical trial of VK2809 in approximately 100 patients with hypercholesterolemia and fatty liver disease in the first half of 2016 and to complete this clinical trial in the fourth quarter of 2016 or the first quarter of 2017. 

In the U.S., the number of patients with dyslipidemia was estimated to be greater than 100 million in 2013. In the U.S., 33.5% of adults, or 71.0 million people, have high LDL-C. NASH is a growing epidemic in the U.S., and is quickly becoming a leading cause of cirrhosis and liver failure. It is estimated that NASH affects 2% to 5% of Americans, or 6.0 to 15.0 million people. As a result, we believe the global market opportunity for VK2809 in hypercholesterolemia or NASH exceeds $1.0 billion.

We are also developing VK0214 for X-ALD, a rare X-linked, inherited neurological disorder characterized by a breakdown in the protective barriers surrounding brain and nerve cells. The disease is caused by mutations in a peroxisomal transporter of very long chain fatty acids, or VLCFA, known as the adenosine triphosphate binding cassette transporter D1, or ABCD1. As a result, transporter function is impaired and patients are unable to efficiently metabolize VLCFA. The TR&#223; receptor is known to regulate expression of an alternative VLCFA transporter, known as ABCD2. Various preclinical models have demonstrated that increased expression of ABCD2 can lead to normalization of VLCFA metabolism. Preliminary in vitro data suggest that VK0214 stimulates ABCD2 expression. We are conducting studies of VK0214 in an in vivo model of disease. Pending completion of this work, we expect in 2016 to commence work directed toward filing an Investigational New Drug Application, or IND.

X-ALD is a rare, often fatal condition believed to occur with an incidence of approximately one in 17,000 births. X-ALD is caused by mutations in the gene encoding for ABCD1, which is located on the X chromosome. Men have one X chromosome, while women have two copies. Because of this, an inherited mutation in the ABCD1 gene is more likely to manifest in males relative to females. The ABCD1 protein plays a critical role in the transport of VLCFA into a cellular organelle called the peroxisome, where VLCFA metabolism and disposal occur. Without functional ABCD1, VLCFA accumulate in cells, including neural cells, where they can lead to membrane disruption and damage to the myelin sheath, a protective and insulating membrane that surrounds nerve cells in the brain. This damage can result in decreased motor coordination and function, visual and hearing disturbances, the loss of cognitive 

&#160;

function, dementia, seizures, adrenal dysfunction and other complications, including d eath. There are currently no approved therapies for X-ALD and pharmacologic interventions have demonstrated limited clinical benefit. As a result, we believe the worldwide X-ALD market exceeds $1.0 billion. 

We have a pipeline with three additional programs targeting metabolic diseases and anemia. Our most advanced pipeline program is VK0612, a first-in-class, orally available Phase 2b-ready drug candidate for type 2 diabetes. Preliminary clinical data suggest VK0612 has the potential to provide substantial glucose-lowering effects, with an attractive safety and convenience profile compared with existing type 2 diabetes therapies. Our preclinical programs are focused on identifying orally available erythropoietin receptor, or EPOR, agonists, for the potential treatment of anemia, and on the development of tissue-selective inhibitors of diacylglycerol acyltransferase-1, or DGAT-1, for the potential treatment of obesity and dyslipidemia.

VK5211: A Selective Androgen Receptor Modulator (SARM) for Hip Fracture 

Product Summary

Our lead clinical program, VK5211, is an orally available, non-steroidal SARM in development for the treatment of patients recovering from non-elective hip fracture surgery. VK5211 is designed to selectively produce the therapeutic benefits of testosterone in muscle and bone tissue with improved safety and tolerability. Tissue selectivity is critical in treating patients recovering from hip fracture. These patients experience elevated rates of metabolic breakdown of muscle tissue and loss of BMD. This results in a loss of muscle strength, an increased risk of additional fractures and increased mortality. Androgens, such as testosterone, are hormones that stimulate a variety of physiologic processes, including muscle, bone, hair and prostate growth. However, testosterone&#8217;s lack of selectivity can produce undesirable side effects such as prostate growth in men, and hair growth and masculinization in women.

VK5211 has been evaluated in three Phase 1 clinical trials. Based on these clinical and additional preclinical data, we believe VK5211 has the following important characteristics that may suggest therapeutic benefits in patients recovering from hip fracture surgery:

&#160;

&#183; 

Improvement in lean body mass: Preliminary Phase 1 data suggest VK5211 rapidly stimulates the formation of LBM, an important property for the hip fracture recovery setting, where patients can lose up to 6% of lean body mass in the two months following injury. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Improvement in bone growth and density: VK5211 has demonstrated encouraging efficacy in a standard animal model of osteoporosis, demonstrating improved bone mineral content, density and strength. This may benefit patients following hip surgery, where loss of bone mineral density can exceed 12 times the background rate for patients with osteoporosis. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Encouraging tolerability: VK5211 has been well-tolerated at and above doses that we are currently administering in our Phase 2 clinical trial. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Novel mechanism of action: Based on the anabolic characteristics imparted by selective activation of the androgen receptor, we believe VK5211 may stimulate bone and muscle growth, without demonstrating adverse bone remodeling properties that are a potential concern for osteoporosis drugs such as bisphosphonates. We expect VK5211&#8217;s novel mechanism of action to provide critical bone and muscle growth promoting advantages. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Once-daily, oral convenience: Clinical data suggest that VK5211 has the potential to provide therapeutic benefits via once-daily oral dosing. This may represent an important advantage among elderly patients, relative to injectable protein or bisphosphonate therapies. 

The initial IND filing for VK5211 was submitted in December 2008 by Ligand. The subject of the IND was an application to begin clinical investigations of the drug substance in healthy volunteers. In a Phase 1 clinical trial, VK5211 was shown to be safe and well-tolerated following daily oral administration for 21 days. In this clinical trial, statistically significant increases in lean muscle mass were observed in drug-treated subjects compared to subjects treated with placebo (p=0.047), and positive dose-dependent trends in functional exercise and strength measures were consistent with anabolic activity. Statistically significant refers to a low probability, generally regarded as less than or equal to 5%, of obtaining the observed result under a hypothesis that assumes no difference between treatment groups. No clinically significant drug-related adverse events were reported. In animal models, VK5211 has demonstrated anabolic activity in muscles, anti-resorptive and anabolic activity in bones, and robust selectivity for muscle and bone versus prostate and sebaceous glands.

In October 2015, we commenced enrollment for a Phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical trial in patients recovering from non-elective hip fracture surgery, and we expect to enroll a total of 120 patients and complete enrollment in this clinical trial in the second half of 2016. Pending positive data from this clinical trial, we plan to advance VK5211 in further clinical trials. We also plan to discuss with the FDA potential clinical development of VK5211 in other settings, such as cancer cachexia.

Androgens and Androgen Receptors

Androgens are important for the proper regulation of the reproductive system, and play critical roles in the homeostasis of the muscular, skeletal, cardiovascular, metabolic and central nervous systems. The most predominant androgen hormone is testosterone. Testosterone is predominately produced in the testes in men and in the adrenal glands and ovaries in women, albeit at lower levels than in men. Testosterone stimulates the growth of muscle and bone, also known as anabolic effects, as well as the growth of the prostate and sebaceous gland, also known as androgenic effects and, as such, testosterone is considered a non-tissue-selective androgen.

&#160;

While testosterone preparations are widely used for the treatment of male hypogonadism, the androgenic activity of testosterone limits its use in w omen and in elderly men who have a higher risk of developing benign prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH, a benign increase in prostate size, and prostate cancer. In men, the lack of selectivity of anabolic steroids may result in side effects such as acne, hair l oss and progression of BPH and/or prostate cancer. In women, exposure to exogenous testosterone can be associated with hair growth, acne and masculinization. Furthermore, testosterone must be administered by intramuscular injections, transdermal patches or gels. These routes of administration can be inconvenient or associated with potential safety issues. We believe VK5211&#8217;s selectivity, limited off-target effects and convenient route of administration may make it superior to off-label testosterone for trea ting hip fracture and other muscle wasting disorders. 

SARMs are a class of small molecules designed to elicit the benefits of androgens on tissues such as muscle and bone, without the undesirable effects on prostate and sebaceous glands, by selectively activating androgen receptors in certain tissues. We believe that, based on their robust activity on muscle and bone, SARMs can be used for the potential treatment of a number of diseases or disorders, including hip fracture, muscle wasting, osteoporosis, frailty and hormone deficiency in both men and women in cases where testosterone supplements or anabolic steroid treatments are ineffective or where the side effect profile is inappropriate.

Hip Fracture and Other Muscle Wasting Market Opportunities

We are currently conducting a Phase 2 clinical trial for acute rehabilitation following non-elective hip fracture surgery. More than 300,000 patients in the U.S. experience hip fractures each year, and approximately 50% lose the ability to live independently following the injury. The number of hip fractures is expected to grow in the U.S. as the population ages. Due to required limitations in mobility following hip fracture, patients experience muscle atrophy, or deterioration from lack of use, which impacts the time required for rehabilitation to restore physical function. We believe VK5211&#8217;s potential stimulatory effect on lean body mass could result in benefits to patients recovering from hip fracture or other conditions requiring orthopedic intervention, such as hip or knee replacement surgery. Currently, there are no approved therapies to assist in the maintenance or restoration of LBM, BMD or restoration of functional performance for these patients.

Hip fracture in the elderly is a serious and debilitating condition with a high mortality rate. One year mortality in this group is estimated to range from 20% to 30% and an estimated 50% of patients lose the ability to walk independently. As a result of the loss of mobility, and additional morbidities caused by the hip fracture, 20% of patients will require stays at long-term care facilities. Studies show that following hip fracture, patients experience a severe and rapid decline in LBM and BMD. These reported rates of decline are 12 to 75 times the rates observed in persons of similar age and demographics who have not sustained a hip fracture. Loss of LBM is believed to contribute to morbidity, disability and risk of re-fracture in hip fracture patients. Loss of BMD is associated with an increased risk of mortality and re-fracture. The following graphs illustrate the representative losses in LBM and BMD in the 60 days following hip fracture, as measured in the total hip and at the femoral neck.

&#160;

&#160;

No therapies are currently approved to treat patients experiencing loss of LBM and BMD in the acute setting following non-elective hip fracture surgery. In addition, there are no approved therapies to facilitate improved functional performance following surgery.

VK5211: A Potent, Non-Steroidal SARM

VK5211 is an orally available, non-steroidal SARM. VK5211 is a third generation SARM with greatly improved tissue-selectivity and other characteristics relative to earlier-generation SARM-targeting drug candidates. VK5211 selectively activates androgen receptors 

&#160;

in muscle and bo ne, stimulating muscle and bone growth, while avoiding undesirable side effects, such as unwanted hair growth, acne or stimulation of sebaceous glands and prostate growth. We believe VK5211 is a potential best-in-class compound due to its selectivity, pote ncy and ability to show positive effects within a short treatment duration. 

Clinical Data for VK5211

In three Phase 1 clinical trials, VK5211 was shown to be safe and well-tolerated at all doses following daily oral administration for up to 21 days. There were no reported serious adverse events determined to be related to treatment, and no clinically significant changes in liver function tests, prostate-specific antigen, hematocrit or electrocardiogram readings were observed. Moreover, subjects treated with VK5211 for 21 days experienced statistically significant increases in lean muscle mass, and positive dose-dependent trends in functional exercise and strength measures were consistent with anabolic activity.

The first Phase 1 clinical trial was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 48 healthy male volunteers conducted in 2009. In this clinical trial, six cohorts received an escalating single dose of VK5211 ranging from 0.1 mg to 22 mg. The primary objective of this clinical trial was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of escalating single doses of VK5211 in healthy male subjects. Secondary objectives of the first Phase 1 clinical trial included a determination of the pharmacokinetics, or PK, and pharmacodynamics, or PD, of single escalating doses of VK5211 in healthy male subjects. The results showed that single doses at the levels administered were well-tolerated and no serious or severe adverse events were observed among subjects receiving VK5211. The PD results showed dose-related decreases in total testosterone and sex-hormone binding protein, consistent with the mechanism of action of selective androgen receptor modulation. A dose-related decrease in fasting serum HDL was also observed. VK5211 was well-tolerated and demonstrated predictable dose-proportional increases in systemic exposure.

In a subsequent Phase 1 multiple ascending dose clinical trial, which commenced in 2010 and was completed in 2011, 76 healthy men in three cohorts were dosed daily with placebo, 0.1 mg, 0.3 mg or 1 mg of VK5211 for 21 days. The primary objective of the second Phase 1 clinical trial for VK5211 was to assess the safety and tolerability of escalating doses of VK5211 following repeated once-daily oral administration for 21 days in healthy men. Secondary objectives included a determination of the PK and PD of VK5211 following repeated once-daily oral administration for 21 days. Exploratory objectives included a determination of the effects of 21 days of treatment with VK5211 on lean body mass measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry scan, maximal voluntary strength measured by the one repetition maximum method, and stair climbing power. The average body mass index in all cohorts ranged from 24.6 kg/m 2 to 27.0 kg/m 2 . In this clinical trial, subjects receiving 1 mg doses of VK5211 demonstrated a statistically significant 1.21 kilogram average increase in lean body mass. Positive, dose-dependent trends in strength and performance measurements were also observed. There were no significant changes or trends in fat mass across cohorts. VK5211 was shown to be safe and well tolerated, with a similar frequency of adverse events between the treated and placebo groups. There were no drug-related serious adverse events. In addition, there were no significant changes in hemoglobin, prostate-specific antigen, liver function tests or QT interval at any dose. VK5211 also displayed a favorable pharmacokinetic profile, without any changes in prostate-specific antigen.

&#160;

&#160;

In September 2015, we completed a Phase 1 clinical trial of VK5211 in 24 healthy male and female subjects aged 65 and over. Subjects received once-daily oral doses of VK5211 for seven days. The results of this study showed VK5211 to be safe and well-tolerated, with predictable pharmacokinetic properties.

&#160;

Preclinical Data 

VK5211 has also demonstrated anabolic activity in muscles, anti-resorptive and anabolic activity in bone, and robust selectivity for muscle and bone versus prostate and sebaceous glands in animal models. The effects of VK5211 on bone strength, bone mineral content and BMD were evaluated in ovariectomized female rats, which are rats that have undergone surgical removal of the ovaries. The ovariectomized rat model is a standard animal model for evaluating the effect of pharmaceutical agents in osteoporosis, because removal of ovaries stimulates high bone turnover and subsequent bone loss, creating a simulated post-menopausal state that models the metabolic changes in post-menopausal osteoporosis patients. As shown below, in ovariectomized rats, at the two highest doses, VK5211 produced significant increases in femur bone mineral content and bone strength relative to ovariectomized rats treated with vehicle. In addition, VK5211 demonstrated anabolic effects in bone formation rates, bone density, bone volume and trabecular thickness.

&#160;

Effects of VK5211 on Bone in Ovariectomized Rats

&#160;

The tissue-selectivity of VK5211 was examined in a castrated rat model. The castrated rat model is a standard animal model for examining tissue selectivity for SARMs due to the rapid nature of muscle atrophy in castrated animals and the high sensitivity to muscle growth upon androgen-based treatment. Muscle mass can be restored with a potent androgen-receptor agonist, such as testosterone. Initially, rats are castrated or receive sham surgery. Sham rats are rats that receive surgical procedures that do not remove the ovaries or have other physiologic purposes. Upon recovering from the surgery, castrated and sham rats are administered either an active therapy such as VK5211 or testosterone. The effects of therapy in this model are assessed by measuring muscle and prostate tissue mass. Muscle mass in castrated animals treated with vehicle is assigned 0% relative efficacy, while muscle mass in non-castrated animals that underwent sham surgery is assigned 100% relative efficacy. For example, a castrated rat treated with a drug that demonstrates 100% relative efficacy would have equivalent tissue mass to a non-castrated rat.

In this model, VK5211 demonstrated greater than 500-fold selectivity for maintaining muscle weight at non-castrate levels relative to the effects on prostate weight. By comparison, testosterone shows similar effects on both muscle and prostate tissue. These data suggest that VK5211 is highly tissue-selective for muscle, potentially leading to an improved therapeutic profile relative to testosterone.

&#160;

Effects of VK5211 in Muscle and Prostate Tissue in Castrated Rats 

&#160;

In studies of VK5211 in non-human primates, treatment periods of 14 days and 13 weeks resulted in significant increases in body mass relative to baseline. For example, in a 13 week good laboratory practice-safety study, treated animals experienced progressive body weight gain of 20% to 47% from baseline. Most of this increase in body weight was retained after a four-week recovery period.

Development Plans

We expect to develop VK5211 for potential treatment of a wide range of diseases and disorders in both men and women. In October 2015, we commenced enrollment for a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter Phase 2 proof-of-concept trial in patients who recently underwent non-elective hip fracture surgery. We expect to enroll approximately 120 patients in this clinical trial. We will evaluate three doses of VK5211 and plan to assess changes in LBM, BMD, functional status and quality of life among treated versus untreated patients after 12 weeks of therapy. We expect enrollment in this clinical trial to be completed in the second half of 2016, and the trial to be completed in the first quarter of 2017. Pending positive data from this study, we plan to advance VK5211 in further clinical trials. We also plan to discuss with the FDA potential clinical development of VK5211 in other settings, such as cancer cachexia.

Future Opportunity in Cancer Cachexia

Cachexia is a complex disease characterized by an uncontrolled decline in muscle mass. Patients suffering from cachexia experience increased rates of metabolic breakdown of muscle tissue, resulting in a loss of muscle strength and reduced body weight. The condition is often found secondary to an underlying disease, such as cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart failure and HIV/AIDS. It is estimated that a combined total of approximately 9.0 million people suffer from cachexia in the U.S., Europe and Japan. A combination of factors tied to the underlying disease, including reduced growth factor production and overproduction of inflammatory and apoptosis, or cell-death, mediators, create an imbalance in muscle formation and degradation. The resulting dysregulation and associated weight loss leads to increased mortality rates in affected patients. Common clinical symptoms include decline in physical function and impaired immune function, which contribute to increased disability, fatigue, diminished quality of life and reduced rate of survival.

Although muscle wasting associated with cancer can be partially attributed to nutritional deficiencies, the use of appetite stimulants and nutritional interventions are generally ineffective. This is likely due to the failure of these approaches to address the underlying catabolic processes contributing to muscle wasting. Additionally, cancer patients with severe weight loss, poor performance status and metastatic disease who no longer respond to therapy may be less likely to respond to single therapies designed to increase muscle mass and improve physical function. Because muscle wasting, which often leads to refractory cachexia, has significant negative 

&#160;

impacts on patients an d their families, early intervention with therapeutic agents aimed at stimulating muscle mass is critically important. 

Approximately 2.0 million cancer patients in North America and Europe suffer from cachexia, and it is estimated that up to 20% of all cancer deaths are a direct result of cachexia. It is particularly common among patients with lung, gastric, colorectal or pancreatic cancers, with up to 80% of patients with gastric or pancreatic cancers, and approximately 50% of patients with lung or colorectal cancers, suffering from the syndrome. There are currently no approved therapies in the U.S. for cancer cachexia, and pharmacological interventions have demonstrated limited clinical benefit or expose patients to the risk of undesirable side-effects such as virilization in women and prostate growth in men. As a result, we believe the potential size of the worldwide cancer cachexia market exceeds $1.0 billion.

Pending approval of VK5211 in the acute hip fracture setting, we may seek to pursue label expansion for VK5211 in non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC, patients with cachexia. According to the American Cancer Society, an estimated 224,000 patients in the U.S. are projected to be diagnosed with lung cancer in 2014, of which approximately 85% of these cases are expected to be NSCLC. At diagnosis, approximately half of NSCLC patients present with some form of muscle wasting syndrome. Muscle wasting in this population is associated with reduced strength, increased fatigue and a decrease in overall quality of life. In addition, data indicate that lean body mass may correlate with overall survival, suggesting a potential link between improvement in lean body mass and survival. We believe VK5211 may benefit a large segment of the NSCLC patient population, due to the drug&#8217;s potential therapeutic benefits on muscle mass and associated functional gains.

In the U.S., the number of patients with dyslipidemia was estimated to be greater than 100 million in 2013. In the U.S., 33.5% of adults, or 71.0 million people, have high LDL-C. NASH is a growing epidemic in the U.S., and is quickly becoming a leading cause of cirrhosis and liver failure. It is estimated that NASH affects 2% to 5% of Americans, or 6.0 to 15.0 million people. As a result, we believe the global market opportunity for VK2809 in hypercholesterolemia or NASH exceeds $1.0 billion.

VK2809 and VK0214: Novel Selective Thyroid Hormone Receptor-&#223;, or TR&#223;, Agonists for Lipid Disorders and Adrenoleukodystrophy

Product Summary

VK2809 and VK0214 are novel, orally available, selective TR&#223; agonists in development for lipid disorders and X-ALD. Thyroid hormone receptors are found in various tissues throughout the body. TR&#223; is the major receptor isoform expressed in the liver and TR &#97; is the major isoform expressed in the heart. The unique properties of our TR&#223; agonists are designed to reduce or eliminate the deleterious effects of extra-hepatic thyroid receptor activation. In particular, high tissue and TR&#223; selectivity may lead to reduced activity at the TR &#97; receptor, which can be associated with increased respiration and cardiac tissue hypertrophy. Selective activation of the TR&#223; receptor in liver tissue is believed to favorably affect cholesterol and lipoprotein levels via multiple mechanisms, including increasing the expression of low-density lipoprotein receptors and increasing mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation. These characteristics in turn lead to reductions of LDL-C, plasma and liver triglycerides. In addition, our chemical structures are not substrates for certain transporters involved in the uptake of thyroid hormone. Various animal models have shown that our molecules, as a result of their unique profiles, may have reduced cardiovascular effects versus thyroid hormone and other thyromimetics.

As a result of these characteristics, we believe our selective TR&#223; agonists are capable of eliciting a unique lipid lowering profile without eliciting unwanted effects on the heart and thyroid hormone axis. In Phase 1 clinical trials, subjects treated with VK2809 at doses of 5 mg and above experienced significant placebo-adjusted LDL-C reductions from baseline, ranging from approximately 15-41%. In addition, placebo-adjusted triglyceride levels were reduced by more than 30% at doses of 2.5 mg and above. There were no serious adverse events observed in this trial, and no differences in heart rate, heart rhythm or blood pressure were observed between VK2809 and placebo-treated patients. In addition, VK2809 has demonstrated significant reductions in liver fat content in multiple animal models of fatty liver disease, suggesting potential efficacy in the NASH setting.

We are developing VK2809 for the potential treatment of cholesterolemia and fatty liver disease. Because prior studies have shown excellent data in both the lipid-lowering setting and in models of fatty liver disease, we plan to conduct a Phase 2 clinical trial to evaluate both potential indications. We will target patients who have elevated cholesterol, fatty liver disease, and at least three risk factors for metabolic syndrome. Metabolic syndrome is considered a major driver for the onset of NASH. The primary endpoint of this trial will assess changes in LDL-C, with exploratory endpoints evaluating changes in liver fat content, inflammatory markers, and histological changes. We expect to commence the study in the first half of 2016 and complete the study in the fourth quarter of 2016 or the first quarter of 2017. Upon conclusion, we expect to be in a position to move forward in either hypercholesterolemia or NASH.

&#160;

VK28 09 Summary 

VK2809 has been evaluated in two Phase 1 clinical trials. Based on these clinical and additional preclinical data, we believe VK2809 has the following important characteristics that may benefit patients with metabolic or lipid disorders:

&#160;

&#183; 

Broader efficacy: Preliminary Phase 1 data suggest VK2809 could reduce plasma LDL-C, triglyceride and atherogenic protein levels by greater amounts than existing oral therapies. Such broad and potent lipid lowering-activity may be particularly desirable for poorly-controlled patients with hypercholesterolemia or mixed dyslipidemia, or among patients with risk factors such as chronic kidney disease. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Encouraging safety profile: VK2809 has demonstrated encouraging safety to date in over 110 subjects. No drug related serious adverse events were observed. In addition, no cardiovascular abnormalities were reported, in-line with the expected high tissue and receptor selectivity for VK2809. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Encouraging tolerability: VK2809 has been well-tolerated at and above doses that we plan to administer in future clinical trials. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Novel mechanism of action: Based on its selective thyroid receptor targeting mechanism of action, we believe VK2809 has the potential to lower plasma and liver lipid levels in a manner complementary to existing agents such as statins. In particular, we expect the unique liver-targeting properties of VK2809 will impart a robust lipid lowering effect within hepatic tissue, with potential therapeutic applications in fatty liver diseases such as NASH. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Combinability: VK2809&#8217;s novel mechanism of action is expected to allow combinability with many existing therapies, leading to enhanced efficacy and potentially delaying transition to subsequent therapies. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Once-daily convenience: Clinical data suggest that VK2809 has the potential to lower plasma lipid levels in hypercholesterolemia patients as a once-daily oral therapy. 

Clinical Data for VK2809

VK2809 has been evaluated in two Phase 1 clinical trials. The initial Phase 1 safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic study of VK2809 was conducted in 2006. This was followed by a 14-day Phase 1b clinical trial in 56 patients with mild hypercholesterolemia, defined as baseline plasma LDL-C of at least 100 mg/dL. This study was initiated in 2007 and completed in 2008. VK2809 was shown to be safe and well-tolerated across doses ranging from 0.25 mg to 40 mg per day. There were no serious adverse events, and the frequency of adverse events in VK2809-treated subjects was similar to placebo-treated subjects. No differences in heart rate, heart rhythm or blood pressure were observed between VK2809 and placebo-treated patients. Mild increases in liver enzymes were observed at the higher doses of VK2809 along with dose-related mean shifts in thyroid hormone levels. The clinical trial results also showed dose-related reductions in fasting LDL-C and fasting triglyceride, or TG, levels at day 14. Significant placebo-adjusted LDL-C reductions from baseline were observed at doses of 5 mg and above and ranged from approximately 15%-41%, while placebo-adjusted TG levels were reduced by more than 30% at doses of 2.5 mg and above. In addition, statistically significant reductions of lipoprotein a (Lp(a)) and apolipoprotein (Apo(B)), which are believed to be positively associated with a patient&#8217;s risk of developing cardiovascular disease, were observed in certain cohorts. We believe these preliminary results compare favorably with the lipid lowering activities of existing oral agents for hyperlipidemia. A comparison of the Phase 1b efficacy results of VK2809 and data from existing hyperlipidemia agents is shown in the table below.

&#160;

Preclinical Data 

VK2809, which is our most advanced TR&#223; agonist, is a potent small molecule that is selective for the TR&#223; receptor compared with the alpha receptor. VK2809 has an equilibrium dissociation constant Ki, which refers to the concentration of drug required to occupy 50% of available TR&#223; receptors, of approximately 2 nanomoles per liter, and has approximately 16:1 selectivity for the beta receptor over the alpha receptor. VK2809 has demonstrated cholesterol-lowering activity in five animal species. In addition, VK2809 has demonstrated additive cholesterol lowering activity when combined with atorvastatin, an approved and widely prescribed medication for lowering cholesterol. Treatment of rodents with VK2809 also led to a beneficial reduction in liver fat content. For example, histologic evaluation of liver tissue, as well as quantitative data showing liver triglyceride content was reduced by more than 40% in some rodent models of hepatic steatosis, demonstrated encouraging preliminary signs of efficacy in the reduction of liver fat. We believe the reduction of liver fat content results suggest a potential benefit in diseases characterized by excessive accumulation of lipids in liver tissue, such as NASH. We believe the totality of results from our TR&#223; agonist program suggest that VK2809 possesses an attractive profile for potential future development in a variety of lipid disorders, including dyslipidemia, hypercholesterolemia and NASH.

&#160;

&#160;

VK2809 Development Plans

We are developing VK2809 for potential treatment of cholesterolemia and fatty liver disease. Because prior studies have shown excellent data in both the lipid-lowering setting and in models of fatty liver disease, we plan to conduct a Phase 2 clinical trial to evaluate both potential indications. We will target patients who have elevated cholesterol, fatty liver disease, and at least three of the five criteria developed by the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel (NCEP ATP, 2005 revision) that are used to diagnose patients with metabolic syndrome. Metabolic syndrome is considered a major driver for the onset of NASH. The primary endpoint of this trial will assess changes in LDL-C, with exploratory endpoints evaluating changes in liver fat content, inflammatory markers and histological changes. We expect to commence the clinical trial in the first half of 2016 and complete the clinical trial in the fourth quarter of 2016 or the first quarter of 2017. Upon conclusion, we expect to be in a position to move forward in either hypercholesterolemia or NASH.

Opportunity in X-ALD

We are developing VK0214 for X-ALD, a rare X-linked, inherited neurological disorder characterized by a breakdown in the protective barriers surrounding brain and nerve cells. The disease, for which there is no approved treatment, is caused by mutations in a peroxisomal transporter of very long chain fatty acids, or VLCFA, known as ABCD1. As a result, transporter function is impaired and patients are unable to efficiently metabolize VLCFA. VK0214 is a novel selective TR&#223; agonist. TR&#223; is known to regulate expression of an alternative VLCFA transporter, known as ABCD2. Various preclinical models have demonstrated that increased expression of ABCD2 can lead to normalization of VLCFA metabolism. Preliminary in vitro data suggest that VK0214 stimulates 

&#160;

ABCD2 expression. We are conducting studies of VK0214 in an in vivo model of disease. Pending completion of this work, we expect in 2016 to commence work directed toward filing an IND. 

X-ALD is a rare, often fatal condition believed to occur with an incidence of approximately one in 17,000 births. X-ALD is caused by mutations in the gene encoding for ABCD1, which is located on the X chromosome. Men have one X chromosome, while women have two copies. Because of this, an inherited mutation in the ABCD1 gene is more likely to manifest in males relative to females. The ABCD1 protein plays a critical role in the transport of VLCFA into a cellular organelle called the peroxisome, where VLCFA metabolism and disposal occur. Without functional ABCD1, VLCFA accumulate in cells, including neural cells, where they can lead to membrane disruption and damage to the myelin sheath, a protective and insulating membrane that surrounds nerve cells in the brain. This damage can result in decreased motor coordination and function, visual and hearing disturbances, the loss of cognitive function, dementia, seizures, adrenal dysfunction and other complications, including death. X-ALD is divided into various sub-segments, which are broadly characterized by the presence or absence of brain inflammation:

&#160;

&#183; 

Cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy, or CALD: The most severe form of X-ALD is CALD. CALD is characterized by a progressive inflammatory destruction of myelin, leading to severe loss of neurological function and eventual death. Approximately 35% to 40% of male X-ALD patients present with cerebral involvement at a younger age, between the ages of 5 and 12 years. However, up to 20% of male X-ALD patients develop cerebral involvement later in life, between the ages of 20 and 35 years. In male children affected by CALD, learning and behavioral problems are often the first clinical manifestations of disease. In the absence of intervention, patients affected by CALD typically experience rapid degeneration into vegetative state within 3 to 5 years, often resulting in death within 10 years of diagnosis. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Adrenomyeloneuropathy, or AMN: AMN is the more common form of X-ALD and is considered the default form of the disease in patients surviving beyond childhood. AMN is expected to affect all adult males with ABCD1 mutations, and approximately 65% of females. In males, the diagnosis is usually made between the ages of 20 and 50 and in females after the age of 65. AMN accounts for approximately half of all patients diagnosed with X-ALD. Patients with AMN generally present with slowly progressive symptoms resulting from (non-inflammatory) disruption of the axons, which are a fundamental component of the central nervous system (which allows nerve signals to be transmitted), in the spinal cord. Patients experience a variety of symptoms, including weakness in the legs, impaired vibration sense, incontinence and impotence. Severe motor disability, requiring the use of a wheelchair or cane, develops over a 3 to 15 year period. Many patients experience lower limb paralysis. While AMN is generally considered to develop more gradually relative to CALD, approximately 35% of AMN patients experience a rapid progression of myelopathy over a three to five year period. In addition, approximately 40% of AMN patients have or will develop CALD, with varying degrees of associated inflammation. 

No Treatment Options for Majority of X-ALD Manifestations

There is a clear unmet medical need for patients suffering from X-ALD. CALD has been more commonly targeted for treatment due to its devastating effects, which are often manifested at a young age. For these patients, the only currently effective treatment option is allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell, or HSC, transplant. In this procedure, the patient is treated with HSCs containing the properly functioning copy of the ABCD1 gene, contributed by a donor other than the patient. Additionally, a method of ex vivo insertion of a functional copy of the ABCD1 gene via an HIV-1 based lentiviral vector into the patient&#8217;s own HSCs to correct the aberrant expression of ABCD1 in patients with CALD is also in development. Over time with either method, as the transplanted cells grow and repopulate, a partial restoration of ABCD1 function can be achieved, leading many patients to resolution of progression in the cerebral form of the disease. While these forms of genetic correction have also shown potential clinical benefits, there is currently no approved therapy for X-ALD. In addition, recent data suggest that, even among successfully transplanted patients, AMN can develop. We believe our thyroid receptor agonists, which have the potential to normalize metabolism of VLCFAs peripherally, and potentially centrally, may positively impact all forms of X-ALD, including the currently untreatable AMN form.

VK0214 Development Plans

We also plan to complete ongoing preclinical experiments with VK0214 in cell and animal models of X-ALD. We plan to complete an in vivo study in an established model of disease and report preliminary data in 2016. Pending completion of this work, we expect in 2016 to commence work directed toward filing an IND.

Three Pipeline Programs Target Metabolic Disease with Large Unmet Medical Need

We have a pipeline with three additional programs targeting metabolic diseases and anemia. Our pipeline programs include VK0612, a first-in-class, orally available Phase 2b-ready drug candidate for type 2 diabetes. Preliminary clinical data suggest VK0612 has the potential to provide substantial glucose-lowering effects, with an attractive safety and convenience profile compared with existing type 2 diabetes therapies. Our preclinical programs are focused on identifying orally available erythropoietin receptor, or EPOR, 

&#160;

agonists, for the potential treatment of anemia, and on the development of tissue-selective inhibitors of diacylglycerol acyltransferase-1, or DGAT-1, for the potential treatment of obesity and dyslipidemia. 

Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase) Inhibitor Program

VK0612 is a first-in-class, orally available drug candidate for type 2 diabetes, one of the largest global healthcare challenges today. Preliminary clinical data suggest VK0612 has the potential to provide substantial glucose-lowering effects, with an attractive safety and convenience profile compared with existing type 2 diabetes therapies.

VK0612 is a potent, selective inhibitor of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, or FBPase, an enzyme that plays an important role in endogenous glucose production, or the synthesis of glucose by the body. We believe the inhibition of FBPase provides an attractive approach to controlling blood glucose levels in patients with diabetes. VK0612 has demonstrated potent glucose lowering effects in diabetic animal models. Clinical trials have shown that VK0612 is safe, well-tolerated and leads to significant glucose-lowering effects in patients with type 2 diabetes. Pending receipt of sufficient funding, we intend to commence additional clinical trials of VK0612 in patients with type 2 diabetes.

VK0612 has been evaluated in seven clinical trials, including one Phase 2a and six Phase 1 clinical trials. The first five Phase 1 clinical trials were conducted between 2006 and 2007. These were followed by the Phase 2a clinical trial, which was initiated in 2007 and completed in 2008, and the Phase 1b clinical trial, which was conducted in 2008. Based on these clinical and additional preclinical data, we believe VK0612 has the following important advantages over many existing type 2 diabetes therapies:

&#160;

&#183; 

Greater efficacy: Preliminary Phase 1 and 2 data suggest VK0612 could reduce plasma glycated hemoglobin A1c, or HbA1c, an important measure of long-term blood glucose levels, by 1% or more, potentially exceeding the typical anti-glycemic effects of newer drug classes. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Encouraging safety profile: VK0612 has demonstrated encouraging safety to date in over 250 subjects. No cases of hypoglycemia, or low blood glucose levels, lacticemia, or sustained lactic acid in the blood, or other drug-related safety issues were observed in these subjects. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Improved tolerability: VK0612 has been well-tolerated at and above doses that we plan to administer in our Phase 2b clinical trial, which we expect to be at or below 300 mg, with specific doses to be chosen based on the outcome of planned pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic calculations. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Novel mechanism of action: Based on its insulin-independent mechanism of action, we believe VK0612 lowers blood glucose levels independently of pancreatic function. We expect VK0612&#8217;s novel mechanism of action to provide critical durability and combinability advantages. 

&#160;

&#8211; 

Durability: Diabetes is characterized by deteriorating pancreatic beta cell function. Given VK0612&#8217;s insulin-independent mechanism of action, the drug could provide a more durable therapeutic effect than many currently available type 2 diabetes therapies.

&#160;

&#8211; 

Combinability: VK0612&#8217;s novel mechanism of action is expected to allow combinability with many existing type 2 diabetes therapies, leading to enhanced efficacy and potentially delaying transition to subsequent therapies.

&#160;

&#183; 

Weight and lipid neutral profile: Clinical and preclinical data suggest VK0612 has the potential to provide robust anti-glycemic effects while maintaining a weight and lipid neutral profile. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Once-daily convenience: Clinical data suggest that VK0612 has the potential to lower blood glucose levels in type 2 diabetes patients as a once-daily oral therapy. 

We plan to commence a Phase 2b clinical trial with VK0612 in type 2 diabetes patients at a future date. Pending clinical data from this clinical trial, we may request an end-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA or may seek to commence Phase 3 clinical trials in type 2 diabetes patients either on our own or with a third party. The purpose of an end-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA would be to review our data with the FDA, discuss appropriate potential Phase 3 clinical trial designs and obtain agreement between us and the FDA on Phase 3 efficacy and safety objectives.

EPO Receptor (EPOR) Agonist Program

We are developing small molecule agonists of the erythropoietin, or EPO, receptor, or EPOR, for the potential treatment of anemia. Anemia results from a decrease in red blood cells and is typically experienced by patients with renal complications, cancer patients and HIV/AIDS patients. These patients currently receive recombinant human EPO and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, or ESAs. Total worldwide sales of these agents exceeded $6.0 billion in 2014. However, these agents have a number of limitations, including cost of drug manufacturing, cost of treatment, a non-oral route of administration, and potential for immunogenicity, or possibility of inducing an immune response. Furthermore, ESA treatment is associated with an increased risk of adverse 

&#160;

cardiovascular complicatio ns in patients with kidney disease when used to increase hemoglobin levels above 13.0 g/dL, and may be related to an increase in mortality in cancer patients. We believe that our drug candidates have the potential to treat anemia with improved safety, tole rability and route of administration. We plan to conduct further preclinical studies and file an IND with the FDA at a future date. 

Diacylglycerol Acyltransferase-1 (DGAT-1) Inhibitor Program

We are developing small molecule inhibitors of the enzyme DGAT-1 for the potential treatment of lipid disorders such as obesity and dyslipidemia. According to the CDC, approximately 36% of the adult U.S. population is obese, with the prevalence expected to exceed 40% by 2018. The World Health Organization estimates at least 500.0 million people are currently obese worldwide. DGAT-1 is a potential therapeutic target for reduction of triglyceride levels in the circulation and fat accumulation in adipose tissues. DGAT-1 null mice exhibit both reduced post-meal plasma triglyceride levels and increased energy expenditure, but have normal levels of circulating free fatty acids. Conversely, transgenic mice that overexpress DGAT-1 in adipose tissue are predisposed to obesity when fed a high-fat diet and have elevated levels of circulating free fatty acids. We have developed a series of novel compounds with tissue- targeting properties intended to mitigate potential side effects by selectively targeting the enterocyte, or intestinal absorptive cells, in the intestine, to inhibit dietary triglyceride uptake, or the liver, to inhibit de novo triglyceride synthesis. We plan to conduct further preclinical studies and file an IND with the FDA at a future date.

Competition

The biopharmaceutical industry is characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our technology, knowledge, experience and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including commercial biopharmaceutical enterprises, academic institutions, government agencies and private and public research institutions. Any drug candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future.

Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical studies, clinical trials, regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. Our competitors may succeed in developing technologies and therapies that are more effective, better tolerated or less costly than any which we are developing, or that would render our drug candidates obsolete and noncompetitive. Even if we obtain regulatory approval of any of our drug candidates, our competitors may succeed in obtaining regulatory approvals for their products earlier than we do. We will also face competition from these third parties in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, and in acquiring and in-licensing technologies and products complementary to our programs or advantageous to our business.

The key competitive factors affecting the success of each of our drug candidates, if approved, are likely to be its efficacy, safety, tolerability, frequency and route of administration, convenience and price, the level of branded and generic competition and the availability of coverage and reimbursement from government and other third-party payors.

VK5211

In the U.S., there are currently no marketed therapies for the maintenance or improvement of LBM, BMD or physical function in patients recovering from non-elective hip fracture surgery. However, VK5211, if approved, will face competition from several experimental therapies that are in various stages of development for acute rehabilitation following hip fracture surgery, including programs in development at Novartis AG and Morphosys AG. There are also several experimental therapies that are in various stages of clinical development for conditions characterized by muscle wasting by companies including GTx, Inc., Helsinn Group and Morphosys AG. In addition, nutritional and growth hormone-based therapies are sometimes used in patients experiencing muscle wasting.

VK2809

There are many therapies currently available and numerous others being developed for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia and dyslipidemia. If approved, VK2809 will face competition from therapies that are currently available and from therapies that may become available in the future. Generic statin therapies such as atorvastatin are widely prescribed for the initial treatment of hypercholesterolemia. Cholesterol absorption inhibitors such as Merck &#38; Co., Inc.&#8217;s Zetia (ezetimibe), generic bile acid sequestrants such as coleselevam and generic fibrates such as fenofibrate are also prescribed for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. Various combinations of these therapies are often prescribed for patients suffering from dyslipidemia. In addition, recently-approved antibody 

&#160;

therapies targeting the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) gene are expected to be prescribed for patients whose LDL remains elevated despite treatment with existing cholesterol-lowering agents. Wh ile no therapies are currently approved for the treatment of NASH, we are aware of several development-stage programs targeting this disease, including obeticholic acid from Intercept Pharmaceuticals, Inc., GFT505 from Genfit SA, aramchol from Galmed Pharm aceuticals Ltd., simtuzumab from Gilead Sciences, Inc., and emricisan from Conatus Pharmaceuticals Inc. 

VK0214

In the U.S., there are currently no marketed therapies for the treatment of X-ALD. Hematopoietic stem cell therapy has been used to treat the most severe form of X-ALD, CALD. More recently, gene therapy has been shown to be effective in CALD as well. However, both treatments are invasive, requiring surgical intervention, and these do not appear to have an effect on the most pervasive form of X-ALD, AMN. High-dose biotin is under investigation for treatment of AMN. There are several experimental therapies that are in various stages of clinical development for X-ALD by companies, including MedDay Pharmaceuticals SAS and bluebird bio, Inc., which may be competitive with VK0214, if approved.

VK0612

In the U.S., VK0612, if approved, will face competition from a variety of currently marketed oral type 2 diabetes therapies, including metformin (generic), pioglitazone (generic), glimepiride (generic), sitagliptin (Merck &#38; Co., Inc.) and canagliflozin (Johnson &#38; Johnson). These therapies are well-established and are widely accepted by physicians, patients, caregivers and third-party payors as the standard of care for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Physicians, patients and third-party payors may not accept the addition of VK0612 to their current treatment regimens for a variety of potential reasons, including:

&#160;

&#183; 

if they do not wish to incur any potential additional costs related to VK0612; or 

&#160;

&#183; 

if they perceive the use of VK0612 to be of limited additional benefit to patients. 

In addition to the currently approved and marketed type 2 diabetes therapies, there are a number of experimental drugs that are in various stages of clinical development by companies such as Eli Lilly and Company, Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited and TransTech Pharma, Inc.

Preclinical Programs Focused on EPOR Agonists and DGAT-1 Inhibitors

If any of our preclinical programs are ultimately determined safe and effective and approved for marketing, they may compete for market share with established therapies from a number of competitors, including large biopharmaceutical companies. Many therapies are currently available and numerous others are being developed for the treatment of anemia and obesity. Any products that we may develop from our preclinical programs may not be able to compete effectively with existing or future therapies.

Manufacturing and Supply

We do not have any manufacturing facilities and do not intend to develop any manufacturing capabilities. We believe that we currently possess sufficient VK5211 and VK2809 drug substance to allow for completion of our planned VK5211 and VK2809 Phase 2 clinical trials. Bulk active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, and certain dosage forms are currently in storage in compliance with cGMP requirements. We believe that a majority of the existing API will be suitable for formulation into clinical trial material. We also have identified multiple contract manufacturers to provide commercial supplies of the formulated drug candidates if they are approved for marketing. We intend to secure contract manufacturers with established track records of quality product supply and significant experience with the regulatory requirements of the FDA and EMA.

We will also pay to Ligand royalties on aggregate annual worldwide net sales of Licensed Products by us, our affiliates and our sublicensees at tiered percentage rates in the following ranges based upon net sales: (a) upper single digit royalties upon sales of VK5211 or any other SARM Compound, (b) low-to-middle single digit royalties upon sales of VK2809, VK0214 or any other TR&#223; Compound, (c) upper single digit royalties upon sales of VK0612 or any other FBPase Compound, (d) middle-to-upper single digit royalties upon sales of any EPOR Compound, and (e) low-to-middle single digit royalties upon sales of any DGAT-1 Compound; in each case subject to reduction in certain circumstances.

The term of the Master License Agreement will continue unless the agreement is terminated by us or Ligand. Ligand has the right to terminate the Master License Agreement under certain circumstances, including, but not limited to: (1) in the event of our insolvency or bankruptcy; (2) if we do not pay an undisputed amount owing under the Master License Agreement when due and fail to cure such default within a specified period of time; or (3) if we default on certain of our material and substantial obligations and fail to cure the default within a specified period of time. We have the right to terminate the Master License Agreement under certain circumstances, 

&#160;

including, but not limited to: (i) if Ligand does not pay an undisputed amount owing under the Master License Agreement when due and fails to cure such default within a specified period of time, or (ii) if Ligand defaults on certain of its mater ial and substantial obligations and fails to cure the default within a specified period of time. In addition, provisions of the Master License Agreement can be terminated on a licensed program-by-program basis under certain circumstances. In the event that the Master License Agreement is terminated in its entirety or with respect to a specific licensed program for any reason: (A) all licenses granted to us under the Master License Agreement (or with respect to the specific licensed program) will terminate a nd we will, upon Ligand&#8217;s request (subject to Ligand assuming legal responsibility for any clinical trials of the Licensed Products then ongoing), assign and transfer to Ligand (or to such transferee as Ligand may direct), at no cost to Ligand, all regulat ory documentation and all regulatory approvals prepared or obtained by us or on our behalf related to the Licensed Products (or those related to the specific licensed program), or, if Ligand does not make such a request, we will wind down any ongoing clini cal trials with respect to the Licensed Products (or those related to the specific licensed program) at no cost to Ligand; (B) we will, upon Ligand&#8217;s request, sell and transfer to Ligand (or to such transferee as Ligand may direct), at a price equal to 125 % of our costs of goods, any and all chemical, biological or physical materials relating to or comprising the Licensed Products (or those related to the specific licensed program); (C) we will have, for a period of six months following termination, the rig ht to sell on the normal business terms in existence before such termination any finished commercial inventory of Licensed Products (or those related to the specific licensed program) which remains on hand, so long as we pay to Ligand the applicable royalt ies and sales milestones; (D) Ligand has the right to require us to assign to Ligand the trademarks owned by us relating to the Licensed Products (or those related to the specific licensed program); and (E) we will grant to Ligand a non-exclusive, worldwid e, royalty-bearing sublicensable license under any patent rights and know-how controlled by us to the extent necessary to make, have made, import, use, offer to sell and sell the Licensed Products (or those related to the specific licensed program) anywher e in the world at a royalty rate in the low single digits. 

Under the Master License Agreement, we have agreed to indemnify Ligand for claims relating to the performance of our obligations under the Master License Agreement, any breach of the representations and warranties made by us under the Master License Agreement, clinical trials conducted by us and the research, development and commercialization of the Licensed Products by us and our affiliates, sublicensees, distributors and agents. In addition, Ligand has agreed to indemnify us for claims relating to the performance of its obligations under the Master License Agreement, its breach of representations and warranties under the agreement and its research and development of the licensed compounds before the effective date of the Master License Agreement. Each party&#8217;s indemnification obligations will not apply to the extent the claims result from the negligence or willful misconduct of the indemnified party or any of its employees, agents, officers or directors or from the indemnified party&#8217;s breach of its representations or warranties set forth in the Master License Agreement.

Loan and Security Agreement

In connection with entering into the Master License Agreement, we entered into a Loan and Security Agreement with Ligand, dated May 21, 2014, as amended on April 8, 2015 and January 22, 2016, or the Loan and Security Agreement, pursuant to which, among other things, Ligand agreed to provide us with loans in the aggregate amount of up to $2.5 million. Pursuant to the Loan and Security Agreement, Ligand loaned us $2.5 million through December 31, 2014. From May 21, 2014 to January 21, 2016, the principal amount outstanding under the loans accrued interest at a fixed per annum rate equal to the lesser of 5.0% and the maximum interest rate permitted by law. Effective as of January 22, 2016, the principal amount outstanding under the loans accrue interest at a fixed per annum rate equal to the lesser of 2.5% and the maximum interest rate permitted by law. In the event we default under the loans, the loans will accrue interest at a fixed per annum rate equal to the lesser of 8% and the maximum interest rate permitted by law.

Each of the loans is evidenced by a Secured Convertible Promissory Note, or the Ligand Note. Pursuant to the terms of the Loan and Security Agreement and the Ligand Note, the loans will become due and payable upon the written demand of Ligand at any time after the earlier to occur of an event of default under the Loan and Security Agreement or the Note, or May 21, 2017, or the Maturity Date, unless the loans are repaid in cash or converted into equity prior to such time. Upon the consummation of our first bona fide capital financing transaction occurring after January 22, 2016, but prior to the Maturity Date, with aggregate net proceeds to us of at least $2,000,000, or the Next Financing, we will be required to repay $1,500,000 of the Ligand Note obligation to Ligand, with at least $300,000 of such payment to be paid in cash (with any greater cash amount determined by us in our sole and absolute discretion), and the balance of the $1,500,000 payment, or the Balance, to be paid in the form of such number of shares of our equity securities that are issued in the Next Financing equal to the quotient obtained by dividing the Balance by the lesser of (1) the lowest price per share paid by investors in the Next Financing, or the Financing Price, and (2) $8.00 (subject to adjustment for stock dividends, splits, combinations or similar transactions). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the number of shares that we may issue to Ligand will be reduced to the extent that the issuance of such shares would increase Ligand&#8217;s beneficial ownership of our common stock to greater than 49.9%, and any remaining amount of the Balance would have to be paid in cash. Each $1.00 of the $1,500,000 payment will reduce the amount of accrued and unpaid interest and then unpaid principal amount of the loans under the Ligand Note by $0.50.

&#160;

In addition, following the consummation of the Nex t Financing, we may repay any portion of the outstanding principal amount of the loans under the Ligand Note, plus accrued and previously unpaid interest thereon, by delivering a notice to Ligand, or the Additional Repayment Notice, specifying the amount t hat we wish to repay, or the Additional Payment Amount. Ligand will have five days to elect to receive the Additional Payment Amount in cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock. If Ligand does not make an ele ction within such five-day period, the form of the Additional Payment Amount will be at our sole election and discretion, subject to the number of shares of common stock being reduced to the extent that the issuance of shares would increase Ligand&#8217;s benefi cial ownership of our common stock to greater than 49.9%. To the extent that any portion of an Additional Payment Amount will be paid in the form of shares of our common stock, the number of shares issuable will be equal to the quotient obtained by dividin g the portion of the Additional Payment Amount that will be paid in shares by the lesser of (1) (a) if we deliver the Additional Repayment Notice within 180 days of the closing of the Next Financing, the Financing Price, or (b) if we deliver the Additional Repayment Notice 180 days or more after the closing of the Next Financing, the volume weighted average closing price of our common stock for the 30 days prior to the date we deliver the Additional Repayment Notice, and (2) $8.00 (subject to adjustment for stock dividends, splits, combinations or similar transactions). Each $1.00 of any Additional Repayment Amount will reduce the amount of accrued and unpaid interest and then unpaid principal amount under the Ligand Note by $0.50. Additionally, pursuant to the Loan and Security Agreement, Ligand has agreed that it will not, until January 23, 2017, sell or otherwise transfer or dispose of any of our securities, including shares issuable upon conversion of the Ligand Note. 

Following the Maturity Date, Ligand may demand repayment of the loans under the Ligand Note in full. If (1) the Ligand Note is not repaid in full prior to the Maturity Date and Ligand demands repayment, or (2) we wish to repay the full amount owed under the Ligand Note prior to the Maturity Date, we will be obligated to repay to Ligand an amount equal to 200% of the aggregate of the outstanding principal amount of the loans under the Ligand Note and of all accrued and unpaid interest thereon, or the Remaining Balance.

In either case, we may, at our sole election and discretion, elect to pay the Remaining Balance solely in cash. If we do not elect to repay the Remaining Balance in cash, the form of payment and mix of cash and shares of our common stock will be at Ligand&#8217;s sole election and discretion. To the extent that any portion of the Remaining Balance will be paid in the form of shares of our common stock, the number of shares issuable will be equal to the quotient obtained by dividing the portion of the Remaining Balance that will be paid in shares by the lesser of (1) the volume weighted average closing price of our common stock for the 30 days prior to the date of Ligand&#8217;s demand for repayment or the date of our prepayment of the Remaining Balance in full, and (2) $8.00 (subject to adjustment for stock dividends, splits, combinations or similar transactions).

We also granted Ligand a continuing security interest in all of our right, title and interest in and to our assets as collateral for the full, prompt, complete and final payment and performance when due of all obligations under the Loan and Security Agreement and the Ligand Note.

Under the Loan and Security Agreement and the Ligand Note, we are subject to affirmative and negative covenants. We agreed to, among other things, deliver financial statements, forecasts and budget information to Ligand. In addition, we agreed to use the proceeds from the loans solely as working capital and to fund our general business requirements in accordance with our forecast and budget. Under the Loan and Security Agreement and the Ligand Note, we may not take certain actions without Ligand&#8217;s consent, such as declare or pay dividends, incur or repay certain indebtedness or engage in certain related party transactions. Ligand has the right to transfer the Ligand Note at any time without our permission.

An event of default under the Loan and Security Agreement will be deemed to occur or exist upon the termination of the Master License Agreement; in the event we fail to make principal or interest payments under the Ligand Note when due; if we become insolvent or breach and fail to cure within a specified period of time any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in the Loan and Security Agreement, the Master License Agreement, the Option Agreement, dated September 27, 2012, by and between us and Ligand, as amended, the Voting Agreement (as defined below) or the Management Rights Letter (as defined below); or upon the occurrence of certain other events. Additionally, pursuant to the Loan and Security Agreement, Ligand has agreed that it will not, until January 23, 2017, sell or otherwise transfer or dispose of any of our securities, including shares issuable upon conversion of the Ligand Note.

Management Rights Letter

As a condition to entering into the Master License Agreement, the Loan and Security Agreement and the Ligand Note, we entered into a Management Rights Letter with Ligand, dated as of May 21, 2014, or the Management Rights Letter. Pursuant to the Management Rights Letter, we agreed to: (1) expand the size of our board of directors so as to create one new directorship on our board of directors, and (2) appoint an individual named by Ligand, or the Ligand Director, to fill the newly-created directorship. Pursuant to the terms of the Management Rights Letter, the Ligand Director is entitled to receive the same compensation, including cash payments and equity incentive grants, as is provided to our other directors; however, the Ligand Director is not entitled to receive the compensation 

&#160;

provided to ou r directors in their capacity as members of a committee of our board of directors. Furthermore, we agreed to provide Ligand with advance written notice of the date of the annual meeting of our stockholders for each year in which the Ligand Director is up f or election so as to permit Ligand to designate the Ligand Director for election at such annual meeting, and to nominate the Ligand Director to our board of directors at each such annual meeting of our stockholders. In addition, under the Management Rights Letter, we granted Ligand certain contractual management rights in the event Ligand is not represented on our board of directors, including the right to consult with us and offer advice to our management on significant business issues and the right to rec eive copies of all notices, minutes, consents and other material that we provide to our directors, subject to certain exceptions. We also agreed that, upon the consummation of the IPO, we would appoint a Chairperson of our board of directors who is &#8220;indepe ndent&#8221; under applicable SEC rules and the rules and listings standards of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC. In accordance with the terms of the Management Rights Letter, Matthew W. Foehr was appointed to our board of directors as the Ligand Director and Lawson Macartney, DVM, Ph.D. was appointed Chairperson of our board of directors. The Management Rights Letter will terminate upon the earliest to occur of: (a) the liquidation, dissolution or indefinite cessation of our business operations; (b) the execution by us of a general assignment for the benefit of creditors or the appointment of a receiver or trustee to take possession of our property and assets; (c) an acquisition of us by means of any transaction or series of related transactions (including, without li mitation, any reorganization, merger or consolidation) if our stockholders of record as constituted immediately prior to such transaction hold less than 50% of the voting power of the surviving or acquiring entity; (d) the date that Ligand and its affiliat es collectively cease to beneficially own at least 7.5% of our outstanding voting stock; or (e) May 21, 2024. 

Voting Agreement

In connection with the terms of the Management Rights Letter, we, Ligand, Brian Lian, Ph.D., and Michael Dinerman, M.D., our former Chief Operating Officer, entered into a Voting Agreement dated as of May 21, 2014, or the Voting Agreement, pursuant to which each of Ligand, Dr. Lian and Dr. Dinerman agreed to vote all of his or its shares of our voting securities so as to elect the Ligand Director as a member of our board of directors, and, if requested by Ligand, to vote in favor of any removal of the Ligand Director or selection of a new Ligand Director. The Voting Agreement will terminate under the same circumstances in which the Management Rights Letter will terminate.

Registration Rights Agreement

As a condition to the parties entering into the Master License Agreement and the Loan and Security Agreement, we entered into a Registration Rights Agreement, dated May 21, 2014, as amended on January 22, 2016, with Ligand, or the Registration Rights Agreement, pursuant to which we granted certain registration rights to Ligand with respect to (1) the securities issued by us to Ligand pursuant to the Master License Agreement and the securities issuable by us to Ligand pursuant to the Ligand Note, or, collectively, the Viking Securities, (2) the shares of our common stock issued or issuable upon conversion of the Viking Securities, if applicable, and (3) the shares of our common stock issued as a dividend or other distribution with respect to, in exchange for or in replacement of the Viking Securities, or, collectively, the Registrable Securities.

Mandatory Resale Registration Rights

Pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, we have agreed that we will file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, by no later than January 23, 2017, a Registration Statement on Form S-1 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, that covers the resale of the full amount of the Registrable Securities. We are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to have the Registration Statement declared effective by the SEC as soon as practicable after it is filed with the SEC, but in no event later than (1) in the event the SEC Staff does not review the Registration Statement, March 24, 2017 or (2) in the event the SEC Staff reviews the Registration Statement, May 23, 2017. If we do not file a Registration Statement for the resale of the Registrable Securities within the requisite time period, if such Registration Statement is not declared effective by the SEC Staff by a certain date, or if, on any day after the Registration Statement is declared effective by the SEC Staff, sales of all of the Registrable Securities required to be included in the Registration Statement cannot be made pursuant to the Registration Statement, then we will, subject to certain exceptions, be obligated to pay to Ligand an amount in cash equal to 1% of the aggregate value of the Registrable Securities, measured as of the date of their issuance, on the day of such failure or ineffectiveness of, or inability to use, the Registration Statement and on every thirtieth day thereafter (pro-rated for partial periods) until such failure or ineffectiveness of, or inability to use, the Registration Statement is cured; up to a maximum of 5% of the aggregate value of the Registrable Securities, measured as of the date of their issuance.

Pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, in the event the SEC Staff takes the position that the registration of some or all of the Registrable Securities is not eligible to be made on a delayed or continuous basis under the provisions of Rule 415 under the Securities Act, or would require Ligand to be named as an &#8220;underwriter&#8221; in the Registration Statement, we have agreed to use our commercially reasonable efforts to persuade the SEC Staff that the offering contemplated by the Registration Statement is a valid secondary offering, is not made &#8220;by or on behalf of the issuer&#8221; (as defined in Rule 415 under the Securities Act) and that Ligand is not an 

&#160;

&#8220;underwriter&#8221; for purposes of the registration. If the SEC Staff does not agree with our proposal, we will remove from the Registration Statement the portion of the Registrabl e Securities, and/or we and Ligand will agree to certain restrictions and limitations on the registration and resale of the Registrable Securities, as the SEC Staff may require to ensure the registration complies with Rule 415 under the Securities Act. In the event the SEC Staff imposes restrictions or limitations on the registration and resale of the Registrable Securities, then any amounts that we would be obligated to pay to Ligand as a result of the failure or ineffectiveness of, or inability to use, th e Registration Statement, will not accrue until a certain period of time after the date that we determine we are able to effect the registration of such Registrable Securities in accordance with SEC rules and regulations. 

Pursuant to the terms of the Registration Rights Agreement, we also agreed to use our commercially reasonable efforts to keep each Registration Statement filed pursuant to the agreement effective with respect to all Registrable Securities until the earlier of (1) the date on which all shares of Registrable Securities may immediately be sold under Rule 144, as promulgated by the SEC under the Securities Act, or Rule 144, during any 90-day period, or (2) the date on which all of the Registrable Securities covered by the Registration Statement that are held by Ligand are sold.

Additionally, we have the right during certain periods after the effective date of the Registration Statement covering the resale of the Registrable Securities, to delay the disclosure of material, non-public information if, in the good faith opinion of our board of directors, it is not in our best interests to disclose the information. In addition, we have the ability to prohibit sales under the Registration Statement during certain periods, subject to certain limitations.

Form S-3 Registration Rights

The Registration Rights Agreement also provides that after the IPO, we will use our commercially reasonable efforts to qualify for the use of Form S-3 for purposes of registering the issuance and/or resale of the Registrable Securities. Once we have qualified for the use of Form S-3, we have agreed to convert the Registration Statement on Form S-1 that is initially to be filed to register the resale of the Registrable Securities into a Registration Statement on Form S-3.

Limitation on Registration Rights

Pursuant to the terms of the Registration Rights Agreement, we have agreed that we will not, except with Ligand&#8217;s prior written consent, from and after the date of the Registration Rights Agreement and prior to the date the Registration Statement covering the resale of the full amount of the Registrable Securities is declared effective by the SEC, enter into an agreement with another holder or prospective holder of our securities which provides demand registration rights that are more favorable than the registration rights provided to Ligand under the Registration Rights Agreement.

Termination of Registration Rights

Ligand&#8217;s registration rights terminate upon the earlier of (1) the date on which all shares of Registrable Securities may immediately be sold under Rule 144 during any 90-day period, or (2) the date on which all of the Registrable Securities covered by the Registration Statement that are held by Ligand are sold.

Expenses

We will bear all registration expenses in connection with the mandatory resale registration rights granted pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, including but not limited to all registration, qualification and filing fees, except that we will not be required to pay selling expenses, fees and disbursements of counsel for the holders of our capital stock other than the fees and disbursements of one special counsel in an amount of up to $20,000.

Representative&#8217;s Warrant Registration Rights

Upon the closing of the IPO, on May 4, 2015, we issued to the representative of the underwriters in the IPO as additional compensation a warrant to purchase an aggregate of 82,500 shares of our common stock, or the Representative&#8217;s Warrant.

&#160;

Demand Registration Rights 

Pursuant to the terms of the Representative&#8217;s Warrant, we are obligated, upon the written demand of the holders of at least 51% of the shares issuable upon exercise of the Representative&#8217;s Warrant, or the Registrable Warrant Shares, to register all or a portion of the Registrable Warrant Shares, on one occasion. Upon our receipt of a written demand notice, we must file a registration statement with the SEC covering the Registrable Warrant Shares within 60 days and use our commercially reasonable efforts to have the registration statement declared effective promptly thereafter. The holder of the Representative&#8217;s Warrant may exercise this demand registration right at any time from April 28, 2016 until April 28, 2020. However, we will not be required to register any Registrable Warrant Shares that are the subject of a then-effective registration statement. Additionally, we will not be obligated to file a registration statement in connection with a demand notice if the holder of the Registrable Warrant Shares is entitled to certain piggyback registration rights.

To the extent we file a registration statement in connection with the demand registration rights granted under the Representative&#8217;s Warrant, we have agreed to keep the registration statement effective until the earlier of (1) the one year anniversary of the effective date of the registration statement or (2) the date when all Registrable Warrant Shares covered by the registration statement have been sold.

Piggyback Registration Rights

Pursuant to the terms of the Representative&#8217;s Warrant, we have also agreed to provide the holder of the Registrable Warrant Shares with certain piggyback registration rights. Until April 28, 2022, the holder of the Registrable Warrant Shares has a right to include all or any portion of the Registrable Warrant Shares in a registration statement filed by us, subject to certain exceptions. However, we will not be required to register any Registrable Warrant Shares that are the subject of a then-effective registration statement.

Expenses

We will pay all fees and expenses incurred in registering the Registrable Warrant Shares, but the holder of the Registrable Warrant Shares will pay any and all underwriting commissions and the expenses of any legal counsel selected by the holder of the Registrable Warrant Shares to represent it in connection with the sale of the Registrable Warrant Shares.

Research Services Agreement with the Academic Medical Center at the University of Amsterdam

Effective January 27, 2015, we entered into a Research Services Agreement with the Academic Medical Center at the University of Amsterdam, or the Academic Medical Center, pursuant to which the Academic Medical Center agreed to perform from time to time certain research projects for us on a series of one or more compounds. The agreement provided that, following completion of its research under the agreement, the Academic Medical Center would provide us with a report of the results of each study performed, and that we would solely own all right, title and interest in the results of the research services. The Research Services Agreement further provided that, as compensation for its services, and after our acceptance of the applicable services, we would be obligated to pay to the Academic Medical Center the amount set forth in the Statement of Work relating to the specific research project.

The Research Services Agreement also provided that it would remain in effect until the end date provided for in the last Statement of Work to be executed under the agreement. We entered into one Statement of Work under the Research Services Agreement, pursuant to which the Academic Medical Center evaluated the ability of our proprietary TR&#223; agonists, including VK2809 and VK0214, to induce ABCD2 expression in both control cell lines and in cells from X-ALD patients. This Statement of Work was completed in July 2015, at which time the Research Services Agreement terminated in accordance with its terms. 

Government Regulation

FDA Regulation and Marketing Approval

In the U.S., the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938, as amended, or FDCA, and related regulations. Drugs are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. regulatory requirements at any time during the drug development process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions and non-approval of drug candidates. These sanctions could include the imposition by the FDA or an Institutional Review Board, or IRB, of a clinical hold on clinical trials, the FDA&#8217;s refusal to approve pending applications or related supplements, withdrawal of an approval, untitled or warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, restitution, disgorgement, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. Such actions by government agencies could also require us to expend a large amount of resources to respond to the actions. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.

&#160;

The FDA and comparable regulatory agencies in state and local jurisdictions and in foreign countries impose substantial requirements upon the clinical development, manufacture and marketing of pharmaceutical products. 

These agencies and other federal, state and local entities regulate research and development activities and the testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, record-keeping, approval, post-approval monitoring, advertising, promotion, sampling and import and export of our products. Our drugs must be approved by the FDA through the new drug application, or NDA, process before they may be legally marketed in the U.S. See &#8220;The NDA Approval Process&#8221; under Part I, &#8220;Item 1. Business&#8221; of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

The process required by the FDA before drugs may be marketed in the U.S. generally involves the following:

&#160;

&#183; 

completion of non-clinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies conducted according to good laboratory practice or other applicable regulations; 

&#160;

&#183; 

submission of an IND, which allows clinical trials to begin unless the FDA objects within 30 days; 

&#160;

&#183; 

adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its intended use or uses conducted in accordance with FDA regulations, good clinical practices, or GCP, which are international ethical and scientific quality standards meant to assure that the rights, safety and well-being of trial participants are protected, and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators and monitors and to assure clinical trial data integrity; 

&#160;

&#183; 

pre-approval inspection of manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

FDA approval of an NDA, which must occur before a drug can be marketed or sold. 

IND and Clinical Trials

Prior to commencing the first clinical trial, an IND, which contains the results of preclinical studies along with other information, such as information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls and a proposed protocol, must be submitted to the FDA. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA unless the FDA within the 30-day time period raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical trial. In such a case, the IND sponsor must resolve any outstanding concerns with the FDA before the clinical trial may begin. A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial to be conducted during drug development. Further, an independent IRB for each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the investigational plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that site. Informed written consent must also be obtained from each trial subject. Regulatory authorities, including the FDA, an IRB, a data safety monitoring board or the sponsor, may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the participants are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or that the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements.

For purposes of NDA approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in sequential phases that may overlap:

&#160;

&#183; 

Phase 1 &#8211; the drug is initially given to healthy human subjects or patients in order to determine metabolism and pharmacologic actions of the drug in humans, side effects and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. During Phase 1 clinical trials, sufficient information about the investigational drug&#8217;s pharmacokinetics and pharmacologic effects may be obtained to permit the design of well-controlled and scientifically valid Phase 2 clinical trials. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Phase 2 &#8211; clinical trials are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication or in a limited number of patients in the target population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to determine the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted by the sponsor to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials. Throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we refer to our initial Phase 2 clinical trials as &#8220;Phase 2a clinical trials&#8221; and our subsequent Phase 2 clinical trials as &#8220;Phase 2b clinical trials.&#8221; 

&#160;

&#183; 

Phase 3 &#8211; when Phase 2 clinical trials demonstrate that a dosage range of the product appears effective and has an acceptable safety profile, and provide sufficient information for the design of Phase 3 clinical trials, Phase 3 clinical trials in an expanded patient population at multiple clinical sites may be undertaken. They are performed after preliminary evidence suggesting effectiveness of the drug has been obtained, and are intended to further evaluate dosage, effectiveness and safety, to establish the overall benefit-risk relationship of the investigational drug and to provide an adequate basis for product labeling and approval by the FDA. In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug in an expanded patient population at multiple clinical trial sites. 

All clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with FDA regulations, GCP requirements and their protocols in order for the data to be considered reliable for regulatory purposes.

&#160;

An investigational drug product that is a combination of two different drugs in the same dosage form must comply with an additional rule that requires that each component make a contribution to the claimed effects of the drug product. This typically requires larger studies that test the drug against each of its components. In addition, typica lly, if a drug product is intended to treat a chronic disease, as is the case with our products, safety and efficacy data must be gathered over an extended period of time, which can range from six months to three years or more. Government regulation may de lay or prevent marketing of drug candidates or new drugs for a considerable period of time and impose costly procedures upon our activities. 

Disclosure of Clinical Trial Information

Sponsors of clinical trials of FDA-regulated products, including drugs, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial, is then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to discuss the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed until the new product or new indication being studied has been approved. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs.

The NDA Approval Process

In order to obtain approval to market a drug in the U.S., a marketing application must be submitted to the FDA that provides data establishing to the FDA&#8217;s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the investigational drug for the proposed indication. Each NDA submission requires a substantial user fee payment (currently exceeding $2.3 million for fiscal year 2016) unless a waiver or exemption applies. The application includes all relevant data available from pertinent non-clinical studies, or preclinical studies and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product&#8217;s chemistry, manufacturing, controls and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of a product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators that meet GCP requirements.

During the development of a new drug, sponsors are given opportunities to meet with the FDA at certain points. These points may be prior to submission of an IND, at the end of Phase 2 clinical trials, and before an NDA is submitted. Meetings at other times may be requested. These meetings can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date, for the FDA to provide advice and for the sponsor and the FDA to reach agreement on the next phase of development. Sponsors typically use the end-of-Phase 2 clinical trials meetings to discuss their Phase 2 clinical trials results and present their plans for the pivotal Phase 3 registration trial that they believe will support approval of the new drug.

Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional preclinical safety studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for the NDA sponsor&#8217;s manufacturing the product in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drugs. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf-life.

The results of drug development, non-clinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the drug, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product. The FDA reviews all NDAs submitted to ensure that they are sufficiently complete for substantive review before it accepts them for filing. It may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to conduct an initial review to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the FDA&#8217;s threshold determination that the application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. If the NDA submission is accepted for filing, the FDA reviews the NDA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product&#8217;s identity, strength, quality and purity. The FDA has agreed to specific performance goals on the review of NDAs and seeks to review standard NDAs within 12 months from submission of the NDA. The review process may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider certain late submitted information or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission. After the FDA completes its initial review of an NDA, it will communicate to the sponsor that the drug will either be approved, or it will issue a complete response letter to communicate that the NDA will not be approved in its current form and inform the sponsor of changes that must be made or additional clinical, non-clinical or manufacturing data that must be received before the application can be approved, with no implication regarding the ultimate approvability of the application or the timing of any such approval, if ever. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA&#8217;s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such 

&#160;

resubmissions in two to six months depending on the type of information included. The FDA may refer applications for novel drug products or drug produ cts that present difficult questions of safety or effectiveness to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and, if so, under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. 

Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP regulations. If the FDA determines the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it typically will outline the deficiencies and often will request additional testing or information. This may significantly delay further review of the application. If the FDA finds that a clinical site did not conduct the clinical trial in accordance with GCP regulations, the FDA may determine the data generated by the clinical site should be excluded from the primary efficacy analyses provided in the NDA. Additionally, notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.

The FDA may require, or companies may pursue, additional clinical trials after a product is approved. These so-called Phase 4 or post-approval clinical trials may be made a condition to be satisfied for continuing drug approval. The results of Phase 4 clinical trials can confirm the effectiveness of a drug candidate and can provide important safety information. In addition, the FDA now has express statutory authority to require sponsors to conduct post-marketing trials to specifically address safety issues identified by the agency. See &#8220;Post-Marketing Requirements&#8221; under Part I, &#8220;Item 1. Business&#8221; of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

The FDA also has authority to require a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or a REMS, from manufacturers to ensure that the benefits of a drug outweigh its risks. A sponsor may also voluntarily propose a REMS as part of the NDA submission. The need for a REMS is determined as part of the review of the NDA. Based on statutory standards, elements of a REMS may include &#8220;dear doctor letters,&#8221; a medication guide, more elaborate targeted educational programs, and in some cases elements to assure safe use, or ETASU, which is the most restrictive REMS. ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring and the use of patient registries. These elements are negotiated as part of the NDA approval, and in some cases if consensus is not obtained until after the Prescription Drug User Fee Act of 1992, as amended, review cycle, the approval date may be delayed. Once adopted, REMS are subject to periodic assessment and modification.

Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement before the change can be implemented. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs.

Even if a drug candidate receives regulatory approval, the approval may be limited to specific disease states, patient populations and dosages, or might contain significant limitations on use in the form of warnings, precautions or contraindications, or in the form of onerous risk management plans, restrictions on distribution or post-marketing trial requirements. Further, even after regulatory approval is obtained, later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market. Delay in obtaining, or failure to obtain, regulatory approval for our products, or obtaining approval but for significantly limited use, would harm our business. In addition, we cannot predict what adverse governmental regulations may arise from future U.S. or foreign governmental action.

The Hatch-Waxman Amendments

Under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, as amended, commonly known as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, a portion of a product&#8217;s U.S. patent term that was lost during clinical development and regulatory review by the FDA may be restored. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments also provide a process for listing patents pertaining to approved products in the FDA&#8217;s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations (commonly known as the Orange Book) and for a competitor seeking approval of an application that references a product with listed patents to make certifications pertaining to such patents. In addition, the Hatch-Waxman Amendments provide for a statutory protection, known as non-patent exclusivity, against the FDA&#8217;s acceptance or approval of certain competitor applications.

&#160;

Patent Term Restoration 

Patent term restoration can compensate for time lost during drug development and the regulatory review process by returning up to five years of patent life for a patent that covers a new product or its use. This period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND (falling after issuance of the patent) and the submission date of an NDA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application, provided the sponsor acted with diligence. Patent term restorations, however, cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended and the extension must be applied for prior to expiration of the patent. The United States Patent and Trademark Office, or the USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration.

Orange Book Listing

In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent whose claims cover the applicant&#8217;s product. Upon approval of a drug, each of the patents listed by the NDA holder listed in the drug&#8217;s application or otherwise are then published in the FDA&#8217;s Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential generic competitors in support of approval of an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA. An ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredients in the same strengths and dosage form as the listed drug and has been shown through bioequivalence testing to be therapeutically equivalent to the listed drug. Other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing, ANDA applicants are not required to conduct, or submit results of, preclinical studies or clinical trials to prove the safety or effectiveness of their drug product. Drugs approved in this way are commonly referred to as &#8220;generic equivalents&#8221; to the listed drug, and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the original listed drug.

The ANDA applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the FDA&#8217;s Orange Book. Specifically, the applicant must certify that: (1) the required patent information has not been filed; (2) the listed patent has expired; (3) the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (4) the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the new product. The ANDA applicant may also elect to submit a Section VIII statement certifying that its proposed ANDA label does not contain (or carves out) any language regarding the patented method-of-use rather than certify to a listed method-of-use patent. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents, the ANDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired.

A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product&#8217;s listed patents, or that such patents are invalid, is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant.

An applicant submitting an NDA under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA, which permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by, or for, the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference, is required to certify to the FDA regarding any patents listed in the Orange Book for the approved product it references to the same extent that an ANDA applicant would.

Market Exclusivity

Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the U.S. to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an ANDA or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a Paragraph IV certification. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, for new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA; however, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the non-clinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.

&#160;

Post-Marketing Requirements 

Following approval of a new product, a pharmaceutical company and the approved product are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, monitoring and record-keeping activities, reporting to the applicable regulatory authorities of adverse experiences with the product, providing the regulatory authorities with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, and complying with promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, restrictions on promoting drugs for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the drug&#8217;s approved labeling (known as &#8220;off-label use&#8221;), limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and requirements for promotional activities involving the internet, including social media. Although physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such off-label uses. Modifications or enhancements to the product or its labeling or changes of the site of manufacture are often subject to the approval of the FDA and other regulators, who may or may not grant approval, or may include in a lengthy review process.

Prescription drug advertising is subject to federal, state and foreign regulations. In the U.S., the FDA regulates prescription drug promotion, including direct-to-consumer advertising. Prescription drug promotional materials must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use. Any distribution of prescription drug products and pharmaceutical samples must comply with the U.S. Prescription Drug Marketing Act of 1987, as amended, or the PDMA, a part of the FDCA.

In the U.S., once a product is approved, its manufacture is subject to comprehensive and continuing regulation by the FDA. The FDA regulations require that products be manufactured in specific, approved facilities and in accordance with cGMP. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our products in accordance with cGMP regulations. cGMP regulations require, among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP. Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. These regulations also impose certain organizational, procedural and documentation requirements with respect to manufacturing and quality assurance activities. NDA holders using contract manufacturers, laboratories or packagers are responsible for the selection and monitoring of qualified firms and, in certain circumstances, qualified suppliers to these firms. These firms and, where applicable, their suppliers are subject to inspections by the FDA at any time, and the discovery of violative conditions, including failure to conform to cGMP, could result in enforcement actions that interrupt the operation of any such product or may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved NDA, including, among other things, recall or withdrawal of the product from the market.

In addition, the manufacturer or sponsor under an approved NDA is subject to annual product and establishment fees, currently exceeding $114,450 per product and $585,200 per establishment for fiscal year 2016. These fees are typically increased annually.

The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, also known as Phase 4 testing, REMS to monitor the effects of an approved product or place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. Discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, judicial or administrative enforcement, untitled or warning letters from the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, withdrawal of approval, and civil or criminal penalties, among others. Newly-discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product&#8217;s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA&#8217;s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products in development.

Reimbursement, Anti-Kickback and False Claims Laws and Other Regulatory Matters

In the U.S., the research, manufacturing, distribution, sale and promotion of drug products and medical devices are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare &#38; Medicaid Services, or CMS, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services ( e.g. , the Office of Inspector General), the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety &#38; Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, state Attorneys General and other state and local government agencies. For example, sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs must comply with the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the federal False Claims Act of 1986, as amended, or the federal False Claims Act, the privacy regulations promulgated under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended, or HIPAA, and similar state laws. Pricing and rebate programs must comply with the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, as amended, and the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992, as amended. If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal 

&#160;

Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. The handling of any c ontrolled substances must comply with the U.S. Controlled Substances Act and Controlled Substances Import and Export Act. Products must meet applicable child-resistant packaging requirements under the U.S. Poison Prevention Packaging Act. All of these acti vities are also potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws. 

The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, or the MMA, established the Medicare Part D program to provide a voluntary prescription drug benefit to Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities which will provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Unlike Medicare Part A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for products for which we receive regulatory approval. However, any negotiated prices for our products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan will likely be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in payment that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-government payors.

The distribution of pharmaceutical products is subject to additional requirements and regulations, including extensive record-keeping, licensing, storage and security requirements intended to prevent the unauthorized sale of pharmaceutical products.

The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provides funding for the federal government to compare the effectiveness of different treatments for the same illness. A plan for the research will be developed by the Department of Health and Human Services, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the National Institutes for Health, and periodic reports on the status of the research and related expenditures will be made to Congress. Although the results of the comparative effectiveness studies are not intended to mandate coverage policies for public or private payors, it is not clear what effect, if any, the research will have on the sales of our drug candidate, if any such product or the condition that it is intended to treat is the subject of a clinical trial. It is also possible that comparative effectiveness research demonstrating benefits in a competitor&#8217;s product could adversely affect the sales of our drug candidate. If third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our products after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis.

In addition, in some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. Historically, products launched in the European Union do not follow price structures of the U.S. and generally tend to be priced significantly lower than in the U.S.

As noted above, in the U.S., we are subject to complex laws and regulations pertaining to healthcare &#8220;fraud and abuse,&#8221; including, but not limited to, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the federal False Claims Act, and other state and federal laws and regulations. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute makes it illegal for any person, including a prescription drug manufacturer, or a party acting on its behalf, to knowingly and willfully solicit, receive, offer, or pay any remuneration that is intended to induce the referral of business, including the purchase, order or prescription of a particular drug, or other good or service for which payment in whole or in part may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. Violations of this law are punishable by up to five years in prison, criminal fines, administrative civil money penalties, and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. In addition, many states have adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Some of these state prohibitions apply to the referral of patients for healthcare services reimbursed by any insurer, not just federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Due to the breadth of these federal and state anti-kickback laws, the absence of guidance in the form of regulations or court decisions, and the potential for additional legal or regulatory change in this area, it is possible that our future sales and marketing practices or our future relationships with medical professionals might be challenged under anti-kickback laws, which could harm us. Because we intend to commercialize products that could be reimbursed under a federal healthcare program and other governmental healthcare programs, we plan to develop a comprehensive compliance program that establishes internal controls to facilitate adherence to the rules and program requirements to which we will or may become subject.

&#160;

The federal False Claims Act prohibits anyone from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to federal programs (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for items or services, including dru gs, that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided as claimed, or claims for medically unnecessary items or services. Although we would not submit claims directly to payors, manufacturers can be held liable under these laws if they are deemed to &#8220;cause&#8221; the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product off-label. In addition, our future activities relating to the reporting of wholesale r or estimated retail prices for our products, the reporting of prices used to calculate Medicaid rebate information and other information affecting federal, state and third-party reimbursement for our products, and the sale and marketing of our products, are subject to scrutiny under this law. For example, pharmaceutical companies have been found liable under the federal False Claims Act in connection with their off-label promotion of drugs. Penalties for a federal False Claims Act violation include three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties of between $5,500 and $11,000 for each separate false claim, the potential for exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs and, although the federal False Claims Act is a civil statute, conduct that results in a federal False Claims Act violation may also implicate various federal criminal statutes. If the government were to allege that we were, or convict us of, violating these false claims laws, we could b e subject to a substantial fine and may suffer a decline in our stock price. In addition, private individuals have the ability to bring actions under the federal False Claims Act and certain states have enacted laws modeled after the federal False Claims A ct. 

There are also an increasing number of state laws that require manufacturers to make reports to states on pricing and marketing information. Many of these laws contain ambiguities as to what is required to comply with the laws. In addition, as discussed below, beginning in 2013, a similar federal requirement requires manufacturers to track and report to the federal government certain payments made to physicians and teaching hospitals in the previous calendar year. These laws may affect our sales, marketing and other promotional activities by imposing administrative and compliance burdens on us. In addition, given the lack of clarity with respect to these laws and their implementation, our reporting actions could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent state, and soon federal, authorities.

The failure to comply with regulatory requirements subjects companies to possible legal or regulatory action. Depending on the circumstances, failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements can result in criminal prosecution, fines or other penalties, injunctions, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of product approvals, or refusal to allow a company to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts.

Changes in regulations, statutes or the interpretation of existing regulations could impact our business in the future by requiring, for example: (1) changes to our manufacturing arrangements; (2) additions or modifications to product labeling; (3) the recall or discontinuation of our products; or (4) additional record-keeping requirements. If any such changes were to be imposed, they could adversely affect the operation of our business.

Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act

In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or the PPACA, was enacted, which includes measures that have or will significantly change the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. Among the provisions of the PPACA of greatest importance to the pharmaceutical industry are the following:

&#160;

&#183; 

The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to enter into and have in effect a national rebate agreement with the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services as a condition for states to receive federal matching funds for the manufacturer&#8217;s covered outpatient drugs furnished to Medicaid patients. Effective in 2010, the PPACA made several changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, including increasing pharmaceutical manufacturers&#8217; rebate liability by raising the minimum basic Medicaid rebate on most branded prescription drugs and biologic agents to 23.1% of the average manufacturer price, or AMP, and adding a new rebate calculation for &#8220;line extensions&#8221; ( i.e. , new formulations, such as extended release formulations) of solid oral dosage forms of branded products, as well as potentially impacting their rebate liability by modifying the statutory definition of AMP. The PPACA also expanded the universe of Medicaid utilization subject to drug rebates by requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay rebates on Medicaid managed care utilization as of 2010 and by expanding the population potentially eligible for Medicaid drug benefits, to be phased-in by 2014. The CMS have proposed to expand Medicaid rebate liability to the territories of the U.S. as well. In addition, the PPACA provides for the public availability of retail survey prices and certain weighted average AMPs under the Medicaid program. The implementation of this requirement by the CMS may also provide for the public availability of pharmacy acquisition of cost data, which could negatively impact our sales. 

&#160;

&#183; 

In order for a pharmaceutical product to receive federal reimbursement under the Medicare Part B and Medicaid programs or to be sold directly to U.S. government agencies, the manufacturer must extend discounts to entities eligible to participate in the 340B drug pricing program. The required 340B discount on a given product is calculated based on the AMP and Medicaid rebate amounts reported by the manufacturer. Effective in 2010, the PPACA expanded the types of 

&#160;

&#160;

entities eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing, although, under the current state of the law, with the exception of children&#8217;s hosp itals, these newly-eligible entities will not be eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing on orphan drugs when used for the orphan indication. In addition, as 340B drug pricing is determined based on AMP and Medicaid rebate data, the revisions to the Me dicaid rebate formula and AMP definition described above could cause the required 340B discount to increase. &#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Effective in 2011, the PPACA imposed a requirement on manufacturers of branded drugs and biologic agents to provide a 50% discount off the negotiated price of branded drugs dispensed to Medicare Part D patients in the coverage gap ( i.e. , &#8220;donut hole&#8221;). 

&#160;

&#183; 

Effective in 2011, the PPACA imposed an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs, although this fee would not apply to sales of certain products approved exclusively for orphan indications. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Effective in 2012, the PPACA required pharmaceutical manufacturers to track certain financial arrangements with physicians and teaching hospitals, including any &#8220;transfer of value&#8221; made or distributed to such entities, as well as any investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Manufacturers are required to track this information and were required to make their first reports in March 2014. The information reported is publicly available on a searchable website. 

&#160;

&#183; 

As of 2010, a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute was established pursuant to the PPACA to oversee, identify priorities in and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research. The research conducted by the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute may affect the market for certain pharmaceutical products. 

&#160;

&#183; 

The PPACA created the Independent Payment Advisory Board, which has the authority to recommend certain changes to the Medicare program to reduce expenditures by the program that could result in reduced payments for prescription drugs. Under certain circumstances, these recommendations will become law unless Congress enacts legislation that will achieve the same or greater Medicare cost savings.

The PPACA established the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation within CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending. Funding has been allocated to support the mission of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation from 2011 to 2019. 

Many of the details regarding the implementation of the PPACA are yet to be determined, and, at this time, the full effect of the PPACA on our business remains unclear.

Pediatric Exclusivity and Pediatric Use

Under the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, or the BPCA, certain drugs may obtain an additional six months of exclusivity if the sponsor submits information requested in writing by the FDA, or a Written Request, relating to the use of the active moiety of the drug in children. Conditions for exclusivity include the FDA&#8217;s determination that information relating to the use of a new drug in the pediatric population may produce health benefits in that population, the FDA making a written request for pediatric studies and the applicant agreeing to perform, and reporting on, the requested studies within the statutory timeframe. The FDA may not issue a Written Request for studies on unapproved or approved indications or where it determines that information relating to the use of a drug in a pediatric population, or part of the pediatric population, may not produce health benefits in that population. Applications under the BPCA are treated as priority applications, with all of the benefits that designation confers.

We have not received a Written Request for such pediatric studies, although we may ask the FDA to issue a Written Request for such studies in the future. To receive the six-month pediatric market exclusivity, we would need to receive a Written Request from the FDA, conduct the requested studies in accordance with a written agreement with the FDA or, if there is no written agreement, in accordance with commonly accepted scientific principles, and submit reports of the studies. A Written Request may include studies for indications that are not currently in the labeling if the FDA determines that such information will benefit the public health. The FDA will accept the reports upon its determination that the studies were conducted in accordance with, and are responsive to, the original Written Request or commonly accepted scientific principles, as appropriate, and that the reports comply with the FDA&#8217;s filing requirements.

Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, or the PREA, an NDA or supplement thereto must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to 

&#160;

support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The PREA also authorizes the FDA to require holders of approved NDAs for marketed drugs to conduct pediatric studies under certain circumstances. With the enactment of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovati on Act, or the FDASIA, in 2012, sponsors must also submit pediatric study plans prior to the assessment data. Those plans must contain an outline of the proposed pediatric study or studies the applicant plans to conduct, including study objectives and desi gn, any deferral or waiver requests, and other information required by regulation. The applicant, the FDA and the FDA&#8217;s internal review committee must then review the information submitted, consult with each other and agree upon a final plan. The FDA or th e applicant may request an amendment to the plan at any time. 

The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. Additional requirements and procedures relating to deferral requests and requests for extension of deferrals are contained in the FDASIA. Unless otherwise required by regulation, the pediatric data requirements do not apply to products with orphan designation.
