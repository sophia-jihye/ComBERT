Sales of our products internationally are subject to government regulations, including export control regulations of the U.S. Department of State and Department of Commerce. Violation of these regulations by the Company could result in monetary penalties and denial of export privileges. The Company is not aware of any violations of export control regulations or any other applicable government regulations. 

Five of the Company&#8217;s principal product families require government approval. Further, a significant portion of our business is military and is dependent on maintaining our facility certifications to MIL-PRF-38534, MIL-PRF-19500 and MIL-PRF-28750. In addition, several customers require the Company maintain ISO 9001-2002 certifications. We expect to maintain these certifications and qualifications; however, the loss of any of these certifications would have a significant negative impact on our business. 

Government regulations impose certain controls on chemicals used in electronics and semiconductor manufacturing. Micropac has obtained all the necessary environmental permits, and routinely monitors and reports the wastewater stream results to the local governing agency. Micropac is classified as a small generator of hazardous waste, and the annual cost of complying with the regulations is minimal. 

In 2015, the Company&#8217;s investment in technology through research and development, which was expensed, totaled approximately $1,707,000 ($1,856,000 in 2014). The Company&#8217;s research and development expenditures were directed primarily toward standard proprietary power management products, including industrial power controllers and DC-DC converters, fiber optic transceivers, high voltage optocouplers and continued product development and improvement associated with the Company&#8217;s space level and other high reliability products. 

In addition to the Company&#8217;s investment in research and development, various customers paid the Company approximately $650,000 in non-recurring engineering revenue with costs recorded within cost of goods sold associated with the development of custom products for specific applications. 

The Company provides a one year warranty from the date of shipment to the original purchaser. The Company is obligated under this warranty to either replace or repair defective goods or refund the purchase price paid by the buyer.

COMPETITION 

The Company competes with two or more companies with respect to each of its major products. Some of these competitors are larger and have greater capital resources than the Company. Management believes the Company&#8217;s competitive position is favorable with regard to our product reliability and integrity, past performance, customer service and responsiveness, timely delivery and pricing; however, no assurance can be given that the Company can compete successfully in the future. 

There are approximately 51 independent manufacturing companies who are certified to supply microcircuits to MIL-PRF-38534 or supply semiconductors to MIL-PRF-19500, in addition to OEM&#8217;s, who manufacture hybrid microcircuits for their internal needs. Micropac may compete with all of these for hybrid microcircuit, power management and optoelectronics business. Some of the Company&#8217;s primary competitors are MS Kennedy, Avago, Isolink, and International Rectifier. 

SUPPLY CHAIN 

The parts and raw materials for the Company&#8217;s products are generally available from more than one source. Except for certain optoelectronic products, the Company does not manufacture the basic parts or materials used in production of its products. From time to time, the Company has experienced difficulty in obtaining certain materials when needed. The Company&#8217;s inability to secure materials for any reason could have adverse effects on the Company&#8217;s ability to deliver products on a timely basis and could result in loss of customers or sales. However, the Company has not been materially affected by such shortages. The Company uses capacitors, active semiconductor devices (primarily in chip form), hermetic packages, ceramic substrates, resistor inks, conductor pastes, precious metals and other materials in its manufacturing operations. The Company&#8217;s delivery commitments to customers allow for adequate lead times for production of the products including lead time for order and receipt from the supply chain. 

Some of the Company&#8217;s primary suppliers are NTK Technologies, Electrovac, Schott Glass, Semi-Dice, Micross Components, Cobhanm Rad Solutions, and Materion Advanced Materials.
