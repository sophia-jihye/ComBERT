 Item 1. Business

Overview

Telos Corporation, together with its subsidiaries, (the "Company" or "Telos" or "We") is an information technology leader focused on designing and providing advanced technologies to deliver solutions that empower and protect the world's most demanding enterprises. We empower our customers with secure solutions that leverage mobile communication and real-time collaboration. We protect vital assets that include the critical operational and tactical systems of our customers so that they can safely conduct their global missions. Our customer base consists primarily of military, intelligence and civilian agencies of the federal government and NATO allies around the world.

We generate approximately 77.0% of our revenues by delivering these solutions at a fixed price to our customers. This focus on fixed price delivery has enabled us to significantly reduce life cycle costs for our customers. We have been able to achieve this by investing in intellectual property development so that we can use automation, when appropriate.

While we were incorporated in 1971, we liquidated and/or sold our original businesses and refocused on delivering secure solutions beginning in 1997. Our Company includes Telos Corporation, Xacta Corporation, Teloworks, Inc., and a 50% interest in Telos Identity Management Solutions, LLC ("Telos ID").

We were incorporated in Maryland, our headquarters are located at 19886 Ashburn Road, Ashburn, VA 20147, and our telephone number is (703) 724-3800. Our website is www.telos.com.

Our Mission

Our mission is to secure critical assets by protecting communications, systems, networks, and access.

We believe that our customer focus is the foundation of our success to date. We also believe that this focus is critical for the creation of long-term value.

Selected Examples of How We Accomplish Our Mission

We protect and enhance the communications of our customers through the development and delivery of our Telos Secure Information eXchange (T-6) platform for unified communication and collaboration. T-6 includes Telos Automated Message Handling System ("AMHS"), which has been adopted by the Department of Defense to carry all official message traffic and is implemented throughout all branches of the military, the intelligence community and other critical civilian agencies. AMHS is also used by U.S. Central Command to meet its critical organization and communications requirements in the CENTCOM Theater of Operations including Iraq and Afghanistan.

We protect the systems of our customers through the development and delivery of our Xacta IA Manager software ("Xacta"). Our Xacta solution is the dominant provider of continuous certification and is used throughout the Department of Defense, intelligence communities and civilian government. We have performed thousands of certifications and our product has been adopted as the risk management framework for numerous enterprises.

We deploy, protect and extend the networks of our customers around the world, as well as secure the communications on the network. We also empower our customers with advanced applications that leverage mobile devices and multi-user, multi-touch interfaces to put mission-critical information literally at users' fingertips.

Through an exclusive subcontractor relationship with Telos ID, we assess, design and deliver identity and access solutions to protect national security assets, people and facilities. Among these programs is the premier federal identity application, which has issued more than 38,000,000 smart card based secure credentials for active duty uniformed service personnel, Selected Reserve, Department of Defense ("DoD") civilian employees, and eligible contractor personnel. Additionally, we provide near real-time data collection on personnel movement and location information for operating forces, government civil servants and government contractors in specified operational theaters. This system has captured over 499,000,000 scans by more than 2,700,000 U.S. Government, U.S. Military and company contractors since its inception.

We would not be able to design, deliver, install, and support any of our solutions without our employees. They are a vital element of our success. We provide competitive pay and benefits and a work environment that promotes employee retention.

The Technology Behind Our Solutions

&#9679; Techniques: We employ development and production methodologies such as Agile and ISO 9001 to ensure predictability, repeatability, and quality. Techniques such as continuous integration are employed to accelerate the solution development and testing process while at the same time reducing cost and improving quality. We believe such techniques are critical for providing our customers with a high quality user experience. 

&#9679; Architecture: The nature of our customers' missions requires our solutions to be highly secure and scalable. Aside from architecting our solutions with these core objectives in mind, we also employ open standards and technologies that afford a high degree of flexibility and interoperability needed to support web-based and netcentric operations. 

Intellectual Property

We invest in the creation of intellectual property and employ various forms of legal intellectual property protection mechanisms including the use of copyright, trademark, patent, and trade secret laws in North America and other jurisdictions. We have intellectual property reviews as an integral part of our development process in order to identify intellectual property as early as possible in the development process so the appropriate form of protection can be obtained. We also vigorously control access to intellectual property via physical and logical protection mechanisms. All of our employees sign agreements that govern intellectual property ownership and confidentiality. We also enter into intellectual property, confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with partners and other third parties.

Patents, Trademarks, Trade Secrets and Licenses

We have made it a practice of obtaining patent and/or copyright protection on our products and processes where possible. We own a number of patents and copyrights, which we believe to be of material importance to the Company. Our patents and copyrights extend for varying periods of time based on the date of application or registration. Generally, registered copyright protection continues for a term of at least 70 years. Trademark and service mark protection for registered marks generally continues for as long as the marks are used.

Telos and Xacta are trademarks of Telos Corporation. Telos ID is a trademark of Telos ID.

Sales and Marketing

We target decision makers in government agencies and departments, and commercial businesses who have a need for secure enterprise solutions. Decisions regarding contract awards by our customers typically are based upon an assessment of the quality of our past performance, responsiveness to proposal requirements, uniqueness of the offering itself, price, and other competitive factors.

Our products and services in many instances combine a wide range of skills drawn from each of our major product and service offerings. Accordingly, we must maintain expert knowledge of federal agency policies, procedures and operations.

&#160; 

We employ marketing and business development professionals who identify, qualify, and sell opportunities for us. Virtually all of our officers and managers, including the chief executive officer, other executive officers, vice presidents, and division managers, actively engage in new business development.

We have strategic business relationships with certain companies in the information technology industry. These strategic partners have business objectives compatible with ours, and offer products and services that complement ours. We intend to continue developing such relationships wherever they support our marketing, growth and solution offering objectives.

The majority of our business is awarded through submission of formal competitive bids. Commercial bids are frequently negotiated as to terms and conditions such as schedule, specifications, delivery and payment. However, in government proposals, in most cases, the customer specifies the terms, conditions and form of the contract.

Our contracts and subcontracts are generally composed of a wide range of contract types including indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity ("IDIQ") and government-wide acquisition contracts (known as "GWACs") which are generally firm fixed-priced or time-and-materials contracts. For 2015, 2014, and 2013, the Company's revenue derived from firm fixed-price contracts was 77.0%, 74.9%, and 84.1%, respectively, cost plus contracts was 12.0%, 15.4%, and 8.0%, respectively, and time-and-material contracts was 11.0%, 9.7%, and 7.9%, respectively.

We derive substantially all of our revenues from contracts and subcontracts with the U.S. Government. Our revenues are generated from a number of contract vehicles and task orders. Over the past several years we have sought to diversify and improve our operating margins through an evolution of our business from an emphasis on product reselling to that of an advanced solutions and services provider. To that end, although we continue to offer resold products through our contract vehicles, we have focused on selling solutions and services and outsourcing product sales, as well as designing and delivering Telos manufactured technology products. In general, we believe our contract portfolio is characterized as having low to moderate financial risk due to the limited number of long-term fixed price development contracts.

Our IT solutions primarily involve the design and integration of commercial off-the-shelf IT products into integrated solutions deliverables. Such equipment is generally available from several sources, although several factors including technical specifications, proprietary or brand-specific equipment requirements, or contractual channel agreements may limit the availability of sourcing options. We utilize more than 300 vendors as direct materials suppliers, subcontractors, and service providers. The vendors utilized in any given measurement period vary based on the mix and the timing of the solutions delivered, but typically our contracts are a smaller subset that comprises the majority of the direct cost of sales on an annual basis. Therefore, while a smaller subset of suppliers, subcontractors, and service providers may be employed to deliver the majority of the revenue for a particular period, were there to be an unforeseen disruption to one of these vendors, the delay would likely be short-term in nature due to the existence of alternate sourcing options.

We derived substantially all of our revenues from contracts and subcontracts with the U.S. Government. Revenue by customer sector for the last three fiscal years is as follows:

We build market awareness of Telos and our solutions through a variety of marketing programs, including regular briefings with industry analysts, public relations activities, government relations initiatives, web seminars, trade show exhibitions, speaking engagements and web site marketing. When appropriate, we pursue joint marketing and selling efforts with our strategic partners.

Our People and Culture

As of December 31, 2015, we employed 521 people, which includes 45 from Teloworks, and 83 from Telos ID. Of our employees, 374 hold security clearances of secret or higher. 

Our people are proficient in many fields such as computer science, information security and vulnerability testing, networking technologies, physics, engineering, operations research, mathematics, economics, and business administration. We place a high value on our people. As a result, we seek to remain competitive in terms of salary structures, incentive compensation programs, fringe benefits, opportunities for growth, and individual recognition and award programs.

Our management team is committed to maintaining a corporate culture that fosters mutual respect and job satisfaction for our people, while delivering innovation and value to customers and shareholders. This commitment is reflected in our core values.

Always with integrity, at Telos we: 

Build trusted relationships,

Work hard together,

Design and deliver superior solutions, and 

Have fun doing it.

These values are woven throughout the fabric of Telos. They are reflected in our hiring practices, reinforced regularly, and reviewed during appraisals. They are written into annual and quarterly objectives for staff and managers alike, as well as department and company business goals. Employees are encouraged to challenge themselves and each other to exhibit the core values in everyday activities.

Our employees also are given avenues of communication and interaction should they observe activities that are inconsistent with the Company's core values. Encouraged first to speak openly about any issues, a hotline provides an opportunity to express concerns anonymously.

We consider the foundational value of integrity to be a non-negotiable requirement of employment, and an expectation of suppliers, partners, and our customers. We guard our reputation and will take aggressive action to protect it. An essential part of our brand promise is that we always engage employees, customers, partners, suppliers, and investors with integrity.

Competition

We operate in a highly competitive marketplace. There are other companies that provide solutions similar to ours. Although these companies provide offerings that overlap with some of our solutions, we are not aware of any single company that provides competitive solutions in all of the areas where we compete. The companies that our solution areas compete with range from integrators that provide products and services such as Booz Allen Hamilton, General Dynamics, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, SAIC and Daon, to more software-specific organizations such as Agiliance and RSA Archer.

The majority of our business is in response to competitive requests from potential and current customers. Decisions regarding contract awards by our customers typically are based upon an assessment of the quality of our past performance, responsiveness to proposal requirements, uniqueness of the offering itself, price, and other competitive factors.

Aside from other companies that compete in our space, we sometimes face indirect competition from solutions that are developed "in-house" by some of our customers.

Government Contracts and Regulation

Our business is heavily regulated. We must comply with and are affected by laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration and performance of U.S. Government and other contracts. These laws and regulations, among other things: 

&#183; impose specific and unique cost accounting practices that may differ from U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and therefore require reconciliation; 

&#183; &#160; impose acquisition regulations that define reimbursable and non-reimbursable costs; and 

&#183; restrict the use and dissemination of information classified for national security purposes and the export of certain products and technical data. 

Government contracts are subject to congressional funding. Consequently, at the outset of a program, a contract is usually partially funded, and Congress annually determines if additional funds are to be appropriated to the contract. All of our customers have the right to terminate their contract with us at their convenience or in the event that we default.

A portion of our business is classified by the U.S. Government and cannot be specifically described. The operating results of these classified programs are included in our consolidated financial statements.

Backlog

Many of our contracts with the U.S. Government are funded year to year by the procuring U.S. Government agency as determined by the fiscal requirements of the U.S. Government and the respective procuring agency. A number of contracts that we undertake extend beyond one year, and accordingly portions of contracts are carried forward from one year to the next as part of the backlog. Because many factors affect the scheduling and continuation of projects, no assurance can be given as to when revenue will be realized on projects included in our backlog.

Funded backlog as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $59.2 million and $68.3 million, respectively.

While backlog remains a measurement consideration, in recent years we, as well as other U.S. Government contractors, experienced a material change in the manner in which the U.S. Government procures equipment and services. These procurement changes include the growth in the use of General Services Administration ("GSA") schedules which authorize agencies of the U.S. Government to purchase significant amounts of equipment and services. The use of the GSA schedules results in a significantly shorter and much more flexible procurement cycle, as well as increased competition with many companies holding such schedules. Along with the GSA schedules, the U.S. Government is awarding a large number of omnibus contracts with multiple awardees. Such contracts generally require extensive marketing efforts by the multiple awardees to procure such business. The use of GSA schedules and omnibus contracts, while generally not providing immediate backlog, provide areas of growth that we continue to aggressively pursue.

Seasonality

We derive substantially all of our revenue from U.S. Government contracting, and as such we are annually subject to the seasonality of the U.S. Government purchasing. As the U.S. Government fiscal year ends on September 30, it is not uncommon for U.S. Government agencies to award extra tasks in the weeks immediately prior to the end of its fiscal year in order to avoid the loss of unexpended fiscal year funds. As a result of this cyclicality, we have historically experienced higher revenues in the third and fourth fiscal quarters, ending September 30 and December 31, respectively, with the pace of orders substantially reduced during the first and second fiscal quarters ending March 31 and June 30, respectively.
