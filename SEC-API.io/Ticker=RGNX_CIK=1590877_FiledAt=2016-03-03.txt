Overview

We are a leading biotechnology company focused on the development, commercialization and licensing of recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV) gene therapy. In AAV gene therapy, the viral genes are removed from the AAV, a small, non-pathogenic virus, creating a biological delivery vehicle called a vector. A therapeutic gene sequence is then inserted, creating a recombinant vector. Our proprietary AAV gene delivery platform (our NAV Technology Platform) consists of exclusive rights to over 100 novel AAV vectors, including AAV7, AAV8, AAV9 and AAVrh10 (NAV Vectors). Our mission is to transform the lives of patients suffering from severe diseases with significant unmet medical needs by developing and commercializing gene therapy products administered directly into the body, or in vivo, based on our NAV Technology Platform. We seek to accomplish our mission through a combination of our internal development efforts and the efforts of our third-party licensees (NAV Technology Licensees). As of December 31, 2015, our NAV Technology Platform was being applied in the development of 28 product candidates for a variety of diseases, including five internally developed product candidates and 23 partnered product candidates developed by our NAV Technology Licensees. Most of our NAV Technology Licensees have licensed specific NAV Vectors for the indications they are pursuing. We maintain rights to all unlicensed indications as well as retaining the right to our NAV Technology Platform for unlicensed vectors in disease indications for which we have granted licenses.

We are applying our NAV Technology Platform in an effort to generate a broad pipeline of best-in-class and often first-in-class AAV gene therapy treatments. Our NAV Technology Platform is covered by more than 100 licensed patents and patent applications worldwide. Our product candidates, which are designed for a variety of diseases, incorporate proprietary advances in AAV gene therapy that significantly enhance their profiles as potential therapeutics. The benefits of our NAV Technology Platform have been observed across several clinical trials and studies conducted by our development partners and third-party investigators. Approximately 70% of all AAV gene therapy clinical trials relating to new treatment Investigational New Drug applications (INDs) posted on the United States (U.S.) government clinical trials database from 2012 through 2014 used NAV Vectors.

The foundation of our NAV Technology Platform was discovered in an effort to identify next generation AAV vectors that could overcome the limitations of earlier generation AAV vectors (AAV1 through AAV6). We believe the key benefits of NAV Vectors over earlier generation AAV vectors include:

&#160;

&#183; 

higher gene expression; 

&#160;

&#183; 

longer-term gene expression; 

&#160;

&#183; 

broad and novel tissue selectivity; 

&#160;

&#183; 

lower immune response; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

improved manufacturability. 

We believe that gene therapies using our NAV Technology Platform (NAV Gene Therapy) have the potential to transform the treatment paradigm for patients with a wide range of severe diseases with significant unmet medical needs. NAV Vectors have demonstrated stable expression in animals for over eight years. Moreover, AAV8 vectors have demonstrated stable expression for over four years in a clinical trial for the treatment of hemophilia B.

In certain monogenic, recessive diseases, NAV Gene Therapy may provide clinical benefits for patients that are substantially greater than currently available therapies. In other types of diseases, such as hemophilia, NAV Gene Therapy has the potential to replace a lifetime of continuous treatment of standard protein replacement therapy and other treatment approaches with a single treatment, which could reduce health care system costs while also improving patients&#8217; quality of life. We believe that the potential efficiency and broad applicability of our NAV Technology Platform may allow us to develop NAV Gene Therapy treatments that are injected or infused into the bloodstream, spinal fluid or directly into the target tissue to treat a wide range of diseases.

&#160;

Our internal and partnered product development program pipeline is shown below. 

&#160;

We currently plan to build internal gene therapy franchises in the metabolic, neurodegenerative and retinal therapeutic areas, and develop multiple product candidates in each area. Our most advanced programs are for the treatment of two severe genetic diseases, homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) and Mucopolysaccharidosis Type I (MPS I). An IND to support a Phase 

&#160;

I/II clinical trial to evaluate the effect of RGX-501 for the treatment of HoFH is active. We expect a Phase I/II clinical trial for RGX-501 to be initiated in the first half of 2016. We expect to file an IND with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the FDA) for RGX-111, our program for MPS I, in the first half of 2016 to support a Phase I/II clinical trial, which we expect to initiate in mid-2016. We also have a preclinical program for wet age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD) for which we expect to file an IND with the FDA in the second half of 2016 and a preclinical program for Mucopolysaccharidosis Type II (MPS II) for which we expect to file an IND with the FDA in the first half of 2017. 

Our partnered development pipeline benefits from the disease-specific expertise of our NAV Technology Licensees. Our partnering strategy provides us the flexibility to sublicense development of treatments designed to address significant unmet medical needs, while remaining focused on our core programs and therapeutic areas internally, which we believe enables us to achieve maximum value. We believe that the broad applicability of our NAV Technology Platform and any clinical successes of the treatments utilizing NAV Vectors will create new internal and partnered pipeline opportunities.

As an innovator in AAV gene therapy development, our intellectual property strategy is designed to provide us with extensive protection for our product candidates and our NAV Technology Platform. We currently have exclusive rights to over 100 patents and patent applications worldwide covering our NAV Vectors, including composition of matter claims for AAV7, AAV8, AAV9 and AAVrh10, as well as methods for their manufacture and therapeutic uses. We believe this patent portfolio forms a strong foundation for our current programs and with our ongoing research and development, we expect to continue to expand this substantial patent portfolio. Our licensed patents not only seek to protect our key assets - our NAV Technology Platform and our internal product candidates - they also form the basis for licensing and partnering arrangements.

Our company was formed from a successful collaboration that began in February 2009 between FoxKiser LLP, the University of Pennsylvania (together with The Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania, Penn) and gene therapy pioneer James Wilson, M.D., Ph.D. We have built on the foundation of this collaboration to produce what we believe to be compelling NAV Gene Therapy product candidates derived from discoveries and research in Dr. Wilson&#8217;s lab. As our team has grown, we have continued to build on our scientific foundation, adding depth in gene therapy and biotechnology leadership. Our management team includes leaders who are experienced in building and operating innovative healthcare ventures and have expert knowledge in the development of AAV gene therapy. We believe the strength of our team coupled with the depth of knowledge of our scientific founder and advisors position us to succeed in developing and bringing to market, independently or with our development partners, unique, best-in-class gene therapy treatments for a range of severe diseases with significant unmet medical needs.

Our Strategy

Our mission is to transform the lives of patients suffering from severe diseases with significant unmet medical needs by developing and commercializing in vivo gene therapy products based on our NAV Technology Platform. We are seeking to develop, manufacture, commercialize and license product candidates across multiple therapeutic areas while continuing to expand our NAV Technology Platform. To achieve our mission, we are pursuing the following strategies:

&#160;

&#183; 

Apply our proprietary, next generation AAV vector technology to develop in vivo gene therapies for patients. We believe in vivo gene therapy is an ideal treatment paradigm for many diseases with sub-optimal or non-existent therapies because of its potential to correct an underlying genetic defect, rather than just treating a patient&#8217;s symptoms. We believe our NAV Technology Platform will prove to be a significant advancement over earlier AAV vectors. Based on data derived from third-party clinical studies using our NAV Vectors, we believe our NAV Technology Platform possesses unique, beneficial properties that are not seen in earlier generation AAVs. We believe that our NAV Technology Platform, which underpins our internal development programs and the programs of our NAV Technology Licensees, will enable us and our partners to develop best-in-class gene therapy candidates for a wide range of disease targets due to these unique properties. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Focus on rapidly advancing our internal lead proprietary development programs in metabolic, neurodegenerative and retinal diseases. Both HoFH and MPS I are diseases with high unmet clinical need and current treatments that are sub-optimal or non-existent. An IND to support a Phase I/II clinical trial to evaluate the effect of RGX-501 for the treatment of HoFH is active. We expect a Phase I/II clinical trial for RGX-501 to be initiated in the first half of 2016. We expect to file an IND for MPS I in the first half of 2016 and expect to initiate a Phase I/II clinical trial for MPS I in mid-2016. If we are successful in achieving proof-of-concept in the Phase I/II clinical trials for these diseases, we will pursue registration trials and commercialization of such product candidates. In addition, we plan to progress our product development programs for wet AMD and MPS II toward clinical trials and expect to file INDs for these programs in the second half of 2016 and the first half of 2017, respectively. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Establish gene therapy franchises in our current core therapeutic areas of metabolic, neurodegenerative and retinal diseases. After human proof-of-concept is achieved in a disease, we believe we will be able to apply what we have learned and use our NAV Technology Platform to more rapidly develop new product candidates for many similar diseases. Once an appropriate vector and route of administration for a particular disease type have been established, a new gene can be inserted into the appropriate vector and the established route of administration can be used for other similar diseases. We expect to use this approach to further build the foundation for our neurodegenerative disease franchise by filing an IND in the first half of 2017 for our MPS II program and moving to clinical trials thereafter if we are able to demonstrate human proof-of-concept in MPS I. We believe that this approach is also applicable to metabolic and retinal diseases, as well as many other therapeutic areas, and will allow us to efficiently generate product candidates for diseases in and beyond our current areas of therapeutic focus. &#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Further grow the pipeline of products based on our NAV Technology Platform through strategic in-licensing and sublicensing of new programs. We also plan to grow the pipeline of commercial product development programs using our NAV Technology Platform through licensing. For example, we plan to pursue in-licensing for programs we deem to be the most promising research programs using our NAV Vectors. We intend to continue to selectively sublicense our NAV Technology Platform for specific vector and indication combinations to additional NAV Technology Licensees. Strategic sublicensing allows us to maintain our internal product development focus in our core disease indications and therapeutic areas while still expanding the NAV Gene Therapy pipeline, developing a greater breadth of treatments for patients, providing additional technological and potential clinical proof-of-concept for our NAV Technology Platform, and creating potential additional revenue. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Maintain and grow our extensive intellectual property portfolio. We plan to leverage our intellectual property rights and substantial expertise in AAV gene therapy in order to develop and commercialize NAV Gene Therapy treatments. We have licensed exclusive rights to a broad portfolio of certain fundamental AAV gene therapy patents and patent applications. In securing these rights, we have focused on obtaining robust rights for those intellectual property assets we believe will be most important in providing us with a competitive advantage with respect to AAV gene therapy treatments. We plan to continue to seek to protect and enhance the proprietary technology, inventions, and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business.

The Broad Potential and Application of Gene Therapy

The concept of developing human therapies involving the delivery of external genes has existed for decades, driven by the arrival of recombinant technology and the early demonstrations by scientists of the ability to deliver and drive expression of external gene sequences in mammalian cells.

&#160;

We believe that gene therapy has the potential to become a new and important class of treatment because it may offer the following benefits: 

&#160;

&#183; 

Ability to treat a broad range of diseases. Given the availability of the sequence of the entire human genome, it could be possible to design gene therapy to express or effect expression of any human protein whose presence, absence or activity causes disease. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Ability to target mechanisms that cannot be targeted effectively by existing drug classes. Many proteins that play roles in disease cannot be targeted effectively with small molecules and therapeutic proteins. These limitations on small molecule and protein drugs may not apply to gene therapy, which we believe can be designed to target any gene in the genome. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Inherently specific, natural and therefore potent mechanism of action. Gene therapy is designed to result in proteins specifically targeting the underlying cause of a disease and that are produced naturally in humans. This mechanism has the inherent theoretical benefit of creating more potent treatments with a reduced risk of inactivation. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Simplified discovery of treatment candidates. Identification of small molecule and protein drug candidates typically requires screening of a large number of potential candidates to find prospective leads. Identification of gene therapy candidates has the potential to be simpler and take considerably less time because it can involve relatively standard processes that can be applied in a similar fashion to many successive product candidates. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Ability to create convenient treatment profiles. Because gene therapies are designed to deliver a long-term effect with a single administration, a single gene delivered via gene therapy could potentially do the same work of administering conventional drugs for many years. 

Historically, the primary challenge for gene therapy has been the delivery of genes into cells. Genes are made of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), which is a large, highly charged molecule that is difficult to transport across a cell membrane and deliver to the nucleus, where it can be transcribed and translated into protein. The genetic material needs to be delivered efficiently and to the desired target tissues and cell types, which will vary depending on the disease to be treated. Based on this need, scientists have designed and developed a variety of gene vectors in order to facilitate gene delivery in cells.

To date, the study of gene vectors as treatments in humans has involved approaches with in vivo and ex vivo techniques using a variety of different gene vectors. Each approach presents different features and benefits for the treatment of a particular disease. Ex vivo gene therapy approaches generally are employed to target correction in blood and bone marrow. These methods typically involve harvesting and isolating a patient&#8217;s own cells. Both the patient and cells undergo several preparatory steps to allow for modification of the cells by gene vectors. Ultimately, the modified cells are re-administered to the patient. In vivo gene therapy approaches involve directly administering (e.g., by infusion or injection) gene vectors into patients in order to reach desired cells in target tissues (e.g., liver, brain, eye, muscle, heart). These methods rely on a combination of the route of administration and the gene vectors themselves to facilitate the correction in the target tissues. We focus on in vivo gene therapy.

Among vectors available for in vivo gene therapy, viral vectors have been adopted with the greatest frequency because they have demonstrated the greatest efficiency in gene delivery to date. This efficiency exists because viral vectors are derived from naturally occurring viruses whose normal life-cycle relies on gene delivery of their own genomes. In other words, they are naturally optimized to deliver genes to cells. Many viral vectors have presented sub-optimal safety profiles for in vivo treatment in humans because the viruses from which they are derived are pathogenic (causing disease), immunogenic (causing immune response) or create genomic toxicity (delivering a gene to a place where it interrupts normal function). Vectors derived from adenovirus, herpes virus and retroviruses have been tested as in vivo viral vectors.

Vectors derived from AAV have among the best safety profiles for gene therapy given that AAVs are not known to be associated with disease in humans. The earlier generation AAV vectors were designed by scientists in the mid-1980s and the first clinical trials using AAV began in the mid-1990s. There were only a handful of AAV vectors available to scientists at the time of the first clinical trials because AAV vectors were designed based on the capsid (the protein shell of a virus that encloses the genetic material of the virus) of AAV viruses known to be in existence and only six distinct serotypes (groups within a single species of microorganisms, such as bacteria or viruses, which share distinctive surface structures) had been discovered at that time. These earlier generation AAV vectors were shown to be limited in their application due to a variety of limitations and challenges, including:

&#160;

&#183; 

low or unmeasurable gene expression, meaning the delivered gene was enabling production of low or unmeasurable amounts of the therapeutic protein; 

&#160;

&#183; 

short-term gene expression, meaning if gene expression was measurable, it was transient; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

limited tissue selectivity, meaning concentrated gene expression was not observed in the target organ; and &#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

high levels of immune response, meaning the body may neutralize the gene delivery vector with pre-existing antibodies or generate T-cells that inhibit the therapeutic effect. 

Discovery of Next Generation AAV

In recognition of the limitations and challenges of earlier generation AAV vectors, an effort was undertaken in the early 2000s at Penn to discover other naturally occurring AAV sequences. The identification of such sequences was based on the observation that wild-type AAV (in contrast to recombinant AAV) can undergo a latent cycle in which the AAV genome stays within the cell, meaning the virus, including its capsid gene sequence, remains intact within the cell but does not reproduce. This allowed for identification of new sequences not by purifying viruses from tissues, but by searching for capsid gene sequences in a variety of tissues isolated from non-human primates and from humans, based on regions of the AAV capsid gene that did not vary between the known AAV vectors. By searching for capsid gene sequences in this manner, many more capsid protein sequences were discovered than would have been found by purifying viruses from tissues.

More than 100 new capsid sequences were identified by the process. The first few were initially designated AAV7, AAV8 and AAV9, after which, other sequences were identified by species from which it was isolated (e.g., &#8220;rh&#8221; indicating rhesus macaque) followed by a number (e.g., 10, for rh10). Early characterization of the initial discoveries of AAV7, AAV8, AAV9 and AAVrh10 suggested that these vectors may be significantly more efficient in various applications important for clinical translation than other previously known AAVs.

After patenting the next generation AAV vectors, Penn initiated a distribution program through a material-transfer process that enabled researchers to access the next generation AAV vectors for research use only, under specific restrictions. Thousands of custom reagents were sent to independent researchers, who began to characterize and validate the beneficial features of AAV vectors in animal models of disease. In 2010, the first clinical trials were conducted using the next generation AAV vectors and initial proof-of-concept and safety in humans was established from these trials. These clinical trials also produced longer-term efficacy results which reinforced our belief that these next generation vectors have beneficial properties not seen in the earlier generation AAV vectors.

We believe the next generation AAV vectors, which form the basis of our NAV Technology Platform, have many improved properties relative to earlier generation AAV vectors for development and commercialization of AAV treatments, including:

&#160;

&#183; 

higher gene expression; 

&#160;

&#183; 

longer-term gene expression; 

&#160;

&#183; 

broad and novel tissue selectivity; 

&#160;

&#183; 

lower immune response; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

improved manufacturability. 

Our Proprietary NAV Technology Platform for Gene Delivery

Our NAV Technology Platform has been used in several clinical trials conducted by our partners and third-party investigators. In 2009, we licensed rights to the next generation AAV vectors discovered at Penn. Our NAV Vectors form the foundation of our NAV Technology Platform.

We are developing therapeutics using NAV Vectors that contain genes which are synthesized to code for the expression of therapeutic proteins in target cells to correct the underlying causes of the diseases we seek to treat. Each product candidate is designed with a NAV Vector for a specific cell target and to express a specific protein. We incorporate proprietary modifications to both the AAV and the gene which enhance properties such as potency, stability and tissue distribution. Our proprietary modifications, including the use of vectors derived from novel sequences of AAV such as AAV7, AAV8, AAV9 and AAVrh10, are protected by over 100 licensed patents and patent applications. The rights to our NAV Technology Platform provide our product candidates with what we believe to be a competitive advantage over product candidates developed with earlier generation AAV vectors due to the novel and beneficial properties of our NAV Vectors.

&#160;

Clinical Validation of Our NAV Technology Platform 

History of the Development of AAV8 in the Treatment of Hemophilia B

Hemophilia is a genetic bleeding disorder that prevents the blood from clotting normally. The main symptom is uncontrolled, often spontaneous bleeding. Internal bleeding into the joints can result in pain, swelling and, if left untreated, can cause permanent damage. Hemophilia B is caused by mutations in the gene encoding the clotting factor, Factor IX (FIX).

A collaboration among scientists and clinicians at St. Jude Children&#8217;s Research Hospital and University College London established the first human proof-of-concept using AAV8 to deliver and express a gene in the liver. The results of these translational studies and clinical trial present an informative translational road map.

&#160;

&#183; 

Mice studies demonstrate correction of bleeding episodes. In 2006, preclinical studies were reported involving a single intravenous administration of an AAV8 vector encoding the human Factor IX (hFIX) gene that resulted in greater than normal levels of hFIX and correction of the bleeding diathesis in FIX knock-out mice. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Non-human primate studies demonstrate long-term hFIX expression. In 2011, preclinical studies were reported involving a single intravenous administration of an AAV8 vector encoding the hFIX gene that resulted in peak levels of hFIX of approximately 420% of normal. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Human clinical trial demonstrates reduction in disease severity. In 2011, the New England Journal of Medicine published results from a clinical trial involving a single, intravenous administration of an AAV8 vector encoding the hFIX gene to six subjects with severe hemophilia B. This trial resulted in increased levels of hFIX sufficient to improve severe hemophilia B to a mild or moderate disease state. 

Researchers at St. Jude Children&#8217;s Research Hospital, studying hemophilia B patients, used AAV8 encoding the FIX protein delivered intravenously to target the liver, and used the liver as a depot for producing and secreting the needed FIX. In the study, six patients with FIX levels of less than one percent of normal were treated in an ascending dose study and then the highest dose was extended to another four patients. Reports indicate that the treatment was well-tolerated and demonstrated therapeutic, sustained levels of FIX expression in all patients. All patients were expressing levels of FIX post-treatment at levels at or above two percent of normal, converting them to patients with moderate disease. Several high dose patients have sustained levels at eight percent of normal, placing them in the mild disease group. Most patients have been able to stop prophylactic FIX infusions. The main vector-related adverse event was an elevated serum alanine aminotransferase level, which we believe may be attenuated by a short, tapering course of steroid.

The clinical trial described above was the strongest example of efficacy evidence in any AAV vector clinical trial. Expression has been stable, with the earliest dosed patient showing expression and long-lasting amelioration of bleeding episodes for over four years. A previous clinical trial in hemophilia B using AAV2 did not have observed evidence of efficacy, so the St. Jude clinical trial was notable for reporting evidence of preliminary efficacy in this disease and in suggesting the importance of NAV Vectors.

Subsequently, two additional groups have reported human proof-of-concept using AAV8-mediated gene therapy to deliver and express a gene in the liver for the treatment of hemophilia B. NAV Vectors have been further validated in a more recent clinical trial by Baxalta US Inc. (formerly Baxter Healthcare) (Baxalta) in hemophilia B. Baxalta employs an AAV8 vector which differs by encoding a gene for a naturally occurring mutant of FIX which has higher activity. Baxalta has recently reported that two patients in the mid-dose cohort have experienced no bleeds without regular infusions of FIX and one of these patients has had sustained FIX expression levels of 20% to 25% of normal FIX levels for 12 months. In the highest dose cohort, FIX expression levels have peaked above 50%, though the two patients in this cohort experienced an immune response which has led to decreased FIX expression, with one patient resuming regular FIX infusions. Baxalta has exclusive rights to use AAV8 for the treatment of hemophilia B from a license executed directly with GSK which predates our licensing of the NAV Technology Platform . 

Development of AAV9 in the Treatment of SMA Type I

SMA Type 1 is a lethal genetic disorder caused by a defect in the survival of motor neuron 1, telomeric (SMN1) gene that codes the survival motor neuron (SMN) protein, which is necessary for survival of motor neurons. Motor neurons are a critical component of the pathway that carries signals from the brain to muscle cells and SMA Type I is characterized by motor neuron loss and associated muscle deterioration. SMA Type I is the leading genetic cause of infant mortality and results in mortality or the need for permanent ventilation support before the age of two for greater than 90% of patients. There is currently no FDA-approved treatment for SMA Type 1.

Our NAV Technology Licensee, AveXis, Inc. (AveXis), is developing AAV9 encoding the SMN protein administered intravenously to target the lower motor neurons for the treatment of SMA Type I. AveXis has fully enrolled a Phase I clinical trial 

&#160;

with 15 patients, three in the low-dose cohort who completed dosing in September 2014 and 12 in the high-dose cohort who completed dosing in January 2016. Patients must have been no older than nine months of age (for the first nine patients) and six months of age (for the last six patients) when dosed. Recently, AveXis reported preliminary results in the study, which we believe has the potential to demonstrate strong efficacy evidence and proof-of-concept for treatment of a severe genetic CNS disease using AAV9. 

Clinical Use of NAV Technology

Our NAV Technology has been used by our NAV Technology Licensees in clinical trials. In 2010, major milestones were achieved with the initiation of two investigator-sponsored studies using NAV Vectors. As noted above, clinical trials for hemophilia B using AAV8 have met safety and efficacy endpoints. Additionally, we believe preliminary clinical trial results for SMA Type I using AAV9 may demonstrate efficacy evidence and proof-of-concept. The hemophilia B study has generated evidence of durable gene expression in patients for over four years. Since the initial investigator-sponsored trials began in 2010, we believe 13 additional clinical trials have been initiated using NAV Vectors by our NAV Technology Licensees or other third parties. In addition, an IND for RGX-501 is active. All diseases targeted in 16 clinical trials using NAV Vectors of which we are aware as of December 31, 2015 are set forth in the graphic below. 

&#160;

&#160;

Key Potential Benefits of NAV Technology

The properties that make NAV Vectors unique from and potentially an improvement to earlier generation AAV vectors, as well as provide support that they are potentially best-in-class for development and commercialization of AAV treatments, are set forth in the pages that follow.

&#160;

Higher Gene Expression 

NAV Vectors have been shown to generate higher levels of gene expression in animals than earlier generation AAV vectors such as AAV2. In mice livers, one of our NAV Vectors, AAV8, produced levels of gene expression that were 10- to 100-fold higher than was achieved with AAV2. The figure below shows the contrast in the amount of gene expressed using the two vectors.

AAV Transduction in Mouse Liver

&#160;

&#160;

In this experiment, the reporter gene LacZ, a gene which encodes a protein that turns a clear substrate blue in a specific medium, was included in the transgene sequence delivered by the vector so that cells expressing the transgene are stained blue, visually denoting expression level. It was possible to transduce the entire mouse liver and achieve long-term expression with AAV8. Higher gene expression creates the possibility of achieving therapeutic benefit in more diseases than was possible using earlier AAV vectors, as more therapeutic protein is generated with vectors that enable higher expression.

Longer-Term Gene Expression

We believe the longer-term gene expression seen using NAV Vectors is due to more stable genomic persistence and reduced cellular immunity, which are a function of novel capsid structure and lower dosing required using NAV Vectors due to the greater gene expression discussed earlier. NAV Vectors have demonstrated stable expression in animals for over eight years. Moreover, AAV8 vectors have demonstrated stable expression for over four years in clinical trials for hemophilia B patients.

Broad and Novel Tissue Selectivity

NAV Vectors also display high levels of tissue specificity. This property is important because it allows for development of therapeutics to target cells that earlier generation AAV vectors do not target or do not target well. In the CNS, AAV9 has emerged as a vector that enables efficient gene delivery when directly injected into the brain. This was aided by the ability of AAV9 to be transported throughout the brain, enabling broader delivery with a single injection.

NAV Gene Therapy has demonstrated novel tissue selectivity for the CNS when delivered intravenously. Intravenous delivery of AAV9 resulted in efficient gene expression in the brain and spinal cord, and this route of administration produced results in both small and large animals, including non-human primates. This was the first time a gene therapy vector was demonstrated to cross the blood-brain barrier. This route of administration has recently been used clinically by one of our NAV Technology Licensees to treat SMA Type I.

&#160;

NAV Vectors have also shown novel properties in the eye when investigated for the treatment of acquired disease and inherited retinal degenerations. AAV8 expressing a fluorescent protein was administered by subretinal injection in the non-human primate eye in order to show gene expression in the retina itself, which contains the cell types to be treated. As is depicted in the graphic below, a cross-section of the non-human primate retina below showed more efficient gene delivery (as demonstrated by the much greater amount of the fluorescent protein expressed) with AAV8 as compared to AAV2 in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and to the photoreceptor (PR) layer. The majority of genes associated with retinal degeneration are located in the RPE and PR layer. These genes influence the cell&#8217;s development or function and are therefore critical to most inherited retinal degenerations.

Lower Immune Response

Lower immune response to the gene therapy vector used to deliver the transgene is important for longer-term gene expression, higher expression and higher potency. Data indicate that more than 50% of certain human populations have a high level of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) for the earlier generation vector AAV2. This represents a major obstacle to the effective use of these earlier generation AAV vectors due to the inhibition of gene delivery via particle neutralization in circulation, meaning pre-existing antibodies neutralize the vector with the transgene before it can reach the target cells. By contrast, frequency of neutralizing antibodies for AAV8 is consistently lower than for AAV2. In a French study, for example, AAV2 NAbs occurred at a frequency of 59% compared to 19% for AAV8. Thus, AAV8 is a candidate for liver-directed gene delivery in a higher proportion of the population than AAV2.

Additionally, reduced effect from the generation and reactivity of T-cells to NAV Vectors has been demonstrated, relative to earlier generation AAV vectors. Activation of T-cells to the capsid of AAV2 vectors has been implicated in liver toxicity in a clinical trial for the treatment of hemophilia B. A patient in this clinical trial developed an elevation of liver enzymes and subsequently lost expression. This led to a hypothesis that capsid protein antigens and memory T-cell activation may lead to clearance of AAV-transduced cells. To further investigate this kind of toxicity, scientists reported a study that evaluated T-cell responses to AAV vectors after administration to mice and nonhuman primates. In this study, high levels of T-cells specific to capsids of AAV2 were detected. AAV8, however, did not lead to activation of capsid-specific T-cells. In a more recent clinical trial for the treatment of hemophilia B, using AAV8, there was less of an effect from T-cells generated and reactive with AAV8. We believe this is likely a function of the lower doses that can be used as well as the structure of the vector itself.

Improved Manufacturability

The manufacturing process for NAV Vectors can be designed to reduce the number of difficult processing steps required for the earlier AAV vectors, improving overall yield at larger scale. NAV Vectors are derived from naturally &#8220;fit&#8221; viruses, which are stable structures that efficiently assemble, in contrast to the earlier generation AAV vectors. During production, NAV Vectors are secreted by AAV producer cells, eliminating the need for lysing (breaking down of the membrane of a cell, often by viral, enzymic or osmotic mechanisms that compromise the cells integrity) of cells, which can complicate purification and impact yield. This is a novel aspect of NAV Vectors that increases yield and efficiency in production.

Our NAV Gene Therapy Product Candidates 

We have developed an internal pipeline of product candidates across the therapeutic areas of metabolic, neurodegenerative and retinal diseases. Below is a table summarizing our current internal development programs.

&#160;

Metabolic Diseases

Our product development pipeline includes treatment candidates for liver-targeted expression of genes. The selected candidates for our programs seek to leverage lessons learned from previous reports of preclinical and human proof-of-concept studies conducted by third-party investigators and our partners using our NAV Technology Platform. Based on these studies and our own research, we believe our NAV Technology Platform demonstrates promising properties for applications that involve gene delivery to liver cells that may result in long-term, high-level expression of protein.

Historically, a clinical trial for the treatment of hemophilia B using AAV2 vectors that were administered to achieve expression of genes in the liver did not produce evidence of efficacy. Reported data from this study generally did not show any measureable levels of expression sufficient to correct disease symptoms. In subjects where measureable expression levels were reported, gene expression faded over a short period of time. We believe selecting different AAV vectors will increase the levels and duration of expression.

The first clinical milestone of AAV-mediated liver gene therapy occurred in 2011 in the trial described previously for the treatment of hemophilia B using AAV8 in which some patients were able to discontinue prophylactic FIX injections. In 2014, the same group reported in a study update that the treatment was shown to be durable for over four years and that long-lasting efficacy results were reported in the patients treated. Subsequently, two additional groups have reported human proof-of-concept using AAV8-mediated gene therapy to deliver and express a gene in the liver for the treatment of hemophilia B.

Recently, our academic collaborators demonstrated in a MPS I feline model that liver directed &#945;-l-iduronidase (IDUA) gene delivery using AAV8 resulted in persistent, normal levels of IDUA in the blood. In most cases, the treatment also resulted in cross-correction (cells that are transduced with vector can release enzyme, which is taken up by non-transduced cells) in most tissues including complete resolution of disease pathology in some tissues normally not responsive to enzyme replacement therapy (ERT).

We intend to advance a pipeline of programs in certain metabolic diseases that will be enhanced by the benefits of NAV-mediated liver gene therapy. Our initial focus will be on a severe lipid disorder, HoFH.

&#160;

RGX-501 for the Treatment of HoFH Caused by LDLR Mutations 

Overview of HoFH

HoFH is a monogenic disorder caused by abnormalities in the function or expression of the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) gene. LDLR plays an important role in the regulation of cholesterol by facilitating uptake and degradation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) in the liver. LDL is the primary carrier of cholesterol in the blood and has been implicated in the development of plaque buildup in the arteries. HoFH patients have very low levels or are completely deficient of LDLR, resulting in very high total blood cholesterol levels which are typically greater than 500 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dl). This leads to premature and aggressive plaque buildup, life threatening coronary artery disease (CAD) and aortic valve disease. Over time, patients with HoFH develop atherosclerosis, or narrowing and blockage of the arteries, which leads to a high incidence of heart attacks in children and teenagers, among other severe symptoms. If untreated, HoFH patients usually die of causes related to CAD or aortic valve disease before the age of 30.

Recently published medical literature suggests that the worldwide prevalence of HoFH is estimated to be as high as 1 in 200,000. Based on disease severity and molecular characteristics, we estimate there are approximately 11,000 individuals globally who are primary candidates for gene therapy treatment of HoFH. Multiple studies have compared HoFH patients based on LDLR activity and have shown small differences in residual activity can lead to significant reductions in cholesterol levels and better long-term outcomes.

Current Therapies for HoFH

The current standard of care in HoFH focuses on early initiation of aggressive treatment because of the severe clinical effects of elevated LDL-C. Unfortunately, available treatment options are limited. Lipoprotein apheresis, a physical method of purging the plasma of LDL-C, requires weekly or biweekly treatment in order to maintain effect. The procedure is laborious, requiring frequent intravenous access that can be challenging, expensive and not readily available. Other available treatments include statins, a class of pharmaceuticals commonly used to lower cholesterol levels, cholesterol absorption inhibitors and other cholesterol lowering medications. Recently, two new drugs have been approved by the FDA as add-on therapy specifically for HoFH: lomitapide and mipomersen. Both result in a reduction of LDL-C, but their use is associated with an array of adverse events that may affect tolerance and long-term adherence. These therapies do not provide a cure for the disease and their use is limited due to tolerability and drug availability. Despite the implementation of an aggressive multi-drug therapy approach, the LDL-C levels of HoFH patients remain elevated and mean life expectancy remains at approximately 32 years. With all current therapies, even in combination, providing sub-optimal treatment for patients, a better solution is needed. We believe HoFH is a promising target for gene therapy.

In July and August 2015, respectively, the European Commission and the FDA approved Repatha (Amgen) for the treatment of high cholesterol and HoFH, among other indications. In July 2015, the FDA also approved Praluent (Sanofi-Aventis) for the treatment of high cholesterol. In September 2015, the European Commission approved Praluent for adults with primary hypercholesterolemia (heterozygous familial and non-familial) or mixed dyslipidaemia. Repatha and Praluent represent the first drug approvals in a new class of drug called PCSK9 inhibitors. PCSK9 inhibitors are designed to bind to a protein called PCSK9 and inhibit PCSK9 from binding to LDLR on the liver surface. In the absence of PCSK9, there is more LDLR on the surface of the liver to remove LDL-C from the blood. We believe that the emergence of PCSK9 inhibitors as therapy will increase the opportunity and awareness for the profile of RGX-501 by helping to identify more patients who may benefit from its product profile. A clinical trial evaluating a PCSK9 inhibitor demonstrated that its effectiveness relies on patients having functional LDLR. We believe that a substantial unmet medical need remains for the population of HoFH patients who are LDLR negative or severely deficient in LDLR function. We believe that RGX-501, by restoring or increasing LDLR function, may enhance the impact of PCSK9 inhibitors in the treatment of many patients with high cholesterol and as prescribers explore combination therapies.

RGX-501

RGX-501 is our product candidate for the treatment of HoFH, which uses the AAV8 vector to deliver the human LDLR gene to liver cells. We believe that the liver is the preferred target organ for gene therapy of HoFH since LDLRs produced in the liver contribute to greater than 90% of the capture and breakdown of LDL, making the liver by far the most important LDLR producing organ. Additionally, the liver is also the only organ capable of excreting cholesterol from the body, a function that is critical to the maintenance of cholesterol balance. Finally, studies have shown that liver transplantation in HoFH patients corrects the disease, providing strong support that correction of hepatic LDL receptor activity by gene therapy is sufficient for metabolic correction of the disease.

&#160;

Preclinical Proof of Concept for RGX-501 

In order to evaluate the potential for RGX-501 for the treatment of HoFH, mouse LDLR liver-directed gene therapy with AAV8 was evaluated in mouse models of HoFH by our scientific collaborators at Penn. Mice were injected intravenously with the vector and followed for metabolic correction and reversal of pre-existing atherosclerotic lesions. Animals were also evaluated for gross clinical toxicity and abnormalities in serum transaminases, an indicator of liver damage. Animals in the Penn study receiving the vector showed a near complete normalization of hypercholesterolemia that remained stable for almost a year, as well as a substantial regression of atherosclerosis over two months as assessed by two independent methods of quantification at two different sites within the aorta. There was no vector induced toxicity of the liver based on histopathology and clinical chemistry.

Planned Clinical Development of RGX-501

An IND to support the initiation of a dose-escalation Phase I/II clinical trial of intravenously administered RGX-501 in the U.S. in patients with HoFH became active in November 2015 (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02651675). We expect a Phase I/II clinical trial for RGX-501 to be initiated in the first half of 2016. The trial is a single ascending dose design with a formal safety assessment of the lower dose group prior to dose escalation. The trial design calls for enrollment of up to 12 subjects and is intended to be a single center study. The primary endpoint will be a safety assessment. The secondary endpoints will be reduction in LDL-C and other outcome measures. Based on previous clinical trials and recent approvals in HoFH, we believe reduction in LDL-C is an endpoint that is an acceptable measure on which regulatory approval could be based.

The U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) Office of Biotechnology Activities&#8217; Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee (the RAC) reviewed the draft protocol for our HoFH Phase I/II clinical trial which we submitted in January 2012. In March 2012, we presented the protocol to the RAC and received subsequent communication from the RAC in March 2012 endorsing the protocol with comments. We have incorporated the RAC&#8217;s recommendations into the final protocol. Results from this Phase I/II clinical trial will guide us in finalizing the design of a pivotal Phase III clinical trial. If successful, we believe the results of this Phase III clinical trial could support submission of a Biologics License Application (BLA) to the FDA in the U.S. and a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in the European Union for RGX-501.

We have received orphan drug product designation from the FDA for RGX-501.

Neurodegenerative Diseases

We are focused on developing NAV Gene Therapy for treatments for diseases with significant unmet medical need that involve neurodegeneration in the brain and spinal cord&#8212;which together comprise the CNS. We believe our NAV Technology Platform has optimal features for gene delivery to the CNS. In addition, our programs involve novel strategies for improved delivery of NAV Gene Therapy treatments to the CNS that enhance our candidate profiles.

For neurodegenerative disease, AAV2 vectors were historically applied via focal delivery in the brain by adopting existing direct injection techniques. In certain cases, investigators have attempted to use direct injection of vector into multiple sites of the 

&#160;

brain to address neurodegenerative disorders that require gene delivery to larger areas. Although there are some examples in animal models in which focal delivery can be therapeutic, these techniques have not produced efficacy in humans. 

For most neurodegenerative diseases, we believe that global delivery to the CNS will achieve optimal therapeutic efficacy. Widespread transduction of the CNS in animal models has been achieved by administration of NAV Vectors into the ventricles, cisterna magna, as well as lumbar puncture, which allows the vector to circulate through the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). We are progressing similar delivery approaches through the CSF in humans to achieve global delivery to the CNS.

Additionally, as described above, one of our NAV Vectors, AAV9, has produced early evidence of potentially unique and beneficial properties for gene delivery in the CNS by having the ability to cross the blood-brain barrier. As a result, treatments may be delivered via intravenous injection to target the CNS. One of our NAV Technology Licensees is currently using this approach in a clinical trial for the treatment of SMA Type I, which has shown preliminary evidence of lower motor neuron transduction.

Based on these studies and our own research, we believe our NAV Technology Platform demonstrates promising properties for applications that involve gene delivery to the CNS that we believe will result in long-term, high-level expression of protein. We intend to advance a pipeline of programs in neurodegenerative diseases that will be enhanced by the benefits of using our NAV Technology Platform.

RGX-111 for the Treatment of MPS I Caused by Autosomal Recessive IDUA Mutations

Overview of MPS I

MPS I is a rare autosomal recessive, or non-sex-linked, genetic disease caused by deficiency of IDUA, an enzyme required for the breakdown of polysaccharides heparan sulfate and dermatan sulfate in lysosomes, which are intracellular structures that dispose of waste products inside cells. These polysaccharides, called glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), accumulate in tissues of MPS I patients, resulting in characteristic storage lesions and diverse clinical signs and symptoms. MPS I patients may exhibit short stature, bone and joint deformities, coarsened facial features, enlargement of both the liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly), cardiac valve disease, obstructive sleep apnea, recurrent upper respiratory infections, hearing impairment, carpal tunnel syndrome and vision impairment due to corneal clouding. In addition, many patients develop symptoms related to GAG storage in the CNS, which can include excessive accumulation of fluid in the brain, spinal cord compression and cognitive impairment. MPS I patients span a broad spectrum of disease severity and extent of CNS involvement. We believe this variability in severity correlates with residual IDUA expression. The severe form of MPS I is also referred to as Hurler syndrome. Hurler patients have two mutations of the IDUA gene, resulting in no active enzyme expression. These patients typically present with symptoms before two years of age and universally exhibit severe cognitive decline after an initial period of normal development. Patients with at least one mutation of the IDUA gene who are able to produce a small amount of active IDUA exhibit an attenuated, or less severe, phenotype. These phenotypes are referred to as Hurler-Scheie or Scheie syndrome. Hurler-Scheie represents an intermediate phenotype, with patients exhibiting some or all of the physical features of Hurler syndrome. Some Hurler-Scheie patients also experience neurological complications and cognitive decline.

MPS I is estimated to occur in 1 in 100,000 births. Based on global population, this equates to over 1,000 MPS I patients born each year worldwide. Studies suggest that severe forms of MPS I represent between one-half and two-thirds of all MPS I patients. 

Current Therapies for MPS I

The current standard of care for patients with an attenuated form of MPS I is a recombinant form of human IDUA (Aldurazyme). Given as a weekly intravenous infusion, this ERT has demonstrated improvement in hepatosplenomegaly, growth, mobility and respiratory function. However, as the enzyme cannot cross the blood-brain barrier, ERT does not treat the CNS manifestations of MPS I.

The first disease modifying therapy developed for severe MPS I was bone marrow transplant (BMT). Though BMT has demonstrated improvements in survival, growth, cardiac and respiratory function, mobility and intellect, it is also associated with substantial morbidity and an estimated 15% to 25% mortality. Accordingly, the procedure is reserved for patients with severe disease before two years of age because the risk-benefit ratio is thought to be more favorable in younger patients who have not yet experienced advanced cognitive decline. Another critical limitation of BMT is that cognitive decline continues for up to a year after transplant before stabilizing, leaving permanent cognitive deficits. In an effort to find approaches that treat the CNS manifestations of neurodegenerative diseases, clinical trials to evaluate direct administration of ERT into the spinal fluid (intrathecal administration) for the treatment of MPS I and direct administration of ERT into the brain (intracerebroventricular administration) for Batten&#8217;s Disease (a neurodegenerative disease) have been initiated. These approaches, however, do not address the underlying cause of these neurodegenerative diseases. Furthermore, we believe the need for frequent (bi-weekly or monthly) intrathecal or intracerebroventricular administration is likely to lead to patient compliance issues, further reducing the treatment potential of this method of ERT.

&#160;

Overall, the limitations of BMT and ERT leave a significant unmet need for a method to safely achieve long-term IDUA reconstitution in the CNS for MPS I patients experiencing neurological complications. 

RGX-111

RGX-111 is our product candidate for the treatment of MPS I which uses the AAV9 vector to deliver the human IDUA gene to the CNS. Delivery of the enzyme that is deficient within cells in the CNS could provide a permanent source of secreted IDUA beyond the blood-brain barrier, allowing for long-term cross-correction of cells throughout the CNS. This strategy could also provide rapid IDUA delivery to the brain, potentially preventing the progression of cognitive deficits that otherwise occurs in MPS I patients.

Preclinical Proof of Concept of RGX-111

To assess the feasibility of achieving widespread IDUA expression and correction of storage pathology throughout the brain of MPS I patients, we carried out proof-of-concept studies of intrathecal AAV9 delivery of IDUA using large animal models of MPS I. These studies demonstrated that AAV9 delivery can safely restore IDUA expression to levels equivalent to or greater than non-affected animals. As can be seen in the diagram below, animals treated with an intracisternal injection of an AAV9 vector expressing feline IDUA from a CB promoter (gray symbols) or CMV promoter (black symbols) showed IDUA expression levels above those of untreated animals and in some cases above those of wild-type animals (the dotted line represents mean CSF IDUA expression for two wild-type animals). Storage correction was observed throughout the CNS. Some animals had IDUA activity at lower levels than wild-type animals post-treatment but also achieved significant correction relative to diseased animals. The extent of CNS correction in our studies was substantially greater than that observed in a previous study of MPS I cats treated with BMT at similar ages, thus demonstrating that gene delivery can achieve rapid onset and high levels of IDUA delivery. These findings provide proof of concept of AAV9 delivery of IDUA for treating the CNS pathology associated with MPS I.

Planned Clinical Development of RGX-111

We intend to file an IND in the first half of 2016 to support the initiation of an early phase dose-escalation clinical trial of RGX-111 based gene delivery via CNS administration in mid-2016 in subjects with MPS I. The Phase I/II clinical trial currently being considered is expected to be a single ascending dose design with a formal safety assessment of the lower dose group prior to dose escalation. The trial design is expected to call for enrollment of approximately 10 adult subjects. The primary endpoint will be a safety assessment. The secondary and exploratory endpoints will be evaluation of biomarkers and clinical outcomes.

In September 2015, we received endorsement from the RAC for our RGX-111 protocol. We have received orphan drug product designation and rare pediatric disease designation from the FDA for RGX-111.

&#160;

RGX-121 for the Treatment of MPS II Caused by X-Linked Recessive IDS Mutations 

Overview of MPS II

MPS II, also known as Hunter syndrome, is a rare, X-linked recessive, or sex-linked, disease caused by a deficiency in the lysosomal enzyme iduronate-2-sulfatase (IDS). IDS is another enzyme responsible for the breakdown of polysaccharides heparan sulfate and dermatan sulfate in the lysosomes of cells resulting in a progressive, multisystem disorder with a similar phenotype to MPS I. In severe forms of the disease, early developmental milestones may be met, but developmental delay is readily apparent by 18 to 24 months. Developmental progression begins to plateau between three and five years of age, with regression reported to begin around six and a half years. By the time of death, most patients with CNS involvement are severely mentally handicapped and require constant care.

MPS II is estimated to occur in approximately 1 in 200,000 births. Based on global population, this equates to approximately 500 to 1,000 MPS II patients born each year worldwide.

Current Therapies for MPS II

In 2006, recombinant IDS (Elaprase), an ERT, was approved by the FDA for the treatment of Hunter syndrome and has subsequently been approved for use internationally. ERT in MPS II patients is not expected to result in improvement of CNS dysfunction since IDS is not expected to cross the blood-brain barrier. Specific treatment to address the neurological manifestations of MPS II and prevent or stabilize cognitive decline remains a significant unmet medical need. Overall, the limitations of ERT leave a significant unmet need for a method to safely achieve long-term IDS reconstitution in the CNS.

RGX-121

RGX-121 is our product candidate for the treatment of MPS II, which uses the AAV9 vector to deliver the human IDS gene to the CNS. Delivery of the gene encoding the enzyme that is deficient within cells in the CNS could provide a permanent source of secreted IDS beyond the blood-brain barrier, allowing for long-term cross-correction of cells throughout the CNS. We believe this strategy could also provide rapid IDS delivery to the brain, potentially preventing the progression of cognitive deficits that otherwise occur in Hunter syndrome patients.

As noted above, this approach has been successfully used in the treatment of animal models of monogenic CNS diseases. Previously conducted studies of AAV9 directed gene therapy in the CNS with MPS I animal models have shown that AAV9 can successfully be used to achieve wide biodistribution within the CNS, robust expression of transgene product that benefits from cross-correction and overall acceptable safety profile. We believe these studies have validated the use of AAV9 in the development of CNS directed gene therapy products and that by using AAV9 for the development of both RGX-111 and RGX-121, we will be able build upon the learnings and experience generated in our RGX-111 program to rapidly and efficiently focus our development efforts for RGX-121.

&#160;

Preclinical Development of RGX-121 

To assess the feasibility of achieving widespread IDS expression and correction of storage pathology throughout the brain of MPS II patients, we carried out proof-of-concept studies of CNS AAV9 delivery using a mouse model of MPS II. There are no known large animal models of MPS II. MPS II mice were administered with AAV9 vector encoding a gene for IDS in the CNS, which resulted in higher levels of IDS enzyme activity in the brain. As shown in the diagram below, these higher levels of IDS enzyme activity resulted in a statistically significant reduction of neuronal storage lesions in the brains of treated mice as measured by cells positive for GM3, a ganglioside which accumulates in cells as a result of IDS deficiency. These results show the potential therapeutic benefit of AAV9-mediated IDS gene delivery to the CNS through the CSF to address neurological manifestations of MPS II.

Planned Development of RGX-121 

We intend to file an IND in the first half of 2017 to support the initiation of an early phase dose-escalation clinical trial of RGX-121 based gene delivery via CNS administration in subjects with MPS II. The Phase I/II clinical trial currently being considered is expected to be a single ascending dose design with a formal safety assessment of the lower dose group prior to dose escalation. The trial design is expected to include approximately 10 subjects. The primary endpoint will be a safety assessment. The secondary and exploratory endpoints will be evaluation of biomarkers and clinical outcomes.

We have received orphan drug product designation from the FDA for RGX-121.

Retinal Diseases

We are developing applications of our NAV Technology Platform to treat inherited and acquired forms of retinal disease that can result in visual loss or complete blindness. The retina is the light-sensitive layer of cells that lines the inside of the eye and sends visual messages to the brain. The effects of retinal diseases are isolated to the eye, which is an ideal target for gene therapy due to its immunoprivileged state, small size and relative physical isolation from the rest of the body. The molecular basis of many retinal diseases is becoming well-understood and many retinal diseases are monogenic diseases whose complementary DNA has already been successfully cloned. Also, diagnosis with many forms of inherited blindness is becoming quicker and simpler, due to improved research and application of technology to characterize the variable, unique patterns of different retinal diseases. We believe our NAV Gene Therapy will have improved profiles for achieving therapeutic efficacy where highly efficient gene delivery to the retina is required.

Third party studies reported early evidence of the safety and efficacy of subretinal injection of AAV2 in clinical trials for a retinal disease called Leber congenital amaurosis type 2 (LCA2). Other programs are studying the safety and efficacy profile of AAV2 to treat neovascularization in wet AMD. For LCA2, retinal function was restored by reconstituting gene function in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). However, for most retinal degeneration disorders, photoreceptor cells are the primary cell type involved and have 

&#160;

historically been a more difficult cellular target in the retina for AAV gene therapy. We believe our NAV Technology Platform will be more efficient at gene delivery into many retinal cell types, particularly photoreceptor cells, than earlier generation AAV vectors such as AAV2. Data from mice, dogs and non-human primates suggests that, compared to other AAVs, NAV Vectors can safely and more effectively target a diverse set of retinal cells, including RPE cells and photoreceptors, when compared to other AAVs. For instance, in most retinal cells, NAV-mediated gene delivery reaches maximal levels of expression much sooner than AAV2-mediated delivery. Furthermore, in the same set of retinal cells, NAV Vectors achieve equivalent expression to AAV2 at a dose that is ten times less. Our NAV Technology Platform has been used successfully in a gene therapy approach in animal models of achromatopsia, LCA2, autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa, retinoschisis and wet AMD. 

We believe that retinal diseases are an ideal target for NAV Gene Therapy due to early evidence indicating efficiency at achieving gene delivery in a wide-array of cell types in the retina. We believe the first use of our NAV Technology Platform in a clinical trial for retinal diseases could result in robust safety and efficacy data but could also serve as a stepping stone for using NAV Gene Therapy in other human retinal diseases.

RGX-314 for the Treatment of Wet AMD

Overview of Wet AMD

Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a disease that results in diminution and eventual loss of central vision due to progressive damage to the macula. A subset of AMD patients have wet AMD which is characterized by loss of vision due to the formation of new blood vessels into space between two layers of cells in the retina. This excess blood vessel formation results in fluid leakage that can result in physical changes in the structure of the retina and changes in vision. As this process becomes more severe, blindness can result from scar formation due to hemorrhaging.

Wet AMD is a leading cause of total and partial vision loss in the U.S., Europe and Japan. Wet AMD consists of approximately 10% of all cases of AMD, but accounts for approximately 90% of the vision loss associated with AMD. As indicated by the name, the risk for developing AMD increases with age and we anticipate the diagnosis rate will continue to increase as the population continues to trend towards an aging population. In the U.S., the prevalence of wet AMD is estimated to be nearly 600,000 individuals. Globally, the prevalence of wet AMD may exceed three million individuals based on extrapolations using global population figures. In developed countries, an estimated two-thirds of people with AMD have been diagnosed, of whom about two-thirds are treated.

Current Therapies for Wet AMD

Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapies have significantly changed the landscape for treatment of wet AMD. They have quickly become the standard of care due to their ability to either halt or significantly impede the loss of vision in the majority of patients with wet AMD. Currently there are three VEGF inhibitors that are commonly used for the treatment of wet AMD. All of these therapies require repetitive intravitreal injections typically ranging from every four to eight weeks in frequency to maintain efficacy, and patients often experience vision loss with reduced frequency of treatment. Due to a variety of factors, including inconvenience and discomfort associated with frequent injections in the eye, patient compliance is a significant concern with anti-VEGF therapies.

We are aware of multiple gene therapy product candidates currently in development to address the unmet medical need described above for wet AMD by targeting VEGF inhibition using AAV2 as the gene therapy vector. Recently, an ongoing clinical trial using one of these AAV2 gene therapy vectors reported data that indicated there may be patients who benefited with reduced injection frequency. We believe these data may also indicate that some patients may benefit from greater inhibition of VEGF activity and that utilizing NAV Technology could allow us to achieve better VEGF inhibition than our competitors using AAV2 to treat wet AMD.

RGX-314

RGX-314 is our product candidate for the treatment of wet AMD, which acts by neutralizing the activity of VEGF and modifying the pathway for formation of new, leaky blood vessels and retinal fluid accumulation. We plan on delivering RGX-314 subretinally using an AAV8 vector encoding a gene for a monoclonal antibody fragment which binds to VEGF and neutralizes VEGF activity. Ranibizumab is an FDA-approved monoclonal antibody fragment that binds to VEGF and has been extensively shown to be both efficacious and safe in wet AMD patients when delivered repeatedly through intraocular injections.

Planned Development of RGX-314

We expect to file an IND for RGX-314 in the second half of 2016. 

&#160;

X-linked Retinitis Pigmentosa (XLRP) 

Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is the most common inherited form of blindness, with an estimated 100,000 patients in the U.S. XLRP accounts for approximately 10% of RP, with 75% to 80% of XLRP cases due to mutations in the gene for retinitis pigmentosa GTPase regulator (RPGR). Mutations in RPGR are associated with a more severe form of the disease, causing early onset of disease, and a relatively fast progression. No therapies exist for RP beyond vitamin supplementation and sun protection, which may or may not slow disease progression. We currently have a preclinical program in development, RGX-321, for the treatment of XLRP.

With respect to the first third party license granted by Penn, our license is non-exclusive with respect to the patents and patent applications licensed to the third party for so long as that preexisting license grant remains in effect and will become exclusive upon the expiration or termination of that existing license agreement. The pre-existing licenses also include a license agreement Penn entered into with GSK in May 2002 granting a license to certain patents and patent applications, of which we subsequently sublicensed certain rights to from GSK in March 2009. For further information regarding our GSK sublicense, please see &#8220;License Agreements and Commercial Agreements&#8212;Platform Licenses&#8212;GlaxoSmithKline LLC&#8221; located elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our license agreement with Penn provides that should the rights Penn licensed to GSK ever revert to Penn, such rights shall automatically be included in our license agreement with Penn.

The Penn license agreement, as amended, also provides us with a non-exclusive, worldwide license to use all know-how that:

&#160;

&#183; 

was developed by Dr. Wilson, or other Penn researchers working under his direct supervision at Penn; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

is related to the AAV technology platform discovered by Dr. Wilson prior to February 2009; or 

&#160;

&#183; 

is related to the AAV technology platform discovered by Dr. Wilson at Penn after February 2009 pursuant to the 2009 SRA, the 2013 SRA or subsequent amendment to a sponsored research agreement; and 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

is owned by Penn and available for licensing; and &#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

is necessary or useful for the practice of the licensed patent rights. 

Under the terms of the Penn license agreement, we issued equity to Penn now represented by 213,150 shares of our common stock. We are also obligated to pay Penn:

&#160;

&#183; 

low- to mid-single digit royalties on net sales of licensed pharmaceutical products sold by us or our affiliates; 

&#160;

&#183; 

low-single digit to low-double digit royalty percentages of net sales on products intended for research purposes only; 

&#160;

&#183; 

low- to mid-double digit royalty percentage on royalties received from third parties on net sales of licensed pharmaceutical products by such third parties; 

&#160;

&#183; 

low-double digit to mid-teen digit percentages of sublicense fees we receive for the licensed intellectual property rights from sublicensees; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

reimbursements for ongoing patent prosecution and maintenance expenses. 

As of December 31, 2015, we have incurred expenses of $2.3 million to Penn under the license agreement. There are no future potential milestones to be paid under the license agreement. Our Penn license agreement, as amended, will terminate on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis on the date each particular licensed product ceases to be covered by at least one valid claim, issued or pending, under the licensed patent rights. We can terminate this license agreement by giving Penn prior written notice. Penn has the right to terminate:

&#160;

&#183; 

with notice if we are late in paying money due under the license agreement; 

&#160;

&#183; 

with notice if we fail to achieve a diligence event on or before the applicable completion date or otherwise breach the license agreement; 

&#160;

&#183; 

if we or our affiliates experience insolvency; or 

&#160;

&#183; 

if we commence any action against Penn to declare or render any claim of the licensed patent rights invalid or unenforceable. 

Under the current 2014 SRA, we fund research at Penn and pay certain intellectual property legal and filing expenses and receive the rights to the research results, if any. Under the Penn license agreement, as amended, and the 2014 SRA, all patentable inventions conceived, created, or conceived and reduced to practice pursuant to the 2014 SRA, together with patent rights represented by or issuing from the U.S. patents and patent applications, including provisional patent applications, automatically become exclusively licensed to us and all research results are automatically licensed to us as know-how. Our 2014 SRA with Penn will expire on December 31, 2016. We expect to seek to amend the SRA in order to continue to fund work and receive rights to the results of the research we fund at Penn.

GlaxoSmithKline LLC. In March 2009, we entered into a license agreement with GSK in order to secure the exclusive rights to patents and patent applications covering NAV Technology that GSK had previously licensed from Penn (subject to certain rights retained by GSK and Penn). Under this GSK license agreement, we receive an exclusive, worldwide sublicense under the licensed patent rights to make, have made, use, import, sell and offer for sale products covered by the licensed patent rights anywhere in the world. Our rights under this GSK license agreement are subject to certain rights retained by GSK for the benefit of itself and other third parties, including rights relating to: domain antibodies; RNA interference and antisense drugs; internal research purposes and GSK&#8217;s discovery research efforts with non-profit organizations and GSK collaborators; AAV8 for the treatment of hemophilia B; AAV9 for the treatment of Muscular Dystrophy, congestive heart failure suffered by Muscular Dystrophy patients and cardiovascular diseases by delivery of certain genes; and non-commercial research in the areas of Muscular Dystrophy, hemophilia B, congestive heart failure suffered by Muscular Dystrophy patients, and other cardiovascular disease. Under the terms of the license agreement, we issued to GSK 1,085,824 shares of our common stock. We are obligated to pay GSK: 

&#160;

&#183; 

up to $1.5 million in aggregate milestone payments; 

&#160;

&#183; 

low- to mid-single digit royalty percentages on net sales of licensed products; 

&#160;

&#183; 

low- to mid-double digit percentages of any sublicense fees we receive from sublicensees for the licensed intellectual property rights; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

reimbursements for certain patent prosecution and maintenance expenses. 

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015, we have incurred expenses of $4.0 million to GSK under the license agreement and no milestone payments have been made. Under our GSK license agreement, we are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize licensed products. Our GSK license agreement will terminate upon the expiration, lapse, abandonment or invalidation of the last licensed claim to expire, lapse, become abandoned or unenforceable in all the countries of the world where the licensed patent rights existed. However, if no patent ever issues from patent rights licensed from GSK, this license agreement will terminate a specified number of years after the first commercial sale of the first licensed product in any country. We may terminate this license agreement for any reason upon a specified number of days&#8217; written notice. GSK can terminate this license agreement if: 

&#160;

&#183; 

we are late in paying GSK any money due under the agreement and do not pay in full within a specified number of days of GSK&#8217;s written demand; 

&#160;

&#183; 

we materially breach the agreement and fail to cure within a specified number of days; or 

&#160;

&#183; 

we file for bankruptcy. 

Commercial Licenses to NAV Technology Licensees

We sublicense our NAV Technology Platform to third parties in order to develop and bring to market NAV Gene Therapy for a range of severe diseases with significant unmet medical needs. Sublicensing allows us to maintain our internal product development focus on our core disease indications and therapeutic areas while still expanding the NAV Gene Therapy pipeline, developing a greater breadth of treatments for patients, providing additional technological and potential clinical proof-of-concept for our NAV Technology Platform, and creating potential additional revenue. Each sublicense specifies the vector or vectors and disease indication or indications as well as whether the sublicense is exclusive or non-exclusive. In determining whether to sublicense, we first evaluate whether the disease indication is of interest to us in which case we may develop a therapeutic for the disease indication internally using our NAV Technology Platform. If it is not, we consider the size of the potential market and unmet need, competition, licensee development history and licensee&#8217;s ability to pay in evaluating whether to enter into a license agreement. As of December 31, 2015, we have granted 12 commercial licenses covering 23 partnered product candidates in development by our NAV Technology Licensees, most under a license to specific NAV Vectors. Our license agreements include upfront fees, annual maintenance fees, milestone fees based on licensee candidate progression, and low-single to low-double digit royalties on sales. Such royalties are subject to customary reductions, such as if the licensee must obtain a license from a third party to avoid infringement of such third party&#8217;s rights in order to exercise its rights under the license granted by us. We are obligated to make payments to our licensors with respect to the revenues we receive from our licensees for these sublicenses, in accordance with the terms of our agreements with our licensors.

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015, our NAV Technology Licensees had three on-going clinical trials using NAV Vectors. The chart below provides an overview of the development status of the programs of our NAV Technology Licensees.

Minnesota may terminate the license agreement if we become bankrupt or if we commence or maintain an action challenging any patent or patent application licensed under the license agreement. We may terminate the agreement if Minnesota materially breaches or materially fails to perform one or more of its duties under this agreement. We may terminate for any reason upon a specified number of days&#8217; prior written notice but must pay an early termination fee.

&#160;

ARIAD Pharmaceuticals, Inc. In November 2010, we entered into a license agreement with ARIAD Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ARIAD) in order to secure the exclusive rights for certain gene expression regulation technology. Under this ARIAD license agreement, we receive an exclusive worldwide license under the licensed intellectual property to develop, make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale and import licensed products and perform licensed services in the field of human gene therapy and a non-exclusive license to conduct internal research using related technology. In exchange, we granted to ARIAD a non-exclusive, royalty free, worldwide license to certain improvements and inventions based on the licensed intellectual property for any and all uses outside of the field of human gene therapy. We also issued ARIAD 687,139 shares of our common stock. Under the terms of the ARIAD license agreement, we are obligated to pay ARIAD: 

&#160;

&#183; 

up to $2.3 million in milestone payments; 

&#160;

&#183;

&#160;

&#183; 

following achievement of a milestone event, annual maintenance fees to ARIAD for remittance to one of ARIAD&#8217;s licensors; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

reimbursement for ongoing patent prosecution and maintenance costs. 

As of December 31, 2015, we have made no cash payments to ARIAD under the license agreement.

Our ARIAD license agreement will expire on a country-by-country, licensed product-by-licensed product, licensed service-by-licensed service basis on the later of ten years from the first commercial sale of the applicable licensed product or licensed service in such country or the date when there is no longer any valid claim covering such licensed product or licensed service in such country. Either party may terminate the ARIAD license agreement for material breach, effective a specified number of days after written notice in the event of nonpayment or a specified number of days for any other breach. We may terminate this license agreement upon a specified number of days&#8217; notice to ARIAD. Either party may terminate this license agreement if the other party files for bankruptcy.

Process Development and Manufacturing

We believe that we have access to the resources necessary to enable us to successfully commercialize NAV Gene Therapy products following regulatory approval, if any, by developing scalable processes to manufacture such products efficiently and at commercial quantity.

AAV Vector Expertise

We believe that Dr. Wilson&#8217;s lab at Penn is among the leading centers in the world for the cloning, production and characterization of AAV vectors. Since our inception we have funded the research of Dr. Wilson relating to the development of manufacturing processes and the analytical characterization of NAV Vectors. We believe that our significant investments in process development and characterization at Penn will help us develop a scalable, proprietary manufacturing process for NAV Gene Therapy products.

We have also entered into two agreements with WuXi Apptec, Inc. (WuXi), a leading technology platform company, with expertise in characterization of biologics. In May 2015, we entered into a collaboration agreement with WuXi in order to establish a proprietary production process for our NAV Gene Therapy. The proprietary production process is designed to enable the manufacturing for our, as well as our NAV Technology Licensees&#8217;, therapeutic programs from clinical trials through commercialization. Under the terms of the collaboration agreement, WuXi will work with us to establish standard processes applicable to our NAV Technology Platform which may be applied for the development, testing and manufacture of our products or those of our NAV Technology Licensees. WuXi will provide us and our NAV Technology Licensees substantially the same access to process development, testing and manufacturing resources to that received by WuXi&#8217;s key commercial clients. WuXi will provide us with preferred scheduling and performance of services supporting our gene therapy programs and those of our NAV Technology Licensees. The collaboration agreement with WuXi will remain in force unless terminated in accordance with its terms. Either party may terminate the collaboration agreement upon a specified number of days&#8217; prior written notice, for a material breach uncured for more than a specified number of days or if the other party becomes insolvent.

We also entered into an agreement with WuXi in April 2015 setting forth the terms and conditions that would govern future work orders with WuXi. Under this agreement, WuXi would carry out services set forth in future work orders as agreed to by the 

&#160;

parties. All work product developed as a result of WuXi&#8217;s performance of the services under these future work orders would be our sole and exclusive property. This agreement will expire on the later of April 2017 or the completion of all services under the last work order executed by the parties prior to April 2017. Either party may terminate this agreement or future work order upon a specified number of days&#8217; prior written notice, for a material breach uncured for more than a specified number of days or if the other party becomes insolvent. 

As part of our collaboration with WuXi, we have initiated production of NAV Vectors for use in our planned clinical trial for RGX-111 and have been invoiced $1.0 million by WuXi as of December 31, 2015.

Proprietary Methods

We have obtained rights to all of the proprietary technology underlying our NAV Technology Platform through our Platform Licenses and our SRAs, under which we have exclusively licensed rights to certain manufacturing-related patents and non-exclusively licensed rights to certain know-how owned or developed by Penn. This intellectual property encompasses areas including scalable AAV production methods, methods of increasing the packaging yield of AAV and methods of purification of AAV vectors.

Through our SRAs with Penn, we have examined several methods of larger-scale manufacturing of AAV which have been optimized to yield high titer and quality vectors. However, further improvements to the efficiency and simplicity of the process remain important to address future needs for commercial applications. We have paid particular attention to how the scale-up of AAV vector production occurs during downstream processing of the vector. Many production protocols have vector particles purified from a cell lysate, necessitating extensive downstream purification. These methods were largely developed using AAV2 vectors.

Scientists at Penn discovered that in contrast to earlier generation AAV2, most NAV Vectors were released primarily into the medium of production cultures and not retained in the cell. Because this distribution occurs in the absence of cell lysis, the production culture medium represents a relatively pure source of NAV Vectors and a lower level of cellular contaminants reduces the need for complicated purification steps. This method, for which we have licensed from Penn the exclusive patent rights, is high-yielding and versatile for the production of different NAV Vectors.

Other Capabilities

We have prepared and characterized a proprietary HEK293 master cell bank and other components (plasmid DNA banks) required for clinical vector production. Our master cell bank and other components are being used by us and certain of our NAV Technology Licensees for the production of NAV Vectors under cGMP for use in clinical trials that we expect will begin in 2015 and 2016. For example, as part of a European Union grant consortium, we were selected to manage the production of NAV Vectors for use in a clinical trial to be initiated in Italy for the treatment of MPS VI, a severe lysosomal storage disorder, expected to begin in 2016.

Intellectual Property

Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary or intellectual property protection for our product candidates, our core technologies, and other know-how, to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary or intellectual property rights. We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technology, inventions, and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business, including by seeking, maintaining and defending patent rights, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties. We also rely on trade secrets relating to our proprietary technology platform and on know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen and maintain our proprietary position in the field of gene therapy. Additionally, we intend to rely on regulatory protection afforded through orphan drug designations, data exclusivity and market exclusivity as well as patent term extensions, where available.

We have exclusively licensed rights relevant to our NAV Technology which includes novel recombinant AAV vectors AAV7, AAV8, AAV9, and AAVrh10, among others. Our licensed patent portfolio includes exclusive rights to more than 100 patents and patent applications worldwide relating to composition of matter patents and/or patent applications for our novel AAV vectors, as well as methods for their manufacture and therapeutic uses. We also possess substantial know-how and trade secrets relating to NAV Technology.

&#160;

&#183; 

Two pending U.S. provisional patent applications relating to RGX-501; upon conversion to a U.S. non-provisional application and/or International patent application, the expected expiration date of any U.S. patent and European patent that issues from these applications would be 2036; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

Two International Patent applications filed pursuant to the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) and pending U.S. patent applications relating to RGX-111 and RGX-121 - any U.S. patent and European patent that issues from these pending PCT applications relating to RGX-111 and RGX-121 is currently scheduled to expire in 2034. 

Except as indicated above, the anticipated expiration dates referred to above are without regard to potential patent term extension, patent term adjustment or other market exclusivity that may be available to us.

In addition to our licensed patents and patent applications relating to composition of matter protection for novel AAV vectors having AAV7 capsid, AAV8 capsid, AAV9 capsid, and AAVrh10 capsid, our licensed patent portfolio includes composition of matter claims for novel AAV vectors having AAV11 and AAV12 capsids; Rh.1 to Rh.38, Rh.40, Rh.43, Rh.48 to Rh.62, and Rh.64; Cy.1 to Cy.6 capsids; bb.1 and bb.2 capsids; Ch.1 to Ch.4 capsids; hu.1 to hu.4, hu.6, hu.7, hu.9 to hu.25, hu.27 to hu.29, hu.31, hu.32, hu.34, hu.35, hu.37, hu.39 to hu.49, hu.51 to hu.58, hu.60 to hu.64, hu.66, and hu.67 capsids; pi.1 to pi.3 capsids; and AAV vectors that have amino acid sequences that are at least 95% identical to these capsids.

technology related to engineering AAV therapeutics including recombinant AAV vectors engineered to target conducting airway cells, methods of altering the targeting and cellular uptake efficiency of an AAV viral vector having a capsid containing an AAV9 cell surface binding domain, the design of recombinant AAV viral vectors that confer passive immunization to airborne pathogens (the aforementioned gene therapy systems can include the use of certain gene expression regulation technology; we have exclusively licensed the patents and patent applications relating to this technology); 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

methods of detecting an AAV nucleotide sequence useful in diagnostics; and &#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

methods of manufacture of AAV, including patents and applications directed to scalable AAV production methods; methods of increasing the packaging yield, transduction efficiency, and gene transfer efficiency of an AAV, and methods of purification of viral vectors, such as AAV vectors. 

We anticipate that our patent portfolio will continue to expand as a result of our sponsored research agreements with academic institutions, including the 2014 SRA with Penn where all patentable inventions conceived, created, or conceived and reduced to practice pursuant to the 2014 SRA, together with patent rights represented by or issuing from the U.S. patents and patent applications (including provisional patent applications) related thereto automatically become exclusively licensed to us under our existing licensing agreement with Penn and all research results are automatically non-exclusively licensed to us as know-how under that existing license agreement. We also anticipate further expansion of our patent portfolio through our commercial licenses to NAV Technology Licensees which grant us non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual licenses to use and practice, subject to certain limitations, any patentable modifications or improvements developed by our licensees, their affiliates, or sublicensees to any vector that is the subject of a claim within the licensed patents. For further information regarding our commercial sublicenses, please see &#8220;License Agreements and Commercial Licenses&#8212;Commercial Licenses to NAV Technology Licensees&#8221; located elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Customers

Our revenue for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 consisted of license revenue, reagent sales and grant revenue. Three customers, two of which were based in the U.S. and one of which was based in Ireland, accounted for approximately 79% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015. No other customer accounted for more than 15% of revenue in 2015. Two customers, one of which was based in the U.S. and another which was based in the European Union, accounted for approximately 47% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014. No other customer accounted for more than 15% of revenue in 2014. Three customers, two of which were based in the U.S. and one of which was based in the European Union, accounted for approximately 76% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2013. No other customer accounted for more than 15% of revenue in 2013. Future license revenue is uncertain due to the contingent nature of our licenses granted to third-parties. We expect grant revenue to decrease in the future as we are not currently seeking any further grant awards. Future revenue is uncertain and may fluctuate significantly from period to period.

Research and Development 

We are in the process of building a research and development organization that includes extensive expertise in AAV gene therapy and related scientific disciplines. We operate cross-functionally and are led by an experienced research and development management team. We use rigorous project management techniques to assist us in making disciplined strategic research and development program decisions and to help limit the risk profile of our product pipeline. We also access relevant market information and key opinion leaders in creating target product profiles when appropriate, as we advance our programs towards commercialization. We engage third parties to conduct portions of our preclinical research. In addition, we plan to utilize multiple clinical sites to conduct our clinical trials; however, we are not substantially dependent upon any one of these sites for our clinical trials nor do any of them conduct a major portion of our clinical trials.

We incurred $17.3 million, $5.0 million and $5.1 million in research and development expenses in the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

Competition

The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, including in the field of gene therapy, are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on intellectual property. While we believe that our NAV Technology Platform, strong intellectual property portfolio and scientific expertise in the gene therapy field provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including larger and better-funded pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, new market entrants and new technologies.

We are aware of several companies focused on developing gene therapies in various disease indications, including Applied Genetic Technologies Corporation, Avalanche Biotechnologies, Inc., BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc., bluebird bio, Inc., Genzyme Corporation (Genzyme), Sangamo BioSciences, Inc., Spark Therapeutics, Inc. and uniQure N.V. as well as several companies addressing other methods for modifying genes and regulating gene expression. Additionally, we have sublicensed our NAV Technology Platform for developing gene therapies in various disease indications to our NAV Technology Licensees. Not only must we compete with other companies that are focused on gene therapy products using earlier generation AAV technology and other gene 

&#160;

therapy platforms, but any products that we may commercialize will have to compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. 

There are other organizations working to improve existing therapies or to develop new therapies for our initially selected disease indications. Depending on how successful these efforts are, it is possible they may increase the barriers to adoption and success for our product candidates, if approved. These efforts include the following:

&#160;

&#183; 

HoFH. There are several companies with marketed products for the treatment of HoFH, including Aegerion (Juxtapid), Genzyme (Kynamro) and Amgen (Repatha). 

&#160;

&#183; 

MPS I. There is one principal competitor with a marketed product for the treatment of MPS I, Sanofi (Aldurazyme). 

&#160;

&#183; 

MPS II. The principal marketed competition for MPS II is a systemic enzyme replacement therapy, Elaprase (idursulfase), which is marketed by Shire. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Wet AMD. Marketed competition for wet AMD largely consists of anti-VEGF therapies developed by Roche/Genentech (Lucentis, Avastin) and Regeneron (Eylea). 

Many of our competitors, either alone or with their strategic partners, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do. Our competitors may be more successful than us in obtaining approval for treatments and achieving widespread market acceptance. Our competitors&#8217; treatments may be more effective, or more effectively marketed and sold, than any treatment we may commercialize and may render our treatments obsolete or non-competitive before we can recover the expenses of developing and commercializing any of our treatments.

Mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies.

We anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new drugs enter the market and advanced technologies become available. We expect any treatments that we develop and commercialize to compete on the basis of, among other things, efficacy, safety, convenience of administration and delivery, price, the level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors.

Government Regulation

In the U.S., biological products, including gene therapy products, are subject to regulation under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&#38;C Act) and the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act) and other federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations. Both the FD&#38;C Act and the PHS Act and their corresponding regulations govern, among other things, the testing, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, packaging, storage, record keeping, distribution, reporting, advertising and other promotional practices involving biological products. Applications to the FDA are required before conducting clinical testing of biological products, and each clinical study protocol for a gene therapy product is reviewed by the FDA and, in some instances, the NIH, through its RAC. FDA approval also must be obtained before marketing of biological products. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources and we may not be able to obtain the required regulatory approvals.

Within the FDA, the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) regulates gene therapy products. The CBER works closely with the NIH and its RAC, which makes recommendations to the NIH on gene therapy issues and engages in a public discussion of scientific, safety, ethical and societal issues related to proposed and ongoing gene therapy protocols. The FDA and the NIH have published guidance documents with respect to the development and submission of gene therapy protocols. The FDA also has published guidance documents related to, among other things, gene therapy products in general, their preclinical assessment, observing subjects involved in gene therapy studies for delayed adverse events, potency testing, and chemistry, manufacturing and control information in gene therapy INDs.

Ethical, social and legal concerns about gene therapy, genetic testing and genetic research could result in additional regulations restricting or prohibiting the processes we may use. Federal and state agencies, congressional committees and foreign governments have expressed interest in further regulating biotechnology. More restrictive regulations or claims that our products are unsafe or pose a hazard could prevent us from commercializing any products. New government requirements may be established that could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our product candidates under development. It is impossible to predict whether legislative changes will 

&#160;

be enacted, regulations, policies or guidance changed, or interpretations by agencies or courts changed, or what the impact of such changes, if any, may be. 

U.S. Biological Products Development Process

The process required by the FDA before a biological product may be marketed in the U.S. generally involves the following:

&#160;

&#183; 

completion of nonclinical laboratory tests, including evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, and animal studies according to good laboratory practice (GLP) and applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory animals or other applicable regulations; 

&#160;

&#183; 

submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical studies may begin; 

&#160;

&#183; 

performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical studies according to the FDA&#8217;s regulations on good clinical practice (GCP) and any additional requirements for the protection of human research subjects and their health information, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed biological product for its intended use; 

&#160;

&#183; 

submission to the FDA of a Biologics License Application (BLA) for marketing approval that includes substantive evidence of safety, purity, and potency from results of nonclinical testing and clinical studies; 

&#160;

&#183; 

satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the biological product is produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP), to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biological product&#8217;s identity, strength, quality and purity and, if applicable, the FDA&#8217;s current good tissue practice (GTP), for the use of human cellular and tissue products; 

&#160;

&#183; 

potential FDA inspection of the nonclinical and clinical study sites that generated the data in support of the BLA; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

FDA review and approval, or licensure, of the BLA. 

Where a gene therapy study is conducted at, or sponsored by, institutions receiving NIH funding for recombinant DNA research, prior to the submission of an IND to the FDA, a protocol and related documentation is submitted to and the study is registered with the NIH Office of Biotechnology Activities (OBA) pursuant to the NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules (NIH Guidelines). Compliance with the NIH Guidelines is mandatory for investigators at institutions receiving NIH funds for research involving recombinant DNA, however many companies and other institutions not otherwise subject to the NIH Guidelines voluntarily follow them. The NIH is responsible for convening the RAC, a federal advisory committee, which discusses protocols that raise novel or particularly important scientific, safety or ethical considerations at one of its quarterly public meetings. The OBA will notify the FDA of the RAC&#8217;s decision regarding the necessity for full public review of a gene therapy protocol. RAC proceedings and reports are posted to the OBA web site and may be accessed by the public.

The clinical study sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA places the clinical study on a clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical study can begin. With gene therapy protocols, if the FDA allows the IND to proceed, but the RAC decides that full public review of the protocol is warranted, the FDA will request at the completion of its IND review that sponsors delay initiation of the protocol until after completion of the RAC review process. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a biological product candidate at any time before or during clinical studies due to safety concerns or non-compliance. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, studies may not recommence without FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by the FDA. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical studies to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that suspend or terminate such studies.

&#160;

Clinical studies involve the administration of the biological product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the study sponsor&#8217;s control. Clinical studies are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical study, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety, including stopping rules that assure a clinical study will be stopped if certain adverse events should occur. Each protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Clinical studies must be conducted and monitored in accordance with the FDA&#8217;s regulations imposing the GCP requirements, including the requirement that all research subjects provide informed consent. Further, each clinical study must be reviewed and approved by an independent institutional review board (IRB) at or servicing each institution at which the clinical study will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of study participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical studies are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the form and content of the informed consent that must be signed by each clinical study subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical study until completed. Clinical studies also must be reviewed by an institutional biosafety committee (IBC), a local institutional committee that reviews and oversees basic and clinical research conducted at that institution. The IBC assesses the safety of the research and identifies any potential risk to public health or the environment. 

Human clinical studies are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:

&#160;

&#183; 

Phase I. The biological product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Phase II. The biological product is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule.

Phase III. Clinical studies are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy, potency, and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical study sites. These clinical studies are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. Post-approval clinical studies, sometimes referred to as Phase IV clinical studies, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These clinical studies are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication, particularly for long-term safety follow-up. The FDA recommends that sponsors observe subjects for potential gene therapy-related delayed adverse events for a 15-year period, including a minimum of five years of annual examinations followed by ten years of annual queries, either in person or by questionnaire, of study subjects. 

During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data, and clinical study investigators. Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical studies must be submitted to the FDA. Written IND safety reports must be promptly submitted to the FDA, the NIH and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events, any findings from other studies, tests in laboratory animals or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects, or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must submit an IND safety report within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsor&#8217;s initial receipt of the information. Phase I, Phase II and Phase III clinical studies may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor or its data safety monitoring board may suspend a clinical study at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical study at its institution if the clinical study is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB&#8217;s requirements or if the biological product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.

Human gene therapy products are a new category of therapeutics. Because this is a relatively new and expanding area of novel therapeutic interventions, there can be no assurance as to the length of the study period, the number of patients the FDA will require to be enrolled in the studies in order to establish the safety, efficacy, purity and potency of human gene therapy products, or that the data generated in these studies will be acceptable to the FDA to support marketing approval. The NIH and the FDA have a publicly accessible database, the Genetic Modification Clinical Research Information System, which includes information on gene transfer studies and serves as an electronic tool to facilitate the reporting and analysis of adverse events on these studies.

Concurrent with clinical studies, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the physical characteristics of the biological product as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. To help reduce the risk of the introduction of adventitious agents with use of biological products, the PHS Act emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, 

&#160;

among other things, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the final biological product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the biological product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 

U.S. Review and Approval Processes

After the completion of clinical studies of a biological product, FDA approval of a BLA must be obtained before commercial marketing of the biological product. The BLA must include results of product development, laboratory and animal studies, human studies, information on the manufacture and composition of the product, proposed labeling and other relevant information. In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA) a BLA or supplement to a BLA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the biological product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of pediatric data or full or partial waivers of pediatric requirements. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any biological product for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted. The testing and approval processes require substantial time and effort and there can be no assurance that the FDA will accept the BLA for filing and, even if filed, that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.

Within 60 days following submission of the application, the FDA reviews a BLA submitted to determine if it is substantially complete before the agency accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this event, the BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the BLA. The FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and potent, including whether it is effective, for its intended use, and has an acceptable purity profile, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product&#8217;s identity, strength, quality, potency and purity as those factors relate to the safety or effectiveness of the product. The FDA may refer applications for novel biological products or biological products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. During the biological product approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) is necessary to assure the safe use of the biological product. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the BLA without a REMS, if required.

Before approving a BLA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. For a gene therapy product, the FDA also will not approve the product if the manufacturer is not in compliance with GTP. These are FDA regulations that govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture of human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue based products (HCT/Ps) which are human cells or tissue intended for implantation, transplant, infusion, or transfer into a human recipient. The primary intent of the GTP requirements is to ensure that cell and tissue based products are manufactured in a manner designed to prevent the introduction, transmission and spread of communicable disease. FDA regulations also require tissue establishments to register and list their HCT/Ps with the FDA and, when applicable, to evaluate donors through screening and testing. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure that the clinical studies were conducted in compliance with IND study requirements and GCP requirements. To assure cGMP, GTP and GCP compliance, an applicant must incur significant expenditure of time, money and effort in the areas of training, record keeping, production, and quality control.

Notwithstanding the submission of relevant data and information, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA does not satisfy its regulatory criteria for approval and deny approval. Data obtained from clinical studies are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. If the agency decides not to approve the BLA in its present form, the FDA will issue a complete response letter that usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the BLA identified by the FDA. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical studies. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application.

If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. The FDA may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing, or dispensing in the form of a risk management plan, or otherwise limit the scope of 

&#160;

any approval. In addition, the FDA may require post marketing clinical studies, sometimes referred to as Phase IV clinical studies, designed to further assess a biological product&#8217;s safety and effectiveness, and testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. 

One of the performance goals agreed to by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) is to review 90% of standard BLAs in 10 months of the 60-day filing date and 90% of priority BLAs in six months of the 60-day filing date, whereupon a review decision is to be made. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority BLAs and its review goals are subject to change from time to time. The review process and the PDUFA goal date may be extended by three months if the FDA requests or the BLA sponsor otherwise provides additional information, or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission, constituting a major amendment to the BLA.

Orphan Drug Designation

Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is defined under the FD&#38;C Act as a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., or more than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug or biological product available in the U.S. for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan product designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants orphan product designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.

If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug or biological product for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity. Competitors, however, may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity. Orphan product exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same biological product as defined by the FDA or if our product candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor&#8217;s product for the same indication or disease. If a drug or biological product designated as an orphan product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan product exclusivity. Orphan drug status in the European Union has similar, but not identical, benefits.

Expedited Development and Review Programs

The FDA has a Fast Track program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs and biological products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs and biological products are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a new drug or biologic may request the FDA to designate the drug or biologic as a Fast Track product at any time during the clinical development of the product. Also under the Fast Track program, the FDA may consider for review sections of the marketing application on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the application, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the application and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the application.

Any product submitted to the FDA for marketing, including under a Fast Track program, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as Breakthrough Therapy designation, priority review, and accelerated approval. Under the Breakthrough Therapy program, products intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition may be eligible for the benefits of the Fast Track program when preliminary clinical evidence demonstrates that such product may have substantial improvement on one or more clinically significant endpoints over existing therapies. Additionally, FDA will seek to ensure the sponsor of a breakthrough therapy product receives timely advice and interactive communications to help the sponsor design and conduct a development program as efficiently as possible. Any product is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide safe and effective therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists or a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease compared to marketed products. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug or biological product designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. Additionally, a product may be eligible for accelerated approval. Drug or biological products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval, which means that they may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical studies establishing that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a 

&#160;

drug or biological product receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical studies. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product. Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, priority review and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval. Rather, these programs are intended to expedite the development and approval process, but do not necessarily accomplish that intent. 

Post-Approval Requirements

Maintaining substantial compliance with applicable federal, state, and local statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Rigorous and extensive FDA regulation of biological products continues after approval, particularly with respect to cGMP. We will rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of any products that we may commercialize. Manufacturers of our products are required to comply with applicable requirements in the cGMP regulations, including quality control and quality assurance and maintenance of records and documentation. Other post-approval requirements applicable to biological products, include reporting of cGMP deviations that may affect the identity, strength, quality, potency, or purity of a distributed product in a manner that may impact the safety or effectiveness of the product, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse effects, reporting updated safety and efficacy information, and complying with electronic record and signature requirements. After a BLA is approved, the product also may be subject to official lot release. As part of the manufacturing process, the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution. If the product is subject to official release by the FDA, the manufacturer submits samples of each lot of product to the FDA together with a release protocol showing a summary of the history of manufacture of the lot and the results of all of the manufacturer&#8217;s tests performed on the lot. The FDA also may perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products, such as viral vaccines, before releasing the lots for distribution by the manufacturer. In addition, the FDA conducts laboratory research related to the regulatory standards on the safety, purity, potency, and effectiveness of biological products.

We also must comply with the FDA&#8217;s advertising and promotion requirements, such as those related to direct-to-consumer advertising, the prohibition on promoting products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the product&#8217;s approved labeling (known as &#8220;off-label use&#8221;), industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the internet. Discovery of previously unknown problems or the failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements may result in restrictions on the marketing of a product or withdrawal of the product from the market as well as possible civil or criminal sanctions. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant or manufacturer to administrative or judicial civil or criminal sanctions and adverse publicity. FDA sanctions could include refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, clinical hold, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, debarment, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.

Biological product manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved biological products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved BLA, including withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process or facility generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval.

U.S. Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity

Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of the FDA approval of the use of our product candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product&#8217;s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of a BLA plus the time between the submission date of a BLA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved biological product is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may intend to apply for restoration of patent term for one of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical studies and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant BLA.

&#160;

A biological product can obtain pediatric market exclusivity in the U.S. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an FDA-issued &#8220;Written Request&#8221; for such a study. 

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Affordable Care Act) signed into law on March 23, 2010, includes a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be similar to, or interchangeable with, an FDA-licensed reference biological product. This amendment to the PHS Act attempts to minimize duplicative testing. Biosimilarity, which requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical study or studies. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product and, for products administered multiple times, the biologic and the reference biologic may be switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. However, complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structure of biological products, as well as the process by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implementation that are still being worked out by the FDA.

A reference biologic is granted 12 years of exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the reference product. The first biologic product submitted under the abbreviated approval pathway that is determined to be interchangeable with the reference product has exclusivity against other biologics submitting under the abbreviated approval pathway for the lesser of (i) one year after the first commercial marketing, (ii) 18 months after approval if there is no legal challenge, (iii) 18 months after the resolution in the applicant&#8217;s favor of a lawsuit challenging the biologics&#8217; patents if an application has been submitted, or (iv) 42 months after the application has been approved if a lawsuit is ongoing within the 42-month period.

Additional Regulation

In addition to the foregoing, state and federal laws regarding environmental protection and hazardous substances, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Resource Conservancy and Recovery Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act, affect our business. These and other laws govern our use, handling and disposal of various biological, chemical and radioactive substances used in, and wastes generated by, our operations. If our operations result in contamination of the environment or expose individuals to hazardous substances, we could be liable for damages and governmental fines. We believe that we are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws and that continued compliance therewith will not have a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot predict, however, how changes in these laws may affect our future operations. Equivalent laws have been adopted in other countries that impose similar obligations.

Other U.S. Healthcare Laws and Regulations

Healthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and use of pharmaceutical products that are granted marketing approval. Arrangements with third-party payors, existing or potential customers and referral sources are subject to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations, and these laws and regulations may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which manufacturers market, sell and distribute the products for which they obtain marketing approval. Such restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations include the following:

&#160;

&#183; 

the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or kind, in exchange for, or to induce, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers, on the one hand, and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. The PPACA amends the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. A person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it; 

&#160;

&#183; 

the federal False Claims Act (FCA), which prohibits, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payors that are false or fraudulent. Federal Anti-Kickback Statute violations and certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion, also may implicate the FCA: 

&#160;

&#183; 

federal criminal laws that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

the federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to report annually to CMS information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians, other healthcare providers and teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and other healthcare providers and their immediate family members; &#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) imposes criminal and civil liability for executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters; 

&#160;

&#183; 

HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, which governs the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protects the security and privacy of protected health information; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

state and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to: items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry&#8217;s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. 

Violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental laws and regulations may result in penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of operations, the exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment. Furthermore, efforts to ensure that business activities and business arrangements comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations can be costly for manufacturers of branded prescription products.

Coverage and Reimbursement

Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any products for which we may obtain regulatory approval. In the U.S. and markets in other countries, sales of any product candidates for which regulatory approval for commercial sale is obtained will depend in part on the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the drug product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. Moreover, a payor&#8217;s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved.

Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. New metrics frequently are used as the basis for reimbursement rates, such as average sales price, average manufacturer price and actual acquisition cost. In order to obtain coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, it may be necessary to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the products, in addition to the costs required to obtain regulatory approvals. If third-party payors do not consider a product to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover the product after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow a company to sell its products at a profit. Health Technology Assessment which is intended to take account of medical, social, economic and ethical issues when determining the suitability of a medicinal product for reimbursement has increasingly become an element of the pricing and reimbursement decisions of the competent authorities in European Union Member States.

The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid health care costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. By way of example, the PPACA contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of drug products, including, for example, increasing the minimum rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, extending the rebate program to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care plans, addressing a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected and establishing annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies&#8217; share of sales to federal health care programs. Adoption of government controls and measures, and tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit payments for pharmaceuticals.

&#160;

U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 

The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, to which we are subject, prohibits corporations and individuals from engaging in certain activities to obtain or retain business or to influence a person working in an official capacity. It is illegal to pay, offer to pay or authorize the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in an official capacity. Equivalent laws have been adopted in other countries that impose similar obligations.

Government Regulation Outside of the U.S.

In addition to regulations in the U.S., we will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical studies and any commercial sales and distribution of our products. Because biologically sourced raw materials are subject to unique contamination risks, their use may be restricted in some countries.

Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical studies or marketing of the product in those countries. Many countries outside of the U.S. have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical study application much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical studies. In the European Union, for example, an application for authorization of a clinical trial must be submitted to the competent regulatory authorities and a request for a related positive opinion must be submitted to the competent Ethics Committees in the European Union Member States in which the clinical trial takes place, much like the FDA and the IRB, respectively. Once the clinical trial has been approved by the competent regulatory authorities and a positive opinion has been provided by the competent Ethics Committees in accordance with the European Union and the European Union Member State requirements, the corresponding clinical study may proceed.

To obtain regulatory approval of a biological medicinal product under European Union regulatory systems, we must submit a marketing authorization application. The grant of marketing authorization in the European Union for products containing viable human tissues or cells such as gene therapy medicinal products is governed by Regulation 1394/2007/EC on advanced therapy medicinal products, read in combination with Directive 2001/83/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council, commonly known as the Community code on medicinal products and Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 March 2004 laying down Community procedures for the authorization and supervision of medicinal products for human and veterinary use and establishing the EMA, commonly referred to as the EMA Regulation. Regulation 1394/2007/EC lays down specific rules concerning the authorization, supervision and pharmacovigilance of gene therapy medicinal products, somatic cell therapy medicinal products and tissue engineered products. Manufacturers of advanced therapy medicinal products must demonstrate the quality, safety and efficacy of their products to the EMA which provides an opinion regarding the application for marketing authorization. The European Commission grants or refuses marketing authorization after the EMA has delivered its opinion.

Innovative medicinal products are authorized in the European Union on the basis of a full marketing authorization application (as opposed to an application for marketing authorization that relies, in whole or in part, on data in the marketing authorization dossier for another, previously approved medicinal product). Applications for marketing authorization for innovative medicinal products must contain the results of pharmaceutical tests, pre-clinical tests and clinical trials conducted with the medicinal product for which marketing authorization is sought. Innovative medicinal products for which marketing authorization is granted are entitled to eight years of data exclusivity. During this period, applicants for approval of generics or biosimilars of these innovative products cannot rely on data contained in the marketing authorization dossier submitted for the innovative medicinal product to support their application. Innovative medicinal products for which marketing authorization is granted are also entitled to ten years of market exclusivity. During these ten years&#8217; of market exclusivity, no generic or biosimilar medicinal product may be placed on the European Union market even if a marketing authorization for approval of a generic or biosimilar of the innovative product has been submitted to the EMA or to the competent regulatory authorities in the European Union Member States and marketing authorization has been granted. The ten years of market exclusivity will be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. However, there is no guarantee that a product will be considered by the European Union&#8217;s regulatory authorities to be an innovative medicinal product which is eligible for the relevant periods of data and market exclusivity.

Products authorized as &#8220;orphan medicinal products&#8221; in the European Union are entitled to benefits additional to those granted in relation to innovative medicinal products. In accordance with Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 1999 on orphan medicinal products, a medicinal product may be designated as an orphan medicinal product if (1) it is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition; (2) either (a) such condition affects no more than five in 10,000 persons in the European Union when the application is made, or (b) the product, without the incentives derived from orphan medicinal product status, would not generate sufficient return in 

&#160;

the European Union to justify investment; and (3) there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of such condition authorized for marketing in the European Union, or if such a method exists, the product will be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition. Further guidance on such criteria is provided in European Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/2000 of 27 April 2000 laying down the provisions for implementation of the criteria for designation of a medicinal product as an orphan medicinal product and definitions of the concepts &#8220;similar medicinal product&#8221; and &#8220;clinical superiority&#8221;. Orphan medicinal products are eligible for financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and following grant of a marketing authorization, the EMA and the European Union Member States&#8217; competent authorities are not permitted to accept another application for a marketing authorization, or grant a marketing authorization or accept an application to extend an existing marketing authorization, for the same therapeutic indication of a similar medicinal product for ten years following grant or authorization. The application for orphan drug designation must be submitted before the application for marketing authorization. The applicant may receive a fee reduction for the marketing authorization application if the orphan drug designation has been granted, but not if the designation is still pending at the time the marketing authorization is submitted. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. 

Products authorized in the European Union as orphan medicinal products are entitled to 10 years of data exclusivity. The products are, in parallel, entitled to 10 years of market exclusivity. The 10-year market exclusivity may be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan designation, for example, if the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Additionally, marketing authorization may be granted to a similar product during the 10-year period of market exclusivity for the same therapeutic indication at any time if:

&#160;

&#183; 

The second applicant can establish in its application that its product, although similar to the orphan medicinal product already authorized, is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior; 

&#160;

&#183; 

The holder of the marketing authorization for the original orphan medicinal product consents to a second orphan medicinal product application; or 

&#160;

&#183; 

The holder of the marketing authorization for the original orphan medicinal product cannot supply enough orphan medicinal product. 

Similar to obligations imposed in the U.S., medicinal products authorized in the European Union may be subject to post-authorization obligations, including the obligation to conduct Phase IV trials.

Moreover, in the European Union, the sole legal instrument at the European Union level governing the pricing and reimbursement of medicinal products is Council Directive 89/105/EEC (the Price Transparency Directive). The aim of the Price Transparency Directive is to ensure that pricing and reimbursement mechanisms established in European Union Member States are transparent and objective, do not hinder the free movement and trade of medicinal products in the European Union and do not hinder, prevent or distort competition on the market. The Price Transparency Directive does not, however, provide any guidance concerning the specific criteria on the basis of which pricing and reimbursement decisions are to be made in individual European Union Member States. Neither does it have any direct consequence for pricing or levels of reimbursement in individual European Union Member States. The national authorities of the individual European Union Member States are free to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices and/or reimbursement of medicinal products for human use. Individual European Union Member States adopt policies according to which a specific price or level of reimbursement is approved for the medicinal product. Other European Union Member States adopt a system of reference pricing, basing the price or reimbursement level in their territory either, on the pricing and reimbursement levels in other countries, or on the pricing and reimbursement levels of medicinal products intended for the same therapeutic indication. Furthermore, some European Union Member States impose direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market.

Health Technology Assessment (HTA) of medicinal products is becoming an increasingly common part of the pricing and reimbursement procedures in some European Union Member States. These countries include the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, and Sweden. The HTA process in the European Union Member States is governed by the national laws of these countries. HTA is the procedure according to which the assessment of the public health impact, therapeutic impact and the economic and societal impact of the use of a given medicinal product in the national healthcare systems of the individual country is conducted. HTA generally focuses on the clinical efficacy and effectiveness, safety, cost, and cost-effectiveness of individual medicinal products as well as their potential implications for the national healthcare system. Those elements of medicinal products are compared with other treatment options available on the market.

The outcome of HTA may influence the pricing and reimbursement status for specific medicinal products within individual European Union member states. The extent to which pricing and reimbursement decisions are influenced by the HTA of a specific medicinal product vary between the European Union Member States.

In 2011, Directive 2011/24/EU was adopted at the European Union level. This Directive concerns the application of patients' rights in cross-border healthcare. The Directive is intended to establish rules for facilitating access to safe and high-quality cross-border healthcare in the European Union. It also provides for the establishment of a voluntary network of national authorities or bodies responsible for HTA in the individual European Union M ember S tates. The purpose of the network is to facilitate and support the exchange of scientific information concerning HTAs. This could lead to harmonization of the criteria taken into account in the conduct of HTA between European Union M ember S tates and in pricing and reimbursement decisions and negatively impact price in at least some European Union M ember S tates. 

For other countries outside of the European Union, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical studies, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, again, the clinical studies are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.

If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
