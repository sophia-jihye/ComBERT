 ITEM 1. BUSINESS Overview 

Mastech Holdings, Inc. (referred to in this report as &#147;Mastech&#148;, the &#147;Company&#148;, &#147;us&#148;, &#147;our&#148; or &#147;we&#148;) is a provider of Information Technology (&#147;IT&#148;) staffing services. Headquartered near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, we have approximately 850 consultants that provide services across a broad spectrum of industry verticals. From July 1986 through September 2008, we conducted our business as subsidiaries of iGATE Corporation (&#147;iGATE&#148;). We do not sell, lease or otherwise market computer software or hardware, and 100% of our revenue is derived from the sale of staffing services. 

&#160;

Our IT staffing business combines technical expertise with business process experience to deliver a broad range of services within business intelligence / data warehousing; web services; enterprise resource planning and customer resource management; mobile applications; and e-Business solutions. We work with businesses and institutions with significant IT spend and recurring staffing needs. We also support smaller organizations with their &#147;project focused&#148; temporary IT staffing requirements. 

Sales and marketing of our IT staffing business are conducted through account executives within two sales channels (wholesale and retail). Much of these efforts employ a cost-effective telesales model, supplemented with selective travel and client visits. The wholesale channel consists of system integrators and other IT staffing firm clients, with a need to supplement their abilities to attract highly-qualified temporary technical computer personnel. The retail channel focuses on clients that are end-users of staffing services. This channel consists of 1) end-users who have retained a third party to provide vendor management services (a &#147;managed service provider&#148; or &#147;MSP&#148;) and centralize the consultant hiring process and 2) branch service operations, which focuses on clients that are end-users of staffing services in select geographies within the U.S. The branch services model employs local sales and recruitment resources, aimed at establishing strong relationships with both clients and candidates. We expanded our branch service operations in 2015 as the result of our June 15, 2015 acquisition of Hudson Global Resources Management, Inc.&#146;s U.S. IT staffing business (&#147;Hudson IT&#148;) which deploys a branch service business model. 

We recruit through global recruiting centers located in the U.S. and India that deliver a full range of recruiting and sourcing services. Our centers employ over 110 recruiters and sourcers that focus on recruiting U.S.-based candidates to service a geographically diverse client base in the U.S. Our ability to respond to client requests from our offshore recruiting centers, with investment in sourcing and recruiting processes, expanded search coverage, round-the-clock sourcing, and frequent candidate contact, gives us the ability to deliver high-quality candidates to our clients in a timely fashion. 

History and Developments 

Historically, we operated as the former Professional Services segment of iGATE. Mastech Holdings, Inc. was incorporated in Pennsylvania as a wholly-owned subsidiary of iGATE on June 6, 2008 in anticipation of our spin-off from iGATE. On September 30, 2008, we spun-off from iGATE and began operating as an independent public company. Our operating subsidiaries have 29 years of history as reliable providers of IT staffing services. 

Established in 1986, our business model focused on importing global IT talent to the U.S. to meet the growing demand for IT professionals. In the early 2000&#146;s, the demand for IT professionals declined and the supply of IT resources quickly exceeded a declining demand curve. No longer was there a need to recruit abroad for technology talent, as supply was abundant in the U.S. Accordingly, we retooled our recruiting model to focus on the recruitment of U.S.-based IT talent. Given our reputation with and knowledge of H1-B visas, part of our recruiting efforts focused on attracting H1-B visa holders currently in the U.S. This approach gave us access to a larger and differentiated recruiting pool compared to many of our competitors. 

In 2003, we launched our offshore global recruitment center model in an effort to meet an increase in industry demand with lower cost recruiting resources. Over the last twelve years, we have made significant investments in these centers to improve infrastructure, processes and effectiveness. Additionally, we have made investments in recent years in our domestic recruitment structure, primarily to support our IT retail channel. 

During 2010, we made two strategic moves designed to enhance and expand our service offerings. In January, 2010, we acquired Curastat, Inc., an Arizona-based specialized healthcare staffing organization. This acquisition, along with the creation of Mastech Healthcare, Inc., expanded our service offerings into the healthcare staffing space. Also in January 2010, we sold our brokerage operations staffing business, thus focusing on our IT and healthcare staffing operations. 

In August 2013, we sold our healthcare staffing operations to focus entirely on our core IT staffing business. 

&#160;

During the fourth quarter of 2014, we established a technology center to evaluate practice opportunities for high-demand IT skill-sets and emerging technologies. In 2015, we embarked on our first technology practice, Salesforce.com. 

On June 15, 2015, we completed the acquisition of Hudson IT. Hudson IT is a domestic IT staffing business with offices in Chicago, Boston, Tampa and Orlando. Hudson IT deploys a branch service business model that targets clients that are direct end-users of IT staffing services. 

Our Business 

Our revenues are principally generated from contract staffing services that are provided on a time and material basis. Typically, we negotiate our business relationship by using one of three methods to gain agreement on the services to be provided. We either establish our relationship based on a simple standard term sheet; create a Statement of Work (&#147;SOW&#148;) specific to a project; or enter into a master service agreement with a client that describes the framework of our relationship. In each case, a client will submit to us positions and / or requirements that they plan on satisfying by using temporary contractors. We propose consultants to the client that we believe satisfy their needs and propose an hourly bill rate for each consultant submitted. The client will select our consultant or a competing firm&#146;s consultant based on their view of quality, fit and pricing. Consultant specific contractual details, such as billable rates, are documented as an annex to the agreement type that is chosen by the client. 

We generally do not enjoy exclusivity with respect to a client&#146;s contractor needs. Most of our clients use multiple suppliers to satisfy their requirements and to ensure a competitive environment. Our success with any particular client is determined by (a) the quality and fit of our consultant; (b) our ability to deliver a quality consultant on a timely basis; and (c) pricing considerations. We recognize revenue on contract staffing assignments as services are performed (hours worked multiplied by the negotiated hourly bill rate). We invoice our clients on a weekly, bi-weekly or monthly basis, in accordance with the terms of our agreement. Typical credit terms require our invoices to be paid within 30 days of receipt by the client. 

While our primary focus is on contract staffing services, we also provide permanent placement services for our clients when opportunities arise. Permanent placement revenues have historically represented less than 1% of our total revenues. 

Sales and Marketing 

We focus much of our marketing efforts on businesses and institutions with significant budgets and recurring staffing needs. We constantly look to develop relationships with new clients. In addition, we continuously work to penetrate our existing client relationships to deeper levels. 

Our marketing is conducted through account executives within two sales channels (wholesale and retail). Our IT consultants and their skill sets can be marketed within both sales channels. There are numerous occasions where a consultant will end a project within one channel and immediately start a new project within the other channel. When a consultant is on &#147;paid bench&#148; (between projects), account executives from both sales channels have the ability to market the consultant within their respective client base. 

The wholesale channel consists of system integrators and other IT staffing firm customers with a need to supplement their ability to attract highly-qualified temporary technical computer personnel. Over the last several years, more of our revenues have come from the wholesale channel as a percentage of total revenues. However, with the acquisition of Hudson IT, which has a strong stable of direct end-user clients in the retail channel, the wholesale channel in 2015 represented 67% of our total revenues compared to 77% in 2014. Most of our strategic relationships in this channel are established at the vice president / sales director level. Account executives generally are responsible for expanding existing client relationships. We supplement these marketing activities 

&#160;

through our sales organization in India, whose account executives target smaller IT staffing clients within the wholesale channel. Generally, these account executives call (telesales) on potential new customers within an assigned U.S. territory. 

Our retail channel focuses on customers that are end-users of IT staffing services. Revenues from this channel represented 33% of our total revenues in 2015, which is up materially from previous years due to the Hudson IT acquisition. Account executives at our branch operations call on, and meet with, potential new customers and are also responsible for maintaining existing client relationships within their geographic territory. Account executives are paired with recruiters and both receive incentive compensation based on revenue generation activities using a localized sales and recruitment model. Within the retail channel, many end-users of IT staffing services have retained a third party to provide vendor management services to centralize the consultant hiring process and reduce costs. Under this arrangement, the third-party MSP retains control of the vendor selection and vendor evaluation process, which weakens the relationship built with the client. Our lower-cost centralized telesales model and highly efficient offshore recruiting model have better positioned us to respond to the growing use of MSPs. 

Permanent placement activity can be generated from both of our sales channels. However, such opportunities are largely by-products of conducting our core contract staffing business. During 2015, permanent placement fees continued to represent less than 1% of total revenues. 

Recruiting 

We operate seven small recruiting centers located in the U.S. and two larger facilities in India that deliver a full range of recruiting and sourcing services. Our centers employ over 110 recruiters and sourcers that focus on recruiting U.S.-based candidates to service a geographically diverse client base in the U.S. Our ability to respond to client requests faster than the competition is critical for success in our industry as most staffing firms access the same candidate pool via job boards and websites. Our offshore recruiting capabilities, with investment in sourcing and recruiting processes, expanded search coverage, around-the-clock sourcing, and frequent candidate contact, gives us the ability to deliver high-quality candidates to our clients in a timely fashion. 

We have continued to invest in leading technologies and recruitment tools to enhance efficiencies. For example, we use web-based tools to expand the reach of our candidate searches. We also employ a state-of-the-art applicant tracking system that has proprietary tool-kits and job board / internet interfacing capabilities, resulting in further operational efficiencies. 

In late 2011, we upgraded and expanded our offshore recruitment offices in Bangalore. In late 2014, we significantly expanded our offshore recruitment offices in New Delhi which gives us the ability to nearly double our recruiter seats from existing levels. Both facilities provide our offshore organization with state-of-the-art infrastructure and workforce amenities to attract top-quality employees. 

We have access to a large and differentiated recruiting pool due to our brand recognition with both W-2 hourly U.S. citizens and H1-B visa holders in the U.S. Unlike most staffing firms that have a high concentration of either H1-B workers or W-2 hourly U.S. citizens, we have historically maintained an equal balance of H1-B and W-2 hourly employees. We believe that this balanced mix allows us to access a broader candidate pool than our primary competition.

Geographic Presence &#38; Industry Verticals 

All of our revenues are generated from services provided in the U.S. We market our services on a national basis and have the ability to provide services in all 50 states. Our geographical concentration tends to track major client locations, such as California, Texas, Pennsylvania and Florida, and in large metropolitan areas such as Chicago, New York City and Washington, D.C. 

We provide our IT services across a broad spectrum of industry verticals including: automotive, consumer products, education, financial services, government, healthcare, manufacturing, retail, technology, telecommunications, transportation and utilities. Below is a breakdown of our IT billable consultant base by industry that represented at least 5% of our billable consulants as of December 31, 2015: 

&#160;

&#160; Financial Services &#160; 25% &#160; Technology &#160; 11% &#160; &#160; Healthcare &#160; 18% &#160; Government &#160; 8% &#160; &#160; Telecom &#160; 14% &#160; Manufacturing &#160; 5% &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Other &#160; 19% &#160; Employees 

At December 31, 2015, we had approximately 800 U.S. employees and 170 employees offshore. None of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements governing their employment with our Company. We employ our consultants on both an hourly and salary basis. Most of our salaried employees are H1-B visa holders. We enjoy a good reputation within the H1-B visa community, which allows us to access a very broad candidate pool. The majority of our hourly employees are U.S. citizens. On average, we maintain a balanced composition of salaried and hourly employees. We believe that our employee relations are good. 

Intellectual Property Rights 

Our intellectual property largely consist of proprietary processes; client, employee and candidate information; and proprietary rights of third parties from whom we license intellectual property. We rely upon a combination of nondisclosure and other arrangements to protect our intellectual property. 

Seasonality 

Our operations are generally not affected by seasonal fluctuations. However, our consultants&#146; billable hours are affected by national holidays and vacation practices. Accordingly, we typically have lower utilization rates and higher benefit costs during the fourth quarter. Additionally, assignment completions tend to be higher near the end of the calendar year, which largely impacts our revenue and gross profit performance during the subsequent quarter. 

Our Competitive Position 

We operate in a highly competitive and fragmented industry, with low barriers to entry. We compete for potential clients with providers of outsourcing services, systems integrators, computer systems consultants, other staffing services firms and, to a lesser extent, temporary personnel agencies. Many competitors are significantly larger and have greater financial resources in comparison to us. We believe that the principal competitive factors for securing and building client relationships are driven by the ability to precisely comprehend client requirements and by providing highly qualified consultants who are motivated to meet or exceed a client&#146;s expectations. We must be able to do this efficiently to provide speed to market with pricing that is competitive and represents value to both our clients and our consultants. The principal competitive factors in attracting qualified personnel are compensation, availability, location and quality of projects and schedule flexibility. We believe that many of the professionals included in our database may also pursue other employment opportunities. Therefore, our responsiveness to the needs of these professionals is an important factor in our ability to be successful. 

&#160;

Our Strengths 

We believe our strengths compared to industry peers include: 

Established client base 

Our client base consists of large, medium-sized and small companies that span across multiple industry verticals. Long-standing relationships with corporate clients, blue-chip IT integrators and MSPs are a core component of our future growth strategy. These relationships, exemplified by our consistently low customer attrition rate, reflect our focus and commitment to our customers. 

Operational excellence 

In the staffing services business, operational excellence largely relates to a firm&#146;s ability to effectively recruit high quality talent. Our offshore recruitment operations give us the ability to respond to clients&#146; staffing needs in a timely and cost-effective manner. Investments in sourcing and recruiting processes and leading technologies and recruitment tools have resulted in a highly scalable offshore recruiting model, which has delivered value to our clients. 

Additionally, we employ a human resource management model, featuring portal technology as well as immigration support services, for our widely dispersed consultant base. This model enables us to maintain attrition rates that are much lower than the industry averages for our salaried workforce. 

Minority-owned status 

We are a large minority-owned staffing firm and have received multiple awards for our commitment to diversity. We have been certified as a minority-owned business by the National Minority Supplier Development Council (&#147;NMSDC&#148;). This certification is attractive to many clients and potential clients, particularly in the government and public sector segments, where project dollars are specifically earmarked for diversity spending. 

Attractive financial profile 

We have historically enjoyed a lower operating cost structure than our industry peers due to our low cost telesales and offshore recruiting models. These business models allow us to quickly adjust our costs to changes in our business environment. Our blue-chip client base has ensured high quality accounts receivable and a strong and predictable cash flow conversion metric. 

Expertise in high-demand IT skills 

We have substantial expertise in certain IT skills including: ERP and CRM; SOA and web services; business intelligence and data warehousing; and e-Business solutions. We also have the capacity to take advantage of demand growth in these sectors, as we are well positioned in terms of scale, technical capabilities, and client base. In addition, we have relationships with industry leaders such as Salesforce.com, Oracle and Accenture, who are among the leading providers of such services. 

Experienced management team 

Our management team, comprised of business leaders with deep industry experience, is a unique blend of executives with significant Mastech experience and others who have held leadership roles in other companies. We believe this talent, with combined experience across a variety of industries, allows us to capitalize on the positives of our existing business model and at the same time improve our service offerings, internal processes and long-term strategy for future growth. 

&#160;

Reportable Financial Segments 

The Company has one reportable segment in accordance with ASC Topic 280 &#147;Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information&#148;. 

Government Regulation 

We recruit IT professionals on a global basis and, therefore, must comply with the immigration laws in the countries in which we operate, particularly the U.S. As of December 31, 2015, approximately 49% of our U.S. workforce was working under Mastech sponsored H1-B temporary work permits. Statutory law limits the number of new H1-B petitions that may be approved in a fiscal year. Legislation could be enacted limiting H1-B visa holders&#146; employment with staffing companies. In recent years, the vast majority of our H1-B hires were not subject to the annual quota limiting H1-B visas because they were already in the U.S. under H1-B visa status with other employers. Additionally, the U.S. Congress has recently considered and may consider in the future extensive changes to U.S. immigration laws regarding the admission of high-skilled temporary and permanent workers. Such changes, if enacted, may impact the types of H1-B temporary work permits that may be granted or the number of available H1-B temporary work permits.
