Our Business Drivers

Factors that drive demand for our business offerings include:

&#160;

&#183; 

M&#38;A Activity . M&#38;A activity is an important driver for all of our segments. We offer services for all phases of the M&#38;A process. Our services during the pre-transaction phase include government competition advice and pre-transaction analysis. Our services during the negotiation phase include due diligence, negotiation and other transaction advisory services, government competition and antitrust regulation services, expert advice, asset valuations, and financial advice. We also offer post-M&#38;A integration and transformation services. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Financial Markets . Financial market factors, including credit and financing availability, terms and conditions, the willingness of financial institutions to provide debt modifications or relief, corporate debt levels, default rates, and capital market transactions are significant drivers of demand for our business offerings, particularly our Corporate Finance &#38; Restructuring and Strategic Communications segments. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Regulatory Complexity, Public Scrutiny and Investigations . Increasingly complex global regulations and legislation, greater scrutiny of corporate governance, instances of corporate malfeasance, and more stringent and complex reporting requirements, drive demand for our business offerings. The need to understand and address the impact of regulation and legislation, as well as the increasing costs of doing business, have prompted companies to focus on better assessing and managing risks and opportunities. In addition, boards of directors, audit committees and independent board committees have been increasingly tasked with conducting internal investigations of financial wrongdoing, regulatory non-compliance, and other issues. These factors and laws such as SOX and the Dodd&#8211;Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, have contributed to the demand for independent consultants and experts to investigate and provide analyses and to support the work of outside legal counsel, accountants and other advisors. These types of investigations also increasingly demand the use of multiple disciplinary service offerings like ours, which combine skills and expertise. These factors drive demand for various practices and services of all our segments. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Litigation and Disputes . Litigation and business disputes, the complexity of the issues presented, and the amount of potential damages and penalties drive demand for the services offered by many of our segments, particularly our Forensic and Litigation Consulting, Economic Consulting and Technology segments. Law firms and their clients as well as government regulators and other interested third parties rely on independent outside resources to evaluate claims, facilitate discovery, assess damages, provide expert reports and testimony, manage the pre-trial and in-trial process and effectively present evidence. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Operational Challenges and Opportunities . Businesses facing challenges that require the evaluation and reevaluation of strategy, risks and opportunities as a result of crisis driven situations, competition, regulation, innovation and other events that arise in the course of business. These challenges include enterprise risk management, global expansion, competition from established companies and emerging businesses and technologies, doing business in emerging markets, and new and changing regulatory requirements and legislation. Management, companies and their boards need outside help to recognize, understand and evaluate such events and effect change, which drives demand for independent expertise that can combine general business acumen with the specialized technical expertise of our practice offerings and industry expertise. These factors drive demand for various practices and services of all our segments. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Developing Markets . The growth of multinational firms and global consolidation can precipitate antitrust and competition scrutiny and the spread internationally of issues and practices that historically have been more common in the U.S., such as increased and complex litigation, corporate restructuring and bankruptcy activities, and antitrust and competition scrutiny. Companies in the developing world and multinational companies can benefit from our expert advice to access capital and business markets, comply with the regulatory and other requirements of multiple countries, and structure M&#38;A transactions, and conduct due diligence, which drives demand for the services of our Corporate Finance &#38; Restructuring , Economic Consulting, Technology and Strategic Communications segments.

We compete primarily on the basis of the breadth of our services, the quality of our work, the prominence of our professionals, our geographic reach, our reputation and performance record, our specific industry expertise, and our strong client relationships.

Demand for Integrated Solutions and a Consultative Approach .

Our Business Strategy

We build client relationships based on the quality of our services, our reputation, and the recognition of our professionals. We provide diverse complimentary services to meet our clients&#8217; needs around the world. We emphasize client service and satisfaction. We aim to build strong brand recognition. The following are key elements of our business strategy:

&#160;

&#183; 

Leverage Our Practices, Relationships and Expertise . We work hard to maintain and strengthen our core practices and competencies. We believe that our recognized expertise, client relationships, and the quality of our reputation, coupled with our successful track record, size, and geographic diversity are the most critical elements in a decision to retain us. Many of our professionals are recognized experts in their respective fields. By successfully leveraging our reputation, experience, broad client base, and the expertise of our professionals, we expect to continue to obtain engagements from new as well as existing clients. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Grow Organically . Our strategy is to grow organically by increasing headcount and market share to provide clients with a complete suite of services across our segments, as well as the industries and geographic regions in which we operate. We strive to engage in our markets competitively to produce better than average success. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Attract an d Retain Highly Qualified Professionals . Our professionals are crucial to delivering our services to clients and generating new business. As of December 31, 2015, we employed 3,516 revenue-generating professionals, many of whom have established and widely recognized names in their respective service and industry specializations, and specialized industry expertise. Through our substantial staff of highly qualified professionals, we can handle a large number of complex assignments simultaneously. To attract a nd retain highly qualified professionals, we offer significant compensation opportunities, including sign-on bonuses, forgivable loans, retention bonuses, incentive bonuses, and equity compensation, along with a competitive benefits package and the chance to work on challenging engagements with other highly skilled peers. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Enhance Profitability . We endeavor to manage costs, headcount, utilization, bill rates, and pricing for both time and materials and alternative fee arrangements, to operate profitably, at segment and regional levels. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Acquisitions and Other Investments . We will consider future strategic or opportunistic acquisition opportunities on a selective basis. We seek to integrate completed acquisitions and manage investments in a way that fosters organic growth, expands our geographic presence, or complements our current practices, services and industry focuses. We will typically structure our acquisitions to retain the services of key individuals from the acquired companies. 

Our Employees

Our success depends on our ability to attract and retain our expert professional work force. Our professionals include PhDs, MBAs, JDs, CPAs, CPA-ABVs (who are CPAs accredited in business valuations), CPA-CFFs (who are CPAs certified in financial forensics), CRAs (certified risk analysts), Certified Turnaround Professionals, Certified Insolvency and Reorganization Advisers, Certified Fraud Examiners, ASAs (accredited senior appraisers), construction engineers and former senior government officials. We also engage independent contractors to supplement our professionals on client engagements as needed. As of December 31, 2015, we employed 4,634 employees, of which 3,516 were revenue-generating professionals.

Employment Agreements

As of December 31, 2015, we had written employment arrangements with substantially all of our 410 Senior Managing Director and equivalent personnel, (collectively, &#8220;SMD&#8221;s), 261 of which are employment agreements with fixed terms ending between 2016 and 2024, while the other 149 contracts are of an at-will nature with no fixed term. Of the 261 written agreements with a fixed term, 253 provide that at the end of the initial term they automatically renew for successive year-to-year terms, unless either party provides advance written notice of non-renewal prior to commencement of the renewal term.

The employment agreements with SMDs generally provide for fixed salary and participation in incentive payment programs (which in some cases may be based on financial measures such as EBITDA), salary continuation benefits, accrued bonuses and other benefits beyond the termination date if such professional leaves our employ for specified reasons prior to the expiration date of the employment agreement. The length and amount of payments to be paid by us following the termination or resignation of a professional varies depending on whether the person resigned with or without &#8220;good reason&#8221; or was terminated by us with or without &#8220;cause,&#8221; retires or does not renew, died or became &#8220;disabled,&#8221; or was terminated as a result of a &#8220;change in control&#8221; (all such terms as defined in such SMD&#8217;s employment agreement). All of our written employment arrangements with SMDs include covenants providing for restrictions on the SMD&#8217;s ability to compete and solicit the employees of the Company following the end of their employment. 

Loan and Equity Compensation

Employees, consultants and professionals who join us in connection with acquisitions or as new hires may receive retention or sign-on payments, on a case by case basis, through unsecured general recourse forgivable loans or other payments. We believe that the loan arrangements enhance our ability to attract and retain professionals. Some or all of the principal amount and accrued interest of the loans we make to employees and consultants will be forgiven by us, or their repayment will be funded by us through additional bonus compensation, upon the passage of time, provided that the professional is an employee or consultant on the forgiveness date. In addition, upon certain termination events, accrued interest and the outstanding principal balance may be forgiven, including upon death, disability and, in some cases, retirement or termination by the employer without cause or the employee with good reason, or the employee may be required to repay the unpaid accrued interest and outstanding principal balance upon certain other termination events such as voluntary resignation, as applicable to the specific loan. The value of the forgivable loans we have made, in the aggregate as well as on an individual basis, have been, and we anticipate will continue to be, significant. Our executive officers are not eligible to receive loans and no loans have been made to them.

Our executive officers, other members of senior management, outside direc tors, as well as employees and independent service providers, have received and will continue to receive equity awards, including stock option and share-based awards (including awards in the form of restricted stock, performance-based restricted stock unit s, deferred restricted stock units, and cash-settled stock appreciation rights and units), on a case-by-case basis, to the extent that shares are available under our stockholder approved equity compensation plans. The value of such equity and cash-based aw ards, in the aggregate, as well as on an individual basis, have been and are expected to continue to be significant. 

Select SMDs may participate in other incentive compensation programs, such as our Senior Managing Director Incentive Compensation Program in the U.S., UK and Canada (the &#8220;ICP&#8221;) or the Key Senior Managing Director Incentive Plan (the &#8220;KSIP&#8221;), which provide for initial, and in the case of the ICP recurring, compensation. Employment arrangements under the ICP and KSIP are discussed below. 

Select SMD Compensation Opportunities

The ICP and the KSIP are supplemental incentive compensation arrangements open only to select SMDs who are recommended by management and approved by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company. Effective January 2015, the ICP was closed to new participants and was replaced with the KSIP. SMDs previously admitted to the ICP continue to be eligible to receive annual recurring equity awards related to the deferral of a portion of each participant&#8217;s annual bonus award for the prior bonus year. 

The benefits under the KSIP include an initial cash payment in the form of an initial unsecured general recourse forgivable loan and a restricted stock award, as well as future cash bonus opportunities, which are contingent upon the SMD entering into a new five-year employment agreement and agreeing to defer payment of one-third his or her annual performance-based discretionary bonus over a two-year term. ICP participants who enter the KSIP are required to forego future annual recurring equity awards under the ICP, which are not replicated in the KSIP. KSIP awards typically cliff-vest, 50% at the end of four or six years, with the balance vesting at the end of six or nine years, depending on the aggregate monetary value of the awards to such participant. All or portions of the awards may vest or forfeit upon different termination events. 

As of December 31, 2015, there were 74 SMDs participating in the ICP and 17 SMDs participating in the KSIP (of which 12 were former ICP participants). 

For the past five years, we have made the following aggregate forgivable loans and equity awards to (i) new participants entering the ICP, (ii) participants moving to higher participation levels within the ICP, (iii) participants receiving annual deferred bonus, restricted stock bonus and additional equity awards pursuant to the annual bonus matching features of the ICP, and (iv) participants in the KSIP:

In 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015, we also funded $34.3 million, $51.5 million, $40.8 million, $47.9 million and $20.3 million, respectively, of unsecured forgivable loans and other loans to SMDs and other professionals outside of the ICP and KSIP. Our corporate officers are not eligible to receive loans of any kind.

Marketing

We rely primarily on our senior professionals to identify and pursue business opportunities. Referrals from clients, law firms and other intermediaries and our reputation from prior engagements are also key factors in securing new business. Our professionals often learn about new business opportunities from their frequent contacts and close working relationships with clients. In marketing our services, we emphasize our experience, the quality of our services and our professionals&#8217; particular areas of expertise, as well as our ability to quickly staff new and large engagements. While we aggressively seek new business opportunities, we maintain high professional standards and carefully evaluate potential new client relationships and engagements before accepting them. We also employ or contract with sales professionals who are tasked primarily with marketing the services of our Corporate Finance &#38; Restructuring, Forensic and Litigation Consulting, Strategic Communications and Technology segments.

Clients 

During the year ended December 31, 2015, no single client accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenues. Our Technology segment had one client that individually accounted for 19% of its total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015. No other reportable segment had a single client that accounted for more than 10% of its respective total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015. The loss of this client by the Technology segment would not have a material adverse effect on FTI Consulting and our subsidiaries as a whole but could have a material adverse effect on such segment if that business was not quickly replaced. In some cases, we may have engagements through law firms that represent a larger percentage of our consolidated revenues or the revenues of a segment; however, each law firm engages us on behalf of multiple clients.

Competition

We compete with different companies or businesses of companies depending on the particular nature of a proposed engagement and the requested types of service(s) or the location of the client, or delivery of the service(s) or product(s). Our businesses are highly competitive. Our competitors include large organizations, such as the global accounting firms and large management and financial consulting companies, which offer a broad range of consulting services; investment banking firms; consulting and software companies, which offer niche services that are the same or similar to services or products offered by one or more of our segments; and small firms and independent contractors that provide one or more specialized services.

We compete primarily on the basis of the breadth of our services, the quality of our work, the prominence of our professionals, our geographic reach, our reputation and performance record, our specific industry expertise, our ability to staff multiple significant engagements across disciplines and industries in multiple locations, and our strong client relationships. Our Technology segment, and to a lesser extent our other segments, may also compete on price, although the critical nature of the services provided by our Corporate Finance &#38; Restructuring, Forensic and Litigation Consulting and Economic Consulting segments typically makes price a secondary consideration with respect to those segments. Since our businesses depend in a large part on professional relationships, there are low barriers of entry for professionals, including our professionals, electing to work independently, start their own firms, or change employers.

Our Corporate Finance &#38; Restructuring segment primarily competes with specialty boutiques providing restructuring, bankruptcy or M&#38;A services, and to a lesser extent large investment banks and global accounting firms. 

Our Forensic and Litigation Consulting segment primarily competes with other large consulting companies with service offerings similar to ours.

Our Economic Consulting segment primarily competes with individually recognized economists, specialty boutiques, and large consulting companies with service offerings similar to ours. 

Our Technology segment primarily competes with consulting and/or software providers specializing in e-discovery, ESI and the management of electronic content. Competitors may offer products and/or services intended to address one piece or more of those areas. There continues to be significant consolidation of companies providing products and services similar to our Technology segment, through M&#38;A and other transactions, which may provide competitors access to greater financial and other resources than those of the Company. This industry is subject to significant and rapid innovation. Larger competitors may be able to invest more in research and development or react more quickly to new regulatory or legal requirements and other changes and may be able to innovate more quickly and efficiently. Our Ringtail &#174; software has been facing significant competition from competing software products that are offered to end-users on a commodity basis through licensing as opposed to our historical integrated product and consulting service offerings. In addition, companies compete aggressively against our Technology segment on the basis of price, particularly with respect to hosting and e-discovery services.

Our Strategic Communications segment competes with large public relations firms and boutique M&#38;A and crisis management communications firms. Our Strategic Communications segment has been experiencing competitive downward fee pressure on higher margin types of engagements and fewer or smaller retainer relationships.

Some service providers are larger than we are and, on certain engagements, may have an advantage over us with respect to one or more competitive factors. Specialty boutiques or smaller local or regional firms, while not offering the range of services we provide, may compete with us on the basis of geographic proximity, specialty services or pricing advantages.

We use the FTI, Palladium and Compass-formative marks pursuant to co-existence, consent and/or settlement agreements with third parties. We believe we take the appropriate steps to protect our trademarks and brands. 

We also rely upon non-disclosure, license and other agreements to protect our products and services.
