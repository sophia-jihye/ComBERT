 Item 1. Business 

Business Overview 

TriNet Group Inc., or TriNet or the Company, is a leading provider of comprehensive human resources, or HR, solutions for small to midsize businesses, or SMBs, under a co-employment model. Our HR solutions are designed to manage an increasingly complex set of HR regulations, costs, risks and responsibilities for our clients, allowing them to focus on operating and growing their core businesses. Our bundled HR solutions include offerings such as: 

&#8226; 

multi-state payroll processing and tax administration; 

&#8226; 

employee benefits programs, including health insurance and retirement plans; 

&#8226; 

workers compensation insurance and claims management; 

&#8226; 

federal, state and local labor, employment and benefit law compliance; 

&#8226; 

risk mitigation, including employment practices claims management; 

&#8226; 

expense and time management; and 

&#8226; 

human capital consulting. 

Our proprietary, cloud-based HR software systems are used by our clients and their employees, whom we refer to as worksite employees, or WSEs, to efficiently store and manage their core HR-related information and conduct a variety of HR-related transactions anytime and anywhere. 

In addition, our expert teams of in-house HR professionals also provide additional services upon request to support various stages of our clients' growth, including talent management, recruiting and training, performance management consulting or other consulting services (with an incremental charge for such services). 

As of December 31, 2015, we served over 12,700 &#32;clients in all 50 &#32;states, the District of Columbia and Canada, co-employed more than 324,000 &#32;WSEs and had processed over $31 billion &#32;in payroll and payroll tax payments for clients on our systems in 2015. Our clients are distributed across a variety of industries, including technology, life sciences, not-for-profit, professional services, financial services, property management, retail, manufacturing, and hospitality. Our sales and marketing, client services and product development teams are increasingly focused on specific industry verticals. This verticalized approach gives us a deeper understanding of the HR needs facing SMBs in particular industries, which better enables us to provide HR solutions and services tailored to the specific needs of clients in these verticals. We conduct our business primarily in the United States, with more than 99% of our total revenues for each of 2015, 2014 and 2013 being attributable to WSEs in the U.S. and the remainder being attributable to WSEs in Canada. 

For 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , our total revenues were $2.7 billion , $2.2 billion &#32;and $1.6 billion &#32;respectively. Our total revenues consist of professional service revenues and insurance service revenues. For 2015 &#32;and 2014 , 15% &#32;and 16% &#32;of our total revenues, respectively, consisted of professional service revenues, and 85% &#32;and 84% &#32;of our total revenues, respectively, consisted of insurance service revenues. 

We recognize as professional service revenues the fees we earn for providing our clients with a comprehensive suite of HR professional services, but do not include amounts paid to us by clients as payroll that are paid out to WSEs or amounts withheld and remitted to authorities as taxes. 

We recognize as insurance service revenues all insurance-related billings and administrative fees collected from clients and withheld from WSEs. We pay premiums to third-party insurance carriers for client and WSE insurance benefits and reimburse the insurance carriers and third-party administrators for claims payments made on our behalf within our insurance deductible layer, where applicable. These premiums and reimbursements are classified as insurance costs on our statements of operations. 

To augment our financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, we use internally a non-GAAP financial measure, Net Insurance Service Revenues, which consists of insurance service revenues less insurance costs. We also use a measure of total non-GAAP revenue, or Net Service Revenues, which is the sum of professional service revenues and Net Insurance Service Revenues. For 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , Net Service Revenues were $546.9 million , $507.2 million &#32;and $417.7 million , respectively. For 2015 , 73% &#32;of our Net Service Revenues consisted of professional service revenues and 27% &#32;of our Net Service Revenues consisted of Net Insurance Service Revenues. 

For 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , our net income was $31.7 million , $15.5 million &#32;and $13.1 million , respectively, and our Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization, or Adjusted EBITDA, was $151.3 million , $165.3 million &#32;and $136.0 million , respectively. 

Our Services 

Professional Services 

We provide our clients with a comprehensive suite of HR professional services that we believe enable SMBs to effectively execute fundamental HR transactions and manage an increasingly complex set of HR regulations, costs, risks and responsibilities. 

As part of our professional service offerings, we provide our clients with fundamental HR transactional capabilities, including multi-state payroll processing and tax administration, as well as a cloud-based system of record for all their HR transactions. Our online and mobile self-service tools enable our clients, for example, to manage effectively employee hiring and termination, administer changes to employee payroll, view real-time benefits data and create compensation reports. In addition, WSEs are able to access our system to manage their own payroll information, request paid time off (PTO) and view approval status real-time, view paystubs, PTO balances, W-2s and more. This HR functionality is a core component of our professional HR service offering. 

We also leverage the collective insights and experience that we have gained over our 27-year operating history to help clients mitigate the many administrative, regulatory and practical risks associated with their responsibilities as employers. We continuously monitor changes in the labor, employment and benefit regulatory environment and offer guidance and training to clients to assist them in avoiding or reducing liability and exposure. Our professional HR services include access to HR templates, best practices, employee handbooks, disciplined process management guidelines, employee relations consultation, issue investigation, workplace employment posters, and compensation practice benchmarking data. In addition, our clients are able to consult directly with our HR professionals through a variety of interaction models, ranging from call center support for basic questions to pooled specialized resources and dedicated HR professionals, depending upon the needs of the client and their WSEs. Our HR teams also provide additional services upon request to support stages of our clients&#8217; growth, including recruiting or other services (with an incremental charge for such services). 

Insurance Services 

We offer our clients and WSEs access to a broad range of TriNet-sponsored benefits and insurance programs that many of our clients may be unable to obtain for their WSEs on their own and that are compliant with state, local, and federal regulations. We believe access to our fully-insured, Affordable Care Act compliant group health insurance plans is one of the 

most important benefits we provide to our clients and WSEs. In addition, our insurance services offerings include plan design and administration, enrollment management, and WSE and client communications relating to our sponsored benefits and insurance programs. As described below, the principal components of our insurance services offerings are employee benefit plans, workers compensation insurance and employment practices liability insurance. 

Employee Benefit Plans 

We sponsor and administer a number of fully-insured, risk based employee benefit plans, including group health, dental, vision and life insurance as an employer plan sponsor under Section 3(5) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, or ERISA. We also offer other benefit programs to our clients and WSEs, including individual life insurance, a legal services plan, commuter benefits, home insurance, critical illness insurance, pet insurance and auto insurance. We provide group insurance coverage to our WSEs through a national network of carriers including Aetna, Blue Shield of California, Florida Blue, BlueCross BlueShield of North Carolina, Tufts, Kaiser Permanente, MetLife United Healthcare, EyeMed, Delta Dental and Vision Service Plan. 

Approximately 38% &#32;of our 2015 group health insurance premiums were for fully insured policies with respect to which our carriers set the premiums and for which we were not responsible for any deductible, which are referred to as &#8216;guaranteed cost&#8217; policies. The remaining 62% &#32;of our 2015 group health insurance premiums were for fully insured policies with respect to which we agree to pay additional amounts to our carriers for any claims paid within an agreed-upon deductible layer. Our agreements with our health insurance carriers with respect to these non-'guaranteed cost' policies typically include limits to our exposure for individual claims, which we refer to as &#8216;pooling&#8217; limits, and limits to our maximum aggregate exposure for claims in a given policy year, which we refer to as &#8216;stop loss&#8217; limits. We have experienced variability, and may experience variability in the future, in the amounts that we are required to pay our health insurance carriers for group health insurance expenses incurred by WSEs within our deductible layer under non-'guaranteed cost' policies, based on continually changing trends in the frequency and severity of claims. These historical trends may change, and other seasonal trends and variability may develop, which may make it more difficult for us to manage this aspect of our business. 

Workers Compensation Insurance 

We provide fully-insured workers compensation insurance coverage for our clients and WSEs through agreements that we negotiate with our third-party insurance providers. These agreements typically include a deductible layer that obligates us to reimburse our carriers up to $1 million per claim occurrence. We manage the risk that we assume in connection with these policies by being selective in the types of businesses that we take on as new clients, by monitoring claims data and the performance of our carriers and third-party claims management services and vendors and by providing risk management services for existing clients. These services include performing workplace assessment, safety consultation, accident investigation and other risk management services at our client locations to help prevent situations that could lead to claims and services to help remediate claims when they occur. 

Employment Practices Liability Insurance 

We provide employment practices liability insurance (EPLI) for our clients through agreements that we negotiate with our third-party EPLI insurance provider. These EPLI policies provide for a per-claim retention amount. For most of our clients, the retention amount is split between the client and TriNet, with the client paying its portion of the retention amount first. While we do not provide legal representation to our clients, our clients can benefit from the extensive experience of employment law specialists in our legal department who support our HR professionals in their efforts to assist clients in avoiding employment practices liability claims and in managing, processing and responding to such claims. For claims covered by the EPLI insurance, actual litigation defense is conducted by one of several outside employment law firms chosen by the EPLI carrier with whom we and our EPLI carriers have previously negotiated rates, established billing guidelines and invoice review processes and developed a case management protocol to efficiently and effectively defend such claims. 

Seasonality and Insurance Variability 

Our business is affected by cyclicality in business activity and WSE behavior. Historically, we have experienced our highest monthly addition of WSEs, as well as our highest monthly levels of client attrition, in the month of January, primarily because clients that change their payroll service providers tend to do so at the beginning of a calendar year. We also experience higher levels of client attrition in connection with renewals of the health insurance we sponsor for our WSEs, in the event that such renewals result in higher costs to our clients. We have also historically experienced higher insurance claim volumes in the second and third quarters of a fiscal year than in the first and fourth quarters of a fiscal year, as WSEs typically access their health care providers more often in the second and third quarters of a fiscal year, which has negatively impacted our insurance 

costs in these quarters. We have also experienced variability on a quarterly basis in the amount of our health and workers compensation insurance costs due to the number and severity of insurance claims being unpredictable. These historical trends may change, and other seasonal trends and variability may develop which would make it more difficult for us to manage our business. 

Our Co-Employment Model 

We operate under a co-employment model business model, under which employment-related responsibilities are contractually allocated between us and our clients, which affords us a close relationship with our clients and their WSEs. Each of our clients enters into a client service agreement with us that defines the suite of professional and insurance services and benefits to be provided by us, the fees payable to us, and the division of responsibilities between us and our client as co-employers. The division of responsibilities under our client service agreements is typically as follows: 

TriNet Responsibilities 

We assume responsibility for, and manage certain risks associated with: 

&#8226; 

remittance to WSEs of salaries, wages and certain other compensation, as reported and paid to us by the client, related tax reporting and remittance to tax authorities and processing of garnishment and wage deduction orders. Unlike a payroll service provider, we issue each WSE a payroll check drawn on our bank accounts; 

&#8226; 

maintenance of workers compensation insurance and workers compensation claims processing; 

&#8226; 

provision and administration of group health, welfare, and retirement benefits to WSEs, based on our clients&#8217; elections, under TriNet-sponsored insurance plans; 

&#8226; 

compliance with applicable law for employee benefits offered to WSEs; 

&#8226; 

processing of unemployment claims; and 

&#8226; 

provision of certain HR policies, including an employee handbook describing the co-employment relationship. 

Client Responsibilities 

Our clients are responsible for employment-related responsibilities that we do not assume, including: 

&#8226; 

day-to-day management of their worksites and WSEs; 

&#8226; 

compliance with laws associated with the classification of employees as exempt or non-exempt, such as overtime pay and minimum wage law compliance; 

&#8226; 

accurate and timely reporting to TriNet of compensation and deduction information, including information relating to hours worked, rates of pay, salaries, wages and certain other compensation; 

&#8226; 

accurate and timely reporting to TriNet of information relating to workplace injuries, employee hires and termination, and certain other information relevant to TriNet&#8217;s services; 

&#8226; 

provision and administration of any employee benefits not provided by TriNet (e.g., equity incentive plans); 

&#8226; 

compliance with all laws and regulations applicable to the client&#8217;s workplace and business, including work eligibility laws, laws relating to workplace safety or the environment, laws relating to family and medical leave, laws pertaining to employee organizing efforts and collective bargaining and employee termination notice requirements; 

&#8226; 

payment of TriNet invoices which include wages to WSEs and applicable employment taxes and service fees; and 

&#8226; 

all other matters for which TriNet does not assume responsibility under the client service agreement, such as intellectual property ownership and protection and liability for products produced and/or services provided. 

As a result of our co-employment relationship with each of our WSEs, we are liable for payment of salary, wages and certain other compensation to the WSEs as reported by the client and are responsible for providing specified employee benefits to such persons to the extent provided in each client service agreement and under federal and state law. In most instances, clients are required to remit payment prior to the applicable payroll date by wire transfer or automated clearinghouse transaction. Although we may become liable, as the employer for payroll purposes, to pay certain amounts for work previously performed, we are not obligated to continue to provide services to the client if payment has not been made. For the year ended December 31, 2015 , our bad debt expense relating to such obligations was approximately $2.0 million . 

We also assume responsibility for payment and liability for the withholding and remittance of federal and state income and employment taxes with respect to salaries, wages and certain other compensation paid to WSEs, although we reserve the right to seek recourse against our clients for any liabilities arising out of their conduct. Except to the extent federal legislation and applicable state law otherwise provide, the client may be held ultimately liable for those obligations if we fail to remit taxes and the bonding security provided by the Employer Services Assurance Corporation (ESAC) is not sufficient to satisfy the obligation. We also secure insurance in the event that we fail to meet these obligations. 

Our Technology Platform 

We provide our clients and WSEs with fundamental HR transactional capabilities, as well as a cloud-based system of record for all their HR transactions. Our online and mobile self-service tools allow our clients and WSEs 24/7 access to their core HR information. On our systems, clients can effectively manage employee hiring and termination, administer employee payroll, view real-time benefits data and create compensation reports. WSEs can also manage their own payroll information, request paid time off (PTO) and view approval status real-time, enroll in benefits, and view paystubs, PTO balances, and W-2s, among other things. We also offer human capital management software offerings, including talent management and development, applicant tracking, expense management, and performance management. These modules can be either bundled into the product offering or purchased as add-ons for certain of our verticals. We have also made significant investments to integrate our software offerings with those of certain third-party technology and benefits services providers to allow clients and WSEs to access a unified view of all of their pertinent HR information. 

By offering a proprietary, cloud-based HR system, our clients gain the efficiencies of an enterprise-level software solution without the significant cost of in-house installation or ongoing maintenance. Features include: 

&#8226; 

multi-tenant system enabling multiple clients and WSEs to share one version of our system while isolating each client&#8217;s and WSE&#8217;s data; 

&#8226; 

rule-based provisioning ensuring that all users are authenticated, authorized and validated before they can access our systems; 

&#8226; 

redundant processing centers to protect client data from loss; 

&#8226; 

integrated benefits and payroll processing for faster, more accurate data; and 

&#8226; 

flexible and extensible platform architecture. 

From 2013 &#32;through 2015 , we invested approximately $111.3 million &#32;in our technology systems. We plan to continue to invest to upgrade and improve our technology offerings, including enhancements of our solutions to address specific needs of clients in our key vertical markets, as we believe the continued improvement of our technology provides TriNet with the ability to drive operating efficiencies while improving our clients&#8217; experience. We will leverage our existing online technology offerings to build additional products and features, including a full-service mobile platform, standard APIs for selected third party offerings, improved client experience for key processes, and retirement of legacy software systems from acquisitions and migration of clients to the primary TriNet software system. 

Competition 

We face significant competition on a national and regional level from a number of companies purporting to deliver a range of bundled services that are generally similar to the services we provide. The National Association of Professional Employer Organizations, or NAPEO, estimates that there are between 780 &#32;and 980 &#32;such entities currently operating in the United States. We are one of only five PEOs accredited by the Employer Services Assurance Corporation that offers services in all 50 states and believe that we are one of the largest PEOs in the industry. Our competitors include large PEOs such as the TotalSource unit of Automatic Data Processing, Inc. and Insperity, Inc., as well as specialized and smaller PEOs and similar service providers. If and to the extent that we and other companies providing these services are successful in growing our businesses, we anticipate that future competitors will enter this industry. 

In addition to competition from other professional employer organizations, we also face significant competition in the form of companies serving their HR needs in both traditional and non-traditional manners. These forms of competition include: 

&#8226; 

HR and information systems departments and personnel of companies that perform their own administration of employee benefits, payroll and HR; 

&#8226; 

providers of certain endpoint HR services, including payroll, employee benefits and business process outsourcers with high-volume transaction and administrative capabilities, such as Automatic Data Processing, Inc., Paychex, Inc. and other third-party administrators; 

&#8226; 

employee benefit exchanges that provide benefits administration services over the Internet to companies that otherwise maintain their own employee benefit plans; and 

&#8226; 

insurance brokers who allow third party HR systems to integrate with their platform. 

We believe that our services are attractive to many SMBs in part because of the quality and breadth of our workers compensation, group health insurance and other employee benefits programs. We compete with insurance brokers and other providers of this coverage in this regard. 

We believe the principal competitive factors in our market include the following: 

&#8226; 

level of client satisfaction; 

&#8226; 

ease of client setup and on-boarding; 

&#8226; 

breadth and depth of benefit plans; 

&#8226; 

vertical market expertise; 

&#8226; 

total cost of service; 

&#8226; 

brand awareness and reputation; 

&#8226; 

ability to innovate and respond to client needs rapidly; 

&#8226; 

online and mobile functionality; and 

&#8226; 

subject matter expertise. 

We believe that we compete favorably on the basis of each of these factors. 

Sales and Marketing 

We sell our solutions primarily through our direct sales organization. We have aligned our sales organization by industry vertical with the goal of driving profitable market share in our targeted industries. This vertical approach deepens our network of relationships and gives us an understanding of the unique HR needs facing SMBs in those industries. As part of our vertical approach, we conduct industry-specific client marketing programs, including industry and geographic focus groups, to foster a sense of community through the sharing of best practices, while also collecting valuable information about the unique requirements of companies in particular industries. This knowledge then allows our sales team to work with our product development and client service teams to build bundled solutions of services that are tailored to the specific needs of clients in these industries. 

The number of sales representatives in the field has grown substantially in recent years, through both internal hiring and through onboarding sales representatives from acquired businesses, from 80 &#32;sales representatives as of December 31, 2011 &#32;to 481 &#32;sales representatives as of December 31, 2015 . In our direct sales organization, we recruit and seek to hire sales professionals who have experience in a specific industry vertical market, and with a background in selling business services such as accounting, HR or sales solutions. As of December 31, 2015 , we had approximately 50 &#32;regional field sales offices. 

Our sales team&#8217;s primary focus and goal is to win new accounts as opposed to mining our installed base of business for incremental revenue. In order to drive the most effective cost of acquisition for this new business, we continually fine-tune our lead generation and marketing efforts and our initiatives to attempt to drive higher productivity per sales representative. 

Our marketing, inside sales, lead generation, and lead incubation efforts support the success of our direct sales representatives. We employ a broad range of vertically focused awareness and demand-generation marketing programs, including digital and print advertising, e-mail, direct mail and social media. We have an internal public relations team that works with an external agency to promote relevant content to target media outlets. We sponsor and participate in associations and events around the country and utilize these forums to target specific vertical and geographic markets. We also generate 

sales opportunities, and deepen our relationships within key industry verticals, through marketing alliances and other indirect channels, such as existing clients, certified public accountants, venture capital firms, incubators, insurance brokers, and other vertical market industry associations. 

We drive sales representative productivity in a number of ways, including by improving the quality of leads generated by our marketing and inside sales teams, and through the development of a sales operations team that offloads sales process work. We believe our focus on specific verticals, and the expertise gained through this focus, makes our sales representatives increasingly relevant to their target audience. Recently, we have expanded our focus on various channel relationships and alliances that drive warm leads to our direct sales force. Finally, our sales representatives benefit from building strong relationships with prospects during the sales process, resulting in referrals to new prospects as well as direct support through providing reference calls in regards to our products and services. 

Strategic Acquisitions 

Historically, we have pursued strategic acquisitions to both expand our product capabilities and supplement our growth across geographies and certain industry verticals. Our acquisition targets have included other bundled HR providers as well as technology companies or technology product offerings to supplement or enhance our existing HR solutions. We intend to continue to pursue strategic acquisitions that will enable us to add new clients and WSEs, expand our presence in certain geographies or industry verticals and offer our clients and WSEs more comprehensive and attractive products and services. 

Clients 

We approach the market with a vertical, or industry-based, focus. Our clients span a variety of industries, including technology, life sciences, not-for-profit, professional services, financial services, property management, retail, manufacturing and hospitality. We have grown our number of clients from approximately 4,500 &#32;as of December 31, 2011 &#32;to over 12,700 &#32;clients as of December 31, 2015 . We have also grown our number of WSEs from approximately 83,000 &#32;as of December 31, 2011 &#32;to approximately 324,000 &#32;in all 50 &#32;states, the District of Columbia and Canada as of December 31, 2015 . 

U.S. Legal and Regulatory Environment 

The complex environment created by the numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to labor and employment matters, benefit plans and income and employment taxes creates a significant demand for our HR solutions. Many of those laws and regulations also significantly affect how we are able to provide our HR solutions to our clients. Many of these laws, such as ERISA, were enacted before the development of the co-employment relationship and other non-traditional employment relationships, such as temporary employment and other employment-related outsourcing arrangements. Therefore, many of these laws do not specifically address the obligations and responsibilities of professional employer organizations utilizing a co-employment model like ours, creating uncertainty about their interpretation and application to our industry. In addition, other federal and state laws and regulations, such as the Affordable Care Act, are relatively new and administrative agencies and federal and state courts have only begun to interpret and apply these regulations to our industry. The development of additional regulations and interpretation of these laws and regulations can be expected over time. 

We believe that our operations are currently in compliance in all material respects with applicable federal and state statutes and regulations. The sections discussed below summarize what we believe are the most important regulatory aspects of our business: 

Employer Status 

In order for clients and WSEs to receive the full benefit of our employee benefit plan offerings, it is important that we constitute the &#8220;employer&#8221; of the WSEs under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or the Code, and ERISA. The definitions of &#8220;employer&#8221; under both the Code and ERISA are not clear and are defined in part by complex multi-factor tests under common law. We believe that we qualify as an &#8220;employer&#8221; of our WSEs in the United States under both the Code and ERISA, and we implement processes to protect and preserve this status. With Congressional passage of the Small Business Efficiency Act in December 2014, the Code clarified the employer status of professional employer organizations, or PEOs, for federal tax purposes, for those PEOs who voluntarily become certified under this law. The IRS is expected to begin accepting applications for certification in July 2016 and we currently intend to apply for certification. 

Tax Qualified Plans. In order to qualify for favorable tax treatment under the Code, certain employee benefit plans such as 401(k) retirement plans and cafeteria plans must be established and maintained by an employer for the exclusive benefit of its employees. Generally, an entity is an &#8220;employer&#8221; of certain workers for federal employment tax purposes if an employment 

relationship exists between the entity and the workers under the common law test of employment. The common law test of employment, as applied by the IRS, involves an examination of many factors to ascertain whether an employment relationship exists between a worker and a purported employer. Our 401(k) retirement plans are operated pursuant to guidance provided by the IRS for the operation of defined contribution plans maintained by co-employers that benefit WSEs. This guidance provides qualification standards for such plans. All of our 401(k) retirement plans have received favorable determination letters from the IRS confirming the qualified status of the plans. The IRS 401(k) guidance and qualification requirements are not applicable to the operation of our cafeteria plans. 

ERISA Regulation. &#32;Employee pension and welfare benefit plans are also governed by ERISA. ERISA defines an &#8220;employer&#8221; as &#8220;any person acting directly as an employer, or indirectly in the interest of an employer, in relation to an employee benefit plan.&#8221; ERISA defines the term &#8220;employee&#8221; as &#8220;any individual employed by an employer.&#8221; The courts have held that the common law test of employment must be applied to determine whether an individual is an employee or an independent contractor under ERISA. However, in applying that test, control and supervision are less important for ERISA purposes when determining whether an employer has assumed responsibility for providing employee benefits. A definitive judicial interpretation of &#8220;employer&#8221; in the context of a professional employer organization has not been established, and the U.S. Department of Labor has issued guidance that certain entities in the HR outsourcing industry do not qualify as common law employers for ERISA purposes. If we were found not to be an employer for ERISA purposes, it could affect the manner in which we are able to provide employee benefits to our WSEs. 

Affordable Care Act 

The Affordable Care Act, or the Act, implemented sweeping health care reforms with staggered effective dates from 2010 through 2020, and many provisions in the Act require the issuance of additional guidance from the U.S. Department of Labor, the IRS, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the states. The Act imposed a number of new mandates on the coverage required to be provided under health insurance plans beginning in 2010, with additional requirements staged in subsequent years. We believe that our group health insurance plans comply with existing mandates. However, the guidance issued to date by the IRS and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has not addressed, or in some instances is unclear, as to its application in the co-employer context. As a result, we are not yet able to predict all of the impacts to our business, and to our clients, resulting from the Act. 

State Unemployment Taxes 

State unemployment taxes are based on taxable wages and tax rates assigned by each state. The tax rates vary by state and are determined, in part, based on our prior years&#8217; compensation and unemployment claims experience in each state. Certain rates are also determined, in part, by each client&#8217;s own compensation and unemployment claims experience. In addition, states have the ability under law to increase unemployment tax rates, including retroactively, to cover deficiencies in the unemployment tax funds. Due to the adverse U.S. economic conditions during recent years and the associated reductions in employment levels, the state unemployment tax funds have experienced a significant increase in the number of unemployment claims. Accordingly, state unemployment tax rates increased substantially over the past few years. Employers in certain states are also experiencing higher federal unemployment tax rates as a result of certain states not repaying their unemployment loans from the federal government in a timely manner. We have taken steps to mitigate the risk of fluctuations in state and federal unemployment tax rates, including reporting and remitting unemployment insurance taxes or contributions at the client level and/or under the client&#8217;s own account number in approximately 40 states, and we will continue to evaluate such reporting relationships in the future. 

State Regulation of Co-Employers 

Forty-two states have adopted provisions for licensing, registration, certification or recognition of co-employers, and others are considering such regulation. Such laws vary from state to state but generally provide for monitoring or ensuring the fiscal responsibility of professional employer organizations, and in some cases codify and clarify the co-employment relationship for unemployment, workers compensation and other purposes under state law. We believe we are in compliance in all material respects with the requirements in all 42 states. Regardless of whether a state has licensing, registration or certification requirements for co-employers, we must comply with a number of other state and local regulations that could impact our operations, such as state and local taxes, licensing and business regulations. 

Intellectual Property 

Our success depends in part on intellectual property rights to the services that we develop. We rely on a combination of contractual rights, including non-disclosure agreements, trade secrets, copyrights and trademarks, to establish and protect our 

intellectual property rights in our names, services, methodologies and related technologies. If we lose intellectual property protection or the ability to secure intellectual property protection on any of our names, confidential information or technology, this could harm our business. Our intellectual property rights may not prevent competitors from independently developing services and methodologies similar to ours, and the steps we take might be inadequate to deter infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property by competitors, former employees or other third parties, any of which could harm our business. We currently have one pending U.S. patent application covering our technology. We own registered trademarks in the United States, Canada and the European Union that have various expiration dates unless renewed through customary processes. Our trademark registrations may be unenforceable or ineffective in protecting our trademarks. Our trademarks may be unenforceable in countries outside of the United States, which may adversely affect our ability to build our brand outside of the United States. 

Although we believe that our conduct of our business does not infringe on the intellectual property rights of others, third parties may nevertheless assert infringement claims against us in the future. We may be required to modify our products, services, internal systems or technologies, or obtain a license to permit our continued use of those rights. We may be unable to do so in a timely manner, or upon reasonable terms and conditions, which could harm our business. In addition, future litigation over these matters could result in substantial costs and resource diversion. Adverse determinations in any litigation or proceedings of this type could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties and could prevent us from using some of our services, internal systems or technologies.
