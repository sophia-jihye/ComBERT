 Item 1. Business. &#160;

Overview 

&#160;

Sino-Global Shipping America, Ltd. (&#8220;Sino&#8221;), a Virginia corporation, was founded in the United States (&#8220;US&#8221;) in 2001. Sino is a non-asset based global shipping and freight logistic integrated solution provider. Sino provides tailored solutions and value added services to its customers to drive effectiveness and control in related aspects throughout the entire shipping and freight logistic chain. Our current service offerings consist of shipping agency services and inland transportation management services .We temporarily suspended our ship management services from the beginning of the fiscal year 2016, primarily due to changes in market condition. We also temporarily suspended our shipping and chartering services primarily as a result of the termination of vessel acquisition in December 2015.

&#160;

The Company conducts its business primarily through its wholly-owned subsidiaries in the U.S., China (including Hong Kong), Australia and Canada. Currently, a significant portion of our business is generated from the clients located in the People&#8217;s Republic of China (the &#8220;PRC&#8221;), and our operations are currently primarily conducted in the PRC.

&#160;

Company Structure and Function 

&#160;

The Company conducts its business primarily through its wholly-owned subsidiaries in China (including Hong Kong), Australia, Canada, and U.S. (New York and Los Angeles).

&#160;

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s subsidiary in China, Trans Pacific Shipping Limited (&#8220;Trans Pacific Beijing&#8221;), a wholly owned foreign enterprise, invested in one 90%-owned subsidiary, Trans Pacific Logistics Shanghai Limited (&#8220;Trans Pacific Shanghai&#8221;. Trans Pacific Beijing and Trans Pacific Shanghai are referred to collectively as &#8220;Trans Pacific&#8221;). As PRC laws and regulations restrict foreign ownership of local shipping agency service businesses, the Company provided its shipping agency services in the PRC through Sino-Global Shipping Agency Ltd. (&#8220;Sino-China&#8221; or &#8220;VIE&#8221;), a Chinese legal entity, which holds the licenses and permits necessary to operate local shipping agency services in the PRC. Trans Pacific Beijing and Sino-China do not have a parent-subsidiary relationship. Trans Pacific Beijing has contractual arrangements with Sino-China and its shareholders that enable the Company to substantially control Sino-China. Through Sino-China, the Company was able to provide local shipping agency services in all commercial ports in the PRC. In light of the Company&#8217;s decision not to pursue the local shipping agency business, the Company temporarily suspended its shipping agency services through its VIE and has not undertaken any business through or with Sino-China since June 2014. Nevertheless, the Company continues to maintain its contractual relationship with the VIE because Sino-China is one of the committee members of China Association of Shipping Agencies &#38; Non-Vessel-Operating Common Carriers (&#8220;CASA&#8221;). CASA was approved to form by China Ministry of Communications. Sino-China is also our only entity that is qualified to do shipping agency business in China. We keep the VIE to prepare ourselves for the market to turn around.

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s shipping agency business was operated by its subsidiaries in Hong Kong and China. The Company&#8217;s ship management services were originally operated by its subsidiary in Hong Kong. Due to changes in market condition, the Company temporarily suspended the ship management services from fiscal year 2016. The Company&#8217;s shipping and chartering services are operated by its offices in the US and subsidiaries in Hong Kong. The Company also temporarily suspended its shipping and chartering services primarily as a result of the termination of vessel acquisition in December 2015. Currently, the Company&#8217;s inland transportation management services are operated by its subsidiaries in China (including Hong Kong) and the US.

&#160; 

Corporate History and Our Business 

&#160;

Since our inception in 2001 and through our fiscal year ended June 30, 2013, our sole business was providing shipping agency services. In general, we provide two types of shipping agency services, loading/discharging services and protective agency services, in which we act as a general agent to provide value added solutions to our customers. For loading/discharging agency services, we receive the total payment from our customers and pay the port charges on behalf of our customers. For protective agency services, we charge a fixed amount as agent fee while customers are responsible for the payment of port costs and expenses. Under these circumstances, we generally require payments in advance from customers and bill the balances within 30 days after the transactions are completed. We believe the most significant factors that directly or indirectly affect our shipping agency service revenues are:

&#160;

&#183; the number of ship-times to which we provide port loading/discharging services; &#183; the size and types of ships we serve; &#183; the type of services we provide; &#183; the rate of service fees we charge; &#183; the number of ports at which we provide services; and &#183; the number of customers we serve. &#160;

While we were able to consistently generate net revenues from shipping agency business, this business does not become profitable largely due to the rising operating costs associated with doing business in China. In light of consecutive years of operating losses and concerns raised by the US regulators over our VIE structure, the Company decided to reorganize its business structure in fiscal year 2013. Commencing in the later part of fiscal year 2013 and continuing in fiscal year 2014, we took various actions to restructure our business with the goal of achieving a certain level of profitability. As a result of these business reorganization efforts, we optimized our cost structure, reduced our dependency on shipping agency business, and shifted our shipping agency operation from our VIE to our wholly-owned subsidiaries in China including Hong Kong.

&#160;

In June 2013, the Company executed a 5-year global logistic service agreement with TEWOO Chemical &#38; Light Industry Zhiyuan Trade Co., Ltd, which is controlled by Tianjin Zhi Yuan Investment Group Co., Ltd (&#8220;Zhiyuan&#8221;). Zhiyuan is controlled by Mr. Zhong Zhang, who purchased 1,800,000 shares of our common stock for approximately $3 million in April 2013 as approved by our Board of Directors and shareholders, which made Mr. Zhang our largest shareholder. Leveraging our business relationship with Zhiyuan, we expanded our service offerings to include shipping and chartering services and inland transportation management services to diversify our business. Leveraging our in-depth knowledge and extensive resources of shipping industry, inland transportation management services are our tailored value-added solution developed for Zhiyuan to prevent high-priced bulk from damage or loss during its inland transportation from warehouses to factories. Given the industry norm of 12% of loss rate during transportation, our integrated inland transportation solution significantly reduced the bulk losses and effectively addressed the issues in freight logistic chain. Furthermore, after we have conducted an effective trial for Zhiyuan to reduce their bulk losses at end of September 2014, Tengda Northwest Ferroalloy Co., Ltd. (&#8220;Tengda Northwest&#8221;) signed a contract with us to mitigate their bulk losses through our inland transportation management services. 

&#160;

In May 2014, the Company signed a strategic cooperation agreement with Qingdao Zhenghe Shipping Group Limited (&#8220;Zhenghe&#8221;), one of the largest shipping and transportation companies in China, to jointly explore mutually beneficial business development opportunities. In June 2014, Mr. Deming Wang, a major owner of Zhenghe, acquired 200,000 shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock. In August 2014, the Company executed an agreement to acquire all of the equity of Longhe Ship Management (Hong Kong) Co., Limited (&#8220;LSM&#8221;) from Mr. Wang, to further broaden our scope of services and expertise in the ship management business. Due to market condition and high operating costs associated with this business line, the Company decided to temporarily suspend the ship management business starting from the fiscal year 2016.

&#160;

On April 10, 2015, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Rong Yao International Shipping Limited, a Hong Kong company (the &#8220;Vessel Seller&#8221;), pursuant to which the Company agreed to acquire, subject to a number of closing conditions, &#8220;Rong Zhou,&#8221; an 8,818 gross tonnage oil/chemical transportation tanker (the &#8220;Vessel&#8221;) from the Vessel Seller; and in connection therewith, the Company issued to the Vessel Seller 1.2 million shares of its restricted common stock representing $2,220,000 of the $10.5 million purchase price for the Vessel. 9 On December 7, 2015, the Company and the Vessel Seller entered into a supplemental agreement to terminate the proposed Vessel acquisition.

&#160;

The Company received the cash of $330,000 from the Vessel Seller in December 2015 in connection with the termination. The 1.2 million shares was returned to the Company on February 12, 2016 and was cancelled thereafter.

&#160;

In January 2016, the Company formed a new subsidiary, Sino-Global Shipping LA Inc. (&#8220;Sino LA&#8221;), for the purpose of expanding its business to provide import security filing services with U.S Customs and Department of Homeland Security, on behalf of importers who ship goods into the U.S. and also providing inland transportation services to these importers in the U.S. On April 18, 2016, Sino LA signed a Memorandum of Understanding (&#8220;MOU&#8221;) with Yaxin International Co., Ltd.(&#8220;Yaxin&#8221;), pursuant to which Sino LA will provide logistics services to Yaxin, who ships goods via containers into the U.S. and places them on Amazon.com . The services include cargo forwarding, customs filing and declaration, trucking and others.

&#160;

&#160; 5 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

In May 2016, the Company entered into a strategic partnership with Shandong Hi-speed TEU Logistics Co., LTD. (&#34;Shandong Hi-speed TEU&#34;), which belongs to one of China's largest state-owned enterprises, Shandong Hi-Speed Group Co., Ltd., to jointly establish a platform for coordinated transport between China and North America. The Company and Shandong Hi-speed TEU intend to cooperate in creating a standardized network that will unite carriers of the twenty-foot equivalent units or TEUs in China via sea and rail and coordinate with parties in North America and Australia. The companies will serve both upstream and downstream customers through the platform, establish a door-to-door logistics and provide supply chain service.

&#160;

Our Strategy 

&#160;

Our strategy is to:

&#160;

&#183; Provide better solutions for issues and challenges faced by the entire shipping and freight logistic chain to better serve our customers and explore additional growth avenues. &#183; Diversify our current service offerings organically or through acquisitions and/or strategic alliance; continue to grow our business in the US market; &#183; Continue to streamline our business practice, optimize our cost structure and improve our operating efficiency through effective planning, budgeting, execution and cost control; &#183; Continue to reduce our dependency on our legacy business and few key customers; and &#183; Continue to monetize our relationships with our strategic partners and leverage their support and our innovation to expand our business. &#160;

Our Management Team 

&#160; 

We believe we have a strong and experienced management team including our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, Mr. Lei Cao; our Acting Chief Financial Officer, Ms. Tuo Pan; our Chief Operating Officer, Mr. Zhikang Huang; and our Chief Technical Officer, Mr. Africa Li, who, together as a team, have many years of experience, extensive business connections in the shipping industry in China, substantial experience in SEC reporting and compliance, business reorganization, mergers and acquisitions, accounting, risk management and operating both public and private companies.

&#160; 

Business Segments 

&#160; 

As of June 30, 2016, Sino-Global delivers shipping agency services and inland transportation management services to customers.

&#160;

Historically, the Company was in the business of solely providing shipping agency services. In the fiscal year of 2014, by leveraging the support of Sino-Global&#8217;s largest shareholder, Mr. Zhang and the company he controls, Zhiyuan Investment Group, the Company expanded its service platform to include shipping and chartering services during the quarter ended September 30, 2013 and inland transportation management services during the quarter ended December 31, 2013. We temporarily suspended shipping and chartering services as a result of the termination of the vessel acquisition in December 2015. With the acquisition of LSM in 2014, we added ship management services to our service platform but we temporarily suspended it in 2016 primarily due to market conditions. With the establishment of Sino-LA, we added cargo forwarding services to our service platform in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year 2016, which is included in our inland transportation business line.

&#160;

Our Goals and Strategic Plan 

&#160;

By leveraging our fine reputation, extensive business relationships, technical ability and in-depth knowledge of the shipping industry, our goal is to further strengthen our position as a leading global logistic solution provider who offers innovative resolutions to better address complex issues in different aspects in the entire shipping and freight logistic chain.

&#160;

We historically focused our business on providing our customers with customized shipping agency services. In the past, our business came predominately from our strong business relationships with our key strategic partners in China. To reduce our dependency on a single business line, we have leveraged, and will continue to leverage, our business relationships with strategic partners to introduce new service offerings to the market and to diversify our business. In light of the slowdown of the Chinese economy and its negative impact on the shipping business across Pacific Ocean, our strategic plan for the next 5 years is to continue to diversify our service mix and actively seek new growth opportunities to expand our business footprint in the U.S. market to reduce our dependency on the revenue generated from China. For decades, the shipping industry has been operated under traditional business models without many meaningful changes. Today, technological innovation has already played a big role in changing every conventional industry. We believe internet is going to be a big part of future logistic chain services and a transformative era in shipping and freight logistic business is coming. As an innovative solution provider, we plan to apply our technical ability and industry expertise and to utilize cutting-edge information technology in the conventional shipping business to better connect supply and demand and to develop seamless linkages in logistic chains.

&#160;

&#160; 6 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Given recent changes in the market condition in China and the increases in labor costs, our operating costs increased significantly in recent years and we incurred operating loss for the year ended June 30, 2016. To address our rising operating costs, our plan is to continue to optimize our service mix and cost structure by streamlining our operations, adding more high-margin services and closing out inefficient, unprofitable or non-operating business.

&#160;

As a result of our continued restructuring efforts, we implemented two new services of shipping and chartering services and inland transportation management services to our business lines in fiscal year 2014. Although we temporarily suspended our shipping and chartering services in December 2015 due to the termination of vessel acquisition, and we also temporarily suspended our ship management services segment since fiscal year 2016, the inland transportation management service segment diversified our business platform and enhanced our profit margin to a certain extent. As shown in the table below, the restructuring efforts have reduced our dependency on the shipping agency business and improved our overall gross margin from 34.6% as of June 30, 2014 to 48.9% as of June 30, 2016 as we changed our service mix and focused on delivering higher-margin services as mentioned above.

Our Customers 

&#160;

Since our initial public offering, our revenues come primarily from key customers. In light of our strategic relationship with Zhiyuan Investment Group that began with the signing of a 5-year global logistic service agreement in June 2013, we expanded our business platform to include additional service offerings. We started to provide inland transportation management services to a third-party customer, Tengda Northwest Ferroalloy Co., Ltd. (&#8220;Tengda&#8221;), since the quarter ended September 2014. Revenue from Tengda amounted to approximately $1.9 million and $2.3 million, respectively, or approximately 27% and 20% of total revenues for fiscal year 2016 and 2015, respectively. As we continue to diversify our service platform, our goal is to reduce our dependency on the key customers. For the year ended June 30, 2016, two customers accounted for approximately 31% and 27% of the Company&#8217;s revenues, respectively. For the year ended June 30, 2015, two customers accounted for approximately 23% and 20% of the Company&#8217;s revenues, respectively.

&#160;

Our Suppliers 

&#160; 

Our operations consist of working directly with our customers to understand in detail their needs and expectations and then managing local suppliers to ensure that our customers&#8217; needs are met. Our significant suppliers include Monson Agencies Australia Pty Ltd, Baoshan Iron and Steel Co., Ltd. and Shanghai Gangcheng Dangerous Goods Logistics Co., Ltd. For the year ended June 30, 2016, three suppliers accounted for 27%, 15% and 10% of the total cost of revenues, respectively. For the year ended June 30, 2015, two suppliers accounted for 51% and 14% of the total cost of revenues, respectively.

&#160;

Our Strengths 

&#160;

We believe that the following strengths differentiate us from our competitors:

&#160;

&#183; Proven industry experience and problem-solving reputation . We are a non-asset based global shipping and freight logistic solution provider. Unlike a traditional shipping agent, we provide tailored solutions and value added services to our customers to drive effectiveness and control in related aspects throughout the entire shipping and freight logistic chain. We believe that our years&#8217; of successful track record of applying integrated solutions to complex issues in the global shipping logistic business gives us a competitive advantage in attracting large clients and helps us maintain strong long term business relationship with them. &#160;

&#183; Strong leadership and competent professional team . Our CEO is an industry veteran with more than thirty years of extensive industry experiences including ten years&#8217; working for COSCO, one of the largest shipping companies in the world. Most of our employees have marine business working experience, and many of our managers/chief operators served in other large Chinese shipping companies prior to joining us. With these professionals and experienced staff, we believe that we can provide best services to our customers at competitive prices. &#160;

&#160; 7 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; Extensive network and positive industry recognition. Doing business in China often requires a strong business network and support of key strategic partners. The Company served as one of the executive directors of China Association of Shipping Agencies &#38; Non-Vessel-Operating Common Carriers (CASA), the authoritative industry association in China. We are the only non-state-owned enterprise represented on the CASA board guiding the development of the industry. Our good reputation and industry recognition enables us to maintain strong relationships with our business partners and have extensive network of contacts throughout the industry, which helps us gain necessary support to execute our business plans. &#160;

&#183; Lean organization and flexible business model. Although we are a small business with limited resources, we have a cohesive and effective organization structure with the idea to maximize customer value while minimizing waste. Our unique flexible business model allows us to quickly respond to changing market demand and offer our customers innovative problem solving solutions, quality customer service, and competitive prices to achieve greater market acceptance and gain additional market share. &#160;

&#183; U.S.-registered and NASDAQ-listed public company. We believe our status as a US corporation gives us more credibility among existing and potential customers, suppliers, and other business partners than we might have as a privately owned company would have in our industry. Our ability to raise capital through the capital market or use our common stock as &#8220;currency&#8221; to facility potential merger and acquisition transactions can also help us carry out or accelerate our growth strategies. &#160; 

Our Opportunities 

&#160; 

For more than thirty years, the shipping and freight logistic industry has been operated under traditional business models without many meaningful changes. Many of these business practices are inefficient and problematic, therefore, maintaining an innovative mindset is critical to achieving continuous business success and growth. We are a value-added logistic solution provider with successful past performance and individuals that have been in the industry for a long time. Instead of playing the traditional logistic broker role, we focus on providing technology solutions and innovative leading-edge services to bridge the asset-based world with the digital world. We shape our industry practice and profit model by analyzing wider developments both in the global markets and the technology industry so we can address unique problems that are currently pervasive across the shipping and freight logistic industry.

&#160;

We believe we can capture the business opportunity and grow our business organically or through acquisitions or strategic alliance by:

&#160;

&#183; Continuing to streamline our business operations and improve our operating efficiency through effective planning, budgeting, execution and cost control; &#183; Restructuring our business to focus on providing innovative technology based solution to our customers to promote our sustainable business growth; &#183; Developing new service lines along the shipping and freight logistic industry value chain, and leveraging our relationships with COSCO, Zhiyuan Investment Group and other potential strategic business partners to expand our global business footprint. &#160;

Our Challenges 

&#160;

We are facing significant challenges when executing our strategy, including:

&#160;

&#183; Our limited operating history in general and our recent years&#8217; uncertain profitability could affect our ability to grow our business and maintain profitability in the long-run; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#183; Given the complexity and length of restructuring our business, we face the challenges to generate sufficient cash from our current limited business activities to support our daily operations during the transition; &#160;

&#183; Limited funding support may restrict our ability from expanding professional team and research and development of new solutions to solve the critical issues in today&#8217;s shipping logistic industry; &#160;

&#183; We may not have or not be able to get the necessary funds to continue to expand our service offerings and market our services successfully; &#160;

&#183; From time to time, we may have difficulty carrying out services effectively and in a profitable way due to the cyclicality nature of the shipping industry, which could lead to prolonged period of sluggish demand for our services; &#160;

&#160; 8 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; Our ability to respond to competitive pressures as we are facing increasing pressure on our growth and margins as a result of increasing competition from our competitors; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#183; Our ability to respond to competitive pressures as we are facing increasing pressure on our growth and margins as a result of increasing competition from our competitors; &#160;

&#183; Our ability to continue to maintain and further monetize our relationship with our strategic partners; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#183; Our ability to gain further expertise and to serve new customers in new service areas; &#160;

&#183; Our ability to respond promptly to a changing regulatory environment, macroeconomic conditions, industry trends, and competitive landscape; and &#160;

&#183; Developing a winning business model takes time and a new business models may not be recognized by market immediately. As a publicly traded company, management may be forced to fulfill near-term performance goals that may not be consistent with the Company&#8217;s long-term vision. &#160; 

Our Competition 

&#160;

The market segments that we serve do not have high entry barriers. There are many companies ranging from small to large in China that provide shipping and freight related logistic services. At present, the state-owned companies still dominate the industry and generate majority of the revenues in the industry. These companies have greater service capabilities, customer base and financial, marketing, network and human resources than we do. Most of them concentrate their business on shipping agency services to meet general market demand. However, we focus on providing tailored solutions and value added services to selected high-profile customers to drive effectiveness and control in related aspects throughout the entire shipping and freight logistic chain. As a boutique company that provides specialized services with limited resources and history, we face intense competition in the particular market segments that we serve. Our primary competitors are LBH Group and Gulf Agency Company Ltd. Our ability to be successful in our industry depends on our deep understanding of the complexity of industry issues and challenges and our technical ability to develop best solutions to respond to the identified issues and provide effective problem solving strategies to our targeted customers to achieve the fastest and most cost-effective outcomes. Our value added services and innovative approaches are highly recognized by our customers, which helps us to gain additional market share and compete effectively with the companies that may be better capitalized than we are or may provide services we do not or cannot provide to our customers.

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160;

As of the date of this report, we have 27 employees, 16 of whom are based in China. Of the total, four are in management, thirteen are in operations, seven are in finance and accounting and three are in administration and technical support. We believe that our relationship with our employees is good. We have never had a work stoppage, and our employees are not subject to a collective bargaining agreement.

&#160;

Recent Development 

&#160;

In July 2016, the Company signed a Strategic Cooperation Agreement (the &#34;Agreement&#34;) with COSCO Logistics (Americas) Inc. (&#34;COSCO Logistics&#34;), which belongs to China's largest integrated shipping company, China COSCO Holdings Company Ltd. Pursuant to the Agreement, both parties will mutually provide logistics services between China and the United States and develop shipping customers as an end-to-end global logistics service. The Company expects to work with COSCO Logistics to provide inland transportation services in the US for shipments to and from China. According to the Agreement, the two companies will also assess locations in the US to potentially establish warehouse / distribution facilities in the coming months and share pricing information for short-haul trucking services across selected regions of the country. Since Sino-LA was established in January 2016, the Company has been working to integrate inland trucking services including cargo forwarding, trucking and customs declaration and filing services to both coasts in the US. The Company is seeking additional customer relationships and believes this partnership will broaden its potential customer base.

&#160;

In August 2016, the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors authorized management to move forward with the development of a mobile application that will provide a full-service logistics platform between the US and China for short-haul trucking services in the US. The decision follows an extensive review by the Company's management team and Board in identifying Sino&#8217;s key competitive advantages as an expert in global logistics between the US and China, and then leveraging that experience to both address the needs of its customer base and provide solutions to current issues affecting logistics and supply chain. The Company completed a market analysis and feasibility study related to building a mobile based logistics application for short-haul trucking in US ports to better manage the over 25 million containers, or TEU moving between China and the US each year.
