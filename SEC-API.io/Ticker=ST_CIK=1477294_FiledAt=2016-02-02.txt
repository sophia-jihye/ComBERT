 ITEM 1. 

BUSINESS 

The Company 

The reporting company is Sensata Technologies Holding N.V. (&#8220;Sensata Technologies Holding&#8221;) and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, collectively referred to as the &#8220;Company,&#8221; &#8220;Sensata,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;our,&#8221; and &#8220;us.&#8221; 

Sensata Technologies Holding is incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands and conducts its operations through subsidiary companies that operate business and product development centers primarily in the United States (the "U.S."), the Netherlands, Belgium, China, Germany, Japan, South Korea, and the United Kingdom (the "U.K."); and manufacturing operations primarily in China, Malaysia, Mexico, the Dominican Republic, Bulgaria, Poland, France, Brazil, Germany, the U.K., and the U.S. We organize our operations into two businesses, Performance Sensing (formerly referred to as "Sensors") and Sensing Solutions (formerly referred to as "Controls"). 

Overview 

Sensata, a global industrial technology company, engages in the development, manufacture, and sale of sensors and controls. We produce a wide range of sensors and controls for applications such as thermal circuit breakers in aircraft, pressure sensors in automotive systems, and bimetal current and temperature control devices in electric motors. 

Our sensors are customized devices that translate a physical phenomenon, such as pressure or position, into electronic signals that microprocessors or computer-based control systems can act upon. Our controls are customized devices embedded within systems to protect them from excessive heat or current. Underlying these sensors and controls are core technology platforms&#8212;thermal and magnetic-hydraulic circuit protection, micro electromechanical systems, ceramic capacitance, and monosilicon strain gage&#8212;that we leverage across multiple products and applications, enabling us to optimize our research, development, and engineering investments and achieve economies of scale. 

Our primary products include low-, medium-, and high-pressure sensors, temperature sensors, speed sensors, position sensors, motor protectors, and thermal and magnetic-hydraulic circuit breakers and switches. We develop customized, innovative solutions for specific customer requirements or applications across a variety of end-markets, including automotive, heavy vehicle on- and off-road ("HVOR"), appliance, heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (&#8220;HVAC&#8221;), industrial, aerospace, data/telecom, semiconductor, and mobile power, among others. We have long-standing relationships with a geographically diverse base of leading global original equipment manufacturers (&#8220;OEMs&#8221;) and other multinational companies. 

We develop products that address increasingly complex engineering requirements by investing substantially in research, development, and application engineering. By locating our global engineering team in close proximity to key customers in regional business centers, we are exposed to many development opportunities at an early stage and work closely with our customers to deliver solutions that meet their needs. As a result of the long development lead times and embedded nature of our products, we collaborate closely with our customers throughout the design and development phase of their products. Systems development by our customers typically requires significant multi-year investment for certification and qualification, which are often government or customer mandated. We believe the capital commitment and time required for this process significantly increases the switching costs once a customer has designed and installed a particular sensor or control into a system. 

We use a broad range of manufactured components, subassemblies, and raw materials in the manufacture of our products, including silver, gold, platinum, palladium, copper, aluminum, nickel, zinc, and resins. Certain of our Performance Sensing product lines use magnets containing rare earth metals, of which a large majority of the world's production is in China. A reduction in the export of rare earth materials from China could limit the worldwide supply of these rare earth materials, significantly increasing the price of magnets, which could materially impact our Performance Sensing business. 

We are a global business, with significant operations around the world. As of December 31, 2015, 36% , 37% , and 27% &#32;of our fixed assets were located in the Americas, Asia, and Europe, respectively. We have a diverse revenue mix by geography, customer, and end-market. We generated 41% , 26% , and 33% &#32;of our net revenue in the Americas, Asia, and Europe, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2015 . Our largest customer accounted for approximately 9% &#32;of our net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 . Our net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 &#32;was derived from the following end-markets: 27.4% &#32;from European automotive, 18.5% &#32;from Asia and rest of world automotive, 21.5% &#32;from North American automotive, 5.8% &#32;from appliance and HVAC, 12.3% &#32;from HVOR, 6.5% &#32;from industrial, and 8.0% &#32;from all other end-markets. Within many of our end-markets, we are a significant supplier to multiple OEMs, reducing our exposure to fluctuations in market share within individual end-markets.

Acquisition History 

We can trace our origins back to entities that have been engaged in the sensors and controls business since 1916. We operated as a part of Texas Instruments Incorporated ("TI") from 1959 until April 27, 2006, when Sensata Technologies B.V. ("STBV"), an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Sensata Technologies Holding, completed the carve-out and acquisition of the Sensors &#38; Controls business from TI (the "2006 Acquisition"), which was effected through a number of STBV's subsidiaries that collectively purchased the assets and assumed the liabilities being transferred. 

Between the 2006 Acquisition and December 31, 2013, we completed the following significant acquisitions: 

&#8226; First Technology Automotive and Special Products (2006); 

&#8226; Airpax Holdings, Inc. (2007); 

&#8226; Automotive on Board sensors business of Honeywell International Inc. (2011); and 

&#8226; Sensor-NITE Group Companies (2011). 

On January 2, 2014, we acquired Wabash Worldwide Holding Corp. ("Wabash") for an aggregate purchase price of $59.6 million . Wabash develops, manufactures, and sells a broad range of custom-designed sensors and has operations in the U.S., Mexico, and the U.K. We acquired Wabash in order to complement our existing magnetic speed and position sensor product portfolio and to provide new capabilities in throttle position and transmission range sensing, while enabling additional entry points into the HVOR end-market. Wabash has been integrated into our Performance Sensing segment. 

On May 29, 2014, we acquired Magnum Energy Incorporated ("Magnum") for an aggregate purchase price of $60.6 million . Magnum is a supplier of pure sine, low-frequency inverters and inverter/chargers based in Everett, Washington. Magnum products are used in recreational vehicles and the solar/off-grid applications market. We acquired Magnum to complement our existing inverter business. Magnum has been integrated into our Sensing Solutions segment. 

On August 4, 2014, we acquired CoActive US Holdings, Inc., the direct or indirect parent of companies comprising the DeltaTech Controls business ("DeltaTech") for an aggregate purchase price of $177.8 million . DeltaTech is a manufacturer of customized electronic operator controls based on magnetic position sensing technology for the construction, agriculture, and material handling industries. DeltaTech was acquired to expand our magnetic speed and position sensing business with new and existing customers in the HVOR market. DeltaTech is being integrated into our Performance Sensing segment. 

On October 14, 2014, we acquired August Cayman Company, Inc. ("Schrader") for an aggregate purchase price of $1,004.7 million . Schrader is a manufacturer of tire pressure monitoring sensors (&#8220;TPMS&#8221;), a vehicle safety feature now standard on all cars and light trucks sold in the U.S. and growing in use globally in Europe and Asia. Schrader was acquired to add TPMS and additional low pressure sensing capabilities to our current product portfolio. Schrader is being integrated into our Performance Sensing segment. 

On December 1, 2015, we completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of certain subsidiaries of Custom Sensors &#38; Technologies Ltd. in the U.S., the U.K., and France, as well as certain assets in China (collectively, "CST"), for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $1,008.8 million , subject to customary post-closing adjustments. The acquisition included the Kavlico, BEI, Crydom, and Newall product lines and brands, and encompassed sales, engineering, and manufacturing sites in the U.S., the U.K., Germany, France, and Mexico. We acquired CST to further extend our sensing content beyond automotive markets and build scale in pressure sensing. Portions of CST are being integrated into each of our segments. 

Kavlico is a provider of linear and rotary position sensors to aerospace original equipment manufacturers and Tier 1 suppliers and pressure sensors to the general industrial and HVOR markets. BEI provides harsh environment position sensors, optical and magnetic encoders, and motion control sensors to the industrial, aerospace, agricultural, and medical device markets. Crydom manufactures solid state relays for power control applications in industrial markets. Newall provides encoders and digital readouts to machinery and machine tool markets. 

Performance Sensing Business 

&#32; Overview 

Our Performance Sensing business is a leading supplier of automotive and HVOR sensors, including pressure sensors, speed and position sensors, temperature sensors, and pressure switches. Our Performance Sensing business accounted for approximately 79% &#32;of our 2015 &#32;net revenue. Products manufactured by our Performance Sensing business are used in a wide 

&#32;5 

Table of Contents 

variety of applications, including automotive air conditioning, braking, transmission, tire, and air bag applications, as well as HVOR applications, including operator controls. We have historically derived most of the revenue in our Performance Sensing business from the sale of medium and high-pressure sensors. With the acquisition of Schrader, we added significant low pressure sensing capabilities, primarily TPMS, to our existing portfolio. We believe that we are one of the largest suppliers of sensors in the majority of the key applications in which we compete. Our customers consist primarily of leading global automotive and HVOR OEMs and their Tier 1 suppliers. Our products are ultimately used by the majority of global automotive OEMs, providing us with a balanced customer portfolio, which, we believe, helps to protect us against shifts in market share between different OEMs. 

Refer to Note 18, "Segment Reporting," of our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for details of the Performance Sensing segment operating income for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 &#32;and total assets as of December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 . 

Performance Sensing Business Markets 

Sensors are customized devices that translate a physical phenomenon, such as pressure or position, into electronic signals that microprocessors or computer-based control systems can act upon. The market is characterized by a broad range of products and applications across a diverse set of end-markets. We believe large OEMs and other multinational companies are increasingly demanding a global presence to supply sensors for their key global platforms. 

Automotive and HVOR sensors are included in the Performance Sensing business results, while industrial sensors are included in the Sensing Solutions business results. Refer to the Sensing Solutions Business Markets &#32;section for discussion of industrial sensors. 

Automotive and HVOR Sensors 

Revenue growth from the global automotive and HVOR sensor end-markets, which include applications in powertrain, tire, air conditioning, and chassis control, is driven, we believe, by three principal trends. First, global automotive vehicle unit sales have demonstrated moderate but consistent annual growth since the global recession in 2008 and 2009 and are expected to continue to increase over the long-term due to population growth and increased usage of cars in emerging markets. Second, the number of sensors used per vehicle has expanded, driven by a combination of factors including government regulation of safety, emissions, and greater fuel efficiency, consumer demand for new applications, and productivity for HVOR applications. For example, governments have mandated sensor-intensive technologies in Europe for TPMS. Finally, revenue growth has been augmented by a continuing shift away from legacy electromechanical products towards higher-value electronic solid-state sensors. 

According to the LMC Automotive "Global Car &#38; Truck Forecast" for the fourth quarter 2015 , the production of global light vehicles in 2015 was approximately 88.4 million &#32;units, an increase of 1.2% &#32;from 2014 . 

The automotive and HVOR sensor markets are characterized by high switching costs and barriers to entry, benefiting incumbent market leaders. Sensors are critical components that enable a wide variety of applications, many of which are essential to the proper functioning of the product in which they are incorporated. Sensor application-specific products require close engineering collaboration between the sensor supplier and the OEM or the Tier 1 supplier. As a result, OEMs and Tier 1 suppliers make significant investments in selecting, integrating, and testing sensors as part of their product development. Switching to a different sensor results in considerable additional work, both in terms of sensor customization and extensive platform/product retesting. This results in high switching costs for automotive and HVOR manufacturers once a sensor is designed-in, and we believe is one of the reasons that sensors are rarely changed during a platform lifecycle, which is typically five to seven years. Given the importance of reliability and the fact that the sensors have to be supported through the length of a product life, our experience has been that OEMs and Tier 1 suppliers tend to work with suppliers that have a long track record of quality and on-time delivery and the scale and resources to meet their needs as the car platform evolves and grows. In addition, the automotive segment is one of the largest markets for sensors, giving participants with a presence in this end-market significant scale advantages over those participating only in smaller, more niche industrial and medical markets. 

According to an October 2015 report prepared by Strategy Analytics, Inc., the global automotive sensor market was $19.9 billion &#32;in 2015 , compared to $19.1 billion &#32;in 2014 . We believe the increase in the number of sensors per vehicle and the level of global vehicle sales are the primary drivers of the increase in the global automotive sensor market. We believe that the increasing installation in vehicles of safety, emissions, efficiency, and comfort-related features that depend on sensors for proper functioning, such as airbags, electronic stability control, TPMS, advanced driver assistance, and advanced combustion and exhaust after-treatment, will continue to drive increased sensor usage and content growth.

In 2015, we determined that force sensors were no longer a significant product category for our business, and we reclassified the revenue related to this product category to "other." In addition, we determined that the products of certain businesses acquired in 2014 that were previously included in "other" were more appropriately categorized as speed and position sensors. Prior periods have been recast to reflect these changes. 

Sensing Solutions Business 

Overview 

We are a leading provider of bimetal electromechanical controls, thermal and magnetic-hydraulic circuit breakers, power conversion and control products, industrial sensors, and interconnection products. Our Sensing Solutions business accounted for approximately 21% &#32;of our 2015 &#32;net revenue. We market and manufacture a broad portfolio of application-specific products, including motor and compressor protectors, circuit breakers, pressure sensors and switches, temperature sensors and switches/thermostats, linear and rotary position sensors, semiconductor burn-in test sockets, solid state relays, and power inverters. Our control products are sold into industrial, aerospace, military, commercial, medical device, and residential end-markets. We derive most of our Sensing Solutions business revenue from products that prevent damage from excess heat or current in a variety of applications within these end-markets, such as internal and external motor and compressor protectors, circuit protection, motor starters, thermostats, switches, semiconductor testing, and light industrial systems. Our industrial sensors, including pressure sensors, temperature sensors, and linear and rotary position sensors, provide real time information about the state of a specific system or subsystem, so control adjustments can be made to optimize system performance. We believe that we are one of the largest suppliers of controls in the majority of the key applications in which we compete. For our industrial sensors, we have a strategic plan to build leading positions over time, leveraging the significant scale advantage and innovative

capability of our Performance Sensing business portfolio. In addition, on December 1, 2015, we acquired CST, which has expanded our product offerings in industrial sensors and power conversion and controls, as disclosed in the Sensing Solutions Business Markets &#32;section below. 

Our Sensing Solutions business also benefits from strong agency relationships. For example, a number of electrical standards for motor control products, including portions of the Underwriters&#8217; Laboratories ("UL") Standards for Safety, have been written based on the performance and specifications of our control products. We also have U.S. and Canadian Component Recognitions from UL, a U.S.-based organization that issues safety standards for many electrical products in the U.S., for many of our control products, so that customers can use Klixon &#174; &#32;products throughout North America. Where our component parts are detailed in our customers' certifications from UL, changes to their certifications may be necessary in order for them to incorporate competitors' motor protection offerings. 

We continue to focus our efforts on expanding our presence in all global geographies, both emerging and mature. Our customers include established multinationals, as well as local producers in emerging markets such as China, India, Eastern Europe, and Turkey. China continues to remain a priority for us because of its export focus and domestic consumption of products that utilize our devices. We continue to focus on managing our costs and increasing our productivity in these lower-cost manufacturing regions. 

Refer to Note 18, "Segment Reporting," of our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for details of the Sensing Solutions segment operating income for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 &#32;and total assets as of December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 . 

Sensing Solutions Business Markets 

Sensing Solutions products include controls, which are customized devices that protect equipment and electrical architecture from excessive heat or current, and sensors, which measure specific fluid based system parameters, including pressure and temperature. Our products help our customers' systems run safely and in an energy efficient and environmentally friendly manner. Our product lines encompass bimetal electromechanical controls, thermal and magnetic-hydraulic circuit breakers, power conversion and control products, interconnection products, and industrial sensors, each of which serves a highly diversified base of customers, end-markets, applications, and geographies. 

Bimetal Electromechanical Controls 

Bimetal electromechanical controls include motor protectors, motor starters, thermostats, and switches, each of which helps prevent damage from excessive heat or current. Our bimetal electromechanical controls business serves a diverse group of end-markets, including commercial and residential HVAC systems, lighting, refrigeration, industrial motors, household appliances, and commercial and military aircraft. In developed markets such as the U.S., Europe, and Japan, the demand for many of these products, and their respective applications, tends to track to the general economic environment. In emerging markets, a growing middle class and rapid overall industrialization is creating growth for our control products in electric motors, consumer conveniences such as appliances and HVAC, and communication infrastructure. 

Thermal and Magnetic-Hydraulic Circuit Breakers 

Our circuit breaker portfolio includes customized magnetic-hydraulic circuit breakers and thermal circuit breakers, which help prevent damage from electrical or thermal overload. Our magnetic-hydraulic circuit breaker business serves a broad spectrum of OEMs and other multinational companies in the telecommunication, industrial, recreational vehicle, HVAC, refrigeration, marine, medical, information processing, electronic power supply, power generation, over-the-road trucking, construction, agricultural, and alternative energy markets. We provide thermal circuit breakers to the commercial and military aircraft markets. Demand for these products tends to pace the general economic environment. 

Power Conversion and Control 

Power conversion and control products include power inverters, and with the acquisition of CST, solid state relays. 

Our power inverter products allow an electronic circuit to convert direct current ("DC") power to alternating current ("AC") power. Power inverters are used mainly in applications where DC power, such as that stored in a battery, must be converted for use in an electrical device that runs on AC power. Specific applications for power inverters include powering applications in utility/service trucks or recreational vehicles and providing power backup for critical applications such as traffic light signals and key business/computer systems. Demand for these products is driven by economic development, the need to meet new energy efficiency standards, and a growing interest in clean energy to replace generators, which increases demand for both portable and stationary power. 

&#32;8 

Table of Contents 

With the acquisition of CST in December 2015, this product category was expanded to include solid state relays, which are used where it is necessary to control a circuit by a low-power signal, or where several circuits must also be controlled by one signal. Applications for solid state relays include those in the industrial equipment end-market. 

Interconnection 

Our interconnection products consist of semiconductor burn-in test sockets used by semiconductor manufacturers to verify packaged semiconductor reliability. Demand in the semiconductor market is driven by consumer and business computational, entertainment, transportation, and communication needs. These needs are driven by the desire to have smaller, lighter, faster, more functional, and energy conscious devices that make users more productive and interconnected to society. 

Industrial Sensors 

Industrial sensors employ similar technology to automotive sensors discussed in the Performance Sensing Business &#32;section above, but often require greater customization in terms of packaging, calibration, and electrical output. Commercial and industrial applications in which our industrial sensors have historically been widely used include: multiple HVAC and refrigeration systems, where refrigerant, water, or air is the sensed fluid media used to optimize performance of the heating and cooling application; discrete industrial equipment applications that have a fluid-based subsystem (e.g., air compressors and hydraulic machinery such as molding and metal machining); and applications such as pumps and storage tanks, where measurement of pressure and temperature is required for optimum performance. 

With the acquisition of CST in December 2015, this product category was expanded to include linear and rotary position sensors. Linear and rotary position sensors translate linear or angular mechanical position to an electrical signal, and are typically used in systems where high reliability is desired, such as aircraft controls. The primary applications for our linear and rotary position sensors are in harsh environments in the aerospace and energy and infrastructure end-markets. 

We believe that sensor usage in industrial and commercial applications is driven by many of the same factors as in the automotive sensor market: regulation of safety, emissions, and greater energy efficiency, and consumer demand for new features. For example, many HVAC/Refrigeration ("HVAC/R") and industrial systems are converting to more energy efficient variable speed control, which inherently requires more sensor feedback than traditional fixed speed control systems. Global trends towards environmentally friendly refrigerants also require more sensors to deliver the desired system performance.

Technology and Intellectual Property 

We rely primarily on patents and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures, and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property rights. While we consider our patents to be valuable assets, we do not believe that our overall competitive position is dependent on patent protection or that our overall operations are dependent upon any single patent or group of related patents. Many of our patents protect specific functionality in our products, and others consist of processes or techniques that result in reduced manufacturing costs. Our patents generally relate to improvements on earlier filed Sensata, acquired, or competitor patents. We acquired ownership and license rights to a portfolio of patents and patent applications, as well as certain registered trademarks and service marks for discrete product offerings, from TI in the 2006 Acquisition. We have also acquired intellectual property as part of our various acquisitions. We have continued to have issued to us, and to file for, additional U.S. and non-U.S. patents since the 2006 Acquisition. As of December 31, 2015 , excluding the recent acquisition of CST, we had approximately 239 &#32;U.S. and 244 &#32;non-U.S. patents and approximately 47 &#32;U.S. and 172 &#32;non-U.S. pending patent applications that were filed within the last five years. We do not know whether any of our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents or whether the examination process will require us to narrow our claims. The acquisition of CST added 

&#32;10 

Table of Contents 

approximately 83 &#32;U.S. and 175 &#32;non-U.S. patents and approximately 12 &#32;U.S. and 35 &#32;non-U.S. pending patent applications that were filed within the last five years. Our patents have expiration dates ranging from 2016 to 2035. We incurred Research and Development expense of $123.7 million , $82.2 million , and $58.0 million &#32;for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 , respectively. 

We utilize licensing arrangements with respect to certain technology that we use in our sensor products and, to a lesser extent, our control products. We entered into a perpetual, royalty-free cross-license agreement with our former owner, TI, in connection with the 2006 Acquisition, which permits each party to use specified technology owned by the other party in its business. No license may be terminated under the agreement, even in the event of a material breach. 

We purchase sense element assemblies, which are components used primarily in our monosilicon strain gage pressure sensors, from Measurement Specialties, Inc. and its affiliates ("MEAS") and also manufacture them internally as a second source. Prior to March 2013, this internal sourcing was under a license provided for by an agreement entered into between MEAS and TI in May 2002 (the "2002 Agreement"), which was on a year-to-year basis, and limited our internal production to 40% of our needs. In March 2013 we entered into an intellectual property licensing arrangement (the "License Agreement") with MEAS to replace the 2002 Agreement, which was terminated in its entirety without penalty. The License Agreement provides for an indefinite duration license, which is subject to royalties through 2019 and thereafter is royalty-free. Pursuant to the terms of the License Agreement, the 40% limitation on internal production under the 2002 Agreement has been eliminated, and we are authorized to produce our entire need for these sense elements within the passenger vehicle and heavy duty truck fields of use. The License Agreement can be terminated by either party in the event of an uncured material breach. The sense element assemblies subject to the License Agreement accounted for $386.3 million &#32;in net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 , of which $206.7 million &#32;was related to products that were manufactured by MEAS, and $179.6 million &#32;was related to products that were manufactured by us. 

Seasonality 

Because of the diverse nature of the markets in which we compete, our revenue is only moderately impacted by seasonality. However, our Sensing Solutions business has some seasonal elements, specifically in its air conditioning and refrigeration products, which tend to peak in the first two quarters of the year as end-market inventory is built up for spring and summer sales. 

Sales and Marketing 

The sales and marketing function within our business is organized into regions&#8212;the Americas, Asia, and Europe&#8212;but also organizes globally across all geographies according to market segments, so as to facilitate knowledge sharing and coordinate activities involving our larger customers through global account managers. 

Customers 

Our customer base in the Performance Sensing business includes a wide range of OEMs and Tier 1 suppliers in the automotive and HVOR end-markets. Our customers in the Sensing Solutions business include a wide range of industrial and commercial manufacturers and suppliers across multiple end-markets, primarily OEMs in the climate control, appliance, semiconductor, medical, energy and infrastructure, data/telecom, and aerospace industries, as well as Tier 1 motor and compressor suppliers. In geographic and product markets where we lack an established base of customers, we rely on third-party distributors to sell our sensor and control products. We have had relationships with our top ten customers for an average of 26 &#32;years. Our largest customer accounted for approximately 9% &#32;of our net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 . 

Selected Geographic Information 

Refer to Note 18, "Segment Reporting," of our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for details of our net revenue by selected geographic areas for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 &#32;and long-lived assets by selected geographic area as of December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 . 

Competition 

Within each of the principal product categories in our Performance Sensing business, we compete with a variety of independent suppliers and with the in-house operations of Tier 1 systems suppliers. We believe that the key competitive factors in this market are product quality and reliability, the ability to produce customized solutions on a global basis, technical expertise and development capability, breadth and scale of product offerings, product service and responsiveness, and price.

Within each of the principal product categories in our Sensing Solutions business, we compete with divisions of large multinational industrial corporations and fragmented companies, which compete primarily in specific end-markets or applications. We believe that the key competitive factors in these markets are product quality and reliability, although manufacturers in certain markets also compete based on price. Physical proximity to the facilities of the OEM/Tier 1 manufacturer customer has, in our experience, also increasingly become a basis for competition. We have additionally found that certain of the product categories have specific competitive factors. For example, in the thermal circuit breaker, thermostat, and switch markets, strength of technology, quality, and the ability to provide custom solutions are particularly important. In the hydraulic-magnetic circuit breaker markets, as another example, we have encountered heightened competition on price and a greater emphasis on agency approvals, including approvals by UL, and similar organizations outside of the U.S., such as Verband der Elektrotechnik, Elektronik und Informationstechnik, and T&#220;V Rheinland in Europe, China Compulsory Certification in China, and Canadian Standards Association in Canada. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015 , we had approximately 19,650 &#32;employees, of whom approximately 11% &#32;were located in the U.S. As of December 31, 2015 , approximately 830 &#32;of our employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements. In addition, in various countries, local law requires our participation in works councils. We also utilize contract workers in multiple locations in order to cost-effectively manage variations in manufacturing volume. As of December 31, 2015 , we had approximately 1,790 &#32;contract workers on a worldwide basis. We believe that our relations with our employees are good. 

Environmental Matters and Governmental Regulation 

Our operations and facilities are subject to U.S. and non-U.S. laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment and our employees, including those governing air emissions, water discharges, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, and the cleanup of contaminated sites. We are, however, not aware of any threatened or pending material environmental investigations, lawsuits, or claims involving us or our operations, other than as set forth in Note 14, "Commitments and Contingencies," of our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As of December 31, 2015 , compliance with federal, state, and local provisions that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position. We have not budgeted any material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities during 2016 . 

Our products are governed by material content restrictions and reporting requirements, examples of which include the European Union regulations, such as REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and Restriction of Chemicals), RoHS (Restriction of Hazardous Substances), and ELV (End of Life Vehicles), etc., U.S. regulations, such as the conflict minerals requirements of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and similar regulations in other countries. Numerous customers, across all end-markets, are requiring us to provide declarations of compliance or, in some cases, full material content disclosure as a requirement of doing business with them. 

We are subject to compliance with laws and regulations controlling the export of goods and services. Certain of our products are subject to International Traffic in Arms Regulation (&#8220;ITAR&#8221;). These products represent an immaterial portion of our net revenue, and we have not exported ITAR-controlled products. However, if in the future we decided to export ITAR-controlled products, such transactions would require an individual validated license from the U.S. State Department&#8217;s Directorate of Defense Trade Controls. The State Department makes licensing decisions based on type of product, destination of end use, end user, national security, and foreign policy. The length of time involved in the licensing process varies but currently averages approximately six to eight weeks. The license processing time could result in delays in the shipping of products. These laws and regulations are subject to change, and any such change may require us to change technology or incur expenditures to comply with such laws and regulations.
