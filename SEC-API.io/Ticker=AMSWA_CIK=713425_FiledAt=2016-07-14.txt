Industry Background 

Companies that effectively communicate, collaborate and integrate with their trading partners (customers, suppliers, and carriers) within the extended enterprise or global supply chains can realize significant competitive advantages in the form of lower costs, improved customer service, and increased revenue. Supply chain management refers to the process of managing the complex network of relationships that organizations maintain with external trading partners to forecast demand, source, manufacture and deliver goods and services to the end consumer. Supply chain management involves both the activities related to supplying products or services (source, make, move, buy, store, and deliver) as well as the sales and marketing activities that influence the demand for goods and services, such as new product introductions, promotions, pricing and forecasting. 

In response to increasing global competition, companies are continually seeking new ways to enhance the productivity of their operations. Computer software applications can be an effective tool for companies to re-engineer and streamline their core business processes. ERP applications help companies reduce employee headcount and increase employee utilization through recording, consolidating, and reporting the large quantities of transactional data that are generated through daily operations. Core ERP applications include automation of financial reporting, human resources, and supply chain functions. Included in supply chain functions are applications that assist companies in managing relationships with external trading partners such as customers, suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, retailers, and carriers. 

Today, several market trends are driving organizations to expand collaboration with trading partners along the supply chain. A general shift in market power has forced manufacturers and distributors to become more responsive to retailers and consumers, which has increased the demand for improved planning capabilities. At the same time, global economic conditions and competitive pressures are forcing businesses to reduce costs, decrease order cycle times and improve operating efficiencies. As a result, manufacturers, distributors and retailers are under pressure to better manage the supply chain as they seek to improve manufacturing efficiency and logistics operations while maintaining flexibility and responsiveness to changing market conditions and specific customer demands. These pressures are compounded by the increasing globalization and complexity of the interactions among suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, retailers and consumers. 

To compete in global markets, businesses must improve the performance of their supply chains, as well as the key functions, processes and technologies that make up an integrated supply chain network. Supply chain planning software solutions create a competitive advantage by modeling the time-phased need for products at a specific location in the business network and enables reducing the cost of goods sold, improving customer service, building global brands and increasing global supply chain visibility as companies move product to the market quicker. Our customers&#146; goal is to provide the right product in the right place at the right time at a competitive price. 

Where appropriate, our software solutions expand the potential user community and streamline collaboration among the various trading partners in the supply chain. The supply chain planning process focuses on demand forecasting, supply and inventory optimization, global sourcing, distribution, transportation and manufacturing planning and scheduling. Planning software is designed to increase revenues, improve forecast accuracy, optimize production scheduling, streamline global sourcing, reduce inventory costs, decrease order cycle times, reduce transportation costs, and improve customer service. The supply chain execution function addresses procuring, manufacturing, warehousing, fulfilling orders and distributing products throughout the supply chain. Within the supply chain execution function, organizations are increasing their focus on the optimization of transportation operations and the need for integration with planning systems and other enterprise applications, in order to increase the efficient and effective fulfillment of customer orders in both the business-to-business and the business-to-consumer sectors. 

&#160;

Index to Financial Statements In order to effectively manage and coordinate supply chain activities, companies require sales and operations planning, supply chain planning, allocation, sourcing, supply chain execution, and supply chain analytics software that provides for integrated communication, optimization and collaboration among the various constituents throughout the supply chain network. This enhanced collaboration synchronizes production plans with demand forecasts, thereby minimizing bottlenecks that lead to production delays, excess inventory and distribution network problems. 

In addition, companies seek sales and operations planning systems to synchronize the time phased needs of market demand with inventory investments. Organizations are also demanding solutions that are modular and scalable to fit the changing needs of the organization. 

Business Segments 

Segment 1&#151;Supply Chain Management 

Logility, Inc. 

Logility, our wholly-owned subsidiary, was incorporated in 1996 and provides SCM and advanced retail planning solutions, as an integrated suite of sales and operations planning, demand planning, inventory optimization, manufacturing planning and scheduling, supply optimization, and transportation optimization. 

Logility&#146;s solutions enable enterprises to increase their market visibility to build competitive advantages and increase profitability by reducing costs, increasing revenues, improving operational efficiencies and collaborating with customers, suppliers and carriers to more effectively sense and respond to dynamic market conditions. Additionally, Logility&#146;s solutions streamline and automate the executive sales and operations planning (S&#38;OP) process to create and assess business plans that profitably match supply with demand while synchronizing supply chain operations with strategic corporate goals. 

Today, Logility&#146;s customer base is approximately 1,250 companies located in more than 80 countries, which gives Logility what we believe is the largest active installed base of supply chain and retail planning customers among all application software vendors. Logility markets and sells the Demand Solutions &#174; product line to the global small and midsize enterprise (SME) market through the global VAR distribution network of DMI. Logility also offers the Logility Voyager Solutions &#153; suite through both direct and indirect sales channels to customers with distribution-intensive supply chains, ranging from upper-midsize to Fortune 500 companies along with tier-one retailers. 

Logility derives revenues primarily from three sources: software licenses, services, and maintenance. Logility generally determines software license and SaaS fees based on the number of modules, deployments, users and/or sites licensed. Services and other revenues consist primarily of fees from software implementation, training, consulting services, SaaS, hosting, and managed services associated with the implementation and support of Logility products. Logility bills for these services primarily under time and materials arrangements and recognizes revenues as it performs services. Maintenance agreements typically are for a one- to three-year term, commencing at the time of the initial product license. Logility generally bills maintenance fees annually in advance under agreements with terms of one to three years, and then recognizes the resulting revenues ratably over the term of the maintenance agreement. Deferred revenues represent advance payments or billings for software licenses, services and maintenance billed in advance of the time Logility recognizes the related revenues. 

Logility&#146;s cost of revenues for licenses includes amortization of capitalized computer software development costs, salaries and benefits along with VAR commissions. Costs for maintenance and services revenues include the cost of personnel to conduct implementations, customer support and consulting, and other personnel-related expenses as well as agent commission expenses related to maintenance revenues generated by the indirect sales channel. 

Logility&#146;s selling expenses generally include the salaries and commissions it pays to its direct sales professionals, along with marketing, promotion, travel and associated costs. Logility&#146;s general and administrative expenses generally include the salaries and benefits it pays to executive, corporate and support personnel, as well as office rent, utilities, communications expenses, and various professional fees.

Supply Chain and Retail Industry Background 

In response to increasing global competition, volatile market demand, shorter product life cycles and reduced lead times, companies are continually seeking new ways to enhance the productivity and profitability of their operations. Companies that effectively communicate, collaborate and integrate with their trading partners within the extended enterprise network or supply chain can realize significant competitive advantages in the form of lower costs, greater customer responsiveness, reduced stock-outs, more efficient sourcing, reduced inventory levels, synchronized supply and demand, improved transportation and logistics operations, and increased revenue. Supply chain management refers to the process of managing the complex global network of relationships that organizations maintain with external trading partners (customers, suppliers, manufacturers, distributors and retailers) to forecast, source, manufacture, store, allocate and deliver goods and services to the end customer. Supply chain management involves both the activities related to supplying products or services (source, make, move, buy, store, and deliver) as well as the sales and marketing activities that influence the demand for goods and services, such as new product introductions, promotions, pricing and forecasting. 

Today, several market trends are driving organizations to invest in supply chain and retail planning initiatives. Global economic conditions and competitive pressures are forcing companies to reduce costs, decrease order cycle times and improve operating efficiencies and omni-channel initiatives are driving the need for more flexibility and better leverage out of inventory to meet the needs of multiple commerce channels including wholesale, branded retail and direct to consumer. As a result, manufacturers, distributors and retailers are under pressure to better manage the supply chain as they seek to reduce costs, improve manufacturing efficiency and accelerate logistics operations while maintaining flexibility and responsiveness to changing market conditions and specific customer demands. These pressures are compounded by the increasing complexity and globalization of the interactions among suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, retailers and consumers. 

Companies are increasingly deploying supply chain optimization and advanced retail planning applications to address their forecasting, supply chain planning, inventory optimization, and transportation requirements. Supply chain optimization and retail planning functions involve the use of information and analysis to facilitate the on-time delivery of the right products to the correct location at the right time and at the optimal total cost. The planning process focuses on forecasting and demand management, inventory and supply optimization, distribution, transportation and manufacturing planning and scheduling, sales and operations planning, and retail financial planning and allocation. Planning software is designed to increase revenues, improve forecast accuracy, optimize manufacturing scheduling, better leverage inventory investments, decrease order cycle times, reduce transportation costs, and improve customer service. Customers are showing increasing interest in planning software that is implemented and accessed in the cloud, known as SaaS. 

The supply chain functions also address procuring, warehousing, fulfilling orders, distributing products, and delivery to customers throughout the global network. Within the supply chain execution function, organizations are increasing their focus on the effective management of warehouse and transportation operations and the need for integration with supply chain planning and other enterprise applications, in order to increase the efficient and effective fulfillment of customer orders in both the business-to-business and the business-to-consumer sectors. 

The May 2016 Gartner Inc. report, Forecast Analysis: Enterprise Software, Worldwide, 1Q16 Update , predicts spending on Supply Chain Management software solutions will grow at a CAGR of 9.5% through 2020, outpacing the CAGR for enterprise software applications at 7.6%. 

In order to effectively manage and coordinate supply chain activities, companies require demand planning, supply planning, inventory optimization, global sourcing, transportation and logistics management, and advanced analytics software that provides for integrated communication, optimization and collaboration among the various stakeholders throughout the supply chain network. This enhanced collaboration optimizes production and distribution plans with demand forecasts and minimizes bottlenecks that lead to production delays, excess inventory, storage constraints and distribution network problems. 

We believe that traditional ERP systems alone do not provide the visibility, depth, flexibility or optimization techniques required to effectively meet the demands of today&#146;s intensely competitive and increasingly dynamic global business environment. Organizations are demanding supply chain solutions that are both modular and scalable to extend ERP functionality, fit the dynamic needs of their businesses, deploy quickly and deliver rapid time-to-benefit. 

&#160;

Index to Financial Statements Additionally, business drivers for more sophisticated supply chain solutions are finding their way downstream. Issues that multi-billion dollar companies faced ten years ago are affecting even the lower end of the SME market today. Increasingly, Logility&#146;s customers have to manage offshore sourcing and manufacturing requirements, which often extend lead times and time-to-market. With new, increasingly complex data management needs to monitor global supply networks and deal with the retailers&#146; demand for accurate forecasts, greater supply visibility and higher in-stock performance, the SME market is outgrowing spreadsheets for supply chain planning and turning to proven supply and demand, inventory and replenishment management software, thus extending the addressable market for Logility&#146;s software offerings.

Leveraging its planning solutions expertise, Logility has been an innovator in developing and deploying supply chain optimization and advanced retail planning solutions, with its first Internet-based collaborative planning software application implemented in 1996. Logility continues to invest and expand its award-winning solutions, which support the global planning, optimization, collaboration, S&#38;OP as well as merchandise and assortment planning and allocations. 

Logility&#146;s experience indicates that distribution-intensive industries face considerable competitive pressure, which is intensified by the high cost of inventory and distribution investments, dynamically changing consumer needs, and variability in overall supply chain performance. These companies need solutions that are capable of delivering significant financial benefits by quickly solving problems that arise in sourcing, manufacturing and distribution operations.

&#160; &#149; &#160; Activity Manager Key benefits of enterprise solutions include the following: 

Single-Source Solution Provider for the Internet Age. Our comprehensive e-business solution suite supports the e-business requirements of most enterprises throughout their adoption of Internet technology. e-Intelliprise is a comprehensive solution to support the operations of enterprises and provide advanced decision support tools. 

Front-to-Back Office Integration. e-Intelliprise provides complete integration of e-business transactions to the entire ERP system, which is critical to the success of an enterprise. This supports comprehensive and consistent flow of information throughout the enterprise and supply chain. Fulfillment issues that have been experienced by some &#147;e-tailers&#148; can be resolved through front-to-back office integration. e-Intelliprise is a single solution for support of traditional and e-business activities. 

Rules-Based Architecture. e-Intelliprise is very flexible due to its rules-based architecture. This allows the ERP data to be presented based upon the profile of the user. 

Deployable over the Internet, or an Intranet or Extranet. Companies can deploy e-Intelliprise over multiple channels without a separate implementation. e-Intelliprise allows users to create multiple secure role-based views of the system. We believe this system flexibility provides greater business value by extending the information within the ERP securely across to employees, customers and trading partners, as needed. 

Full Global Capabilities . e-Intelliprise provides full global support of the entire enterprise with multiple languages, currencies and books. This allows users to view information in their native language and currency. 

Modular Solution. Companies may purchase one or more modules, which they can integrate with other enterprise software. They may also purchase an integrated product suite to handle increased requirements for enterprise management, processing and transaction volume. 

&#160;

Index to Financial Statements Extensive Functionality. Our enterprise solutions combine traditional and e-business functionality into a comprehensive yet flexible system. e-Intelliprise offers full operational and decision support functionality for global enterprises. 

Rapid Deployment. Our products utilize a modular design and a flexible rules-based architecture, thereby streamlining implementation and reducing project time and expenses. We have announced a 120-day implementation program that is appropriate for many customers. 

e-Applications 

e-Applications streamline business processes and create competitive advantages that help businesses leverage the full value of their existing ERP and legacy systems. Our e-applications provide added value by extending the reach of the ERP to trading partners, for collaborative trading. 

e-Procurement. This self-service online procurement solution reduces the time, cost and effort associated with &#147;buy side&#148; activities. This e-application can also help an enterprise become more efficient and productive by streamlining the procurement process and eliminating purchasing bottlenecks. This solution not only eliminates purchasing delays but it positions enterprises to respond faster to change and to capitalize on e-business opportunities. 

e-Store. This e-business storefront solution offers a cost-effective way to expand an enterprise&#146;s market by providing around-the-clock access to web-based ordering. e-Store acquires and retains customers&#146;, employees&#146; and distributors&#146; access to catalog information, pricing, product availability and order status. The solution can give users authority to create or change customer orders, or may be restricted to inquiries. 

e-Expenses. This paperless workflow solution enables employees to submit expense reports via the Internet with attached documented receipts. By giving employees access to expense status at all stages of the processing cycle (routing, approval and payment) and by supplying company management with a system wide look into expense behavior, the e-Expenses solution offers a new level of control over and accountability for the cost of the function. e-Expense is fully integrated into Accounts Payable. 

e-Forms. e-Forms provides the ability to route specific forms, such as purchase requisitions, purchase orders, invoices, and acknowledgments via e-mail or fax. We believe that e-Forms offers an effective, easy-to-use communication channel to external trading partners. e-Forms provides a secure, self-service link between non-host users and purchasing, requisitioning, accounts payable, accounts receivable, customer order processing and manufacturing systems. Using e-mail with PDF attachments, fax and XML/FTP gateways, this solution&#146;s workflow engine routes documents from host applications. The review, approval and update loop uses HTML formatting and receives instructions interactively. 

Purchase Order Tracking and Vendor Collaboration. Companies that source globally may experience problems communicating with distant suppliers. This module combines some of the features of e-Procurement and e-Forms with the ability to negotiate delivery schedules. The system allows buyers to electronically send purchase orders to suppliers, receive acknowledgments into a secure web site, and communicate and negotiate delivery schedules via a secure web site. It uses e-mail alerts extensively to notify buyers and suppliers of changes to requirements and schedules. 

Requisition Tracking. This solution is designed to reduce sourcing cycle time, improve control and compliance with approvals and lower transaction costs with labor and hard copy savings. It streamlines the requisitioning process easily and cost effectively, providing better control and management of the process. It provides for full electronic approval of requisitions, consolidation of vendor orders to meet minimum order requirements and get volume discounts, tracking of in-process requisitions and full history of approval process. 

Shipment Tracking. This solution is a critical element of the global sourcing process. It is designed to provide shipment planning with full approval workflow, Advanced Ship Notice (ASN) management and shipment documentation. This solution works hand in hand with the Vendor Collaboration system to provide full visibility of inbound logistics and product availability. 

e-Connect. We designed this solution to enable the exchange of XML-enabled data. e-Connect provides the link to extend the ERP back-office software to the web and to enable users to interact with the ERP software via the web. e-Connect also enables the interactive communication between web applications, marketplaces, trading exchanges, suppliers, B2B transactions and back office ERP systems. 

e-Process Management. This solution is designed as a web-based event-driven system that facilitates the sharing of information and the management of business processes across internal departments and among business partners. It automates business procedures (work flows) during which documents, information and tasks are passed from one participant to another in a way that is governed by rules or procedures. e-Process Master File Change Control routes proposed changes for approval before allowing the change to be posted to the database. e-Process Inspection workflows document the purchase receipt inspection, manufacturing work in process inspection and returned material inspection from receipt to disposition with integration to the back-office.

Index to Financial Statements We do not have a customer who has more than 10% of fiscal 2016 revenues. We typically experience a slight degree of seasonality, reflected in a slowing of services revenues during the annual winter holiday season, which occurs in the third quarter of our fiscal year. We are not reliant on government-sector customers. 

Integrated System Design 

While customers can use our software applications individually, we have designed them to be combined as integrated systems to meet unique customer requirements. The user may select virtually any combination of modules to form an integrated solution for a particular business problem. The license for such a solution could range from one single module to a multi-module, multiple-user solution incorporating the full range of our products. 

Customers frequently require services beyond those provided by our standard support/maintenance agreement. To meet those customers&#146; needs, we established a separate professional services division that provides specialized business and software implementation consulting, custom programming, on-site installation, system-to-system interfacing and extensive training. We provide these services, frequently referred to as &#147;systems integration services,&#148; for an additional fee, normally under a separate contract based upon time and materials utilized. 

Sales and Marketing 

We market our products through direct and indirect sales channels. We conduct our principal sales and marketing activities from corporate headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia, and have sales and/or support offices in Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Indianapolis, New York, St. Louis, Miami and Pittsburgh. We manage sales channels outside of North America from our international offices, primarily in the United Kingdom. 

In addition to our employee sales force, we have developed a network of agents who assist in selling our products globally. We intend to utilize these and future relationships with software and service organizations to enhance our sales and marketing position. These independent distributors and resellers, located in North America, South America, Mexico, Europe, South Africa, and the Asia/Pacific region, distribute our product lines domestically and in foreign countries. These vendors typically sell their own consulting and systems integration services in conjunction with licensing our products. Our global distribution channel consists of approximately 66 organizations with sales, implementation and support resources serving customers in more than 80 countries. 

We support our sales activities by conducting a variety of marketing programs including public relations, direct marketing, advertising, trade shows, product seminars, industry speakers, user group conferences and ongoing customer communication and industry analysts programs. We also participate in industry conferences such as those organized by the Association for Operations Management (APICS), the Council of Supply Chain Management Professionals (CSCMP), formerly called the Council of Logistics Management (CLM), and the Institute for Supply Management (ISM). 

We also engage in third-party software alliance programs with other software vendors. These programs generally provide some type of assistance for developing or marketing software products which are compatible or complimentary with products of the other party. Under one such program, DMI was designated a Microsoft Gold Certified Partner to provide integrated supply chain products for Microsoft&#146;s Dynamics GP and NAV solutions. 

Licenses 

Like many business application software firms, our software revenue consists principally of fees generated from licensing our software products. In consideration of the payment of license fees, we typically grant non-exclusive, nontransferable, perpetual licenses, which are primarily business unit- and user-specific and geographically restricted. Our standard license agreement contains provisions designed to prevent disclosure and unauthorized use of our software. In these agreements, we warrant that our products will function in accordance with the specifications set forth in our product documentation. 

The prices for our products are typically functions of the number of modules licensed and the number of servers, users and sites for which the solution is designed and deployed. 

Customer Service and Support 

We provide the following services and support to our customers: 

Cloud and Managed Services. We offer our customers the option to deploy Voyager, Demand Solutions and New Generation Solutions in a SaaS, hosted or on-premise model. Cloud Services provides companies a choice in deployment methodology and services that best suit their individual needs and allows them to evolve as their business changes; moving between SaaS, on-premise, and managed services as their IT strategies transform. Managed Services leverage our resources to assist and augment the customer&#146;s technical and operational needs on a day-to-day basis. 

&#160;

Index to Financial Statements Implementation Support. We offer our customers a professional and proven implementation program that facilitates rapid implementation of our software products. Our consultants help customers define the nature of their project and subsequently proceed through the implementation process. We provide training for all users and managers involved. We first establish measurable financial and logistical performance indicators and then evaluate them for conformance during and after implementation. Additional services beyond implementation can include post-implementation reviews and benchmarks to further enhance the benefits to customers. 

Implementation: General Training Services. We offer our customers post-delivery professional services consisting primarily of implementation and training services, for which we typically charge on a daily basis. Customers that purchase implementation services receive assistance in integrating our solution with existing software applications and databases. Implementation of our products typically requires three to nine months, depending on factors such as the complexity of a customer&#146;s existing systems, the number of modules purchased, and the number of end users. 

Product Maintenance and Updates: Support Services. We provide our customers with ongoing product support services. Typically, we enter into support or maintenance contracts with customers for an initial one- to three-year term, billed annually in advance, at the time of the product license with renewal for additional periods thereafter. Under these contracts, we provide telephone consulting, product updates and releases of new versions of products previously purchased by the customer, as well as error reporting and correction services. We provide ongoing support and maintenance services on a seven-days-a-week, 24-hours-a-day basis through telephone, electronic mail and web-based support, using a call logging and tracking system for quality assurance. 

Research and Development 

Our future success depends in part upon our ability to continue to enhance existing products, respond to changing customer requirements, develop and introduce new or enhanced products, and keep pace with technological developments and emerging industry standards. We focus our development efforts on several areas, including, but not limited to, enhancing operability of our products across distributed and changing heterogeneous hardware platforms, operating systems and relational databases, and adding functionality to existing products. These development efforts will continue to focus on deploying applications within a multi-tiered ERP and supply chain environment, including the Internet. 

Logility&#146;s current release of Logility Voyager Solutions is version 8.5, released in March 2014 . Version 8.5 uses an Internet-based architecture for maximum scalability and messaging functionality that supports the increasingly distributed nature of supply chain planning, global sourcing, supply chain execution and collaborative commerce. Logility Voyager Solutions interfaces with software from leading ERP vendors such as SAP and Oracle. 

The current release of the traditional Demand Solutions products is version 11 and the first release of DSX was introduced in February 2010. These products are designed to work with a wide variety of MRP, ERP and legacy enterprise applications. 

Our client/server and Internet-based solutions will be important for our long-term growth. As of April 30, 2016, we employed 88 persons in product research, development and enhancement activities. 

Competition 

Our competitors are diverse and offer a variety of solutions directed at various aspects of the supply chain, as well as the enterprise application market as a whole. Our existing competitors include: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Large ERP application software vendors such as SAP, Oracle and Infor, each of which offers sophisticated ERP solutions that currently, or may in the future, incorporate supply chain management modules, advanced planning and scheduling, warehouse management, transportation or collaboration software; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Vendors focusing on the supply chain application software market, including, but not limited to, vendors such as JDA Software and Kinaxis; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Other business application software vendors that may broaden their product offerings by internally developing, or by acquiring or partnering with independent developers of, supply chain management software; and &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Internal development efforts by corporate information technology departments. In addition, our Logility subsidiary may face competition from other application software vendors, including ERP vendors that from time to time jointly market Logility&#146;s products as a complement to their own systems. To the extent such vendors develop or acquire systems with functionality comparable to Logility&#146;s products, their significant installed customer base, long-standing customer relationships and ability to offer a broad solution could provide a competitive advantage over Logility&#146;s products. 

We also expect to face additional competition as other established and emerging companies enter the market for advanced retail planning and supply chain management software and/or introduce new products and technologies. In addition, current and potential competitors have made and may continue to make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or 

&#160;

Index to Financial Statements with third parties, thereby increasing the ability of their products to address the needs of our prospective customers. Accordingly, it is possible that new competitors or alliances among current and new competitors may emerge and rapidly gain significant market share. Increased competition could result in fewer customer orders, reduced gross margins and loss of market share. 

The principal competitive factors in the target markets in which we compete include product functionality and quality, domain expertise, integration technologies, product suite integration, breadth of products and related services such as customer support, training and implementation services. Other factors important to customers and prospects include: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; customer service and satisfaction; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; ability to provide relevant customer references; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; compliance with industry-specific requirements and standards; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; flexibility to adapt to changing business requirements; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; ability to generate business benefits; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; rapid payback and measurable return on investment; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; vendor financial stability and company as well as product reputation; and &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; initial license price, cost to implement and long term total cost of ownership. Many of our competitors and potential competitors have a broader worldwide presence, longer operating histories, significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources, greater name recognition, and a larger installed base of customers than we have. Some competitors have become more aggressive with their prices, payment terms and issuance of contractual implementation terms or guarantees. In order to be successful in the future, we must continue to develop innovative software solutions and respond promptly and effectively to technological change and competitors&#146; innovations. We may also have to lower prices or offer other favorable terms. Our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products. 

We believe that our principal competitive advantages are our comprehensive, integrated solutions, our list of referenceable customers, the ability of our solutions to generate business benefits for our customers, our substantial investment in product development, our deep domain expertise, the ease of use of our software products, our customer support and implementation services, our ability to deploy quickly, and our ability to deliver rapid return on investment for our customers. 

Proprietary Rights and Licenses 

Our success and ability to compete are dependent in part upon our proprietary technology. To protect our proprietary technology, we rely on a combination of copyright and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions, which may afford only limited protection. In addition, effective copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries. Although we rely on the limited protection afforded by such confidential and contractual procedures and intellectual property laws, we also believe that factors such as the knowledge, ability, and experience of our personnel, new product developments, frequent product enhancements, reliable maintenance and timeliness and quality of support services are essential to establishing and maintaining a technology leadership position. We presently have no patents. The source code for our proprietary software is protected as a trade secret and as a copyrighted work. Generally, copyrights on our products expire 95 years after the year of first publication of each product. We enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees, consultants and customers, and control access to and distribution of our software, documentation and other proprietary information. In addition, we have registered certain trademarks and have registration applications pending for other trademarks. 

We provide our software products to customers under non-exclusive license agreements. As is customary in the software industry, in order to protect our intellectual property rights, we do not sell or transfer title to our products to our customers. Although the license agreements place restrictions on the customer&#146;s use of our products, unauthorized use of our products nevertheless may occur. 

Despite measures we have taken to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to reverse engineer or copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. Policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult and expensive. In addition, litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others, or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity. Such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. 

In the future, we may increasingly be subject to claims of intellectual property infringement as the number of products and competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps. Although we are not aware that any of our products infringe upon the proprietary rights of third parties, there can be no assurance that third parties will 

&#160;

Index to Financial Statements not claim infringement by us with respect to current or future products. In addition, we may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights. Any such claims against us, with or without merit, as well as claims initiated by us against third parties, can be time consuming and expensive to defend, prosecute or resolve. Moreover, an adverse outcome in litigation or similar adversarial proceedings could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties, require the expenditure of significant resources to develop non-infringing technology, require a substantial amount of attention from management, require disputed rights to be licensed from others, require us to enter into royalty arrangements or require us to cease the marketing or use of certain products, any of which would have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. To the extent that we desire or are required to obtain licenses to patents or proprietary rights of others, there can be no assurance that any such licenses will be made available on terms acceptable to us, if at all. 

We have re-licensed, and expect in the future to re-license, certain software from third parties for use in connection with our products. There can be no assurance that these third-party software vendors will not change their product offerings or that these software licenses will continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. The termination of any such licenses or product offerings, or the failure of the third-party licensors to adequately maintain or update their products, could result in delays in our ability to ship certain of our products while we seek to implement technology offered by alternative sources. Any required replacement licenses could prove costly. Further, any such delay, if it becomes extended, could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations. 

Company Strategy 

Our objective is to become a leading provider of collaborative supply chain optimization, advanced retail planning and enterprise-wide ERP solutions to enable small, midsize, large and Fortune 500 companies to optimize their operations associated with the planning, sourcing, manufacture, storage, and distribution of products. Our strategy includes the following key elements: 

Leverage and Expand Installed Base of Customers. We currently target businesses in the consumer goods, food and beverage, retail, apparel and sewn products, life sciences, chemicals, and wholesale distribution industries. We intend to continue to leverage our installed base of more than 1,350 customers to introduce additional functionality, product upgrades, and complementary modules. In addition, we intend to expand sales to new customers in our existing vertical markets and to target additional vertical markets over time. We will continue our focus on offering a best-in-class cloud solution and expect the growth trends we have experienced in this area to continue because many new and existing customers are pursuing cloud strategies for their business applications. 

Continue to Expand Sales and Marketing. We intend to continue to pursue an increased share of the market for SCM and ERP software solutions by expanding our sales and marketing activities. We believe our competitive advantages include providing rapid implementation, easy-to-maintain configuration, and quick time-to-benefit across the full spectrum of customer operations. Logility intends to continue building a direct sales force that is focused on selected vertical markets, such as consumer goods, retail, life sciences, wholesale distribution and manufacturing supply chains. NGC Software intends to continue to focus on the apparel, footwear, sewn products, and furniture industries, adding sales and marketing resources when appropriate. 

Expand Indirect Channels to Increase Market Penetration. We believe that key relationships with VARs will increase sales and expand market penetration of our products and services. This experienced global distribution network significantly expands Logility&#146;s reach and provides sales, implementation and support resources serving customers in more than 80 countries. 

Maintain Technology Leadership. We believe we are a technology leader in the field of collaborative supply chain optimization solutions and we intend to continue to provide innovative, advanced solutions and services to this market. We believe that Logility was one of the earliest providers of SCM software solutions on a client/server platform and on Windows, and the first to introduce a collaborative supply chain planning solution that operates over the Internet. We intend to continue developing and introducing new and enhanced products and keeping pace with technological developments and emerging industry standards. 

Invest Aggressively to Build Market Share. We intend to continue investing to expand our sales force, research and development efforts, and consulting infrastructure, balanced with our goal of increasing profitability. We believe these investments are necessary to increase our market share and to capitalize on the growth opportunities in the market. 

Acquire or Invest in Complementary Businesses, Products and Technologies. We believe that select acquisitions or investments may provide opportunities to broaden our product offering to provide more advanced solutions for our target markets. We will evaluate acquisitions or investments that will provide us with complementary products and technologies, expand our geographic presence and distribution channels, penetrate additional vertical markets with challenges and requirements similar to those we currently meet, and further solidify our leadership position within the SCM market. In fiscal 2015, we acquired MID Retail, Inc. (&#147;MRI&#148;), announced on May 30, 2014, to extend our reach into retail operations and expand our ability to help customers improve their Omni-Channel performance. 

&#160;

Index to Financial Statements Focus on Integrated Collaborative Planning and Supply Chain Execution Solution. We believe Logility is one of the few providers of truly integrated SCM software solutions addressing demand, supply and advanced retail planning as well as transportation logistics requirements. Logility Voyager Solutions provides a comprehensive suite for supply chain planning and transportation management with collaboration at its core, streamlining business processes between both internal and external trading partners. We intend to continue focusing Logility&#146;s development initiatives on enhancing its end-to-end solution, expanding its embedded performance management architecture and introducing additional capabilities that complement its integrated solution suite. 

Increase Penetration of International Markets. In the fiscal year ended April 30, 2016, we generated 17% of our total revenues from international sales, resulting from marketing relationships with a number of international distributors. Logility, along with its subsidiary, DMI, has over 66 VARs in its indirect channel where the majority of the VARs are international. This experienced global distribution network expands Logility&#146;s reach and provides sales, implementation and support resources, serving customers in more than 80 countries. We intend to further expand our international presence by creating additional relationships with distributors in Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, North America and South America. 

Expand Strategic Relationships. We intend to develop strategic relationships with leading enterprise software, systems integrators and service providers to integrate the Logility Voyager Solutions suite into their services and products and to create joint marketing opportunities. In addition, Logility has developed a network of international agents who assist in the sale and support of its products. We intend to utilize these and future relationships with software and service organizations to enhance our sales and marketing position. 

Continue to Focus on Providing High Quality Customer Service. Providing high quality customer service is a critical element of our strategy. We intend to continue investing in technology and personnel to accommodate the needs of our growing customer base. We will continue to seek new ways to improve service to our customers. 

Leverage Cloud Strategy. Our cloud computing initiative accelerates customer&#146;s deployment of our industry leading supply chain and advanced retail planning solutions. Our cloud strategy includes SaaS licensing and services designed to enable the optimization of the customer&#146;s supply chain to reflect their global business needs. 

Serve Small, Midsize and Large Business Markets. Our broad product portfolio allows us to address the unique business needs and complexity of a wide range of enterprises with small, midsize and large global operations. 

There can be no assurance, however, that we will be successful in implementing the strategies outlined above. 

Employees 

As of April 30, 2016, we had 420 full-time employees, including 88 in product research, development and enhancement, 50 in customer support, 172 in professional services, 79 in marketing, sales and sales support, and 31 in accounting, facilities and administration. We believe that our continued success will depend in part on our ability to continue to attract and retain highly skilled technical, marketing and management personnel, who may be in great demand. We believe our employee relations are good. We have never had a work stoppage and no employees are represented under collective bargaining arrangements.
