 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

&#160; 

General 

&#160; 

Quest Solution, Inc., a Delaware corporation, formerly Amerigo Energy, Inc., together with its two wholly owned subsidiaries, referred to herein as &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; and &#8220;our&#8221; (&#8220;Quest&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;), was incorporated in 1973. Since its incorporation, the Company has been involved in various lines of business. 

&#160; 

Between 2008 and 2013, the Company was in the business of developing oil and gas reserves while increasing the production rate base and cash flow. The plan was to continue acquiring oil and gas leases for drilling and to take advantage of other opportunities and strategic alliances. Due to declines in production with respect to the Company&#8217;s oil and gas leases, the Company sought to explore its position in the oil industry. As the operational leases for the Company were not providing sufficient cash flow from operations to allow management to expand its investment in this industry, other potential opportunities were evaluated. 

&#160; 

In February 2013, the Company acquired the rights to a spirits line of business and compiled a team of beverage, entertainment, retail and consumer product industry professionals. On January 10, 2014, the Company came to agreement with the original owners of the spirits brand, to cancel the previous agreement and the license was returned to them. The cancellation of a Consulting Agreement between the Company and the previous owners resulted in the return and cancellation 1,765,000 of the shares of common stock of the Company that had previously been issued. 

&#160; 

In January 2014, the Company had determined it was in the best interest of stockholders to focus on operating companies with a track record of positive cash flows and larger existing revenue bases. The Company&#8217;s strategy developed into leveraging management&#8217;s relationships in the business world for investments for the Company. On January 10, 2014, the Company entered into that certain Share Purchase Agreement with Quest Solution, Inc., an Oregon corporation (&#8220;Quest Solution&#8221;), in the technology, software, and mobile data collection systems business, in order to acquire Quest Solution for a purchase price of $16,000,000, payable in the form of (i) a promissory note for $4,969,000; and (ii) a promissory note for $11,031,000. 

&#160; 

In May 2014, our Board of Directors voted to change the name of the Company from Amerigo Energy, Inc. to Quest Solution, Inc., and the Company received the approval from a majority of its stockholders and filed the amendment to its Articles of Incorporation with the Secretary of State for the State of Delaware. The name change became effective by the State of Delaware on May 30, 2014. The Company also requested a new stock symbol as a result of the name change and we were assigned our new trading symbol &#8220;QUES&#8221; on the OTCQB. 

&#160; 

On November 19, 2014, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with Bar Code Specialties, Inc., a California corporation (&#8220;BCS&#8221;), and David Marin, the sole stockholder of BCS, pursuant to which the Company agreed to purchase all outstanding shares of common stock of BCS held by the Mr. Marin for an aggregate purchase price of $11,000,000, payable in the form of a five-year secured subordinated convertible promissory note. BCS is a company specializing in systems integration and data collection. Initially the company focused on the distribution vertical, but quickly grew its operational focus to include retail, manufacturing, food, and healthcare. 

&#160; 

Effective October 1, 2015, the Company acquired the interest in ViascanQdata, Inc. (&#8220;ViascanQData&#8221;), a Canadian based operation in the same business line as Quest and their CEO, Gilles Gaudreault, was appointed the CEO of Quest, with our then CEO, Tom Miller, remaining as President and Chairman of the Board. 

&#160;

Further the market in which Quest operates is undergoing consolidation and Quest may potentially acquire profitable, strategic companies in the data collection and mobile systems integration market to become the leading specialty integrator within our served markets.

&#160; 

Competitive overview 

&#160; 

The mobile system integration market is characterized by a limited number of large competitors and numerous smaller niche players. Quest typically pursues larger accounts and national customers, competing most often with the larger channel partners, including Stratix, Peak Technologies, Lowry, and Barcoding.com. For specific solutions the Company also competes with niche players that are often focused on a single industry. Hardware sales are often pressured by competition from online retailers, but Quest&#8217;s consultative, integrated solutions approach is a clear differentiator for most prospective customers. 

&#160; 

Sales Strategy 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s current direct sales teams are supported by systems engineers averaging over twenty (20) years of experience in the mobile industry. The sales organization&#8217;s growth in size and reach mirrors the Company&#8217;s addition of new products and services. Sales team members are organized by territory, and to a lesser extent, areas of expertise. Quest&#8217;s sales team adequately addresses national accounts offering a broad array of unique solutions for line of business application, which allows for upsell and cross sell opportunities within each client. For the barcode label (media) business, Quest utilizes a specialty sales force and well as resellers and distributors of Quest manufactured label products to serve the market. 

&#160; 

Sales persons are supported internally by sales support personnel who coordinate quotes and logistics and by members of the systems engineering group and software teams. 

&#160; 

The normal sales cycle is six (6) to nine (9) months, and typically involves the development of a scope of work and preparation of a ROI analysis. Quest prepares templates for this purpose which reduces the sales cycle. The analyses and proposals include information on leasing and other financing options, which helps differentiate the Company from its competitors. The label business sales cycles are shorter with purchases made more frequently on a transactional basis.
