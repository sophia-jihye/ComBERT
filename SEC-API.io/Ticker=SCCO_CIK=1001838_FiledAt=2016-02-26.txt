 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

&#160; 

THE COMPANY 

&#160; 

Southern Copper Corporation (&#147;SCC&#148;, &#147;Southern Copper&#148; or the &#147;Company&#148;) is one of the largest integrated copper producers in the world. Our major production includes copper, molybdenum, zinc and silver. All of our mining, smelting and refining facilities are located in Peru and Mexico and we conduct exploration activities in those countries and in Argentina, Chile and Ecuador. See Item 2 &#147;Properties - Review of Operations&#148; for maps of our principal mines, smelting facilities and refineries. Our operations make us one of the largest mining companies in Peru and Mexico. We believe we have the largest copper reserves in the world. We were incorporated in Delaware in 1952 and have conducted copper mining operations since 1960. Since 1996, our common stock has been listed on both the New York and Lima Stock Exchanges. 

&#160; 

Our Peruvian copper operations involve mining, milling and flotation of copper ore to produce copper concentrates and molybdenum concentrates; the smelting of copper concentrates to produce anode copper; and the refining of anode copper to produce copper cathodes. As part of this production process, we also produce significant amounts of molybdenum concentrate. Our precious metals plant at the Ilo refinery produces refined silver, gold, and other materials. Additionally, we produce refined copper using solvent extraction/electrowinning technology (&#147;SX-EW&#148;). We operate the Toquepala and Cuajone open-pit mines high in the Andes Mountains, approximately 860 kilometers southeast of the city of Lima, Peru. We also operate a smelter and refinery west of the Toquepala and Cuajone mines in the coastal city of Ilo, Peru.

&#160; 

Our Mexican operations are conducted through our subsidiary, Minera Mexico S.A. de C.V. (&#147;Minera Mexico&#148;), which we acquired in 2005. Minera Mexico engages primarily in the mining and processing of copper, molybdenum, zinc, silver, gold and lead. Minera Mexico operates through subsidiaries that are grouped into three separate units. Mexicana de Cobre S.A. de C.V. (together with its subsidiaries, the &#147;La Caridad&#148; unit) operates La Caridad, an open-pit copper mine, a copper ore concentrator, a SX-EW plant, a smelter, refinery and a rod plant. The La Caridad refinery has a precious metals plant which produces refined silver, gold and other materials. Operadora de Minas e Instalaciones Mineras S.A de C.V. (the &#147;Buenavista unit&#148;) operates Buenavista, an open-pit copper mine, which is located at the site of one of the world&#146;s largest copper ore deposits, a copper concentrator and three SX-EW plants. Industrial Minera Mexico, S.A. de C.V. (together with its subsidiaries, the &#147;IMMSA unit&#148;) operates five underground mines that produce zinc, lead, copper, silver and gold, a coal mine and a zinc refinery. 

&#160; 

We utilize modern, state of the art mining and processing methods, including global positioning systems and computerized mining processes. Our operations have a high level of vertical integration that allows us to manage the entire production process, from the mining of the ore to the production of refined copper rod and other products and most related transport and logistics functions, using our own facilities, employees and equipment. 

&#160; 

The sales prices for our products are largely determined by market forces out of our control. Our management, therefore, focuses on cost control and production enhancement to remain profitable. We endeavor to achieve these goals through capital spending programs, exploration efforts and cost reduction programs. Our focus is to remain profitable during periods of low copper prices and on maximizing results in periods of high copper prices. For additional information on the sale prices of the metals we produce, please see &#147;Metal Prices&#148; in this Item 1. 

&#160; 

Currency Information: 

&#160; 

Unless stated otherwise, all our financial information is presented in U.S. dollars and any reference herein to &#147;U.S. dollars&#148;, &#147;dollars&#148;, or &#147;$&#148; are to U.S. dollars; references to &#147;sol&#148;, &#147;soles&#148; or &#147;S/&#148;, are to Peruvian soles; and references to &#147;peso&#148;, &#147;pesos&#148;, or &#147;Ps.&#148;, are to Mexican pesos. 

&#160; 

In December, 2015, by law, the name of the Peruvian currency changed from &#147;Nuevo Sol&#148; to &#147;Sol&#148; and its symbol was also modified from &#147;S/.&#148; to &#147;S/&#148;. This change was effective since December 15, 2015. 

&#160;

&#160; 

ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE 

&#160; 

The following chart describes our organizational structure, starting with our controlling stockholders, as of December 31, 2015. For clarity of presentation, the chart identifies only our main subsidiaries and eliminates intermediate holding companies. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

We are a majority-owned, indirect subsidiary of Grupo Mexico S.A.B. de C.V. (&#147;Grupo Mexico&#148;). At December 31, 2015, Grupo Mexico through its wholly-owned subsidiary Americas Mining Corporation (&#147;AMC&#148;) owned 88.57% of our capital stock. Grupo Mexico&#146;s principal business is to act as a holding company for the shares of other corporations engaged in the mining, processing, purchase and sale of minerals and other products and railway and other related services. 

&#160; 

We conduct our operations in Peru through a registered branch (the &#147;SPCC Peru Branch&#148;, &#147;Branch&#148; or &#147;Peruvian Branch&#148;). The SPCC Peru Branch comprises substantially all of our assets and liabilities associated with our copper operations in Peru. The SPCC Peru Branch is not a corporation separate from us and, therefore, obligations of SPCC Peru Branch are direct obligations of SCC and vice-versa. It is, however, an establishment, registered pursuant to Peruvian law, through which we hold assets, incur liabilities and conduct operations in Peru. Although it has neither its own capital nor liability separate from us, it is deemed to have equity capital for purposes of determining the economic interests of holders of our investment shares (See Note 14 &#147;Stockholders&#146; Equity&#148; of our consolidated financial statements). 

&#160; 

In April 2005, we acquired Minera Mexico, the largest mining company in Mexico on a stand-alone basis, from Americas Mining Corporation (&#147;AMC&#148;), a subsidiary of Grupo Mexico, our controlling stockholder. Minera Mexico is a holding company and all of its operations are conducted through subsidiaries that are grouped into three units: (i) the La Caridad unit (ii) the Buenavista unit and (iii) the IMMSA unit. We own 99.96% of Minera Mexico. 

&#160; 

In 2008, our Board of Directors (&#147;BOD&#148;) authorized a $500 million share repurchase program that has since been increased by the BOD and is currently authorized to $3 billion. Pursuant to this program, through December 31, 2015 we have purchased 116.6 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $2,846.6 million. These shares are available for general corporate purposes. We may purchase additional shares from time to time, based on market conditions and other factors. This repurchase program has no expiration date and may be modified or discontinued at any time. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

REPUBLIC OF PERU AND MEXICO 

&#160; 

Our revenues are derived primarily from our operations in Peru and Mexico. Risks related to our operations in both countries include those associated with economic and political conditions, the effects of currency fluctuations and inflation, the effects of government regulations and the geographic concentration of our operations.

Additional business information follows: 

&#160; 

COPPER BUSINESS 

&#160; 

Copper is an important component in the world&#146;s infrastructure. It is the third most widely used metal, next to iron and aluminum. Copper has unique chemical and physical properties, including high ductility, malleability, thermal and electrical conductivity, and resistance to corrosion that has made it a superior material for use in electrical and electronic products, including power transmission and generation, which accounts for about three quarters of its global copper use, telecommunications, building construction, transportation and industrial machinery. Copper is also an important metal in non-electrical applications such as plumbing and roofing and, when alloyed with zinc to form brass, in many industrial and consumer applications. 

&#160; 

Copper is an internationally traded commodity with prices principally determined by the major metal exchanges, the Commodities Exchange, or &#147;COMEX&#148;, in New York and the London Metal Exchange or &#147;LME.&#148; Copper is usually found in nature in association with sulfur. Pure copper metal is generally produced from a multistage process, beginning with the mining and concentrating of low-grade ores containing copper sulfide minerals, and followed by smelting and electrolytic refining to produce a pure copper cathode. An increasing share of copper is produced from acid leaching of oxidized ores. Copper is one of the oldest metals ever used and has been one of the most important materials in the development of civilization. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

BUSINESS REPORTING SEGMENTS: 

&#160; 

Our management views Southern Copper as having three reportable segments and manages it on the basis of these segments. 

&#160; 

The three segments identified are groups of individual mines, each of which constitutes an operating segment with similar economic characteristics, type of products, processes and support facilities, regulatory environments, employee bargaining contracts and currency risks. In addition, each mine within the individual group earns revenues from similar types of customers for their products and services and each group incurs expenses independently, including commercial transactions between groups. 

&#160; 

Inter-segment sales are based on arm&#146;s length prices at the time of sale. These may not be reflective of actual prices realized by the Company due to various factors, including additional processing, timing of sales to outside customers and transportation cost. Added to the segment data is information regarding the Company&#146;s sales. The segments identified by the Company are: 

&#160; 

1. &#160; Peruvian operations, which include the Toquepala and Cuajone mine complexes and the smelting and refining plants, including a precious metals plant, industrial railroad and port facilities that service both mines. Sales of its products are recorded as revenue of our Peruvian mines. The Peruvian operations produce copper, with production of by-products of molybdenum, silver and other materials.

2. &#160; Mexican open-pit operations, which include the La Caridad and Buenavista mine complexes and the smelting and refining plants, including a precious metals plant and a copper rod plant and support facilities that service both mines. Sales of its products are recorded as revenue of our Mexican mines. The Mexican open-pit operations produce copper, with production of by-products of molybdenum, silver and other materials.

3. &#160; Mexican underground mining operations, which include five underground mines that produce zinc, copper, silver and gold, a coal mine that produces coal and coke, and a zinc refinery. This group is identified as the IMMSA unit and sales of its products are recorded as revenue of the IMMSA unit.

&#160; 

Financial information is regularly prepared for each of the three segments and the results are reported to Senior Management on a segment basis. Senior Management focuses on operating income and on total assets as measures of performance to evaluate different segments and to make decisions to allocate resources to the reported segments. These are common measures in the mining industry. 

&#160; 

Segment information is included in Item 2 &#147;Properties,&#148; under the captions &#151; &#147;Metal Production by Segments&#148; and &#147;Ore Reserves.&#148; More information on business segment and segment financial information is included in Note 18 &#147;Segment and Related Information&#148; of our consolidated financial statements. 

&#160; 

CAPITAL INVESTMENT PROGRAM AND EXPLORATION ACTIVITIES 

&#160; 

For a description of our capital investment program, see Item 7 &#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#151; Capital Investment Program&#148; and for our exploration activities, see Item 2 &#147;Properties &#151; Explorations Activities.&#148; 

&#160; 

PRINCIPAL PRODUCTS AND MARKETS 

&#160; 

Copper is primarily used in the building and construction industries, in electrical and electronic products and, to a lesser extent, in industrial machinery and equipment, consumer products and in the automotive and transportation industries. Molybdenum is used to toughen alloy steels and soften tungsten alloy and is also used in fertilizers, dyes, enamels and reagents. Silver is used for photographic, electrical and electronic products and, to a lesser extent, in brazing alloys and solder, jewelry, coinage, silverware and catalysts. Zinc is primarily used as a coating on iron and steel to protect against corrosion. It is also used to make die cast parts, in the manufacturing of batteries and in the form of sheets for architectural purposes. 

&#160; 

Our marketing strategy and annual sales planning emphasize developing and maintaining long-term customer relationships. Thus acquiring annual or other long-term contracts for the sale of our products is a high priority. Generally, 80% to 90% of our metal production is sold under annual or longer-term contracts. Sales prices are determined based on the prevailing commodity prices for the quotation period according to the terms of the contract. 

&#160; 

We focus on the ultimate end-user customers as opposed to selling on the spot market or to trading companies. In addition, we devote significant marketing efforts to diversifying our sales both by region and by customer base. We also strive to provide 

&#160; 

&#160; 

superior customer service, including timely deliveries of our products. Our ability to consistently fulfill customer demand is supported by our substantial production capacity. 

&#160; 

For additional information on sales please see &#147;Revenue recognition&#148; in Note 2 &#147;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#148; and Note 18 &#147;Segment and Related Information&#148; of our consolidated financial statements. 

&#160; 

METALS PRICES 

&#160; 

Prices for our products are principally a function of supply and demand and, with the exception of molybdenum, are established on COMEX and LME, the two most important metal exchanges in the world. Prices for our molybdenum products are established by reference to the publication Platt&#146;s Metals Week. Our contract prices also reflect any negotiated premiums and the costs of freight and other factors. From time to time, we have entered into hedging transactions to provide partial protection against future decreases in the market price of metals and we may do so under certain market conditions. For a further discussion of our products market prices, please see Item 7 &#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#151; Metal Prices.&#148;

&#160; 

COMPETITIVE CONDITIONS 

&#160; 

Competition in the copper market is based primarily on price and service basis, with price being the most important factor when supplies of copper are ample. Our products compete with other materials, including aluminum and plastics. For additional information, see Item 1A &#147;Risk Factors &#151; The copper mining industry is highly competitive.&#148; 

&#160; 

LABOR FORCE 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, we had 13,024 employees, approximately 73% of whom are unionized and represented by 8 different labor unions. In recent years we have experienced a positive labor environment in our operations in Mexico and Peru, which is allowing us to increase productivity as well as helping us achieve the goals of our capital expansion program. 

&#160; 

Peru 

&#160; 

72.7% of our 4,602 Peruvian employees were unionized at December 31, 2015. Currently, there are five separate unions, one main union and four smaller unions. In the second quarter of 2015, two of the main unions, which formerly represented the Ilo and Cuajone workers, and one of the minor unions, which formerly represented some Toquepala workers, merged into one new main union. The other four smaller unions represent the balance of workers. Our collective bargaining agreements with all of these unions expired in the second half of 2015. Negotiations for new agreements began in the third quarter of 2015 and were finalized early in 2016, with the signing of new three-year agreements. These agreements include, among other things, annual salary increases of 5% for each of the three years. 

&#160; 

Employees of the Toquepala and Cuajone units reside in townsites, where we have built 3,700 houses and apartments. We also have 90 houses at Ilo for staff personnel. Housing, together with maintenance and utility services, is provided at minimal cost to most of our employees. Our townsite and housing complexes include schools, medical facilities, churches, social clubs and recreational facilities. We also provide shopping, banking and other services at the townsites. 

&#160; 

Mexico 

&#160; 

73.3% of our 8,316 Mexican employees were unionized at December 31, 2015, represented by three separate unions. Under Mexican law, the terms of employment for unionized workers are set forth in collective bargaining agreements. Mexican companies negotiate the salary provisions of collective bargaining agreements with the labor unions annually and negotiate other benefits every two years. We conduct negotiations separately at each mining complex and each processing plant. 

&#160; 

Our Taxco and San Martin mines in Mexico have been on strike since July 2007. For a discussion of labor matters reference is made to the information contained under the caption &#147;Labor matters&#148; in Note 13 &#147;Commitments and Contingencies&#148; of the consolidated financial statements. 

&#160; 

Employees of La Caridad and Buenavista units reside in townsites at Nacozari and Cananea, where we have built approximately 2,000 houses and apartments, and 275 houses and apartments, respectively. Most of the employees of the IMMSA unit reside on the grounds of the mining or processing complexes in which they work and where we have built approximately 900 houses and apartments. Housing, together with maintenance and utility services, is provided at minimal cost to most of our employees. Our townsites and housing complexes include educational and medical facilities, churches, social clubs, shopping centers, banking and other services. Through 2007, the Buenavista unit provided health care services free of charge to employees and retired unionized employees and their families through its own hospital at the Buenavista unit. In 2010, the Company signed an agreement with the Secretary of Health of the State of Sonora to provide these services to its retired workers and their families. The new workers of Buenavista del Cobre will receive health services from the Mexican Institute of Social Security as is the case for all Mexican workers. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

FUEL, ELECTRICITY AND WATER SUPPLIES 

&#160; 

The principal raw materials used in our operations are fuel, electricity and water. We use natural gas to power boilers and generators, and for metallurgical processes at our Mexican operations and diesel fuel to power mining equipment. We believe that sources of fuel, electricity and water are readily available. The prices of these raw materials may fluctuate outside of our control, therefore we focus our efforts to reduce these costs through cost and energy saving measures. 

&#160; 

Energy is the principal cost in mining, so the concern for its conservation and efficient usage is very important. We have energy management committees at most of our mines, which meet periodically to discuss consumption and to develop measures directed at saving energy. Also, alternative sources are being analyzed at the corporate level, from both traditional and renewable energy sources. This has helped us to develop a culture of energy conservation directed at the sustainability of our operations. 

&#160; 

Peru: 

&#160; 

Fuel: In Peru, we obtain fuel primarily from local production. The Company believes that adequate supplies of fuel are available in Peru.

&#160; 

Electricity : We currently receive power from Enersur S.A. under a power purchase agreement through April 2017. In June 2014, we entered into a power purchase agreement for 120 megawatt (&#147;MW&#148;) with the state company Electroperu S.A., which will supply energy for our Peruvian operations for twenty years starting on April 17, 2017 and ending on April 30, 2037. In July 2014, we entered into a power purchase agreement for 120MW with a private power generator Kallpa, which will supply energy for our Peruvian operations for ten years starting on April 17, 2017 and ending on April 30, 2027. In addition, we feel confident that additional power can be obtained from the Peruvian national grid, should the need arise.

&#160; 

Additionally, we have nine megawatts of power generation capacity from two small hydro-generating installations at Cuajone. Power is distributed over a 224-kilometer closed loop transmission circuit, which is interconnected with the Peruvian network. 

&#160; 

Water: We have water rights or licenses for up to 1,950 liters per second from well fields at the Huaitire, Vizcachas and Titijones aquifers and surface water rights from the Suches lake and two small water courses, Quebrada Honda and Quebrada Tacalaya. We believe these water sources are sufficient to supply the needs of our operating units at Toquepala and Cuajone. At Ilo, we have desalination plants that produce water for industrial and domestic use that we believe are sufficient for our current and projected needs.

&#160; 

Mexico: 

&#160; 

Fuel : In Mexico, fuel is purchased directly from Petroleos Mexicanos (&#147;PEMEX&#148;), the state oil monopoly.

&#160; 

The La Caridad unit imports natural gas from the United States through its pipeline (between Douglas, Arizona and Nacozari, Sonora), which allows us to import natural gas from the United States at market prices and thereby reduce operating costs. Several contracts with PEMEX and the United States provide us with the option of using a monthly or daily fixed price for our natural gas purchases. 

&#160; 

Natural gas is used for metallurgical processes, to power furnaces, converters, casting wheels, boilers and electric generators. Diesel oil is a backup for all these uses. We use diesel oil to power mining equipment at our operations. 

&#160; 

Electricity: Electricity is used as the main energy source at our mining complexes. We purchase most of our electricity from Mexico Generadora de Energia S. de R. L. (&#147;MGE&#148;), a subsidiary of Grupo Mexico which has recently completed the construction of the two power plants designed to supply power to some of the Company&#146;s Mexican operations. It is expected that MGE will supply approximately 12% of its power output to third party energy users. These plants are natural gas-fired combined cycle power generating units, with a net total capacity of 516.2 megawatts. In 2012, we entered into a power supply agreement with MGE through 2032. The first plant was completed in June 2013 and the second, in the second quarter of 2014. MGE has the authorization for the interconnection with the Mexican electrical system to start operations at the second plant. The first plant began to supply power to the Company in December 2013, and the second plant began to supply power in June 2015.

&#160; 

We also purchase electricity from the Comision Federal de Electricidad (the Federal Electricity Commission or the &#147;CFE&#148;), the state&#146;s electrical power producer. In addition, we recover some energy from waste heat boilers at the La Caridad smelter. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Accordingly, a significant portion of our operating costs in Mexico is dependent upon the pricing policies of CFE, as well as PEMEX, which reflect government policy, as well as international market prices for crude oil, natural gas and conditions in the refinery markets. 

&#160; 

Water : In Mexico, water is deemed a public property and industries not connected to a public service water supply must obtain a water concession from Comision Nacional del Agua (the National Water Commission or the &#147;CNA&#148;). Water usage fees are established in the Ley Federal de Derechos (the Federal Rights Law), which distinguishes several availability zones with different fees per unit of volume according to each zone, with the exception of Mexicana de Cobre. All of our operations have one or several water concessions and pump out the required water from wells. Mexicana de Cobre pumps water from the La Angostura dam, which is close to the mine and plants. At our Buenavista facility, we maintain our own wells and pay the CNA for water usage. Water conservation committees have been established in each plant in order to conserve and recycle water. Water usage fees are updated on a yearly basis and have been increasing in recent years. In December 2013, federal law pertaining to water rights was amended to change the method used to determine water usage fees for underground and surface water effective January 1, 2014.

&#160;

We believe that our Peruvian concessions are in full force and in effect under applicable Peruvian laws and that we are in compliance with all material terms and requirements applicable to these concessions. The concessions have indefinite terms, subject to our payment of concession fees of up to $3.00 per hectare annually for the mining concessions and a fee based on nominal capacity for the processing concessions. Fees paid during 2015, 2014 and 2013, were approximately $1.7 million, $1.2 million and $1.2 million, respectively. We have two types of mining concessions in Peru: metallic and non-metallic concessions. 

&#160; 

In 2011, the Peruvian Congress approved an amendment to the mining royalty charge. The new mining royalty charge is based on operating income margins with graduated rates ranging from 1% to 12% of operating profits, with a minimum royalty charge assessed at 1% of net sales. If the operating income margin is 10% or less, the royalty charge is 1% and for each 5% increment in the operating income margin, the royalty charge rate increases by 0.75%, up to a maximum of 12%. In 2015, 2014 and 2013, we made provisions of $22.9 million, $32.4 million and $34.8 million, respectively. 

&#160; 

At the same time the Peruvian Congress amended the mining royalty charge, it enacted a new tax for the mining industry. This tax is also based on operating income and its rates range from 2% to 8.4%. For additional information see Note 8 &#147;Income Taxes&#148; to the consolidated financial statements. 

&#160; 

Mexico: 

&#160; 

In Mexico we have 527,144 hectares in concessions from the Mexican government for our exploration and exploitation activities as outlined on the table below.

We believe that our Mexican concessions are in full force and in effect under applicable Mexican laws and that we are in compliance with all material terms and requirements applicable to these concessions. Under Mexican law, mineral resources belong to the Mexican nation and a concession from the Mexican federal government is required to explore or mine mineral reserves. Mining concessions have a 50-year term that can be renewed for another 50 years. Holding fees for mining concessions can be from $0.4 to $8.1 per hectare depending on the beginning date of the mining concession. Fees paid during 2015, 2014 and 2013 were approximately $5.6 million, $5.7 million and $5.6 million, respectively. In addition, all of our operating units in Mexico have water concessions that are in full force and effect. Although ownership is not required in order to explore or mine a concession, we generally own the land related to our Mexican concessions. We also own all of the processing facilities of our Mexican operations and the land on which they are constructed. 

&#160; 

In December 2013, the Mexican government enacted a new law which, among other things, established a mining royalty charge of 7.5% on earnings before taxes as defined by Mexican tax regulations and an additional royalty charge of 0.5% over gross income from sales of gold, silver and platinum. These charges were effective January 2014 and are deductible for income tax purposes.
