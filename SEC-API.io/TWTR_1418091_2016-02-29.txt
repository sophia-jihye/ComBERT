 Item 1. BUSINESS 

Overview 

Twitter gives everyone the power to create and share ideas and information instantly without barriers. Our service is live&#8212;live commentary, live connections, live conversations. Whether it is breaking news, entertainment, sports, or everyday topics, hearing about and watching a live event unfold is the fastest way to understand the power of Twitter. Twitter has always been considered a "second screen" for what is happening in the world and we believe we can become the first screen for everything that is happening now. And by doing so, we believe we can build the planet&#8217;s largest daily connected audience. 

Our current strategy for 2016 consists of the following objectives:

&#160;

&#183; 

Our Users . We are committed to refining our core service to better enable people to more easily create, share and consume content that is important to them. As part of that strategy, we will be focusing on live streaming video, which we believe is a strong complement to the live nature of Twitter. We will also be working toward giving our creators and influencers better tools to build and connect with their fans and audience through Twitter. Finally, we intend to invest more resources in making our platform safer by implementing technology to better detect the use of repeat abusive accounts, making it simpler for our users to report multiple abusive Tweets or accounts, and giving people simpler tools to curate and control their experience on Twitter. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Our Advertisers . Our three main initiatives to improve our advertisers&#8217; ability to connect with their customers are: (i) building a rich canvas for marketers by incorporating additional features such as video into our Promoted Products, (ii) increasing advertisers&#8217; return on investment, or ROI, with improved measurement, bidding and relevance capabilities and (iii) increasing advertisers&#8217; scale and reach by leveraging Twitter&#8217;s unique global audience. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Our Developers. We are committed to providing a platform for developers to build, grow, and generate revenue with their sites and apps. In turn, we believe that these sites and apps provide us with strategic value by enabling us to demonstrate the importance of Tweets and extend their reach beyond Twitter. 

Products and Services for Users 

Twitter. Twitter is a global platform for public self-expression and conversation in real time. By developing a way for people to consume, create, distribute and discover content, Twitter has democratized content creation and distribution. The audience for Twitter is not limited to our logged-in users on the Twitter platform, but rather extends to a larger global audience. 

The public nature of the Twitter platform allows us and others to extend the reach of Twitter content beyond our properties. Media outlets and our platform partners distribute Tweets beyond our properties to complement their content by making it more timely, relevant and comprehensive. These outlets and partners also add value to our user experience by contributing content to our platform. Many of the world&#8217;s most trusted media outlets, including the BBC, CNN and Times of India, regularly use Twitter as a platform for content distribution. 

Periscope and Vine. Our mobile application, Periscope, lets anyone broadcast and watch video live with others. We recently added the ability to broadcast from a GoPro camera, and to watch any broadcast live from a Tweet. Pairing Periscope with Twitter gives broadcasters greater distribution (anywhere a Tweet can be displayed, a Periscope can too) and the ability to integrate into our revenue products. Vine is a mobile application that enables users to create and distribute short looping videos of up to six seconds in length. We do not currently monetize videos on Periscope or Vine, other than to the extent they can be integrated into our revenue products. 

&#160;

Products and Services for Advertisers 

Our Promoted Products enable our advertisers to promote their brands, products and services, amplify their visibility and reach, and extend the conversation around their advertising campaigns. We enable our advertisers to target an audience based on a variety of factors, including a user&#8217;s Interest Graph. The Interest Graph maps, among other things, interests based on users followed and actions taken on our platform, such as Tweets created and engagement with Tweets. We believe a user&#8217;s Interest Graph produces a clear and real-time signal of a user&#8217;s interests, greatly enhancing the relevance of the ads we can display for users and enhancing our targeting capabilities for advertisers. Our Promoted Products are incorporated into our platform as native advertising and are designed to be as compelling and useful to our users as organic content on our platform. 

Currently, our Promoted Products (all of which are labeled &#8220;promoted&#8221; within Twitter) consist of: 

&#160;

&#183; 

Promoted Tweets. Promoted Tweets appear within a user&#8217;s timeline or search results just like an ordinary Tweet regardless of device. Using our proprietary algorithm and understanding of each user&#8217;s Interest Graph, we can deliver Promoted Tweets that are intended to be relevant to a particular user. Our goal is to enable advertisers to create and optimize successful marketing campaigns &#8212; and pay only for the user actions that are aligned with their marketing objectives. As a result, we have added product features to Promoted Tweets campaigns based on advertiser objectives, which may include Tweet engagements (e.g., retweets, replies and likes), app installs or engagements, website clicks or conversions, or video views. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Promoted Accounts . Promoted Accounts appear in the same format and place as accounts suggested by our Who to Follow recommendation engine, or in some cases, in Tweets in a user&#8217;s timeline. Promoted Accounts provide a way for our advertisers to grow a community of users who are interested in their business, products or services. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Promoted Trends. Promoted Trends appear at the top of the list of trending topics for an entire day in a particular country or on a global basis. When a user clicks on a Promoted Trend, search results for that trend are shown in a timeline and a Promoted Tweet created by our advertisers is displayed to the user at the top of those search results. We feature one Promoted Trend per day per geography. 

Our technology platform and information database enable us to provide targeting capabilities based on audience attributes like geography, interests, keyword, television conversation, event and devices that make it possible for advertisers to promote their brands, products and services, amplify their visibility and reach, and complement and extend the conversation around their advertising campaigns. 

Our platform also allows customers to advertise across the mobile ecosystem, both on Twitter&#8217;s owned and operated properties as well as off Twitter on third party publishers&#8217; websites, applications and other offerings, across the full user lifecycle &#8212; from acquiring new users to engaging existing users. We enable advertisers to extend their reach beyond Twitter through:

&#160;

&#183; 

MoPub, our mobile-focused advertising exchange, which combines ad serving, ad network mediation and a real-time bidding exchange into one comprehensive monetization platform. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Twitter Audience Platform, an advertising offering that enables advertisers to extend their advertising campaigns with Twitter Promoted Products to audiences off Twitter while retaining access to Twitter&#8217;s measurement, targeting and creative tools. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Performance marketing offering built upon TellApart technology, which provides retailers and e-commerce advertisers unique retargeting capabilities across desktop and mobile web. 

Products for Developers

We provide a set of tools, public APIs and embeddable widgets that developers can use to contribute their content to our platform, syndicate and distribute Twitter content across their properties and enhance their websites and applications with Twitter content. Websites integrating with Twitter add value to our user experience. Indeed many applications have been registered by developers to enable them to integrate with our platform, and leverage Twitter content to enhance and extend their applications in new and creative ways. The goal of our platform product development is to make it easy for developers to integrate seamlessly with Twitter. 

&#160;

Our Fabric platform offers lightweight modular software development kits that help developers build more stable app lications, gives them mobile analytics, the ability to generate revenue through Twitter&#8217;s mobile-focused advertising exchange, MoPub, and allows them to tap into Twitter&#8217;s sign-in systems for simpler identity verification. Fabric also provides a simple way for developers to incorporate real-time Twitter content for greater syndication. 

Products for Data Partners 

We offer subscription access to our public data feed for partners who wish to access data beyond our public API, which offers a limited amount of our public data for free. Our &#8220;Gnip&#8221; branded products and services offer more sophisticated data sets and better data enrichments to allow developers and businesses to utilize our public content to derive business insights and build products using the unique content that is shared on Twitter.

Competition 

Our business is characterized by rapid technological change, frequent product innovation and continuously evolving user, advertiser, platform partner and developer preferences and expectations. We face significant competition in every aspect of our business, including from companies that provide tools to facilitate communications and the sharing of information, companies that enable marketers to display advertising, other online ad networks, exchanges and platforms, and companies that provide development platforms for application developers. We compete to attract, engage, and retain people who use our products, to attract and retain marketers, and to attract and retain developers to build compelling mobile and web applications that integrate with our products. We also compete to attract and retain employees, especially software engineers, designers, and product managers.

We compete with the following companies:

&#160;

&#183; 

Companies that offer products that enable everyone to create and share ideas and other information. These offerings include, for example, Facebook and Google, as well as largely regional social media and messaging companies that have strong positions in particular countries. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Companies that develop applications, particularly mobile applications, that create, syndicate and distribute content across internet properties. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Traditional, online, and mobile businesses that enable marketers to reach their audiences and/or develop tools and systems for managing and optimizing advertising campaigns. 

As we introduce new products, as our existing products evolve, or as other companies introduce new products and services, we may become subject to additional competition. 

We believe that we compete favorably on the factors described above. However, our industry is evolving rapidly and is becoming increasingly competitive. See the sections titled &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;If we are unable to compete effectively for users and advertiser spend, our business and operating results could be harmed&#8221; and &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;We depend on highly skilled personnel to grow and operate our business, and if we are unable to hire, retain and motivate our personnel, we may not be able to grow effectively.&#8221; 

Technology, Research and Development 

Twitter is composed of a set of core, scalable and distributed services that are built from proprietary and open source technologies. These systems are capable of delivering billions of short messages to hundreds of millions of people a day in an efficient and reliable way. We continue to invest in our existing products and services as well as develop new products and services through research and product development. 

Sales and Marketing 

We have a global sales force and sales support staff that is focused on attracting and retaining advertisers. Our sales force and sales support staff assists advertisers throughout the advertising campaign cycle, from pre-purchase decision making to real-time optimizations as they utilize our campaign management tools, and to post-campaign analytics reports to assess the effectiveness of their advertising campaigns. Our advertisers also use our self-serve advertising platform to launch and manage their advertising campaigns. 

&#160;

Since our inception, our user base has grown primarily by word-of-mouth. Historically, we have built our bran d through these efforts and increased usage of Twitter worldwide with relatively minimal marketing costs. However, we began to spend more on sales and marketing in 2015 than we have had historically, and expect our sales and marketing expense to continue t o increase in absolute dollars in 2016. 

Intellectual Property 

We seek to protect our intellectual property rights by relying on federal, state and common law rights in the United States and other countries, as well as contractual restrictions. We generally enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors, and confidentiality agreements with other third parties, in order to limit access to, and disclosure and use of, our confidential information and proprietary technology. In addition to these contractual arrangements, we also rely on a combination of trademarks, trade dress, domain names, copyrights, trade secrets and patents to help protect our brand and our other intellectual property. 

As of December 31, 2015, we had 990 issued patents in the United States and foreign countries relating to message distribution, graphical user interfaces, security and related technologies. Our issued United States patents are expected to expire between 2016 and 2033. 

We may be unable to obtain patent or trademark protection for our technologies and brands, and our existing patents and trademarks, and any patents or trademarks that may be issued in the future, may not provide us with competitive advantages or distinguish our products and services from those of our competitors. In addition, any patents and trademarks may be contested, circumvented or found unenforceable or invalid, and we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing, diluting or otherwise violating them. 

In May 2013, we implemented our Innovator&#8217;s Patent Agreement, or IPA, which we enter into with our employees and consultants, including our founders. We implemented the IPA because we were concerned about the recent proliferation of offensive patent lawsuits, including lawsuits by &#8220;non-practicing entities.&#8221; We are also encouraging other companies to implement the IPA in an effort to reduce the number of patents with offensive rights that may be transferred to third parties, including non-practicing entities. We believe that a reduction in the number of patents with transferrable offensive rights may reduce the number of offensive lawsuits that may be filed, particularly by non-practicing entities. 

The IPA limits our ability to prevent infringement of our patents. S ee the section titled &#8220;Risk Factors &#8212;Our intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products, services and brand&#8221; for a further discussion of the IPA. 

Companies in the Internet, technology and media industries own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement, misappropriation, or other violations of intellectual property or other rights. In addition, various &#8220;non-practicing entities&#8221; that own patents and other intellectual property rights often attempt to aggressively assert their rights in order to extract value from technology companies. We are presently involved in a number of intellectual property lawsuits, and from time to time we face, and we expect to face in the future, allegations that we have infringed or otherwise violated the patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, and other intellectual property rights of third parties, including our competitors and non-practicing entities. As we face increasing competition and as our business grows, we will likely face more intellectual property-related claims and litigation matters. For additional information, see the sections titled &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;We are currently, and expect to be in the future, party to intellectual property rights claims that are expensive and time consuming to defend, and, if resolved adversely, could have a significant impact on our business, financial condition or operating results&#8221; and &#8220;Legal Proceedings.&#8221; 

Government Regulation 

We are subject to a number of U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations that involve matters central to our business. These laws and regulations may involve privacy, rights of publicity, data protection, content regulation, intellectual property, competition, protection of minors, consumer protection, taxation or other subjects. Many of these laws and regulations are still evolving and being tested in courts and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. In addition, the application and interpretation of these laws and regulations often are uncertain, particularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate. 

&#160;

We are also subject to federa l, state and foreign laws regarding privacy and the protection of user data. Foreign data protection, privacy, consumer protection, content regulation and other laws and regulations are often more restrictive than those in the United States. There are also a number of legislative proposals pending before the U.S. Congress, various state legislative bodies and foreign governments concerning data protection that could affect us. For example, regulation relating to the 1995 European Union Data Protection Direc tive is currently being considered by European legislative bodies that may include more stringent operational requirements for entities processing personal information and significant penalties for non-compliance. 

In March 2011, to resolve an investigation into various incidents, we entered into a settlement agreement with the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, that, among other things, requires us to establish an information security program designed to protect non-public consumer information and also requires that we obtain biennial independent security assessments. The FTC investigation was the result of two separate incidents in which unauthorized intruders obtained administrative passwords of certain Twitter employees. In one of the incidents, the intruder accessed the employee&#8217;s administrative capabilities to fraudulently reset various user passwords and post unauthorized Tweets. The obligations under the settlement agreement remain in effect until the later of March 2, 2031, or the date 20 years after the date, if any, on which the U.S. government or the FTC files a complaint in federal court alleging any violation of the order. Violation of existing or future regulatory orders, settlements, or consent decrees could subject us to substantial monetary fines and other penalties that could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations. 

Twitter users may be restricted from accessing Twitter from certain countries, and other countries have intermittently restricted access to Twitter. For example, Twitter is not directly accessible in China and has been blocked in the past in Turkey. It is possible that other governments may seek to restrict access to or block our website or mobile applications, censor content available through our products or impose other restrictions that may affect the accessibility or usability of Twitter for an extended period of time or indefinitely. For instance, some countries have enacted laws that allow websites to be blocked for hosting certain types of content.

For additional information, see the section titled &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Our business is subject to complex and evolving U.S. and foreign laws and regulations. These laws and regulations are subject to change and uncertain interpretation, and could result in claims, changes to our business practices, monetary penalties, increased cost of operations or declines in user growth, user engagement or ad engagement, or otherwise harm our business.&#8221;
