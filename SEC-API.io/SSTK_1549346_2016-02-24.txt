 Item 1. Business. 

Overview 

We are a leading global provider of high quality creative content including: (a) digital imagery, which consists of licensed photographs, vectors, illustrations and video clips that customers use in their visual communications, such as websites, digital and print marketing materials, corporate communications, books, publications and video content; and (b) commercial music, which consists of high-quality music tracks and sound effects, and is often used to complement digital imagery. We also offer digital asset management services through WebDAM, our cloud-based digital asset management platform. This service provides tools for customers to better manage creative content and brand management assets. 

Our global marketplace brings together users and contributors of creative content from around the world by providing a freely searchable collection of content that our customers can pay to license and incorporate into their work. More than 1.4 million &#32;active, paying customers contributed to our revenue in 2015 . As of December 31, 2015 , more than 95,000 &#32;contributors made their creative content available in our collection, which has grown to more than 70 million &#32;commercially licensable images and more than 3.5 million &#32;video clips in addition to our one-of-a-kind collection of curated high-quality music and our ever-growing catalog of current and archived editorial photographs and videos. This makes our collection of digital content one of the largest of its kind. During 2015 , we delivered more than 140 million &#32;paid downloads to our customers. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Key Operating Metrics&#8212;Paid Downloads" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Key Operating Metrics&#8212;Images in our Collection" for more information as to how we define and calculate paid downloads and images in our collection. 

We compensate contributors for their content that is downloaded by our customers. This marketplace model allows us to offer users a cost-effective and easy-to-use alternative to the time-consuming and expensive traditional methods of obtaining and distributing creative content, while our rigorous vetting process and willingness to provide indemnification protection enables us to provide customers with confidence that our collection has been appropriately licensed for commercial or editorial use. We enable businesses of all sizes throughout the world, including media agencies and creative service providers, to affordably access high-quality creative content to meet their increasing needs. 

We enable customers to license creative content in a way that is affordable, simple and easy in order to encourage a high volume of purchases and downloads. Our customers' average cost per download in 2015 &#32;was $2.84 . See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Key Operating Metrics&#8212;Revenue per Download" for more information as to how we define and calculate average cost, or revenue, per download. The majority of customer downloads come from subscription-based users, who contribute approximately 33% &#32;of our revenue. We also offer simple and easy-to-use On Demand purchase options for users who prefer the flexibility of purchasing content when and as needed. Our simple and affordable licensing models drive a high volume of download activity that in turn enables us to continuously improve the quality and accuracy of our proprietary search algorithms, including keyword and similar image identification, and encourages the creation of new content to meet our customers' needs. 

Our Products 

We offer a variety of content types, including photographs, illustrations, vector art, video clips and music tracks. Users can search our collection and preview our content at no cost before licensing and downloading the content they need. All of our content is provided under a royalty-free non-exclusive license and each piece of content available for download has been vetted by our team of reviewers to ensure that it meets our standards of quality and can be appropriately licensed for commercial or editorial use. Our content offerings are marketed as follows: 

&#8226; 

Shutterstock - Shutterstock is our flagship brand and the majority of our revenue is generated through our shutterstock.com website. Since our founding in 2003, we have expanded our Shutterstock collection beyond photographs to include illustrations and videos, and in 2015 &#32;the collection grew to over 70 million &#32;images and over 3.5 million &#32;video clips, further establishing Shutterstock as a top source of high quality digital imagery for multimedia producers world-wide. 

&#8226; 

Bigstock &#32;- Bigstock maintains an extensive library of unique photos, illustrations, vectors and videos specifically curated to meet the needs of independent creators and others seeking to incorporate cost-effective digital imagery into their projects. 

&#8226; 

Offset &#32;- For high-impact use cases that require extraordinary imagery, our Offset brand provides authentic and exceptional imagery under a straightforward licensing process. Offset features work from top assignment photographers and illustrators from around the world, in addition to established and respected collections including National Geographic and The Licensing Project. Every image in the collection is hand-selected, chosen for its artistic distinction and narrative quality, and is curated into specific categories such as lifestyle, food, travel and fashion. 

&#8226; 

Shutterstock Music &#32;- Shutterstock music provides thousands of high-quality audio tracks and sound effects at affordable prices via its easy-to-use e-commerce platform, giving businesses, marketers, producers and filmmakers the audio content they need to bring their ideas to life. In January 2015, we acquired PremiumBeat, a leading provider of exclusive, high-quality music to enhance the depth of our existing music library and the quality of our overall product in the marketplace. 

&#8226; 

Shutterstock Editorial &#32;- Shutterstock editorial provides editorial imagery, such as celebrity, entertainment, sports and news images to a broad range of customers from traditional media outlets to bloggers by providing a real-time feed of editorial content and an extensive multi-decade archive of iconic photos. In January 2015, Shutterstock acquired Rex Features, the largest independently-owned photographic press agency in Europe, which has provided a strong base for growing our editorial offering. In June 2015, we entered into an exclusive distribution agreement with Penske Media Corporation, or PMC, which provides us with insider access to various events such as the Golden Globe Awards and Academy Awards, exclusive worldwide rights to license PMC's extensive archive that includes Variety and Women's Wear Daily publications, and credibility in the market for editorial content that will allow us to further grow our product offerings. 

In addition to our extensive line of content products, our other products include: 

&#8226; 

WebDAM &#32;- WebDAM provides tools to marketing and creative teams through its digital asset management platform. WebDAM's products help organizations manage, search, distribute and collaborate on creative files in order to grow their brands and reach new audiences, and can be particularly attractive to large enterprises, which make up a growing portion of WebDAM's client base. Our addition of WebDAM has enhanced our strategic position with enterprise customers and broadened our product portfolio. 

Competition 

We compete to be an integral component of the creative process for our customers based on a number of factors including the quality, relevance and breadth of content, the ease and speed of search and fulfillment, pricing and licensing models and practices, and brand recognition and reputation. We also compete for contributors on the basis of a number of similar factors including ease and speed of the upload and content review process, contributor commission models and practices, brand recognition and reputation, and the volume of customers who utilize the submitted content in their work. 

We also leverage, to the greatest extent possible, the global nature of our user interfaces and marketing efforts, including local languages, currencies and payment methods and our effective use of current and emerging technology and marketing channels to attract and retain customers and contributors. We believe that we benefit from significant network effects: as we have grown, our broadening audience of paying users has attracted more content from contributors, and the ever-increasing selection of high-quality content has in turn helped to attract more customers to our sites. The success of this network effect is facilitated by the trust that users place in Shutterstock to maintain the quality and integrity of our branded marketplace, and our commitment to seamless integration into users' creative workflows on all sides. 

Some of our current and potential significant competitors include: 

&#8226; 

other online marketplaces for imagery and workflow tools such as iStockphoto, Adobe's AdobeStock offering which was launched after its acquisition of Fotolia, and Dreamstime; 

&#8226; 

traditional stock content providers such as Getty Images and Corbis Corporation (whose content licensing business was recently acquired by an affiliate of Visual China Group); 

&#8226; 

specialized visual content companies that are established in local, content or product-specific market segments; 

&#8226; 

providers of commercially licensable music such as Universal Music Publishing Group, Sony/ATV Music Publishing, Warner Music Group, and EMI Music Publishing; 

&#8226; 

websites focused on image search and discovery such as Google Images; 

&#8226; 

websites for image hosting, art and related products such as Flickr; 

&#8226; 

other providers of cloud-based digital asset management tools; 

&#8226; 

social networking and social media services; and 

&#8226; 

commissioned photographers and photography agencies. 

In addition, we compete with the alternative of creating one's own content or choosing not to consume licensed content due to price considerations or because the user is not aware of how to do so. 

Purchase Options 

More than 1.4 million &#32;customers from more than 150 countries contributed to our revenue in 2015 , with our top 25 customers in the aggregate accounting for less than 2% &#32;of our revenue. The majority of our customers pay us upfront and then use their downloads in a predictable pattern over time, which results in favorable timing of cash flows. 

We strive to offer simple, transparent purchase options that remove complexity from a customer's workflow. We currently offer the following options: 

&#8226; 

Subscription: Our signature purchase options are our subscription plans, which allow customers to download content under our Standard License, regardless of image size, and experiment with multiple images at no extra cost, which removes friction from their creative process. Subscription plans are offered in varying lengths from one month to one year and in varying download quantities with daily and monthly limits. For the majority of subscription sales, we receive the full amount of the purchase price at the time of sale. Subscription purchase options across all of our product offerings represented approximately 33% &#32;of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 . 

&#8226; 

On Demand: Customers can purchase content through fixed price packages varying in download quantities from one to 60 downloads. This offers customers the simplicity of being able to license content under various licensing options depending upon the customer's specific needs. Upon the purchase of On Demand content, the customer has up to one year to download content before it expires. While the majority of On Demand content revenue comes from our Standard License packages, other forms of On Demand purchases for content include Enhanced Licenses (for customers who need broader licensing rights or higher indemnification than are offered under our Standard License), 

and content licensed through Bigstock and Offset. Our On Demand purchase options represented approximately 38% &#32;of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 . 

&#8226; 

Other Purchase Options: We provide a number of other purchase options which together represented approximately 29% &#32;of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 . These purchase options include custom and enterprise accounts for customers that need multi-seat access, invoicing, unlimited indemnification or a higher volume of content, content purchased through third-party application interfaces and content licensed for editorial use only as well as WebDAM's digital asset management offerings, which are made available to enterprise customers via annual software-as-a-service subscription plans. 

We have achieved significant growth since our marketplace was launched in 2003. In 2015 &#32;and 2014 , we generated revenue of $425.1 million &#32;and $328.0 million , respectively, representing year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 30% . In 2015 &#32;and 2014 , our net income was $19.6 million &#32;and $22.1 million , respectively. 

In evaluating our business, we also use certain financial measures which are not calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP, which we collectively refer to as Non-GAAP Measures. In 2015 &#32;and 2014 , we generated Adjusted EBITDA of $84.7 million &#32;and $71.1 million , respectively, Non-GAAP Net Income of $44.2 million &#32;and $38.6 million , respectively, and Free Cash Flow of $68.3 million &#32;and $64.2 million , respectively. For further detail around the calculation and limitations of these measures, please see "Selected Financial Data&#8212;Non-GAAP Financial Measures." 

Our Customers 

We serve a wide variety of customers across numerous industries, organizational sizes and geographies. As of December 31, 2015 , our customer database contained more than 1.4 million &#32;users in more than 150 &#32;countries that contributed to our revenue in 2015 , with approximately 39% , 34% &#32;and 27% &#32;of revenue coming from customers in North America, Europe and the rest of the world, respectively. Due to our large number of customers, we do not have any material customer concentration, and our top 25 customers in the aggregate accounted for less than 2% of our revenue in 2015 . Our customers are concentrated in one of three categories, all of which require high-quality digital content to achieve their creative goals: 

&#8226; 

Businesses. Business customers require content for a wide range of internal- and external-use communications such as websites, print and digital advertisements, annual reports, brochures, employee communications, newsletters, email marketing campaigns and presentations. Our business users range from sole proprietors to Fortune 500 &#32;companies. 

&#8226; 

Marketing Agencies. Marketing agencies require content to incorporate in the work they produce for their clients' business communications. Whether providing graphic design, web design, interactive design, advertising, public relations, communications or marketing services, our marketing users range from independent freelancers to the largest global agencies. 

&#8226; 

Media Organizations. Media professionals require content to incorporate into their work, which includes digital publications, newspapers, books, magazines, television and film, as well as to market their products effectively. Our media users range from independent bloggers to multi-national publishing and broadcast organizations. 

Content Contributors and Content Review Process 

The content we provide to our users is created by a community of contributors from around the world and is vetted by our specialized team of content reviewers to ensure that it is of the highest quality. Whether photographers, videographers, illustrators, designers or musicians, our community of more than 95,000 &#32;approved contributors as of December 31, 2015 &#32;ranges from part-time enthusiasts to full-time professionals, and all of them must meet our high standards that our customers have come to expect from Shutterstock. 

To become a contributor, an individual must submit an application that includes a sampling of images or video clips. Of more than 1.2 million &#32;contributor applications that had been submitted as of December 31, 2015 , fewer than 10% &#32;have been approved. Once accepted by our review team, contributors can upload as many images or videos as they like. However, every submitted image or video is reviewed to ensure that images and videos in our collection meet our aesthetic and technical quality standards. As of December 31, 2015 , approximately 121 million &#32;images had been submitted to our review team by approved contributors and, of those, approximately 60% , were approved and made available in our marketplace. Each image or video that is rejected by our review team is tagged with at least one rejection reason that is communicated to the submitting contributor to help them to improve and to give insight into our review standards. Such rejection reasons include, among other things, lack of focus, composition, poor lighting, and potential concerns regarding intellectual property rights. We combine proprietary technology and a highly trained content review staff to deliver sophisticated yet efficient image review&#8212;typically, all content submitted is processed within 36 hours of upload. 

Contributors are required to associate keywords with each piece of content they submit in order to make their content more easily discovered using our search algorithms. Keywords usually contain both descriptive terms that literally identify the content of an image (e.g., "padlock") and conceptual terms that describe what an image might convey (e.g., "security"). We currently have over 2.5 billion &#32;contributor-generated keywords in our proprietary database, averaging 37 &#32;keywords per image. 

Content accepted into our collection is added to our websites where it is available for search, selection, license and download. Contributors are typically paid monthly based on how many times their images or video clips have been licensed in the previous month. Contributors may choose to remove their images or video clips from our collection at any time. Due to our large number of contributors, we do not have a material content supply concentration; the content contributed by our five highest-earning contributors was together responsible for less than 3% &#32;of downloads in 2015 . 

Editorial and music content is sourced through direct submission to our content teams and through a number of strategic partnerships. Our acquisitions of PremiumBeat and Rex Features and our partnership with PMC during 2015 further enhance our collection and content acquisition capabilities in these areas. 

We provide different earnings structures to contributors based on content type and customers' licensing needs: 

&#8226; 

Images. Contributors of photographs, illustrations and vector art to our websites are typically paid based on the number of times that their images have been downloaded. The majority of image downloads are licensed under our Standard License, whereby the contributor earns a royalty typically ranging from $0.25 to over $5.00 per download. The exact amount earned is determined by our published earnings schedule which considers the contributor's lifetime earnings which determine the contributor's earnings tier and the purchase option under which the content was licensed. Contributors generally earn more per download when images are licensed under our Enhanced License or are licensed for editorial use only and can typically earn up to 50% of the sales price for each image. 

&#8226; 

Video Footage and Music. Contributors of video footage and music tracks are also generally paid based on the number of times that their video clips or music tracks have been licensed and downloaded. When a video clip or music track is downloaded the contributor is typically paid between 30% and 50% of the sales price per download. In certain limited cases, video and music contributors are paid a one-time up-front perpetual license fee instead of being paid per download. 

In certain cases, we will enter into arrangements with contributors whereby we guarantee a minimum royalty to a contributor, usually paid up-front, in exchange for exclusive rights to distribute content when we believe such exclusivity provides us with a distinct competitive advantage. 

Technology and Infrastructure 

Our technology is critical to our business and all of our products and services are made possible by the proprietary technology and robust infrastructure that we have developed. We believe that delivering intuitive, fast and effective user experiences, supported by robust and scalable technology platforms, is critical to our success. 

We employ technology to support both our public facing websites and our back-office systems. We use a combination of proprietary technologies and commercially available licensed technologies, including open source software. We focus our internal development efforts on creating and enhancing the specialized proprietary software that is unique to our business and we leverage commercially available and open source technologies for our more generalized needs. 

Our customer-facing software enables users to search millions of digital images, illustrations, vectors, video clips and music tracks and then select, organize, pay for, license and download the content they would like to use. Our proprietary search algorithms evolve automatically based on behavioral data, which means that each search and download that a user performs on our websites gives our search engine more information with which to improve. Having delivered over 625 million &#32;paid downloads as of December 31, 2015 , the data that we have collected and the search technology that it powers are an important and proprietary asset. In December 2015, we announced the launch of Shutterstock Editor with the goal of further enhancing the user experience by providing users the ability to customize certain content without leaving their browser, improving the customer's workflow and eliminating time-consuming steps in the creative process. We have also invested in globalizing our e-commerce platform, allowing customers to search and make purchases in twenty &#32;languages and twelve &#32;currencies. 

Another of our customer-facing software platforms is WebDAM, which enables us to better service a broader range of customers by offering a more seamless experience to enterprise users as they license, download, store and share digital assets through WebDAM's cloud-based software platform. 

Our contributor-facing software enables creative professionals around the world to apply to become a contributor, upload and tag content, receive feedback on their submissions from our review team, see reports on earnings and payouts, and participate in online discussion forums with other contributors. We have also developed proprietary tools to enable our 

contributors to improve their success on our websites, including our Keyword Trends Tool that allows contributors to see what terms customers are searching for and how those search terms are trending over time. This tool allows contributors to anticipate demand and generate content that customers may want to license, and is another example of how we combine software and large-scale proprietary datasets to deliver value to our users. 

Our internal software enables the technological and business processes necessary to deliver a high quality experience for customers and contributors. This includes a content review system that allows our review team to efficiently and accurately review the content that is made available on our websites. In addition, we use internally developed software and third party applications that enable customer and contributor support, intellectual property rights and license tracking, centralized invoicing and sales order processing, customer database management, language translation and global contributor payouts, in addition to supporting the compliance, finance and accounting functions. 

Our systems infrastructure is hosted by industry-leading third-party hosting providers that offer 24-hour monitoring, high-speed network access, auxiliary power generators and back-up systems. We maintain multiple production data centers to provide rapid content delivery to our customers and also to support business continuity in the event of an emergency. We also use content delivery network solutions to ensure fast access to our content around the world. Network, website, service and hardware-level monitoring, coupled with remote-content monitoring, allow our systems to maintain a high level of uptime and availability with high-performance delivery. 

Our development teams employ Agile Development methodologies to increase the speed and effectiveness of our technology efforts. We focus on iterative and incremental development processes through which cross-functional teams release software code nearly every day. 

As we continue to grow the business, our technological needs continue to expand and, as such, a continuous level of investment is required for the enhancement of existing products and services and for the development of new products and services. We view our investments in technology as core to our long-term success and we intend to continue to investigate, develop and make increased capital investments in technology and operational systems that support both our current business and new areas of potential business expansion. 

Marketing 

We reach new customers through a diverse set of marketing channels including paid search, online display advertising, print advertising, tradeshows, email marketing, direct mail, affiliate marketing, public relations, social media and partnerships. Marketing activities aim to raise awareness of our brands and attract paying customers to our websites by promoting the key value propositions of our offerings: diverse and high-quality content, intuitive and efficient interfaces and market-leading value. 

The marketing efforts used in generating more revenue for us also help us generate more earnings for our contributors. Increasing revenue helps attract more content, which in turn helps us convert and retain even more paying customers. Furthermore, the high degree of satisfaction that customers have with our product drives word-of-mouth recommendations, which helps our marketing efforts attract an even broader audience than we reach directly. In these ways, we believe our marketing efforts have a self-reinforcing effect, which powers the growth and success of our marketplace. 

Sales and Customer Support 

The significant majority of our revenue is generated via self-serve e-commerce. We encourage our customers to take advantage of the comprehensive search capabilities of our websites, our credit card-based payment options and the immediate digital delivery of licensed content. We believe the ability to search for, select, license and download content over the internet offers our users convenience and speed, and enables us to achieve greater economies of scale. 

Direct communication with our customers, however, remains a significant component of our customer support and sales strategy. Our customer support and sales team is available to assist users via email, chat and phone in twelve &#32;languages. In addition to handling inbound customer support and sales inquiries, we also proactively contact potential high-volume enterprise customers and offer them custom accounts to meet their needs; such outbound sales activities contributed approximately 29% &#32;of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 . 

Product Rights and Intellectual Property 

Product Rights and Indemnification. 

All of the content that we make available to customers on our websites is offered under a perpetual, royalty-free license. This means that once a customer has licensed content from us, that customer can use the associated content in accordance with the license terms in perpetuity without having to pay any ongoing royalties to us. Typically, the content license is non-exclusive, meaning that multiple customers can license the same image, video clip or music track under the applicable Shutterstock license agreement. Furthermore, we do not typically require that contributors of content to our sites provide their content to us on an exclusive basis, with the exception of certain editorial, music and other content to which we have exclusive distribution rights. 

Under our various license agreements, we expressly represent and warrant that unaltered content downloaded and used in compliance with our license agreements and applicable law will not infringe any copyright, trademark or other intellectual property right, violate any third party's rights of privacy or publicity, violate any U.S. law, be defamatory or libelous, or be pornographic or obscene. Provided that a customer has not breached the license agreement or any other agreement with us, we will defend, indemnify, and hold a customer harmless from direct damages attributable to breaches of the express representations and warranties provided in our licenses agreements. From time to time, we agree to customize the license agreements with non-standard indemnification terms. Regardless of customization, indemnification only applies to claims for damages attributable to our breach of the express representations and warranties provided in our license agreement and is generally conditioned on our timely receipt of an indemnification claim and our right to assume the defense of such claim. Our license agreements cap our indemnification obligations at amounts ranging from $10,000 to $250,000, with certain exceptions for which our indemnification obligations are uncapped. Since January 1, 2013, we have not incurred any material financial liability as a result of these indemnification obligations and aggregate amounts paid since that date to settle customer indemnification claims have not been material to our business. We maintain commercially reasonable insurance intended to protect against the costs of intellectual property litigation and our indemnification obligations under our license agreements. 

Intellectual Property. We protect our intellectual property through a combination of patents, trademarks and domain name registrations, copyrights and trade secrets. 

We own a portfolio of trademarks, including "Shutterstock", "Offset", "Bigstock", "Rex Features", "Premium Beat" and "WebDAM" and associated logos. We will pursue additional trademark registrations to the extent that we create any additional material and registrable trademarks or logos. We are the registered owner of a variety of the shutterstock.com, bigstock.com, offset.com, webdam.com, premiumbeat.com, and rexfeatures.com internet domain names and various other related domain names. We have successfully recovered infringing domain names in the past and will continue to enforce our rights in the future. We also own copyrights, including certain content in our websites, publications and designs, as well as patents, including with respect to our display systems and search capabilities. These intellectual property rights are important to our business and marketing efforts. The duration of the protection afforded to our intellectual property depends on the type of property in question, the laws and regulations of the relevant jurisdiction and the terms of our license agreements with others. With respect to our trademarks, trade names and patents, laws and rights are generally territorial in scope and limited to those countries where a mark has been registered or protected. While trademark registrations may generally be maintained in effect for as long as the mark is in use in the respective jurisdictions, there may be occasions where a mark or title is not registrable or protectable or cannot be used in a particular country. In addition, a trademark registration may be canceled or invalidated if challenged by others based on certain use requirements or other limited grounds. 

We protect our intellectual property rights by relying on federal, state, and common law rights, including registration, in the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions, as well as contractual restrictions. We enforce and protect our intellectual property rights through litigation from time to time, and by controlling access to our intellectual property and proprietary technology, in part, by entering into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements with our employees, consultants, contractors, and vendors. In this way, we have historically chosen to protect our software and other technological intellectual property as trade secrets. We further control the use of our proprietary technology and intellectual property through provisions in our websites' terms of use and license agreements 

Government Regulation 

The legal environment of the internet and online content is evolving rapidly in the United States and worldwide. The development of new laws and regulations, the manner in which existing laws and regulations will be applied to the internet and online content in general, and how the foregoing will relate to our business in particular, is unclear in many cases. For example, there is uncertainty regarding how laws and regulations will apply in the online context and to different business models, including with respect to such topics as privacy, data management and cyber-security, defamation, e-commerce, pricing, credit 

card fraud, advertising, taxation, sweepstakes, promotions, subscription-based billing, content regulation, quality of products and services, internet neutrality, outsourcing, and intellectual property ownership and infringement. 

Numerous laws have been adopted at the national and state level in the United States that could have an impact on online commerce generally and on our business. These laws include, for example, the following: 

&#8226; 

The Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003 and similar laws adopted by a number of states regulate the format, functionality and distribution of commercial solicitation e-mails, create criminal penalties for unmarked sexually-oriented material, and control other online marketing practices. 

&#8226; 

The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act and the Prosecutorial Remedies and Other Tools to End Exploitation of Children Today Act of 2003 regulate the collection or use of information, and restrict the distribution of certain materials, as related to certain protected age groups. In addition, the Protection of Children From Sexual Predators Act of 1998 provides for reporting and other obligations by online service providers in the area of child pornography. 

&#8226; 

Federal and state regulatory agencies are accelerating the consideration, adoption and enforcement of rules and guidelines concerning data security measures and reporting of cyberattacks and other security breaches of personal data to affected individuals, to regulatory agencies, to law enforcement officials and to other third parties. 

&#8226; 

The Federal Trade Commission Act and numerous state "mini-FTC" acts bar "deceptive" and "unfair" trade practices, including in the contexts of online advertising and representations made in privacy policies and other online representations. Federal and state regulatory agencies are also accelerating the consideration, adoption and enforcement of rules, regulations and guidelines that govern online service providers' data collection, processing, retention, transfer and use policies and practices, including with respect to the disclosure of consumer data to third parties such as direct marketers. 

Many of these laws and regulations have international analogues that apply to our business and are becoming more strict over time. 

Given the broad spectrum of legal and regulatory uncertainties, we expect new laws and regulations to be adopted over time that are likely to be applicable to the internet and to our activities. Any existing or new legislation applicable to Shutterstock could expose us to substantial liability, including significant expenses necessary to comply with such laws and regulations, to respond to regulatory inquiries or investigations, and to defend individual or class litigation. These events could dampen growth in the use of the internet in general, and cause Shutterstock to divert significant resources and funds to addressing these issues, and possibly require us to change our business practices. 

We post privacy policies on our websites concerning our data collection, use and sharing practices. We have also implemented, and continuously improve upon, various data security measures. Allegations that our policy disclosures are inadequate or that we have failed to comply with our posted privacy policies, that our security measures are insufficient, or that we otherwise violated Federal Trade Commission or state requirements or other privacy-related laws and regulations, could result in proceedings by governmental or regulatory bodies or private parties that could potentially harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, there is a risk that privacy, data security and marketing laws may be interpreted and applied differently in certain jurisdictions, in ways that are not consistent with our current practices, which could also potentially harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. In this regard, there are a large number of legislative and regulatory proposals before the United States Congress, various state legislative bodies, and government agencies regarding privacy, security, marketing and other consumer issues that may affect our business. It is not possible to predict whether or when such rules and regulations may be adopted, or how existing or new rules or regulations could be interpreted by courts or agencies, however, it is possible that the foregoing could harm our business by, among other things, decreasing user registrations and revenue, increasing the cost of compliance, impeding the development of new products or services, and limiting potential sources of revenue such as online advertising. These adverse effects on our businesses could be caused by, among other possible provisions, the required display of specific disclaimers, requirements to obtain consent from users for certain activities, costly security measures or other requirements before users can utilize our services. In addition, we may be subject to claims of liability or responsibility for the actions of third parties with whom we interact or upon whom we rely in relation to various services, including but not limited to vendors, payment processors and business partners. These third parties may be vulnerable to violations of privacy laws, threats such as computer hacking, cyber-terrorism or other unauthorized attempts to access, modify or delete our or our customers' information or business assets that they service or maintain on our behalf. Further, Shutterstock itself may be the target of cyberattacks or other unlawful or unauthorized efforts to access, use, acquire or disclose information that we ourselves maintain, and such information may also be subject to accidental loss, destruction or alteration. 

In addition, there is a significant increase in non-U.S. jurisdictions considering, adopting and enforcing existing and new laws and regulations regarding a broad spectrum of data privacy, data management, data transfer/localization, marketing, anti-spam, data security and other matters related to online businesses and e-commerce. Non-U.S. laws and regulations are often more restrictive than those in the United States and often have extraterritorial application. Due to the global nature of the internet, it is possible that the governments of other states and countries might attempt to regulate our online activities such as digital transmissions, regulate our data privacy and security measures, or prosecute us for alleged violations of their laws. We might violate such laws; such laws or their interpretation or application may be modified; and new laws may be enacted in the future. Any such developments could harm our business, operating results and financial condition. We may be subject to legal liability for our online services. The law relating to the liability of providers of online services for activities of their users is currently unsettled both within the United States and abroad. Claims may also be threatened against us for aiding and abetting, defamation, negligence, copyright or trademark infringement, or other reasons based on the nature and content of information that we collect or use, or to or from which we provide links or that may be posted online. 

In addition, the fiscal authorities of virtually every jurisdiction have expressed significant interest regarding the potential implications of e-commerce business from a taxation perspective. Among these is the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, or the OECD, an international economic organization of 34 countries, including the U.S. and several other major economic powers. There have been a number of studies, and even in some cases legislative initiatives, to identify the streams of e-commerce activities that potentially lead to income and to subject such streams to taxation even though such activities would not be subject to a particular jurisdiction's taxation authority under the traditional concepts of nexus requirement and territorial authority to tax. Even though the OECD, through its Base Erosion and Profit Shifting, or BEPS, initiative, has attempted to develop a coordinated viewpoint among its members to address e-commerce, efforts by various taxing authorities to tax these newly identified streams could be disjointed and uncoordinated. As a result, these initiatives could lead to excess or even double taxation of the same streams of income, and e-commerce businesses may not have efficient tools available to reduce or eliminate such excess taxation. As a result, we and other companies engaged in multi-jurisdictional e-commerce activities may face higher tax costs, both with respect to income tax and transactional taxes, as this area develops. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015 , our global workforce included 627 &#32;full-time employees. None of our employees in the United States are covered by collective bargaining arrangements. In several foreign jurisdictions, including Germany, Canada and France, our employees may be subject to national collective bargaining agreements that set minimum salaries, benefits, working conditions and/or termination requirements. We consider our employee relations to be satisfactory. 

Segments and Geographic Areas 

Information about segment and geographic revenue is set forth in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For a discussion of the risks attendant to foreign operations, see the information in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the heading "Risk Factors" under the caption "Continuing expansion into international markets is important for our growth, and as we continue to expand internationally, we face additional business, political, regulatory, operational, financial and economic risks, any of which could increase our costs or otherwise limit our growth." For a discussion of revenue, net income and total assets, see Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Seasonality 

Our operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of a variety of factors. Our quarterly and annual results may reflect the effects of intra-period trends in customer behavior. For example, we expect certain customers' usage to decrease during the fourth quarter of each calendar year due to the year-end holiday season, and to increase in the first quarter of each calendar year as many customers return to work. While we believe these intra-period trends have affected and will continue to affect our quarterly results, our trajectory of rapid growth may have overshadowed these effects to date. Additionally, because a significant portion of our revenue is derived from repeat customers who have purchased subscription plans, our revenues have historically been less volatile than if we had no subscription-based customers.
