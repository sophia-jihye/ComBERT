 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

&#160; 

Overview 

&#160; 

We are a technology company that is focused on last mile delivery systems. We design, develop, manufacture and sell cost effective high-performance electric medium duty trucks and unmanned aerial delivery systems that are fully integrated with our electric vehicles. We believe our vehicles, engineering expertise, and business model differentiates us from other truck and drone manufacturers.

&#160;

We recently developed Metron&#174; which is a system that provides fleet operators ultimate energy and route efficiency while enabling them to monitor, control and update software remotely. We are also currently in the initial stages of developing a self-driving software to further differentiate us as the technology company with the most cost effective last mile delivery system in the marketplace.

&#160;

After delivery and testing of 2 E-GEN pilot vehicles in 2015, we recently received an initial order from United Parcel Service for 125 E-GEN range-extended trucks and 18 E-100 all-electric trucks. As a result, we are in the process of implementing operations as an original equipment manufacturer.

&#160;

On June 4, 2014, the Company entered into a Vehicle Purchase Agreement with United Parcel Service Inc. (&#8220;UPS&#8221;), pursuant to which the relationship by which the Company would sell vehicles to UPS was outlined. On August 7, 2015, the Company entered into a Prime Order under the Vehicle Purchase Agreement with UPS, pursuant to which UPS agreed to purchase 125 E-GEN trucks. Currently, the schedule agreed to with UPS for the Prime Order requires that we deliver the 125 units to 26 selected UPS facilities across 8 states over a six-month period. However, these deadlines are expected to evolve as UPS operations personnel from eight states will be involved in the scheduling.

&#160;

Workhorse had previously entered into a purchase agreement with UPS to supply 18 all-electric Workhorse E-100 Walk-In Vans to be deployed in the Houston-Galveston, Texas area The U.S. Department of Energy selected this project to improve local air quality in the Houston-Galveston area, which is currently designated as a National Ambient Air Quality Non-Attainment Area. We continue regular deliveries of the E-100 vehicles with all deliveries to be completed by the beginning of the third quarter 2016.

&#160;

We have filed a patent application for the system that extends the range of electric vehicles while reducing the overall cost of the typical battery-electric power train. The system, E-GEN TM , is designed specifically for the package delivery vehicle market, in which the diesel and/or gasoline-powered vehicles in use now are required to stop and restart hundreds of times a day. Our E-GEN system incorporates a small internal combustion engine that powers an integrated electric motor as a generator when the battery pack reaches a pre-determined depth-of-discharge (DOD). The DOD is calculated based on projected route distance, package loads and electricity efficiency curves. The gas engine never propels the vehicle, its task is simple, automatically turn on in the event the battery needs a small re-charge. We believe that the range-extended battery-electric technology is an ideal fit for urban and suburban delivery routes, despite the typical fleet owner's concerns about range and cost. Our E-GEN Drive system will enable our customers to keep their batteries charged to a consistent state of charge throughout the day and, since we are able to use smaller battery packs, we can reduce the cost of the entire system. Our E-GEN trucks offer a three-year payback, making them price competitive with gasoline-powered trucks. As a result, we believe our new design has many benefits, including: 

&#160;

&#160; &#9679; Fleet management flexibility: Depending on our customer&#8217;s driving patterns and fuel cost goals, our E-GEN drive train can be remotely adjusted to use more electric power or more internal combustion engine (ICE) power, at their choice. &#160; &#9679; Energy efficiency and cost of ownership: We have demonstrated our trucks offer customers an attractive total cost-of-ownership profile compared to similar products. Using a single electric power train with a small ICE enables us to create a lighter, more energy efficient vehicle that is mechanically simple. Since we are able to use smaller battery packs, we can reduce the cost of the entire system. Additionally, government incentives can further reduce the cost of ownership. &#160; &#9679; High performance: Driver testimonials have demonstrated unparalleled driving experience, with powerful acceleration for the most demanding applications while also providing the added benefit of an extremely quiet operation. &#160;

We believe the benefits of our new design also provide customers additional benefits, which include:

&#160;

&#160; &#9679; Low Total Cost-of-Ownership &#160;

&#160; &#9679; Gaining a competitive edge to increase market share &#160;

&#160; &#9679; Improving profitability created by &#160;

&#160; o Much lower maintenance costs &#160;

&#160; o Reduced fuel expenses &#160;

&#160; &#9679; Increasing the number of deliveries per day through more efficient delivery methods &#160;

&#160; &#9679; Strengthening sustainability programs &#160;

&#160; &#9679; Improving driver experience and safety &#160;

We have developed and begun delivery of our second generation, full-electric truck, &#8220;E-100&#8221;, which is a significant improvement over our first generation E-100 vehicle. The second-generation vehicle includes a single powerful electric motor with no transmission and lighter, high-density Lithium-ion batteries, giving the vehicle a range of up to 100 miles.

&#160;

In March of 2013, we purchased the former Workhorse Custom Chassis assembly plant in Union City, Indiana from Navistar International (NAV: NYSE). With this acquisition, we acquired the capability to be an Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) of Class 3-6 commercial-grade, medium-duty truck chassis, to be marketed under the Workhorse&#174; brand.

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 4 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Ownership and operation of this plant enables us to build new chassis with gross vehicle weight capacities of between 10,000 and 26,000 pounds. These chassis are our new 88&#8221;-track (W88) and include either of our two second-generation, battery-electric drive trains, both powered by Panasonic 18650 Li-ion cells. The W88 truck chassis is currently being offered to fleet purchasing managers at price points that are both attractive and cost competitive.

&#160;

At the same time, we intend to partner with engine suppliers and body fabricators to offer fleet-specific, custom, purpose-built chassis that provide total cost of ownership solutions that are superior to the competition.

&#160;

In addition to having the ability to build our own chassis, we design and produce battery-electric power trains that can be installed in new Workhorse chassis or installed as repower packages to convert used Class 3-6 medium-duty vehicles from diesel or gasoline power to electric power. Our approach is to provide battery-electric power trains utilizing proven, automotive-grade, mass-produced parts in their architectures, coupled with in-house control software that we have developed over the last five years.

&#160;

The Workhorse Custom Chassis acquisition provides other important assets including the Workhorse brand and logo, intellectual property, schematics, logistical support from Up-Time Parts (a Navistar subsidiary) and, perhaps most importantly, a network of 400-plus sales and service outlets across North America. We believe the combination of our chassis assembly capability, coupled with its ability to offer an array of fuel choices, gives Workhorse a unique opportunity in the marketplace.

&#160;

The Company is also seeking to re-design the future of parcel delivery aviation: HorseFly&#8482;, an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) that is designed for the package delivery market as well as other commercial applications. Our UAV works in tandem with our electric trucks to bring a practical low cost solution to making the last mile more efficient and cost effective for our parcel customers. HorseFly&#8482; is designed to further improve package delivery efficiencies and has been developed in conjunction with the University of Cincinnati, one of the country&#8217;s foremost educational institutions for drone research, and the FAA. Although the FAA rules governing the use of drones have not been finalized, we believe that HorseFly&#8482; is built to comply with the nature of the FAA proposed rules.

&#160;

Recent Developments

&#160;

On August 7, 2015, the Company entered into a Prime Order under the Vehicle Purchase Agreement with UPS, pursuant to which UPS agreed to purchase 125 E-GEN trucks. In addition, Workhorse also received orders for two E-GEN vehicles from UPS for testing, which UPS received in early 2015. These vehicles were immediately put into service and remain in service by UPS in Roswell GA. 

&#160; 

Workhorse had previously entered into a purchase agreement with UPS to supply 18 all-electric Workhorse E-100 Walk-In Vans to be deployed in the Houston-Galveston, Texas area The U.S. Department of Energy selected this project to improve local air quality in the Houston-Galveston area, which is currently designated as a National Ambient Air Quality Non-Attainment Area. We continue regular deliveries of the E-100 vehicles with all deliveries to be completed by the beginning of the third quarter 2016. 

&#160; 

Currently, the schedule agreed to with UPS for the Prime Order requires that we deliver the 125 units to 26 selected UPS facilities across eight states over a six-month period. However, these deadlines are expected to evolve as UPS operations personnel from eight states will be involved in the scheduling. There is no guarantee that the Company will be able to perform under the Prime Order or the E-100 order and, if it does perform, that UPS will purchase additional vehicles from the Company. Further, if the Company is not able to raise the required capital, including to purchase required parts and pay certain vendors, the Company may not be able to comply with UPS&#8217;s deadlines. 

&#160;

The Company responded on March 6, 2015 to a Request for Information and Prequalification (RFI) from the United States Postal Service (USPS) for its Next Generation Delivery Vehicle (NGDV) Acquisition Program. The USPS anticipates making a single award in 2017 to a supplier for up to 180,000 NGDVs to replace its current fleet of mail delivery vehicles. Delivery of the NGDVs to the USPS is expected to begin in 2018. On April 14, 2015, the USPS notified Workhorse that it had advanced in the NGDV Acquisition Program as a prequalified supplier. Workhorse partnered with another pre-qualified supplier to design and build the body and the joint response to the USPS NGDV RFP was delivered by the USPS deadline of February 5, 2016. On March 18, 2016, Workhorse and our body builder partner attended by invitation from the USPS a meeting to present our RFP response and respond to questions. Additionally, proposal revisions incorporating these responses, or other changes proposed, are required for final evaluation of the Postal Service and must be submitted in writing to the Contracting Officer via email no later than 10:00AM, Monday, March 28, 2016. Nine (9) hard copies of the revision volume are also required and must be submitted and received by 12:00PM, Tuesday, March 29, 2016. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

On November 6, 2015 Workhorse was informed by The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) that Workhorse had been granted a Section 333 request for exemption, Exemption No. 13564; Regulatory Docket No. FAA-2015-3055. Workhorse&#8217;s request for exemption is to operate an unmanned aircraft system (UAS) to conduct research and development for the Horse Fly package delivery system. In accordance with the statutory criteria provided in Section 333 of Public Law 112&#8722;95 in reference to 49 U.S.C. &#167; 44704, and in consideration of the size, weight, speed, and limited operating area associated with the aircraft and its operation, the Secretary of Transportation has determined that this aircraft meets the conditions of Section 333. Therefore, the FAA finds that relief from 14 CFR part 21, Certification procedures for products and parts, Subpart H&#8212;Airworthiness Certificates, and any associated noise certification and testing requirements of part 36, is not necessary.

&#160;

Since receiving our Section 333 exemption, we continue to perform live tests of package deliveries using our HorseFly UAS Delivery drone and our Workhorse electric trucks. These tests have taken place at multiple US locations, including the Federal Aviation Administration&#8217;s unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) research and test site in Texas, as well as test sites in Southwest Ohio. 

&#160;

Prior to receiving the Section 333 exemption Workhorse was granted a Certificate of Authorization (COA) by The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to the Ohio/Indiana UAS Center and Test Complex, allowing Workhorse and the University of Cincinnati (UC) to continue their joint development of Workhorse Group's HorseFly&#8482; UAS, which is designed to fly to and from a standard delivery vehicle. Testing of HorseFly will take place at the Wilmington Air Park in Wilmington, OH. Collaboration between the UC's College of Engineering and Applied Science and the Ohio/Indiana UAS Center led to sponsorship for the two-year FAA authorization from the Ohio State Department of Transportation in addition to priority access to Wilmington Air Park.

E-GEN 

In January of 2014, the Company submitted a patent application for a new drive system. This revolutionary design is a range-extended electric drive system that we call the E-GEN. This system is an electric drive, transmission-free system that has a gasoline engine that functions as an auxiliary generator. The generator only runs when the battery pack falls below a pre-determined depth-of-discharge (DOD) based on the delivery profile associated to the specific route. The DOD is calculated based on projected route distance, package loads and electricity efficiency curves. The gas engine never propels the vehicle&#8212;its task is simple, automatically turn on in the event the battery needs a small re-charge. This system combines battery-electric propulsion with a low-horsepower, fossil fuel generator to produce a vehicle that gets up to four times the miles per gallon of its conventional counterpart, thus providing the fleet operator with a solution that has a three-year payback without any government incentives. We believe that this is the ideal solution for the domestic package delivery fleet operators as well as other specialized markets (i.e. shuttle, school, public transportation buses, and specialty-use vehicles). We are currently working with the California Air Resource Board (CARB) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to get approval for this design so it can qualify for governmental incentives. 

&#160;

&#160; 

Our approach to the commercial market is to provide alternative-fueled chassis at competitive prices that are as reliable and consistent, in all aspects, as the Navistar chassis that last rolled off the line in the last quarter of 2012. Our sales strategy targets the Top Fleet Buyers. We have restored purchasing arrangements with key parts suppliers, forged an arrangement for logistics support with UpTime Parts, Inc. and structured an engine pre-development and supply agreement. We have historically sourced multi-fuel engines that function as generators from Power Solutions International (NASDAQ:PSIX). We are currently in discussions with other engine suppliers and may seek to source engines from other sources in the future. 

&#160;

We are focused on the extended range electric E-GEN solution since it offers the customer a solution that provides answers to their key concerns with electric vehicles (i.e. range issues in cold weather, peak season requirements, infrastructure costs, and &#8220;what are my options if there is a power outage?&#8221;). 

&#160;

&#160; 

E-100 

Our E-100 all-electric, medium-duty truck is the second generation full electric power-train that is a significant improvement to our first generation. It includes a single electric motor with no transmission and new lighter, high-density Lithium Ion batteries giving it a range of up to 100 miles. This application has received California Air Resources Board approval for sale in California and is now on the California HVIP list and eligible for incentive purchase. Additionally, we are also approved in New York under the NYSERDA Program and approved for both new trucks and repowers under the Drive Clean Chicago incentive program. 

&#160; 

Chassis: 

&#160; 

W88 

The new W88 chassis is designed to meet the needs of a wide range of customers. At the same time, it is a universal chassis from an operations perspective. We believe that this chassis will be the workhorse of our product offerings. We expect to offer this chassis with gross vehicle weight GVW ratings of 10,000 to 26,000 pounds. It will also be offered with drive train and fuel systems ranging from all-electric, extended range electric EREV utilizing gasoline, propane or CNG, PSI gasoline 6-liter engine, propane, and CNG. 

&#160; 

W22 

The W22 chassis is designed to meet the needs of the recreational vehicle market for weight ratings up to 26,000 GVW. It has been in the marketplace for over 10 years and is well-proven for this application. We will offer this chassis with the PSI 8.8 Liter engine. 

&#160; 

W42 

The W42 chassis is designed for the 12,000 to 14,500 GVW vehicle market. Like the W22 it has been in the marketplace for over 10 years and is well-regarded. 

&#160; 

W62 

The W62 chassis is designed for the 19,500 to 23,500 GVW vehicle market. Like the W22 and W42 it has been in the marketplace for over 10 years and is also well-proven. 

&#160; 

Applications: 

&#160; 

Commercial Step Vans 

&#160; 

Package Delivery Industry: Approximately 80% of the vehicles in this segment operate on a fixed route and travel fewer than 100 miles per day, stop more than 100 times within an average duty cycle of eight to ten hours, and return to an indoor distribution center. The best examples include: UPS, FEDEX, FEDEX Ground, DHL, and Purolator. 

&#160; 

Product Delivery Industry : Approximately 70% of the vehicles in this segment operate on a fixed route and travel fewer than 100 miles per day, stop between 50 and 100 times within an average duty cycle of eight to ten hours, and return to a distribution center that is either indoors, or the vehicles are stored at the dock, or in an outdoor lot adjacent to the distribution facility. Examples are: Frito-Lay, Pepsi, Coke, Aramark, Bimbo Bakeries, Peapod, and other grocery delivery services. 

&#160; 

Laundry and Uniform Service Industry: Approximately 60% of the vehicles in this segment operate on a fixed route and travel approximately 100 miles per day, stop between 30 and 50 times within an average duty cycle of eight to ten hours, and return to a laundry facility where the vehicles are stored outside the facility. Cintas, Aramark, UniFirst, and Diaper Service are examples. 

&#160; 

Food Service Industry: Approximately 80% of the vehicles in this segment operate on a fixed route and travel approximately 100 miles per day stopping between 10 and 30 times within an average duty cycle of eight to ten hours. They return to a commissary facility where the vehicles are stored outside the facility and serviced at this common facility. Food trucks fall into this category. 

&#160; 

Utility Industry: The route that these vehicles follow is dependent on the utility and the energy company&#8217;s territory. Some utilities, for example, are captive to a county or surrounding counties of one large metro area. This model is ideal for a segment of the fleet to be all electric utility vehicles. For the utilities that cover the entire state or even multiple states, CNG, or Hybrid CNG/Electric vehicles are required. 

&#160; 

Special Use Industry: This segment basically consists of what is not already mentioned. SWAT, Warehouse on Wheels i.e. Snap-on-Tools, HVAC, Plumbers, and other service applications that require a large cube storage vehicle fit into this category. 

&#160; 

&#160; 7 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Medium Duty Buses 

&#160; 

The next segment that we believe will have significant volume potential for us is the medium duty bus (108&#8221;H x 95.5 W x 247&#8221;to 286&#8221; L) Para-Transit, Shuttle and School Buses are part of this segment. We are able to offer alternative fuel solutions, as well as innovative E-GEN EREV solutions combined with the Workhorse chassis we believe that this market segment has tremendous potential. 

&#160; 

Special Use Vehicles 

&#160; 

The special use vehicle segment includes emergency vehicles, wreckers, construction equipment, communications equipment and military base application. This segment is similar to Medium-duty buses in terms of volume potential. 

&#160; 

Recreational Vehicles 

&#160; 

The final segment that we believe will have significant volume potential for us is the Class 5 and 6 RV chassis market. We believe that the right combination of drive system and Workhorse chassis has the potential to capture a significant portion of the market. Currently, RV manufacturers only have one option if they want to purchase a class 5 or 6 gasoline chassis for an RV application. 

&#160; 

The data provided above is based on internal company research of the industry. Based on such data, we calculate that the current number of commercial step vans in use in the US is approximately 300,000 units. Today, we believe between 3% and 4% are replaced with new vehicles every year. We believe a number of the larger fleets that effectively utilize commercial step vans replace vehicles at a rate closer to 7% per year. 

&#160;

Unmanned Aerial Vehicles: 

&#160; 

HorseFly&#8482; Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) is designed for the package delivery market as well as other commercial applications.

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Designed to meet the anticipated FAA guidelines expected in 2015 &#160; &#9679; Differentiated from other UAVs as it&#8217;s designed to work in tandem with a Workhorse electric truck (patent pending) &#160; &#9679; Expected to deliver packages, loaded in route by the driver, to remote locations while the driver continues on the main delivery route, saving the fleet operator much of the fuel cost of the most expensive miles &#160; &#9679; HorseFly rejoins the truck at its new location once its delivery is completed &#160; &#9679; HorseFly can recharge from atop the Workhorse truck &#160; &#9679; Superior to other delivery UAV&#8217;s operating plans, where the package is loaded at the warehouse and must return to the warehouse once the delivery is completed &#160;

&#160; 8 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

We partnered with The University of Cincinnati&#8217;s Department of Aerospace Engineering and Engineering Mechanics to develop HorseFly. We believe our unique HorseFly line of drones is designed to be the &#8216;last mile&#8217; solution in delivery logistics. We worked with the University of Cincinnati to develop the HorseFly to meet the rigors of package delivery and to have eight rotors and redundant systems to ensure safety in the air. Today, we estimate that it costs approximately $1 to move a 20,000-pound diesel-powered truck one mile. While we believe our Workhorse trucks can reduce the standard delivery costs from $1 to less than $0.30 cents per mile based on current costs of fuel, we expect that having drones handle the last leg of delivery could further potentially reduce the cost to about $0.03 for the last mile. The all-weather HorseFly battery-powered drone will carry up to 10 pounds of cargo with a 15-mile range. Although the FAA rules governing the use of drones have not been finalized, we believe the HorseFly&#8482; is built to comply with the nature of the FAA proposed rules. The HorseFly&#8482; is differentiated from other drones as it is designed to work in tandem with a Workhorse electric truck. HorseFly will deliver packages, loaded on-route by the truck's driver, to remote locations while the driver continues on the main delivery route. HorseFly will then rejoin the truck at its new location after its delivery is completed, saving the fleet operator much of the time and fuel cost of the last, most expensive, mile. Also, while the HorseFly is atop the Workhorse truck, it can quickly charge its batteries from the truck's large battery pack. We believe this implementation is superior to the proposed deployment of other delivery drones wherein the package is loaded at a distant warehouse and the drone must make a round trip flight to the delivery address and back to the warehouse. Other applications for the HorseFly include transmission line inspections and agricultural surveys.

&#160; 

Summary graph of how UAV delivery works follows:

Technology 

&#160; 

Batteries Are Key 

The battery pack is key to the design, development, and manufacture of advanced electric-vehicle power trains. Where some other EV manufacturers purchase their batteries in a plug-and-play pack, we build our own battery packs. This keeps the intellectual property related to the design and production of the pack in-house and avoids the issues that occur when a battery supplier fails. And it also enables us to pay less for our batteries and pack than do our competitors thus our all-electric truck is less expensive than competitive vehicles. We use the Panasonic or LG Chem 18650 cells and design the pack around these commodity cells. 

&#160; 

In-House Software Development is Essential 

Our power trains encompass the complete motor assemblies, computers, and software required for vehicle electrification. We use off-the-shelf, proven components and combine them with our proprietary software. 

&#160; 

Innovation is the Future 

Additionally, we have developed a cloud-based, remote management system to manage and track the performance of all of the vehicles that we deploy in order to provide a 21st Century solution for fleet managers. 

&#160; 

&#160; 9 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

The telematics system and associated hardware installed the Workhorse vehicles is designed to monitor the CAN network traffic for specific signals. These signals are uploaded along with GPS data to a Workhorse server facility where the data signals are tracked at ten (10) second intervals while driving and during the E-GEN electricity generating process and at sixty (60) seconds during a plug-in charge. The real-time data is stored in a database as it arrives and delivers updates to clients connected through the web interface.

&#160; 10 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Clients are given login credentials (username and password) to the telematics website where they can monitor the performance and location of the vehicles. Group privileges can be configured to limit access to client-specific vehicles securing the vehicle data so clients can only view their vehicle data. Administrator privileges allow all data for all clients to be monitored and viewed.

&#160;

As a parameter-based system, we can set route-specific parameters to better manage the battery-provided power with the additional power generated through the E-GEN process (not applicable to E-100). In an upcoming release, we will add the ability to integrate Metron Telematics with the client&#8217;s internal telematics system and automatically update the parameters each day with information about the route. This enhancement will result in a &#8220;SMART-GEN&#8221; vehicle that will maximize efficiency by automating the process to determine the ideal times and locations to use the E-GEN to add electricity to the batteries.

&#160;

Locations and Facilities 

&#160; 

Our company headquarters and R &#38; D facility is located at 100 Commerce Drive, Loveland, Ohio, a Cincinnati suburb. We occupy a 30,000 sq. ft. facility that allows for the manufacture of 1,000 electric power train kits per year. Power trains will be delivered to the Workhorse facility in Indiana or shipped to our dealer network for onsite installation in conversion vehicles. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Workhorse Group Inc. Location 

&#160; 

Our truck assembly facility is located in Union City, Indiana. This facility consists of three buildings with 270,000 square feet of manufacturing and office space on 46 acres. 

&#160; 

Workhorse Facility 

&#160; 

In March of 2013, we purchased the former Workhorse Custom Chassis assembly plant in Union City, Indiana. With this acquisition, we became an Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) of Class 3-6 commercial-grade, medium-duty truck chassis to be marketed under the Workhorse&#174; brand. 

&#160; 

&#160; 11 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

Ownership and operation of this plant enables us to build new chassis with gross vehicle weight capacity of between 10,000 and 26,000 pounds and to offer them in four different fuel variants&#8212;electric, gas, propane, and CNG. We plan to offer well- known Workhorse chassis as well as a new, 88&#8221; track W88 truck chassis that will be offered to fleet purchasing managers at price points that are both attractive and cost competitive.

&#160; 

At the same time, the Company intends to partner with engine suppliers and body fabricators to offer fleet-specific, custom, purpose-built chassis that provide total cost of ownership solutions that are superior to the competition. 

&#160; 

In addition to building our own chassis, we design and produce battery-electric power trains that can be installed in new Workhorse chassis or installed as repower packages to convert used Class 3-6 medium-duty vehicles from diesel or gasoline power to electric power. Our approach is to provide battery-electric power trains utilizes proven, automotive-grade, mass-produced parts in its architecture coupled with in-house control software that it has developed over the last five years. 

&#160; 

The Workhorse Custom Chassis acquisition includes other important assets including the Workhorse brand and logo, intellectual property, schematics, logistical support from UpTime Parts (a Navistar subsidiary) and, perhaps most importantly, a network of 400 plus sales and service outlets across North America. We believe the combination of Workhorse&#8217;s chassis assembly capability, coupled with its ability to offer an array of fuel choices, gives Workhorse a unique opportunity in the marketplace. 

&#160; 

Marketing 

&#160; 

Our sales team is focused on a targeted list of high profile, former purchasers, and current buyers of the Workhorse chassis with the goal of securing purchase orders from these companies. These purchase orders will give us the first look at next year&#8217;s chassis demand related to electric and extended range electric vehicles.

&#160;

Our priority is to establish the commercial step van as our core business. We intend to be the best choice for a vehicle in this segment regardless of the fuel type that the customer chooses. Our sales plan is to meet with the top potential customers and obtain purchase orders for new electric and extended range electric vehicles for their production vehicle requirements.

&#160;

Finally, since our competitive advantage in the marketplace is our ability to provide purpose-built solutions to customers that have unique requirements at relatively low-volume, we have submitted proposals to companies for purpose-built vehicle applications.

Morgan Olsen, Utilimaster, ECO, and other up-fitters or body fabricators : All of these companies build bodies customized for the needs of their customers and mated to chassis that are available to them from the short list of chassis suppliers. The functionality and configuration the end-user receives in the finished product is limited by the available chassis/powertrain. Workhorse will work with these organizations to provide chassis that not only best fit the needs of the end user customer but also provide the customer with a competitive advantage in their specific industry or application.

Research and Development 

&#160; 

The majority of our research and development is conducted in-house at our facilities near Cincinnati, Ohio. Additionally, we contract with engineering firms to assist with validation and certification requirements as well as specific vehicle integration tasks. 

&#160; 

Competitive Companies 

&#160; 

The medium-duty commercial vehicle market is highly competitive and we expect it to become even more so in the future as additional companies launch competing vehicle offerings. The medium-duty commercial alternatively fueled vehicle market, however, is less developed and competitive. There are two primary competitors in the medium-duty vehicle segment in the US market: Ford and Freightliner. Neither has disclosed any plans to offer 100% EV or EREV vehicles in this segment. Ford is vertically integrated building a complete vehicle or chassis including Ford engine and transmission. They provide a chassis as a strip-chassis (which is similar to the Workhorse product) or they provide it with a cab. Freightliner provides a chassis as a strip-chassis, which is similar to the Workhorse Truck chassis. 

&#160; 

We believe the most dramatic difference between Workhorse and the other competitors in the medium duty truck market is our ability to offer customers purpose-built solutions that meet the needs of their unique requirements at a competitive price. While there are many electric car companies from abroad, there are only a few foreign companies that have vehicles in the category of medium-duty trucks. 

&#160; 

We believe that the primary competitive factors within the medium-duty commercial vehicle market are: 

&#160; 

&#9679; the difference in the initial purchase prices of electric vehicles and comparable vehicles powered by internal combustion engines, both including and excluding the impact of government and other subsidies and incentives designed to promote the purchase of electric vehicles; &#9679; the total cost of vehicle ownership over the vehicle's expected life, which includes the initial purchase price and ongoing operational and maintenance costs; &#9679; vehicle quality, performance and safety; &#9679; government regulations and economic incentives promoting fuel efficiency and alternate forms of energy; &#9679; the quality and availability of service for the vehicle, including the availability of replacement parts. &#160;

&#160; 

GOVERNMENT REGULATION 

&#160; 

Our electric vehicles are designed to comply with a significant number of governmental regulations and industry standards, some of which are evolving as new technologies are deployed. Government regulations regarding the manufacture, sale and implementation of products and systems similar to our electric vehicles are subject to future change. We cannot predict what impact, if any, such changes may have upon our business. We believe that our vehicles are in conformity with all applicable laws in all relevant jurisdictions. 

&#160; 

Emission and fuel economy standards 

&#160; 

Government regulation related to climate change is under consideration at the U.S. federal and state levels. The EPA and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, or NHTSA, issued a final rule for greenhouse gas emissions and fuel economy requirements for trucks and heavy-duty engines on August 9, 2011, which will have an initial phase in starting with model year 2014 and a final phase in occurring in model year 2017. NHTSA standards for model year 2014 and 2015 will be voluntary, while mandatory standards will first come into effect in 2016. 

&#160; 

The rule provides emission standards for CO2 and fuel consumption standards for three main categories of vehicles: (i) combination tractors, (ii) heavy-duty pickup trucks and vans and (iii) vocational vehicles. We believe that the Workhorse chassis would be considered &#8220;vocational vehicles&#34; under the rule. According to the EPA and NHTSA, vocational vehicles consist of a wide variety of truck and bus types, including delivery, refuse, utility, dump, cement, transit bus, shuttle bus, school bus, emergency vehicles, motor homes and tow trucks, and are characterized by a complex build process, with an incomplete chassis often built with an engine and transmission purchased from other manufacturers, then sold to a body manufacturer. 

&#160; 

The EPA and NHTSA rule also establishes multiple flexibility and incentive programs for manufacturers of alternatively fueled vehicles, such as the Workhorse E-100 full electric and the E-Gen Electric, including an engine averaging, banking and trading, or ABT, program, a vehicle ABT program and additional credit programs for early adoption of standards or deployment of advanced or innovative technologies. The ABT programs will allow for emission and/or fuel consumption credits to be averaged, banked or traded within defined groupings of the regulatory subcategories. The additional credit programs will allow manufacturers of engines and vehicles to be eligible to generate credits if they demonstrate improvements in excess of the standards established in the rule prior to the model year the standards become effective or if they introduce advanced or innovative technology engines or vehicles. 

&#160; 

The Clean Air Act requires that we obtain a Certificate of Conformity issued by the EPA and a California Executive Order issued by CARB with respect to emissions for our vehicles. The Certificate of Conformity is required for vehicles sold in states covered by the Clean Air Act's standards and the Executive Order is required for vehicles sold in states that have sought and received a waiver from the EPA to utilize California standards. The California standards for emissions control for certain regulated pollutants for new vehicles and engines sold in California are set by CARB. States that have adopted the California standards as approved by EPA also recognize the Executive Order for sales of vehicles. 

&#160; 

Manufacturers who sell vehicles in states covered by federal requirements under the Clean Air Act without a Certificate of Conformity may be subject to penalties of up to $37,500 per violation and be required to recall and remedy any vehicles sold with emissions in excess of Clean Air Act standards. In 2013, we received approval from CARB to sell the E-100 in California based on our own emissions tests. 

&#160; 

Vehicle safety and testing 

&#160; 

The National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966, or the Safety Act, regulates motor vehicles and motor vehicle equipment in the United States in two primary ways. First, the Safety Act prohibits the sale in the United States of any new vehicle or equipment that does not conform to applicable motor vehicle safety standards established by NHTSA. Meeting or exceeding many safety standards is costly, in part because the standards tend to conflict with the need to reduce vehicle weight in order to meet emissions and fuel economy standards. Second, the Safety Act requires that defects related to motor vehicle safety be remedied through safety recall campaigns. A manufacturer is obligated to recall vehicles if it determines that the vehicles do not comply with a safety standard. Should we or NHTSA determine that either a safety defect or noncompliance exists with respect to any of our vehicles, the cost of such recall campaigns could be substantial.

Battery safety and testing 

&#160; 

Our battery packs conform to mandatory regulations that govern transport of &#34;dangerous goods,&#34; which includes lithium-ion batteries, which may present a risk in transportation. The governing regulations, which are issued by PHMSA, are based on the UN Recommendations on the Safe Transport of Dangerous Goods Model Regulations, and related UN Manual of Tests and Criteria. The requirements for shipments of these goods vary by mode of transportation, such as ocean vessel, rail, truck and air. 

&#160; 

Our battery module suppliers have completed the applicable transportation tests for our prototype and production battery packs demonstrating our compliance with the UN Manual of Tests and Criteria, including: 

&#160; 

&#9679; altitude simulation, which involves simulating air transport; &#9679; thermal cycling, which involves assessing cell and battery seal integrity; &#9679; vibration, which involves simulating vibration during transport; &#9679; shock, which involves simulating possible impacts during transport; &#9679; external short circuit, which involves simulating an external short circuit; and &#9679; overcharge, which involves evaluating the ability of a rechargeable battery to withstand overcharging. &#160; 

Vehicle dealer and distribution regulation 

&#160; 

Certain states' laws require motor vehicle manufacturers and dealers to be licensed in such states in order to conduct manufacturing and sales activities. To date, we are registered as both a motor vehicle manufacturer and dealer in Indiana and Ohio as well as a dealer in California and Chicago. We have not yet sought formal clarification of our ability to manufacture or sell our vehicles in any other states. 

&#160; 

Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

We have five pending trademark applications and nine issued trademark registrations (US and foreign). We also intend to pursue additional foreign trademark registrations. We have two pending non-provisional U.S. patent application, one pending provisional patent application, and six existing patents, two of which are design patents. We also plan to pursue appropriate foreign patent protection on those inventions, if available. The following is a summary of our patents:

Agreements 

&#160; 

Momentum Dynamics and BARTA (Berks County Regional Transportation Authority) 

On December 29, 2012, the Company entered into an Agreement with Momentum Dynamics to engineer, develop, and produce two development vehicles for BARTA in Reading, Pennsylvania. We are seeking to have this project generate the following: promote the use of the Company&#8217;s products for other similar applications i.e. rental car shuttle buses, motel and hotel shuttle buses, school buses, and other hospitality shuttle bus applications, network the Company&#8217;s products through the Momentum Dynamic sales channel, and promote the sale of those products to the Departments of Transportation throughout the US.

&#160;

Navistar International Truck 

In April of 2012 we signed a development agreement with Navistar International Truck. The scope of work for this project was to repower two 2004 vintage W1652 vehicles, which were originally produced by Navistar. Their customer, a large package delivery company, has an interest in repowering these vehicles with something other than the current diesel engine that is in this vehicle. Navistar was interested in working with them to repower these vehicles with either electric or some other fuel system. With electric being the most desirable if the customer&#8217;s price point could be met, the Company was subcontracted by Navistar to perform the electric repower, and in August of 2012 we delivered the first vehicle to Navistar. The vehicle passed their initial performance requirements which were based on their end customer&#8217;s specifications. In October 2012 Navistar turned the project over to us to work directly with them to provide a 100% electric repowered vehicle. Since that time, the Company has been working through the customer requirements and completed all stages of testing and durability.

&#160;
