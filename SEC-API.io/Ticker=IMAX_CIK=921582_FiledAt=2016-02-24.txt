 Item 1. &#160; Business 

GENERAL 

IMAX Corporation, together with its consolidated subsidiaries (the &#147;Company&#148;), is one of the world&#146;s leading entertainment technology companies, specializing in motion picture technologies and presentations. IMAX offers a unique end-to-end cinematic solution combining proprietary software, theater architecture and equipment to create the highest-quality, most immersive motion picture experience for which the IMAX &#174; brand has become known globally. Top filmmakers and studios utilize IMAX theaters to connect with audiences in innovative ways, and as such, IMAX&#146;s theater network is among the most important and successful theatrical distribution platforms for major event films around the world. 

The Company&#146;s principal businesses are: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; the design and manufacture of premium theater systems (&#147;IMAX theater systems&#148;) and the sale, lease or contribution of those systems to customers under theater system arrangements; and &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; the Digital Re-Mastering of films into the IMAX format and the exhibition of those films in the IMAX theater network. IMAX theater systems are based on proprietary and patented technology developed over the course of the Company&#146;s 48-year history. The Company&#146;s customers who purchase, lease or otherwise acquire the IMAX theater systems through joint revenue sharing arrangements are theater exhibitors that operate commercial theaters (particularly multiplexes), museums, science centers, or destination entertainment sites. The Company generally does not own IMAX theaters, but licenses the use of its trademarks along with the sale, lease or contribution of the IMAX theater system. The Company refers to all theaters using the IMAX theater system as &#147;IMAX theaters&#148;. 

IMAX theater systems combine: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; IMAX DMR (Digital Re-Mastering) movie conversion technology, which results in higher image and sound fidelity than conventional cinema experiences; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; advanced, high-resolution projectors with specialized equipment and automated theater control systems, which generate significantly more contrast and brightness than conventional theater systems; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; large screens and proprietary theater geometry, which result in a substantially larger field of view so that the screen extends to the edge of a viewer&#146;s peripheral vision and creates more realistic images; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; sound system components, which deliver more expansive sound imagery and pinpointed origination of sound to any specific spot in an IMAX theater; and &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; specialized theater acoustics, which result in a four-fold reduction in background noise. Together these components cause audiences in IMAX theaters to feel as if they are a part of the on-screen action, creating a more intense, immersive and exciting experience than a traditional theater. 

As a result of the immersiveness and superior image and sound quality of The IMAX Experience , the Company&#146;s exhibitor customers typically charge a premium for IMAX DMR films over films exhibited in their other auditoriums. The premium pricing, combined with the higher attendance levels associated with IMAX DMR films, generates incremental box-office for the Company&#146;s exhibitor customers and for the movie studios releasing their films to the IMAX network. The incremental box-office generated by IMAX DMR films has helped establish IMAX as a key premium distribution and marketing platform for Hollywood blockbuster films. 

The Company believes the IMAX theater network is the most extensive premium theater network in the world with 1,061 theater systems (962 commercial, 99 institutional) operating in 67 countries as at December 31, 2015. This compares to 934 theater systems (828 commercial, 106 institutional) operating in 62 countries as at December 31, 2014. The success of the Company&#146;s digital and joint revenue sharing strategies and the strength of its film slate have enabled the Company&#146;s theater network to expand significantly since the beginning of 2008, with the Company&#146;s overall network increasing by 255% and its commercial network increasing by 437%. In 2015 and 2014, the Company signed theater agreements for 138 and 118 theater systems, respectively, which are expected to drive additional growth in the Company&#146;s theater network in 2016 and thereafter. 

&#160;

The Company has identified approximately 2,450 IMAX zones worldwide. The Company believes that these zones present the potential for the IMAX theater network to grow significantly from the 943 commercial multiplex IMAX theaters in operation as of December 31, 2015. While the Company continues to grow domestically, particularly in small to mid-tier markets, a significant portion of the Company&#146;s recent growth has come from international markets, a trend that the Company anticipates will continue into the future. In fact, starting in 2013, revenues and gross box-office derived from outside the United States and Canada exceeded revenues and gross box-office from the United States and Canada. This trend has continued in 2014 and 2015. In 2015, 87.0% of the Company&#146;s 138 new theater signings were for theaters in international markets. Key international growth markets include Greater China (which includes the People&#146;s Republic of China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macau), Japan, Latin America (which includes South America, Central America and Mexico) and Europe. 

Greater China continues to be the Company&#146;s second-largest and fastest-growing market. In recent years, the Company&#146;s Greater China operations have accounted for an increasingly significant portion of its overall revenues, with approximately 30% of overall revenues generated from the Company&#146;s China operations in 2015. As at December 31, 2015, the Company had 307 theaters operating in Greater China and an additional 215 theaters (including two upgrades) in backlog, which represents 57.8% of the Company&#146;s current backlog and which are scheduled to be installed in Greater China by 2021. The Company continues to invest in joint revenue sharing arrangements with select partners to ensure ongoing revenue in this key market. The Company&#146;s largest single international partnership is in China with Wanda Cinema Line Corporation (&#147;Wanda&#148;). Wanda&#146;s total commitment to the Company is for 210 IMAX theater systems, of which 195 theater systems are under the parties&#146; joint revenue sharing arrangement. Furthermore, the Company has a partnership with CJ CGV Holdings, Ltd., for a commitment of 120 IMAX theater systems, of which 100 theater systems will reside in China. 

Recent developments involving the Company&#146;s China operations include the sale and issuance of 20% of the shares of the Company&#146;s subsidiary, IMAX China Holding, Inc. (&#147;IMAX China&#148;), to entities owned and controlled by CMC Capital Partners (&#147;CMC&#148;), an investment fund that is focused on media and entertainment, and FountainVest Partners (&#147;FountainVest&#148;), a China-focused private equity firm (collectively, the &#147;IMAX China Investment&#148;). The sale price for the interest was $80.0 million, and was paid by the investors in two equal installments on April 8, 2014 and February 10, 2015. 

In addition, on October 8, 2015, IMAX China completed an initial public offering of its ordinary shares on the Main Board of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange Limited (the &#147;IMAX China IPO&#148;). Following the IMAX China IPO, the Company continues to indirectly own approximately 68.5% of IMAX China, which remains a consolidated subsidiary of the Company, while CMC and FountainVest continue to own approximately 5.7% each of IMAX China. 

The Company believes that there have been a number of financial, strategic and operating benefits resulting from both the IMAX China Investment and the IMAX China IPO. With respect to the IMAX China Investment, the Company believes that the investors&#146; knowledge of, and influence in, the Chinese media and entertainment industry has contributed to the continued expansion of IMAX&#146;s theater network in China and the further strengthening of the Company&#146;s government and industry relationships. In addition, the Company believes that the IMAX China IPO provides investors the ability to directly access and evaluate the IMAX China business, and provides greater clarity into the business&#146;s performance in the fastest-growing entertainment market in the world. 

The Company believes that the China market presents opportunities for additional growth with favorable market trends, including government initiatives to foster cinema screen growth, to support the film industry and to increase the number of Hollywood films distributed in China. Such initiatives include a 2012 agreement between the U.S. and Chinese governments to permit 14 additional IMAX or 3D format films to be distributed in China each year and to permit distributors to receive higher distribution fees. The Company cautions, however, that its increasing dependence on its operations in China involve a number of risks. See Risk Factors &#150; &#147;The Company faces risks in connection with the continued expansion of its business in China&#148; in Item 1A. 

Over the years, several technological breakthroughs have established IMAX as an important distribution platform for Hollywood&#146;s biggest event films. These include: 

&#160;

&#149; &#160; DMR &#150; IMAX&#146;s proprietary DMR technology digitally converts live-action digital films or 35mm to its large-format, while meeting the Company&#146;s high standards of image and sound quality. In a typical IMAX DMR film arrangement, the Company will receive a percentage, which in recent years has ranged from 10-15%, of net box-office receipts of a film from the film studio in exchange for the conversion of the film to the IMAX DMR format and for access to the IMAX distribution platform. At December 31, 2015, the Company had released 241 IMAX DMR films since the introduction of IMAX DMR in 2002. The number of films released on an annual basis that have been converted through the DMR process has increased significantly in recent years with the advent of digital technology that has reduced the DMR conversion time and with the strengthening of the Company&#146;s relationships with major Hollywood studios. Accordingly, 44 films converted through the IMAX DMR process were released in 2015, as compared to six in 2007. &#160;

&#149; &#160; IMAX Xenon-based Digital Projection System &#150; The Company introduced its xenon-based digital projection system in 2008. Prior to 2008, all of IMAX&#146;s large format projectors were film-based and required analog film prints. The IMAX xenon-based digital projection system, which operates without the need for such film prints, was designed specifically for use by commercial multiplex operators and allows operators to reduce the capital and operating costs required to run an IMAX theater without sacrificing the image and sound quality of The IMAX Experience . By making The IMAX Experience more accessible for commercial multiplex operators, the introduction of the IMAX xenon-based digital projection system paved the way for a number of important joint revenue sharing arrangements which have allowed the Company to rapidly expand its theater network. Since announcing that the Company was developing xenon-based digital projection technology, the vast majority of the Company&#146;s theater system signings have been for xenon-based digital systems. As at December 31, 2015, the Company has signed agreements for 1,287 xenon-based digital systems since 2007, 127 of which were signed in 2015 alone. As at December 31, 2015, 939 IMAX xenon-based digital projection systems were in operation, an increase of 14.9% over the 817 xenon-based digital projection systems in operation as at December 31, 2014 and 348 IMAX xenon-based digital projection systems were in backlog as compared to 326 xenon-based digital systems in backlog as at December 31, 2014. &#160;

&#149; &#160; IMAX Laser-based Digital Projection System &#150; As one of the world&#146;s leaders in entertainment technology, the Company strives to remain at the forefront of advancements in cinema technology. Accordingly, one of the Company&#146;s key short-term initiatives has been the development of its next-generation laser-based digital projection system, which it began rolling out at the end of 2014. In order to develop the laser-based digital projection system, the Company obtained exclusive rights to certain laser projection technology and other technology with applicability in the digital cinema field from Eastman Kodak Company (&#147;Kodak&#148;) in 2011 and entered a co-development arrangement with Barco N.V. (&#147;Barco&#148;) to co-develop a laser-based digital projection system that incorporates Kodak technology in 2012. Furthermore, in 2014, the Company announced an agreement with Necsel IP, Inc. (&#147;Necsel&#148;) to be the exclusive worldwide provider of specified lasers for IMAX&#146;s laser-based digital projection systems in exchange for preferred pricing and supply terms. The Company believes that these arrangements with Kodak, Barco and Necsel enable IMAX laser-based digital projectors to present greater brightness and clarity, higher contrast, a wider color gamut and deeper blacks, and consume less power and last longer than existing digital technology. The laser projection solution is the first IMAX digital projection system capable of illuminating the largest screens in its network. As of December 31, 2015, 18 laser-based digital theater systems were operational. The Company is also undertaking new lines of business, particularly in the area of home entertainment. In 2013, the Company announced new home theater initiatives, including a joint venture with TCL Multimedia Technology Holding Limited (&#147;TCL&#148;) to design, develop, manufacture and sell a premium home theater system. In June 2015, the Company and TCL unveiled the new premium home theater system in Shanghai, and expect to focus sales of the new system in China, the Middle East and other select global markets. To date, the Company has signed agreements for more than 80 premium home theater systems. Beyond its premium home theater system, the Company is also developing other components of a broader home entertainment platform designed to allow consumers to experience elements of The IMAX Experience &#174; in their homes. 

In addition to the design and manufacture of premium theater systems, the Company is also engaged in the production and distribution of original large-format films, the provision of services in support of the IMAX theater network, the provision of post-production services for large-format films, the operation of three IMAX theaters and, from time-to-time the conversion of two-dimensional (&#147;2D&#148;) and three-dimensional (&#147;3D&#148;) Hollywood feature films for exhibition on IMAX theater systems around the world. 

In 2014, the Company announced the creation of the IMAX Original Film Fund (the &#147;Film Fund&#148;) to co-finance a portfolio of 10 original large-format films. The Film Fund, which is intended to be capitalized with up to $50.0 million, will finance an ongoing supply of original films that the Company believes will be more exciting and compelling than traditional documentaries. The initial investment in the Film Fund was committed to by a third party in the amount of $25.0 million, with the possibility of contributing additional funds. The Company, which will contribute $9.0 million to the Film Fund over five years starting in 2014, anticipates the 

&#160;

Film Fund will be self-perpetuating, with a portion of box office proceeds reinvested into the Film Fund to generate a continuous, steady flow of high-quality documentary content. 

Furthermore, on June 16, 2015, the Company announced the creation of the IMAX China Film Fund (the &#147;China Film Fund&#148;) with its subsidiary IMAX China and its partner CMC to help fund Mandarin language commercial films. The China Film Fund, which is expected initially to be capitalized with $50.0 million, will target productions that can leverage the Company&#146;s brand, relationships, technology and release windows in China. 

IMAX Corporation, a Canadian corporation, was formed in March 1994 as a result of an amalgamation between WGIM Acquisition Corp. and the former IMAX Corporation (&#147;Predecessor IMAX&#148;). Predecessor IMAX was incorporated in 1967. 

PRODUCT LINES 

The Company believes it is the world&#146;s largest designer and manufacturer of specialty premium projection and sound system components for large-format theaters around the world, as well as a significant producer and distributor of large-format films. The Company&#146;s theater systems include specialized IMAX projectors, advanced sound systems and specialty screens. The Company derives its revenues from: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; IMAX theater systems (design, manufacture, sale or lease of, and provision of services related to, its theater systems); &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Films (production and digital re-mastering of films, the distribution of film products to the IMAX theater network, post-production and print services for films); &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Joint revenue sharing arrangements (the provision of its theater system to an exhibitor in exchange for a certain percentage of theater revenue and, in some cases, a small upfront or initial payment); &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Theater system maintenance (the use of maintenance services related to its theater systems); and &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Other activities, which include theater operations (owning equipment, operating, managing or participating in the revenues of IMAX theaters), the sale of after-market parts and camera rentals. Segmented information is provided in note 19 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements in Item 8. 

IMAX Theater Systems, Theater System Maintenance and Joint Revenue Sharing Arrangements 

The Company&#146;s primary products are its theater systems. The Company&#146;s digital projection systems include a projector that offers superior image quality and stability and a digital theater control system; a six or twelve-channel, digital audio system delivering up to 12,000 watts of sound; a screen with a proprietary coating technology, and, if applicable, 3D glasses cleaning equipment. IMAX&#146;s digital projection system also operates without the need for analog film prints. Traditional IMAX film-based theater systems contain the same components as the digital projection systems but include a rolling loop 15/70-format projector and require the use of analog film prints. Since its introduction in 2008, the vast majority of the Company&#146;s theater sales have been digital systems. Furthermore, a majority of the Company&#146;s existing film-based theater systems have been upgraded, at a cost to the exhibitor, to an IMAX digital system. As part of the arrangement to sell or lease its theater systems, the Company provides extensive advice on theater planning and design and supervision of installation services. Theater systems are also leased or sold with a license for the use of the world-famous IMAX brand. IMAX theater systems consist of the following configurations: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; IMAX digital systems, which are digital-based theater systems, represent 90.2% of the IMAX theater network; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; IMAX GT projection systems, which are film-based theater systems for the largest IMAX theaters; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; IMAX SR systems, which are film-based theater systems for smaller theaters than the IMAX GT systems; and &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; theater systems featuring heavily curved and tilted screens that are used in dome-shaped theaters. The Company has installed 18 laser-based digital theater systems and is expecting the roll-out of additional laser-based digital systems in 2016. 

The Company&#146;s digital projection system provides a premium and differentiated experience to moviegoers that is consistent with what they have come to expect from the IMAX brand, while providing for the compelling economics and flexibility that digital technology affords. The relatively low cost of a digital file delivery (approximately $100 per movie per system compared to $30 thousand per 2D print and $60 thousand per 3D print for an IMAX analog film print) ensures programming flexibility, which in turn allows theaters to program significantly more IMAX DMR films per year. More programming increases customer choice and potentially increases total box-office revenue significantly. In 2015, 44 films converted through the IMAX DMR process were released to the IMAX theater network as compared to six films in 2007. To date, the Company has contracted for the release of 26 

&#160;

DMR titles to its theater network for 2016; however, the Company expects a similar number of films to be released to the network in 2016 as experienced in 2015. The Company remains in active discussions with all the major studios regarding future titles for 2016 and beyond. Furthermore, the Company expects to announce both additional local language IMAX DMR films and original and alternative content to be released to the IMAX theater network in 2016 and beyond. Supplementing the Company&#146;s film slate of Hollywood DMR titles with appealing local DMR titles is an important component of the Company&#146;s international film strategy. 

To complement its viewing experience, the Company provides digital sound system components which are specifically designed for IMAX theaters. These components are among the most advanced in the industry and help to heighten the realistic feeling of an IMAX presentation, thereby providing IMAX theater systems with an important competitive edge over other theater systems. The Company believes it is a world leader in the design and manufacture of digital sound system components for applications including traditional movie theaters, auditoriums and IMAX theaters. 

The GT, SR and IMAX digital systems are &#147;flat&#148; screens that have a minimum of curvature and tilt and can exhibit both 2D and 3D films, while the screen components in dome shaped theaters are 2D only and are popular with the Company&#146;s institutional clients. All IMAX theaters, with the exception of dome configurations, feature a steeply inclined floor to provide each audience member with a clear view of the screen. The Company holds patents on the geometrical design of IMAX theaters. 

The Company&#146;s arrangements for theater system equipment involve a sale, sales-type lease or joint revenue sharing arrangement. As part of the purchase, lease or other acquisition of an IMAX theater system, the Company also advises the customer on theater design, supervises the installation of the theater systems and provides projectionists with training in using the equipment. The supervision of installation requires that the equipment also be put through a complete functional start-up and test procedure to ensure proper operation. Theater owners or operators are responsible for providing the theater location, the design and construction of the theater building, the installation of the system components and any other necessary improvements, as well as the theater&#146;s marketing and programming. The Company&#146;s typical arrangement also includes trademark license rights whose term tracks the term of the underlying agreement. The theater system equipment components (including the projector, sound system, screen system, and, if applicable, 3D glasses cleaning machine), theater design support, supervision of installation, projectionist training and trademark rights are all elements of what the Company considers the system deliverable (the &#147;System Deliverable&#148;). For a separate fee, the Company provides ongoing maintenance and extended warranty services for the theater system. The Company&#146;s contracts are generally denominated in U.S. dollars, except in Canada, China, Japan and parts of Europe, where contracts are sometimes denominated in local currency. 

Sales-type leases typically have an initial 10-year term and are typically renewable by the customer for one or more additional 5 to 10-year terms. Under the terms of the typical lease agreement, the title to the theater system equipment (including the projector, the sound system and the projection screen) remains with the Company. The Company has the right to remove the equipment for non-payment or other defaults by the customer. The contracts are generally not cancelable by the customer unless the Company fails to perform its obligations. 

Under a sales agreement, by contrast, the title to the theater system equipment components passes to the customer. In certain instances, however, the Company retains title or a security interest in the equipment until the customer has made all payments required under the agreement. 

The typical sales-type lease or sales arrangement provides for three major sources of cash flows for the Company: (i) initial fees; (ii) ongoing minimum fixed and contingent fees; and (iii) ongoing maintenance and extended warranty fees. Initial fees generally are received over the period of time from the date the arrangement is executed to the date the equipment is installed and customer acceptance has been received. However, in certain cases, the payments of the initial fee may be scheduled over a period of time after the equipment is installed and customer acceptance has been received. Ongoing minimum fixed and contingent fees and ongoing maintenance and extended warranty fees are generally received over the life of the arrangement and are usually adjusted annually based on changes in the local consumer price index. The ongoing minimum fixed and contingent fees generally provide for a fee which is the greater of a fixed amount or a certain percentage of the theater box-office. The terms of each arrangement vary according to the configuration of the theater system provided, the cinema market and the film distribution market relevant to the geographic location of the customer. 

The Company also offers certain commercial clients IMAX theater systems under joint revenue sharing arrangements. The Company has two basic types of joint revenue sharing arrangements: traditional and hybrid. Under a traditional joint revenue sharing arrangement, the Company provides the IMAX theater system in return for a portion of the customer&#146;s IMAX box-office receipts and, in some cases, concession revenues, rather than requiring the customer to pay a fixed upfront payment or annual minimum payments. Payments, which are based on box-office receipts, are required throughout the term of the arrangement and are due either monthly or 

&#160;

quarterly. Certain maintenance and extended warranty services are provided to the customer for a separate fixed annual fee. The Company retains title to the theater system equipment components, and the equipment is returned to the Company at the conclusion of the arrangement. 

Under a hybrid joint revenue sharing arrangement, by contrast, the customer is responsible for making upfront payments prior to the delivery and installation of the IMAX theater system in an amount that is typically half of what the Company would receive from a straight sale transaction. As with a traditional joint revenue sharing arrangement, the customer also pays the Company a portion of the customer&#146;s IMAX box-office receipts over the term of the arrangement, although the percentage of box-office receipts owing to the Company is typically half that of a traditional joint revenue sharing arrangement. The Company generally retains title to the theater system equipment components, and the equipment is returned to the Company at the conclusion of the arrangement. In limited instances, however, title to the theater system equipment components passes to the customer. 

Under the significant majority of joint revenue sharing arrangements (both traditional and hybrid), the initial non-cancellable term of IMAX theater systems is 10 years or longer, and is renewable by the customer for one to two additional terms of between three to five years. The Company has the right to remove the equipment for non-payment or other defaults by the customer. The contracts are non-cancellable by the customer unless the Company fails to perform its obligations. In rare cases, the contract provides certain performance thresholds that, if not met by either party, allow the other party to terminate the agreement. By offering arrangements in which exhibitors do not need to invest the significant initial capital required of a sales-type lease or a sale arrangement, the Company has been able to expand its theater network at a significantly faster pace than it had previously. As at December 31, 2015, the Company has entered into joint revenue sharing arrangements for 741 systems with 43 partners, 529 of which were in operation as at December 31, 2015. 

In 2012, Dalian Wanda Group Co., Ltd. (&#147;Dalian Wanda&#148;), the parent company of Wanda, acquired AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (&#147;AMC&#148;). Under common ownership, Wanda and AMC together is the Company&#146;s largest customer, representing approximately 16.0%, 14.5% and 13.9% of the Company&#146;s total revenue in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. In addition, Wanda and AMC together represented approximately 31.1% of the commercial network and 18.8% of the Company&#146;s backlog as of December 31, 2015. See Risk Factors &#150; &#147;Under common ownership, Wanda and AMC together account for a significant and growing portion of the Company&#146;s revenue and backlog. A deterioration in the Company&#146;s relationship with Wanda and/or AMC could materially, adversely affect the Company&#146;s business, financial condition or results of operations.&#148; in Item 1A. 

Sales Backlog. 

The Company&#146;s sales backlog is as follows: 

&#160;

&#160; &#160; December 31, 2015 &#160; &#160; December 31, 2014 &#160; &#160; &#160; Number of Systems &#160; &#160; Dollar Value (in thousands) &#160; &#160; Number of Systems &#160; &#160; Dollar Value (in thousands) &#160; Sales and sales-type lease arrangements

&#160; &#160; 212 &#160; &#160; &#160; 63,056 &#160; &#160; &#160; 221 &#160; &#160; &#160; 45,648 &#160; &#160; &#160; 372 (1)(2) &#160; &#160; $ 270,914 &#160; &#160; &#160; 397 (1)(3) &#160; &#160; $ 269,130 &#160; &#160;

(1) Includes 24 laser-based digital theater system configurations (2014 &#150; 71), including upgrades. The Company continues to develop and roll out its laser-based digital projection system. See &#147;Research and Development&#148; in this Part I for additional information. (2) Includes 15 upgrades to a digital theater system, in existing IMAX theater locations (two xenon and 13 laser). (3) Includes 27 upgrades to a digital theater system, in existing IMAX theater locations (two xenon and 25 laser, of which four are under joint revenue sharing arrangements). The number of theater systems in the backlog reflects the minimum number of commitments under signed contracts. The dollar value fluctuates depending on the number of new theater system arrangements signed from year to year, which adds to backlog and the installation and acceptance of theater systems and the settlement of contracts, both of which reduce backlog. Sales backlog typically represents the fixed contracted revenue under signed theater system sale and lease agreements that the Company believes will be recognized as revenue upon installation and acceptance of the associated theater. Sales backlog includes initial fees along with the estimated present value of contractual ongoing fees due over the lease term, however it excludes amounts allocated to maintenance 

&#160;

and extended warranty revenues as well as fees in excess of contractual ongoing fees that may be received in the future. The value of sales backlog does not include revenue from theaters in which the Company has an equity interest, operating leases, letters of intent or long-term conditional theater commitments. The value of theaters under joint revenue sharing arrangements is excluded from the dollar value of sales backlog, although certain theater systems under joint revenue sharing arrangements provide for contracted upfront payments and therefore carry a backlog value based on those payments. The Company believes that the contractual obligations for theater system installations that are listed in sales backlog are valid and binding commitments. 

The following chart shows the number of the Company&#146;s theater systems by configuration, opened theater network base and backlog as at December 31:

(1) Includes two upgrades from film-based theater systems to xenon-based digital theater systems in existing IMAX theater locations (one commercial and one institutional). (2) Backlog includes 13 upgrades to laser-based digital theater systems from xenon-based digital theater systems in existing IMAX theater locations (three commercial and 10 institutional). (3) Includes two upgrades from film-based theater systems to xenon-based digital theater systems in existing IMAX theater locations (all institutional). (4) Backlog includes 25 upgrades to laser-based digital theater systems from xenon-based digital theater systems in existing IMAX theater locations (12 commercial and 13 institutional). The Company estimates that it will install 135 to 140 new theater systems (excluding upgrades) in 2016. The Company&#146;s installation estimates includes scheduled systems from backlog, as well as the Company&#146;s estimate of installations from arrangements that will sign and install in the same calendar year. The Company cautions, however, that theater system installations may slip from period to period over the course of the Company&#146;s business, usually for reasons beyond its control. 

IMAX Digital: Xenon Theater Systems. In July 2008, the Company introduced a proprietary IMAX xenon-based digital projection system that it believes delivers higher quality imagery compared with other digital systems and that is consistent with the Company&#146;s brand. As at December 31, 2015, the Company had installed 939 xenon-based digital theater systems, including 156 upgrades, and has an additional 348 xenon-based digital theater systems in its backlog. 

IMAX Digital: Laser Theater Systems. One of the Company&#146;s key initiatives has been the development of a next-generation laser-based digital projection system, which it began rolling out at the end of 2014. The Company believes the IMAX laser-based digital projectors present greater brightness and clarity, higher contrast, a wider color gamut and deeper blacks, and consume less power and last longer than existing digital technology, capable of illuminating the largest screens in the IMAX theater network. As at December 31, 2015, the Company had installed 18 laser-based digital systems. 

IMAX Flat Screen and IMAX Dome Theater Systems. As at December 31, 2015, there were 67 IMAX flat screen and IMAX Dome theater systems in the IMAX network, as compared to 72 IMAX flat screen and IMAX Dome theater systems as at December 31, 2014. IMAX flat screen and IMAX Dome systems primarily have been installed in institutions such as museums and science centers. Flat screen IMAX theaters were introduced in 1970, while IMAX Dome theaters, which are designed for tilted dome screens, were 

&#160;

introduced in 1973. There have been several significant proprietary and patented enhancements to these systems since their introduction. With the introduction of the IMAX digital theater systems, there has been a decrease in the number of IMAX flat screen theater systems in the network. 

IMAX 3D GT and IMAX 3D SR Theater Systems. IMAX 3D theaters utilize a flat screen 3D system, which produces realistic 3D images on an IMAX screen. As at December 31, 2015, there were 37 IMAX 3D GT and IMAX 3D SR theater systems in operation compared to 45 IMAX 3D GT and IMAX 3D SR theater systems in operation as at December 31, 2014. The decrease in the number of 3D GT and 3D SR theater systems is largely attributable to the conversion of existing 3D GT and 3D SR theater systems to IMAX digital theater systems.

Film Production and Digital Re-mastering (IMAX DMR) 

In 2002, the Company developed a proprietary technology to digitally re-master Hollywood films into IMAX digital cinema package format or 15/70-format film for exhibition in IMAX theaters at a modest cost that is incurred by the Company. This system, known as IMAX DMR, digitally enhances the image resolution of motion picture films for projection on IMAX screens while maintaining or enhancing the visual clarity and sound quality to levels for which The IMAX Experience is known. This technology has enabled the IMAX theater network to release Hollywood films simultaneously with their broader domestic release. The development of this technology was critical in helping the Company execute its strategy of expanding its commercial theater network by establishing IMAX theaters as a key, premium distribution platform for Hollywood films. In a typical IMAX DMR film arrangement, the Company receives a percentage, which in recent years has ranged between 10-15%, of net box-office receipts of any commercial films released in the IMAX network from the applicable film studio for the conversion of the film to the IMAX DMR format and for access to the Company&#146;s premium distribution and marketing platform. 

Other factors beyond the IMAX DMR format, and IMAX&#146;s proprietary projection and sound technology, further differentiate IMAX content from other film content. Filmmakers are choosing IMAX cameras to shoot selected scenes to increase the audience&#146;s immersion in the film and are taking advantage of the unique dimensions of the IMAX screen by shooting the film in a larger aspect ratio. Certain films also enjoy early release windows in IMAX, including Everest: An IMAX 3D Experience and The Walk: The IMAX Experience , which were released one week early in IMAX theaters in September 2015. Several recent films have featured select sequences shot with IMAX cameras including Star Wars: The Force Awakens: An IMAX 3D Experience , released in December 2015; Interstellar: The IMAX Experience , released in November 2014; Transformers: Age of Extinction: An IMAX 3D Experience , released in June 2014; The Hunger Games: Catching Fire: The IMAX Experience , released in November 2013; and Star Trek Into Darkness: An IMAX 3D Experience , released in May 2013. Several upcoming films, including Captain America: Civil War: An IMAX 3D Experience and Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice: An IMAX 3D Experience will contain certain sequences shot using the IMAX cameras. In addition, Marvel&#146;s Avengers: Infinity War &#151; Part 1: An IMAX 3D Experience and Avengers: Infinity War &#151; Part 2: An IMAX 3D Experience are expected to be shot in their entireties using the IMAX cameras, which is the first time a full feature length movie will be filmed with the IMAX cameras. In addition, several recent movies, including Tomorrowland: The IMAX Experience , released in May 2015, Guardians of the Galaxy : An IMAX 3D Experience, released in August 2014, and Oblivion: The IMAX Experience , released in 2013 have featured footage taking advantage of the larger projected IMAX aspect ratio. IMAX theaters therefore serve as an additional distribution platform for Hollywood films, just as home video and pay-per-view are ancillary distribution platforms. In some cases, the Company may also have certain distribution rights to the films produced using its IMAX DMR technology. 

The IMAX DMR process involves the following: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; in certain instances, scanning, at the highest possible resolution, each individual frame of the movie and converting it into a digital image; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; optimizing the image using proprietary image enhancement tools; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; enhancing the digital image using techniques such as sharpening, color correction, grain and noise removal and the elimination of unsteadiness and removal of unwanted artifacts; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; recording the enhanced digital image onto IMAX 15/70-format film or IMAX digital cinema package (&#147;DCP&#148;) format; and &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; specially re-mastering the sound track to take full advantage of the unique sound system of IMAX theater systems. The first IMAX DMR film, Apollo 13: The IMAX Experience, produced in conjunction with Universal Pictures and Imagine Entertainment, was released in September 2002 to 48 IMAX theaters. One of the more recent IMAX DMR films, Spectre: The IMAX 

&#160;

Experience was released in November 2015 to 903 IMAX theaters. Since the release of Apollo 13: The IMAX Experience, to December 31, 2015, an additional 240 IMAX DMR films have been released to the IMAX theater network. 

Recent advances in the IMAX DMR process allow the re-mastering process to meet aggressive film production schedules. The Company has decreased the length of time it takes to reformat a film with its IMAX DMR technology. Apollo 13: The IMAX Experience, released in September 2002, was re-mastered in 16 weeks, while certain current films can be re-mastered in less than one week. The IMAX DMR conversion of simultaneous, or &#147;day-and-date&#148; releases are done in parallel with the movie&#146;s filming and editing, which is necessary for the simultaneous release of an IMAX DMR film with the domestic release to conventional theaters. 

The original soundtrack of a film to be released to the IMAX network is re-mastered for the IMAX six or twelve-channel digital sound systems in connection with the IMAX DMR release. Unlike the soundtracks played in conventional theaters, IMAX re-mastered soundtracks are uncompressed and full fidelity. IMAX sound systems use proprietary loudspeaker systems and proprietary surround sound configurations that ensure every theater seat is in a good listening position. 

The Company believes that the growth in international box-office will continue to be an important driver of future growth for the Company. In fact, during the year ended December 31, 2015, 60.8% of the Company&#146;s gross box-office from IMAX DMR films was generated in international markets. To support growth in international markets, the Company has sought to bolster its international film strategy, supplementing the Company&#146;s film slate of Hollywood DMR titles with appealing local IMAX DMR releases in select markets. In 2015, the Company released eleven local language IMAX DMR films, including eight in China and three in Japan, and in 2014, the Company released seven local language IMAX DMR films, including six in China and one in India. 

In 2015, 44 films were converted through the IMAX DMR process and released to theaters in the IMAX network by film studios as compared to 40 films in 2014. These films were:

The Company also expects to announce both additional local language IMAX DMR films and original and alternative content to be released to the IMAX theater network in 2016 and beyond. Supplementing the Company&#146;s film slate of Hollywood DMR titles with appealing local DMR titles is an important component of the Company&#146;s international film strategy. 

&#160;

Film Distribution 

The Company is also a distributor of large-format films, primarily for its institutional theater partners. The Company generally distributes films which it produces or for which it has acquired distribution rights from independent producers. The Company receives either a percentage of the theater box-office receipts or a fixed amount as a distribution fee. 

Films produced by the Company are typically financed through third parties, whereby the Company will generally receive a film production fee in exchange for producing the film and a distribution fee for distributing the film. The ownership rights to such films may be held by the film sponsors, the film investors and/or the Company. As at December 31, 2015, the Company&#146;s film library consisted of 529 large-format films, which cover such subjects as space, wildlife, music, history and natural wonders. The Company currently has distribution rights with respect to 45 of such films. Large-format films that have been successfully distributed by the Company include: Island of Lemurs: Madagascar, which was released in April 2014 and has grossed over $12.4 million as at the end of 2015; Journey to the South Pacific, which had a limited release in November 2013 and a broader release in 2014 and has grossed $11.4 million as at the end of 2015; To the Arctic 3D, which was released in April 2012 and has grossed over $23.3 million as at the end of 2015; Born to be Wild 3D, which was released by the Company and Warner Bros. Pictures (&#147;WB&#148;) in April 2011 and has grossed over $39.6 million as at the end of 2015; Hubble 3D, which was released by the Company and WB in March 2010 and has grossed over $71.0 million as at the end of 2015; Under the Sea 3D, which was released by the Company and WB in February 2009 and has grossed over $52.3 million as at the end of 2015; Deep Sea 3D, which was released by the Company and WB in March 2006 and has grossed more than $96.7 million as at the end of 2015; SPACE STATION, which was released in April 2002 and has grossed over $127.5 million as at the end of 2015 and T-REX: Back to the Cretaceous, which was released by the Company in 1998 and has grossed over $104.0 million as at the end of 2015. Large-format films have significantly longer exhibition periods than conventional commercial films and many of the films in the large-format library have remained popular for many decades, including the films To Fly! (1976), Grand Canyon &#151; The Hidden Secrets (1984) and The Dream Is Alive (1985). 

Film Post-Production 

IMAX Post/DKP Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, provides film post-production and quality control services for large-format films (whether produced internally or externally), and digital post-production services. 

Other 

Theater Operations 

As at December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company had three owned and operated theaters on leased premises, respectively. In addition, the Company has a commercial arrangement with one theater resulting in the sharing of profits and losses. The Company also provides management services to two theaters. 

Cameras 

The Company rents its proprietary 2D and 3D large-format film and digital cameras to third party production companies. The Company also provides production technical support and post-production services for a fee. All IMAX 2D and 3D film cameras run 65mm negative film, exposing 15 perforations per frame and resulting in an image area nearly 10x larger than standard 35mm film. The Company believes that its film-based 3D camera, which is a patented, state-of-the-art dual and single filmstrip 3D camera, is among the most advanced motion picture cameras in the world and is the only 3D camera of its kind. The IMAX 3D camera simultaneously shoots left-eye and right-eye images and enables filmmakers to access a variety of locations, such as underwater or aboard aircraft. The Company has also developed a high speed 3D digital camera which utilizes a pair of the world&#146;s largest digital sensors. 

Due to the increasing success major Hollywood filmmakers have had with IMAX cameras, the Company has identified the development and manufacture of additional IMAX cameras as an important research and development initiative. 

The Company maintains cameras and other film equipment and also offers production advice and technical assistance to both documentary and Hollywood filmmakers. 

&#160;

MARKETING AND CUSTOMERS 

The Company markets its theater systems through a direct sales force and marketing staff located in offices in Canada, the United States, Greater China, Europe and Asia. In addition, the Company has agreements with consultants, business brokers and real estate professionals to locate potential customers and theater sites for the Company on a commission basis. In 2015, concurrent with the release of Star Wars: The Force Awakens: An IMAX 3D Experience , the Company launched a new &#147;IMAX Movies&#148; brand campaign and a new website designed to reinforce the IMAX difference and a love of movies the Company shares with its fans and with filmmakers. Throughout 2016, an integrated brand campaign is scheduled to include events, local activations, social media, in-theater marketing and traditional and digital advertising. Supported by an updated roster of world-class agencies and a seasoned team of marketing executives, IMAX is committed to investing in the brand on a worldwide basis in 2016 and beyond. 

The commercial multiplex theater segment of the Company&#146;s theater network is now its largest segment, comprising 943 IMAX theaters, or 88.9%, of the 1,061 IMAX theaters open as at December 31, 2015. The Company&#146;s institutional customers include science and natural history museums, zoos, aquaria and other educational and cultural centers. Over the last several years the Company has not been able to digitally upgrade many of the institutional locations due to the size of the screens. The development of the IMAX digital laser-based system, which was recently demonstrated to members of the institutional community, and the completion of the Film Fund should assist in supporting this segment of the Company&#146;s customer base. The Company also sells or leases its theater systems to theme parks, private home theaters, tourist destination sites, fairs and expositions (the Commercial Destination segment). At December 31, 2015, approximately 58.5% of all opened IMAX theaters were in locations outside of the United States and Canada. 

The following table outlines the breakdown of the theater network by type and geographic location as at December 31:

INDUSTRY AND COMPETITION 

In recent years, as the motion picture industry has transitioned from film projection to digital projection, a number of companies have introduced digital 3D projection technology and, since 2008, an increasing number of Hollywood features have been exhibited using these technologies. According to the National Association of Theater Owners, as at December 31, 2015, there were approximately 16,770 conventional-sized screens in North American multiplexes equipped with such digital 3D systems. In 2008, the Company introduced its proprietary digitally-based projector which is capable of 2D and 3D presentations on large screens and which comprises the majority of its current theater system sales. Over the last several years, a number of commercial exhibitors have introduced their own large screen branded theaters, while certain projection manufacturers and entertainment technology companies 

&#160;

have also announced their own proprietary theater systems. The Company believes that all of these alternative film formats deliver images and experiences that are inferior to The IMAX Experience . 

The Company may also face competition in the future from companies in the entertainment industry with new technologies and/or substantially greater capital resources to develop and support them. The Company also faces in-home competition from a number of alternative motion picture distribution channels such as home video, pay-per-view, video-on-demand, DVD, Internet and syndicated and broadcast television. The Company further competes for the public&#146;s leisure time and disposable income with other forms of entertainment, including gaming, sporting events, concerts, live theater, social media and restaurants. 

The Company believes that its competitive strengths include the value of the IMAX brand name, the premium IMAX consumer experience, the design, quality and historic reliability rate of IMAX theater systems, the return on investment of an IMAX theater, the number and quality of IMAX films that it distributes, the relationships the Company maintains with prominent Hollywood filmmakers, a number of whom desire to film portions of their movies with IMAX cameras, the quality of the sound system components included with the IMAX theater, the availability of Hollywood event films to IMAX theaters through IMAX DMR technology, consumer loyalty and the level of the Company&#146;s service and maintenance and extended warranty efforts. The Company believes that its next-generation laser-based projection system increases further the technological superiority of the consumer experience it delivers. The Company believes that all of the best performing premium theaters in the world are IMAX theaters. 

THE IMAX BRAND 

IMAX is a world leader in entertainment technology. The Company relies on its brand to communicate its leadership and singular goal of creating entertainment experiences that exceed all expectations. Top filmmakers and studios use the IMAX brand to message that a film will connect with audiences in unique and extraordinary ways. The IMAX brand is a promise to deliver what today&#146;s movie audiences crave &#151; a memorable, more emotionally engaging, more thrilling and shareable experience. Consumer research conducted in six countries worldwide by a leading third-party research firm shows that the IMAX brand has near universal awareness, creates a special experience and is by far the most differentiated movie-going brand. On a standardized measure of brand equity, the IMAX brand ranged from two to ten times more powerful than other exhibition and entertainment technology brands. The Company believes that its strong brand equity supports consumers&#146; predisposition to choose IMAX over competing brands and to pay a premium for The IMAX Experience now and into the future. IMAX brand strength is evidenced by growing market share, high average ticket prices and per screen averages that outperform the industry. 

In 2015, concurrent with the release of Star Wars: The Force Awakens: An IMAX 3D Experience , the Company launched a new &#147;IMAX Movies&#148; brand campaign and a new website designed to reinforce the IMAX difference and a love of movies the Company shares with its fans and with filmmakers. Throughout 2016, an integrated brand campaign is scheduled to include events, local activations, social media, in-theater marketing and traditional and digital advertising. Supported by an updated roster of world-class agencies and a seasoned team of marketing executives, IMAX is committed to investing in the brand on a worldwide basis in 2016 and beyond. 

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT 

The Company believes that it is one of the world&#146;s leading entertainment technology companies with significant proprietary expertise in digital and film-based projection and sound system component design, engineering and imaging technology, particularly in 3D. During 2013 and 2014, the Company increased its level of research and development in order to develop its next-generation laser-based projection system. The laser-based projection system provides greater brightness and clarity, higher contrast, a wider color gamut and deeper blacks, while consuming less power and lasting longer than existing digital technology, to ensure that the Company continues to provide the highest quality, premier movie going experience available to consumers. The Company intends for additional research and development to continue in 2016 to support the further development of the laser-based digital projection system. In addition, the Company plans to continue research and development activity in the future in other areas considered important to the Company&#146;s continued commercial success, including further improving the reliability of its projectors, developing and manufacturing more IMAX cameras, enhancing the Company&#146;s 2D and 3D image quality, expanding the applicability of the Company&#146;s digital technology, and using such technology to help expand the Company&#146;s home entertainment platform, developing IMAX theater systems&#146; capabilities in both home and live entertainment and further enhancing the IMAX theater and sound system design through the addition of more channels, improvements to the Company&#146;s proprietary tuning system and mastering processes. 

The Company has also made significant investments in other areas of digital technologies, including the development of a proprietary technology to digitally enhance image resolution and quality of motion picture films, the creation of an IMAX digital projector and the licensing of prominent laser illumination technology. Accordingly, the Company holds a number of patents, patents 

&#160;

pending and other intellectual property rights in these areas. In addition, the Company holds numerous digital patents and relationships with key manufacturers and suppliers in digital technology. 

In 2009, the Company developed its first 3D digital camera primarily for use in IMAX documentary productions. Portions of Born to Be Wild 3D and Island of Lemurs: Madagascar were filmed with the IMAX 3D digital camera and the camera has subsequently been used to film footage for Transformers: Age of Extinction: An IMAX 3D Experience, released in June 2014 and over one hour of footage for Interstellar: The IMAX Experience, released in November 2014 and Star Wars: The Force Awakens: An IMAX 3D Experience , released in December 2015. Several upcoming films, including Captain America: Civil War: An IMAX 3D Experience and Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice: An IMAX 3D Experience will contain certain sequences shot using the IMAX cameras and it has been announced that Marvel&#146;s Avengers: Infinity War &#151; Parts 1: An IMAX 3D Experience and Avengers: Infinity War - Part 2: An IMAX 3D Experience will be shot in their entireties using the IMAX camera, which is the first time a full feature length movie will be filmed with the IMAX cameras. Due to the increasing success major Hollywood filmmakers have experienced with IMAX cameras, the Company has identified the development and manufacture of additional IMAX cameras as an important research and development initiative. To that end, the Company is also in process of developing an IMAX 2D digital camera for use by Hollywood directors who are seeking IMAX differentiation for portions of their movies. 

The Company expects to deploy its proprietary expertise in image technology and 3D technology, as well as its proprietary film content and the IMAX brand, for applications in its in-home entertainment technology initiatives, including its premium home theater system with TCL. The premium home theater system incorporates 4K projection technology and incorporates technology that enables the viewing of current theatrical releases that have been digitally re-mastered with IMAX enhancement technology. To date, the Company has signed agreements for more than 80 theater systems. The Company also continues to actively pursue opportunities in newly emerging areas of digital media and entertainment. 

For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, the Company recorded research and development expenses of $12.7 million, $16.1 million and $14.8 million, respectively. As at December 31, 2015, 76 of the Company&#146;s employees were connected with research and development projects.
