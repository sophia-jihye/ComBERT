 Item 1. Business 

&#160;

(a) General Development of Business CIVISTA BANCSHARES, INC. (&#147;CBI&#148;) was organized under the laws of the State of Ohio on February 19, 1987 and is a registered financial holding company under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, as amended. CBI&#146;s office is located at 100 East Water Street, Sandusky, Ohio. CBI and its subsidiaries are sometimes referred to together as the Company. The Company had total consolidated assets of $1,315,041 at December 31, 2015. 

CIVISTA BANK (&#147;Civista&#148;), owned by the Company since 1987, opened for business in 1884 as The Citizens National Bank. In 1898, Civista was reorganized under Ohio banking law and was known as The Citizens Bank and Trust Company. In 1908, Civista surrendered its trust charter and began operation The Citizens Banking Company. The name Civista Bank was introduced during the first quarter of 2015 to solidify our dual Citizens/Champaign brand and distinguish ourselves from the many other Citizens&#146; Banks in existing and prospective markets. Civista maintains its main office at 100 East Water Street, Sandusky, Ohio and operates branch banking offices in the following Ohio communities: Sandusky (2), Norwalk (2), Berlin Heights, Huron, Port Clinton, Castalia, New Washington, Shelby (2), Willard, Greenwich, Plymouth, Shiloh, Akron, Dublin, Plain City, Russells Point, Urbana (2), West Liberty and Quincy. In January 2015, we added a loan production office in Mayfield Heights, Ohio and in March 2015 we acquired the three offices of TCNB Financial Corp. in Dayton, Ohio. Civista accounted for 99.8% of the Company&#146;s consolidated assets at December 31, 2015. 

FIRST CITIZENS INSURANCE AGENCY, INC. (&#147;FCIA&#148;) was formed in 2001 to allow the Company to participate in commission revenue generated through its third party insurance agreement. Assets of FCIA were not significant as of December 31, 2015. 

WATER STREET PROPERTIES (&#147;WSP&#148;) was formed in 2003 to hold properties repossessed by CBI subsidiaries. Assets of WSP were not significant as of December 31, 2015. 

FC REFUND SOLUTIONS, INC. (&#147;FCRS&#148;) was formed in 2012 and remained inactive for the periods presented. Assets of FCRS were not significant as of December 31, 2015. 

FIRST CITIZENS INVESTMENTS, INC. (&#147;FCI&#148;) was formed in the fourth quarter of 2007 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Civista to hold and manage its securities portfolio. The operations of FCI are located in Wilmington, Delaware. 

FIRST CITIZENS CAPITAL LLC (&#147;FCC&#148;) was also formed in the fourth quarter of 2007 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Civista to hold inter-company debt that is eliminated in consolidation. The operations of FCC are located in Wilmington, Delaware. 

&#160;

(b) Industry Segments CBI is a financial holding company. Through its subsidiary bank, the Company is primarily engaged in the business of community banking, which accounts for substantially all of its revenue, operating income and assets. 

&#160;

(c) Narrative Description of Business General 

The Company&#146;s primary business is incidental to the subsidiary bank. Civista, located in Erie, Crawford, Champaign, Cuyahoga, Franklin, Logan, Madison, Montgomery, Summit, Huron, Ottawa and Richland Counties, Ohio, conducts a general banking business that involves collecting customer deposits, making loans, purchasing securities, and offering Trust services. 

Interest and fees on loans accounted for 69% of total revenue for 2015, 67% of total revenue for 2014, and 68% of total revenue for 2013. The Company&#146;s primary focus of lending continues to be real estate loans, both residential and commercial in nature. Residential real estate mortgages comprised 24% of the total loan portfolio in 2015, 23% of the total loan portfolio in 2014 and 23% of the total loan portfolio in 2013. Commercial real estate loans comprised 52% of the total loan portfolio in 2015, 49% in 2014, and 52% in 2013. Commercial and agriculture loans comprised 12% of the total loan portfolio in 2015, 12% in 2014, and 13% in 2013. Civista&#146;s loan portfolio does not include any foreign-based loans, loans to lesser-developed countries or loans to CBI. 

On a parent company only basis, CBI&#146;s primary source of funds is the receipt of dividends paid by its subsidiaries, principally Civista. The ability of Civista to pay dividends is subject to limitations under various laws and regulations and to prudent and sound banking principles. Generally, subject to certain minimum capital requirements, Civista may declare a dividend without the approval of the State of Ohio Division of Financial Institutions unless the total of the dividends in a calendar year exceeds the total net profits of the bank for the year combined with the retained profits of the bank for the two preceding years. At December 31, 2015, Civista had $6,863 net profits available to pay dividends to CBI. 

The Company&#146;s business is not seasonal, nor is it dependent on a single or small group of customers. 

In the opinion of management, the Company does not have exposure to material costs associated with compliance with environmental laws and regulations or material expenditures related to environmental hazardous waste mitigation or cleanup. 

Competition 

The market area for Civista is Erie, Crawford, Cuyahoga, Champaign, Franklin, Logan, Summit, Huron, Ottawa, Madison, Montgomery and Richland Counties in Ohio. Traditional financial service competition for Civista consists of large national and regional financial institutions, community banks, thrifts and credit unions operating within Civista&#146;s market area. Nontraditional sources of competition for loan and deposit dollars come from captive auto finance companies, mortgage banking companies, internet banks, brokerage companies, insurance companies and direct mutual funds. 

Civista experiences intense competition within several of its markets due to the presence of several national, regional and local financial institutions and other service providers. Civista primarily competes based on client service, convenience and responsiveness to customer needs, availability and selection of products, and rates of interest on loans and deposits. However, some of Civista&#146; competitors have greater resources and, as such, higher lending limits, which may adversely affect the ability of Civista to compete. 

Employees 

CBI has no employees. Civista employs approximately 326 full-time equivalent employees to whom a variety of benefits are provided. CBI and its subsidiaries are not parties to any collective bargaining agreements. Management considers its relationship with its employees to be good. 

&#160;

Supervision and Regulation 

The Bank Holding Company Act: As a financial holding company, CBI is subject to regulation under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the BHCA), and the examination and reporting requirements of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve Board). Under the BHCA, CBI is subject to periodic examination by the Federal Reserve Board and is required to file periodic reports regarding its operations and any additional information that the Federal Reserve Board may require. The Federal Reserve Board also has extensive enforcement authority over financial and bank holding companies, including the ability to assess civil money penalties, issue cease and desist and removal orders, and require that a financial or bank holding company divest subsidiaries, including its subsidiary banks. 

Under Federal Reserve Board policy, a financial or bank holding company is expected to act as a source of strength to each of its subsidiary banks. In accordance with this policy, the Federal Reserve Board may require a financial or bank holding company to contribute additional capital to an undercapitalized subsidiary bank and may disapprove of the payment of dividends to shareholders if the Federal Reserve Board believes the payment of such dividends would be an unsafe or unsound practice. 

The BHCA generally limits the activities of a bank holding company to banking, managing or controlling banks, furnishing services to or performing services for its subsidiaries and engaging in any other activities that the Federal Reserve Board has determined to be so closely related to banking or to managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident to those activities. In addition, the BHCA requires every bank holding company to obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve Board prior to acquiring all or substantially all of the assets of any bank or another financial or bank holding company, acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any bank not already majority-owned by it, or merging or consolidating with another financial or bank holding company. 

Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act: The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (&#147;GLBA&#148;) permits qualifying bank holding companies to become financial holding companies and thereby affiliate with securities firms and insurance companies and engage in other activities that are financial in nature. A bank holding company may become a financial holding company if each of its subsidiary banks is well capitalized under the FDIC&#146;s Deposit Insurance Corporation Act of 1991 prompt corrective action provisions, is well managed, and has at least a satisfactory rating under the Community Reinvestment Act, by filing a declaration that the bank holding company wishes to become a financial holding company. In March, 2000, CBI became a financial holding company. No regulatory approval is required for a financial holding company to acquire a company, other than a bank or a savings association, engaged in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to activities that are financial in nature, as determined by the Federal Reserve Board. 

The GLBA defines &#147;financial in nature&#148; to include: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; securities underwriting, dealing and market making; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; insurance underwriting and agency; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; merchant banking; and &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; activities that the Federal Reserve Board has determined to be closely related to banking. &#160;

Transactions with Affiliates, Directors, Executive Officers and Shareholders: Transactions between Civista and its affiliates, including CBI, are subject to Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, and Federal Reserve Board Regulation W, which generally limit the extent to which Civista may engage in &#147;covered transactions&#148; with affiliates and require that the terms of such transactions be the same, or at least as favorable, to Civista as the terms provided in a similar transaction between Civista and an unrelated party. The term &#147;covered transaction&#148; includes the making of loans to an affiliate, the purchase of assets from an affiliate, the issuance of a guarantee on behalf of an affiliate, the purchase of securities issued by an affiliate and other similar types of transactions. 

A bank&#146;s authority to extend credit to executive officers, directors and greater than 10% shareholders, as well as entities such persons control, is subject to Sections 22(g) and 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation O promulgated thereunder by the Federal Reserve Board. Among other things, these loans must be made on terms (including interest rates charged and collateral required) substantially the same as those offered to unaffiliated individuals or be made as part of a benefit or compensation program and on terms widely available to employees, and must not involve a greater than normal risk of repayment. In addition, the amount of loans a bank may make to these affiliated persons is based, in part, on the bank&#146;s capital position, and specified approval procedures must be followed in making loans which exceed specified amounts. 

Banking subsidiaries of financial and bank holding companies are also subject to federal regulation regarding such matters as reserves, limitations on the nature and amount of loans and investments, issuance or retirement of its own securities, limitations on the payment of dividends and other aspects of banking operations. 

Privacy Provisions of Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act: Under the GLBA, federal banking regulators adopted rules that limit the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose non-public information about consumers to non-affiliated third parties. These rules contain extensive provisions on a customer&#146;s right to privacy of non-public personal information. Except in certain cases, an institution may not provide personal information to unaffiliated third parties unless the institution discloses that such information may be disclosed and the customer is given the opportunity to opt out of such disclosure. The privacy provisions of the GLBA affect how consumer information is conveyed to outside vendors. CBI and its subsidiaries are also subject to certain state laws that deal with the use and distribution of non-public personal information. 

Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (&#147;FDIC&#148;): The FDIC is an independent federal agency which insures the deposits of federally-insured banks and savings associations up to certain prescribed limits and safeguards the safety and soundness of financial institutions. The deposits of Civista are subject to the deposit insurance assessments of the FDIC. Under the FDIC&#146;s deposit insurance assessment system, insurance premiums for each insured depository institution are determined based upon the institution&#146;s capital level and supervisory rating provided to the FDIC by the institution&#146;s primary federal regulator and other information that the FDIC determines to be relevant to the risk posed to the Deposit Insurance Fund by the institution. The assessment rate determined by considering such information is then applied to the amount of the institution&#146;s average assets minus average tangible equity to determine the institution&#146;s insurance premium. In addition, the FDIC has proposed changing the deposit insurance premium assessment method for banks with less than $10 billion in assets that have been insured by the FDIC for at least five years. The proposed changes would revise the financial ratios method so that it would be based on a statistical model estimating the probability of failure of a bank over three years; update the financial measures used in the financial ratios method consistent with the statistical model; and eliminate risk categories for established small banks and use the financial ratios method to determine assessments rates for all such banks (subject to minimum or maximum initial assessment rates based upon a bank&#146;s composite examination rating). 

&#160;

The FDIC is authorized to prohibit any insured institution from engaging in any activity that poses a serious threat to the insurance fund and may initiate enforcement actions against a bank, after first giving the institution&#146;s primary regulatory authority an opportunity to take such action. The FDIC may also terminate the deposit insurance of any institution that has engaged in or is engaging in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, order or condition imposed by the FDIC. 

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau: The Dodd-Frank Act established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the &#147;CFPB&#148;), which regulates consumer financial products and services and certain financial services providers. The CFPB is authorized to prevent unfair, deceptive and abusive acts or practices and seeks to ensure consistent enforcement of laws so that consumers have access to fair, transparent and competitive markets for consumer financial products and services. The CFPB has rulemaking and interpretive authority. 

Community Reinvestment Act: The Community Reinvestment Act requires depository institutions to assist in meeting the credit needs of their market areas, including low- and moderate-income areas, consistent with safe and sound banking practice. Under this Act, each institution is required to adopt a statement for each of its market areas describing the depositary institution&#146;s efforts to assist in its community&#146;s credit needs. Depositary institutions are periodically examined for compliance and assigned ratings. Banking regulators consider these ratings when considering approval of a proposed transaction by an institution. 

USA Patriot Act of 2001: The Uniting and Strengthening of America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (&#147;the USA Patriot Act&#148;) gives the United States Government greater powers over financial institutions to combat money laundering and terrorist access to the financial system in our country. The USA Patriot Act requires the Company to establish a program for obtaining identifying information from customers seeking to open new accounts and establish enhanced due diligence policies, procedures and controls designed to detect and report suspicious activity. 

Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002: As mandated by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the SEC has adopted rules and regulations governing, among other matters, corporate governance, auditing and accounting, executive compensation and enhanced and timely disclosure of corporate information. The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (&#147;Nasdaq&#148;) has also adopted corporate governance rules. The Board of Directors of the Company has taken a series of actions to strengthen and improve the Company&#146;s governance practices in light of the rules of the SEC and Nasdaq. The Board of Directors has adopted charters for the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee and the Nominating Committee, as well as a Code of Conduct (Ethics) applicable to all directors, officers and employees of the Company. In addition, in accordance with Section 302(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, written certifications by CBI&#146;s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer are required. These certifications attest that CBI&#146;s quarterly and annual reports filed with the SEC do not contain any untrue statement of a material fact. See Item 9A &#147;Controls and Procedures&#148; in Part II of this Form 10-K for CBI&#146;s evaluation of its disclosure controls and procedures. 

Regulation of Bank Subsidiary: As an Ohio chartered bank, Civista is subject to supervision and regulation by the State of Ohio Department of Commerce, Division of Financial Institutions (ODFI). In addition, Civista is a member of the Federal Reserve System and, therefore, is subject to supervision and regulation by the Federal Reserve Board. Civista is subject to periodic examinations by the ODFI, and Civista is additionally subject to periodic examinations by the Federal Reserve Board. These examinations are designed primarily for the protection of the depositors of the bank and not shareholders. 

Regulatory Capital Requirements: The Federal Reserve Board has adopted risk-based guidelines for financial holding companies and other bank holding companies as well as state member banks, and the FDIC has adopted risk-based capital guidelines for state non-member banks. The guidelines provide a systematic analytical framework which makes regulatory capital requirements sensitive to differences in 

&#160;

risk profiles among banking organizations, takes off-balance sheet exposures expressly into account in evaluating capital adequacy, and minimizes disincentives to holding liquid, low-risk assets. Capital levels as measured by these standards are also used to categorize financial institutions for purposes of certain prompt corrective action regulatory provisions. 

Prior to January 1, 2015, the guidelines included a minimum for the ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets of 8%, with at least half of the ratio composed of common shareholders&#146; equity, minority interests in certain equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries and a limited amount of qualifying preferred stock and qualified trust preferred securities, less goodwill and certain other intangible assets (known as &#147;Tier 1&#148; risk-based capital). The guidelines also provided for a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to average assets, or &#147;leverage ratio,&#148; of 3% for financial holding companies and bank holding companies that met certain criteria, including having the highest regulatory rating, and 4% for all other financial holding companies and bank holding companies. 

The risk-based capital guidelines adopted by the federal banking agencies are based on the &#147;International Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital Standard&#148; (Basel I), published by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the &#147;Basel Committee&#148;) in 1988. In 2004, the Basel Committee published a new capital adequacy framework (Basel II) for large, internationally active banking organizations, and in December 2010 and January 2011, the Basel Committee issued an update to Basel II (&#147;Basel III&#148;). The Basel Committee frameworks did not become applicable to banks supervised in the United States until adopted into United States law or regulations. Although the United States banking regulators imposed some of the Basel II and Basel III rules on banks with $250 billion or more in assets or $10 billion of on-balance sheet foreign exposure, it was not until July 2013 that the United States banking regulators issued final (or, in the case of the FDIC, interim final) new capital rules applicable to smaller banking organizations which also implement certain of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act (the &#147;Basel III Capital Rules&#148;). Community banking organizations, including CBI and Civista, began transitioning to the new rules on January 1, 2015. The new minimum capital requirements became effective on January 1, 2015, whereas a new capital conservation buffer and deductions from common equity capital phase in from January 1, 2016 through January 1, 2019, and most deductions from common equity tier 1 capital will phase in from January 1, 2015 through January 1, 2019. 

The new rules include (a) a new common equity tier 1 capital ratio of at least 4.5%, (b) a Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 6.0%, rather than the former 4.0%, (c) a minimum total capital ratio that remains at 8.0%, and (d) a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0%. 

Common equity for the common equity tier 1 capital ratio includes common stock (plus related surplus) and retained earnings, plus limited amounts of minority interests in the form of common stock, less the majority of certain regulatory deductions. 

Tier 1 capital includes common equity as defined for the common equity tier 1 capital ratio, plus certain non-cumulative preferred stock and related surplus, cumulative preferred stock and related surplus and trust preferred securities that have been grandfathered (but which are not permitted going forward), and limited amounts of minority interests in the form of additional Tier 1 capital instruments, less certain deductions. 

Tier 2 capital, which can be included in the total capital ratio, includes certain capital instruments (such as subordinated debt) and limited amounts of the allowance for loan and lease losses, subject to new eligibility criteria, less applicable deductions. 

The deductions from common equity tier 1 capital include goodwill and other intangibles, certain deferred tax assets, mortgage-servicing assets above certain levels, gains on sale in connection with a securitization, investments in a banking organization&#146;s own capital instruments and investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions (above certain levels). The deductions phase in from 2015 through 2019. 

&#160;

Under the guidelines, capital is compared to the relative risk related to the balance sheet. To derive the risk included in the balance sheet, one of several risk weights is applied to different balance sheet and off-balance sheet assets, primarily based on the relative credit risk of the counterparty. The capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. Some of the risk weightings have been changed effective January 1, 2015. 

The new rules also place restrictions on the payment of capital distributions, including dividends, and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers if the company does not hold a capital conservation buffer of greater than 2.5 percent composed of common equity tier 1 capital above its minimum risk-based capital requirements, or if its eligible retained income is negative in that quarter and its capital conservation buffer ratio was less than 2.5 percent at the beginning of the quarter. The capital conservation buffer phases in starting on January 1, 2016, at 0.625%. The implementation of Basel III is not expected to have a material impact on CBI&#146;s or Civista&#146; capital ratios. 

At December 31, 2015, both CBI and Civista were in compliance with all of the regulatory capital requirements to which they are subject. For CBI&#146;s capital ratios, see Note 19 to the Company&#146;s 2015 Consolidated Financial Statements. 

The Federal Reserve Board has adopted regulations governing prompt corrective action to resolve the problems of capital deficient and otherwise troubled state-chartered member banks. At each successively lower defined capital category, a bank is subject to more restrictive and numerous mandatory or discretionary regulatory actions or limits, and the Federal Reserve Board has less flexibility in determining how to resolve the problems of the institution. In addition, the Federal Reserve Board generally can downgrade a bank&#146;s capital category, notwithstanding its capital level, if, after notice and opportunity for hearings, the bank is deemed to be engaged in an unsafe or unsound practice, because it has not corrected deficiencies that resulted in it receiving a less than satisfactory examination rating on matters other than capital or it is deemed to be in an unsafe or unsound condition. Civista&#146; capital at December 31, 2015, met the standards for the highest capital category, a &#147;well-capitalized&#148; bank. 

Federal Reserve Board regulations also limit the payment of dividends by Civista to CBI. Civista may not pay a dividend if it would cause Civista not to meet its capital requirements. In addition, the dividends that Civista may pay to CBI without prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board is limited to net income for the year plus its retained net income for the preceding two years. 

Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010: Federal regulators continue to implement many provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, which was signed into law by President Obama on July 21, 2010. The Dodd-Frank Act created many new restrictions and an expanded framework of regulatory oversight for financial institutions, including depository institutions. Currently, federal regulators are still in the process of drafting the implementing regulations for some portions of the Dodd-Frank Act. CBI is closely monitoring all relevant sections of the Dodd-Frank Act to ensure continued compliance with these regulatory requirements. 

The Volcker Rule: In December 2013, five federal agencies adopted a final regulation implementing the Volcker Rule provision of the Dodd-Frank Act (the &#147;Volcker Rule&#148;). The Volcker Rule places limits on the trading activity of insured depository institutions and entities affiliated with a depository institution, subject to certain exceptions. The trading activity includes a purchase or sale as principal of a security, derivative, commodity future or option on any such instrument in order to benefit from short-term price movements or to realize short-term profits. The Volcker Rule exempts specified U.S. Government, agency and/or municipal obligations, and it excepts trading conducted in certain capacities, including as a broker or other agent, through a deferred compensation or pension plan, as a fiduciary on behalf of customers, to satisfy a debt previously contracted, repurchase and securities lending agreements and risk-mitigating hedging activities. 

&#160;

The Volcker Rule also prohibits a banking entity from having an ownership interest in, or certain relationships with, a hedge fund or private equity fund, with a number of exceptions. The Company does not engage in any of the trading activities or have any ownership interest in or relationship with any of the types of funds regulated by the Volcker Rule. 

Many aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act are still subject to rulemaking and will take effect over several years, making it difficult to anticipate the overall financial impact on CBI, its subsidiaries, their respective customers or the financial services industry more generally. 

Executive and Incentive Compensation 

In June 2010, the Federal Reserve Board, the OCC and the FDIC issued joint interagency guidance on incentive compensation policies (&#147;Joint Guidance&#148;) intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risk-taking. This principles-based guidance, which covers all employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of an organization, either individually or as part of a group, is based upon the key principles that a banking organization&#146;s incentive compensation arrangements should (a) provide incentives that do not encourage risk-taking beyond the organization&#146;s ability to effectively identify and manage risks, (b) be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management and (c) be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the organization&#146;s board of directors. 

Pursuant to the Joint Guidance, the Federal Reserve Board will review as part of a regular, risk-focused examination process, the incentive compensation arrangements of financial institutions such as CBI. Such reviews will be tailored to each organization based on the scope and complexity of the organization&#146;s activities and the prevalence of incentive compensation arrangements. The findings of the supervisory initiatives will be included in reports of examination and deficiencies will be incorporated into the institution&#146;s supervisory ratings, which can affect the institution&#146;s ability to make acquisitions and take other actions. Enforcement actions may be taken against an institution if its incentive compensation arrangements, or related risk-management control or governance processes, pose a risk to the organization&#146;s safety and soundness and prompt and effective measures are not being taken to correct the deficiencies. 

On February 7, 2011, federal banking regulatory agencies jointly issued proposed rules on incentive-based compensation arrangements under applicable provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act (&#147;Proposed Rules&#148;). The Proposed Rules generally apply to financial institutions with $1.0 billion or more in assets that maintain incentive-based compensation arrangements for certain covered employees. The Proposed Rules (i) prohibit covered financial institutions from maintaining incentive-based compensation arrangements that encourage covered persons to expose the institution to inappropriate risk by providing the covered person with &#147;excessive&#148; compensation, (ii) prohibit covered financial institutions from establishing or maintaining incentive-based compensation arrangements for covered persons that encourage inappropriate risks that could lead to a material financial loss, (iii) require covered financial institutions to maintain policies and procedures appropriate to their size, complexity and use of incentive-based compensation to help ensure compliance with the Proposed Rules and (iv) require covered financial institutions to provide enhanced disclosure to regulators regarding their incentive-based compensation arrangements for covered persons within 90 days following the end of the fiscal year. 

Pursuant to rules adopted by the stock exchanges and approved by the SEC in January 2013 under the Dodd-Frank Act, public companies are required to implement &#147;clawback&#148; procedures for incentive compensation payments and to disclose the details of the procedures which allow recovery of incentive compensation that was paid on the basis of erroneous financial information necessitating a restatement due to material noncompliance with financial reporting requirements. This clawback policy is intended to apply to compensation paid within a three-year look-back window of the restatement and would cover all 

&#160;

executives who received incentive awards. Public company compensation committee members are also required to meet heightened independence requirements and to consider the independence of compensation consultants, legal counsel and other advisors to the compensation committee. The compensation committees must have the authority to hire advisors and to have the company fund reasonable compensation of such advisors. 

Effects of Government Monetary Policy 

The earnings of the Company are affected by general and local economic conditions and by the policies of various governmental regulatory authorities. In particular, the Federal Reserve Board regulates money and credit conditions and interest rates to influence general economic conditions, primarily through open market acquisitions or dispositions of United States Government securities, varying the discount rate on member bank borrowings and setting reserve requirements against member and nonmember bank deposits. Federal Reserve Board monetary policies have had a significant effect on the interest income and interest expense of commercial banks, including Civista, and are expected to continue to do so in the future.

&#160; Commercial loans are those made for commercial, industrial and professional purposes to individuals, sole proprietorships, partnerships, corporations and other business enterprises. Agriculture loans are for financing agricultural production, including all costs associated with growing crops or raising livestock. Commercial and Agriculture loans may be secured, other than by real estate, or unsecured, requiring one single repayment or on an installment repayment schedule. Commercial and Agriculture loans involve certain risks relating to changes in local and national economic conditions and the resulting effect on the borrowing entities. Secured loans not collateralized by real estate mortgages maintain a loan-to-value ratio ranging from 50% in the case of certain stocks, to 100% in the case of savings or time deposit accounts. Unsecured credits rely on the financial strength and previous credit experience of the borrower and in many cases the financial strength of the principals when such credit is extended to a corporation. 

Commercial Real Estate mortgage loans are made predicated on having a security interest in real property and are secured wholly or substantially by that lien on real property. Commercial Real Estate mortgage loans are generally underwritten with a maximum loan-to-value ratio of 80%. 

Residential Real Estate mortgage loans and home equity lines of credit are made predicated on security interests in real property and secured wholly or substantially by those liens on real property. Such real estate mortgage loans are primarily loans secured by one-to-four family real estate. Residential Real Estate mortgage loans generally pose less risk to the Company due to the nature of the collateral being less susceptible to sudden changes in value. 

Real Estate Construction loans are for the construction of residential homes, new buildings or additions to existing buildings. Generally, these loans are secured by one-to-four family real estate or commercial real estate. The Company controls disbursements in connection with construction loans. 

Consumer loans are made to individuals for household, family and other personal expenditures. These expenditures include the purchase of vehicles or furniture, educational expenses, medical expenses, taxes or vacation expenses. Consumer loans may be secured, other than by real estate, or unsecured, generally requiring repayment on an installment repayment schedule. Consumer loans pose a relatively higher credit risk. This higher risk is moderated by the use of certain loan to value limits on secured credits and aggressive collection efforts. The collectability of consumer loans is influenced by local and national economic conditions. 

&#160;

Letters of credit represent extensions of credit granted in the normal course of business, which are not reflected in the Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company was contingently liable for $950 and $1,207, respectively, with respect to outstanding letters of credit. In addition, Civista had issued lines of credit to customers. Borrowings under such lines of credit are usually for the working capital needs of the borrower. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, Civista had commitments to extend credit, excluding letters of credit, in the aggregate amounts of approximately $227,272 and $192,249, respectively. Of these amounts, $205,148 and $170,123 represented lines of credit and construction loans, and $22,124 and $22,126 represented overdraft protection commitments at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Such amounts represent the portion of total commitments that had not been used by customers as of December 31, 2015 and 2014. 

Maturities and Sensitivities of Loans to Changes in Interest Rates 

The following table shows the amount of commercial and agriculture, commercial real estate, residential real estate, real estate construction, farm real estate and consumer and other loans outstanding as of December 31, 2015, which, based on the contract terms for repayments of principal, are due in the periods indicated. In addition, the amounts due after one year are classified according to their sensitivity to changes in interest rates.

(1) A loan is placed on nonaccrual status when doubt exists as to the collectability of the loan, including any accrued interest. With a few immaterial exceptions, commercial and agriculture, commercial real estate, residential real estate and construction loans past due 90 days are placed on nonaccrual unless they are well collateralized and in the process of collection. Generally, consumer loans are charged-off within 30 days after becoming past due 90 days unless they are well collateralized and in the process of collection. Once a loan is placed on nonaccrual, interest is only recognized on a cash basis where future collections of principal is probable. (2) Excludes loans accounted for on a nonaccrual basis. (3) Excludes loans accounted for on a nonaccrual basis and loans contractually past due 90 days or more as to principal or interest payments. There were no loans as of December 31, 2015, other than those disclosed above, where known information about probable credit problems of borrowers caused management to have serious doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with the present loan repayment terms. There were no other interest-bearing assets that would be required to be disclosed in the table above, if such assets were loans as of December 31, 2015. The gross interest income that would have been recorded on nonaccrual loans and restructured loans in 2015 if the loans had been current in accordance with their original terms and had been outstanding throughout the period or since origination, if held for part of the period, was $1,793. The amount of interest income on such loans actually included in net income in 2015 was $799. 

Interest income recognition associated with impaired loans was as follows.

&#160; At December 31, 2015, Civista had two concentrations, one to Lessors of Non-Residential Buildings and Dwellings totaling $227,947, or 22.8 percent of total loans, as of December 31, 2015 and the other to Lessors of Residential Buildings and Dwellings totaling $126,137, or 12.6 percent of total loans, as of December 30, 2015. 

&#160;

These segments of the portfolio are stable and have been conservatively underwritten, monitored and managed by experienced commercial bankers. However, the customers&#146; ability to repay their loans is dependent on the real estate market and general economic conditions in the area. There were no foreign loans outstanding at December 31, 2015.

(1) The amount of net charge-offs fluctuates from year to year due to factors relating to the condition of the general economy, decline in market values of collateral and deteriorization of specific businesses. (2) The determination of the balance of the allowance for loan losses is based on a detailed analysis of the loan portfolio and reflects an amount that, in management&#146;s judgment, is adequate to provide for probable incurred loan losses. Such analysis is based on a review of specific loans, the character of the loan portfolio, current economic conditions, risk management practices and such other factors as management believes require current recognition in estimating probable incurred loan losses. &#160;

Civista measures the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses by using both specific and general components. The specific component relates to the evaluation of each loan identified as impaired. The general component consists of a pooling of commercial credits risk graded as special mention and substandard, based on portfolio experience, and general reserves, which are based on an eight quarter loss migration analysis, adjusted for current economic factors. Factors in the determination of the economic reserve include items such as changes in the economic and business conditions of its market, changes in lending policies and procedures, changes in loan concentrations, as well as a few others. The allowance for loan losses to total loans decreased from 1.56% in 2014 to 1.43% in 2015. The unallocated reserve of Civista decreased to $382 in 2015 from $697 in 2014. Management considers both the decrease in unallocated and the end-of-period number to be insignificant and within the loan policy guidelines.
