 Item 1. Business.

&#160;

Business Overview 

&#160; 

We are a leading producer and marketer of low-carbon renewable fuels in the United States.

&#160;

We own and operate eight strategically-located ethanol production facilities. Four of our plants are in the Western states of California, Oregon and Idaho, or the Pacific Ethanol West plants; and four of our plants are located in the Midwestern states of Illinois and Nebraska, or the Pacific Ethanol Central plants. Our plants have a combined ethanol production capacity of 515 million gallons per year. We are the sixth largest producer of ethanol in the United States based on annualized volumes. We market all the ethanol and co-products produced at our eight plants as well as ethanol produced by third parties. On an annualized basis, we market over 800 million gallons of ethanol and over 1.5 million tons of ethanol co-products on a dry matter basis. Our business consists of two operating segments: a production segment and a marketing segment.

&#160;

Our mission is to advance our position and significantly increase our market share as a leading producer and marketer of low-carbon renewable fuels in the United States. We intend to accomplish this goal in part by expanding our ethanol production capacity and distribution infrastructure, accretive acquisitions, lowering the carbon intensity of our ethanol, extending our marketing business into new regional and international markets, and implementing new technologies to promote higher production yields and greater efficiencies.

&#160;

Production Segment 

&#160; 

We produce ethanol and co-products at our eight production facilities described below. Our Pacific Ethanol West plants are located on the West Coast near their respective fuel and feed customers, offering significant timing, transportation cost and logistical advantages. Our Pacific Ethanol Central plants are located in the Midwest in the heart of the Corn Belt, benefit from low-cost and abundant feedstock production and allow for access to many additional domestic markets. In addition, our ability to load unit trains from the Pacific Ethanol Central plants allows for greater access to international markets.

Marketing Segment 

&#160; 

We market ethanol and co-products produced by our eight ethanol production facilities and market ethanol produced by third parties. We have extensive customer relationships throughout the Western and Midwestern United States. Our ethanol customers are integrated oil companies and gasoline marketers who blend ethanol into gasoline. Our customers depend on us to provide a reliable supply of ethanol, and manage the logistics and timing of delivery with very little effort on their part. Our customers collectively require ethanol volumes in excess of the supplies we produce at our eight production facilities. We secure additional ethanol supplies from third party plants in California and other third party suppliers in the Midwest where a majority of ethanol producers are located. We arrange for transportation, storage and delivery of ethanol purchased by our customers through our agreements with third-party service providers in the Western United States as well as in the Midwest from a variety of sources.

&#160;

We market our distillers grains and other feed co-products to dairies and feedlots, in many cases located near our ethanol plants. These customers use our feed co-products for livestock as a substitute for corn and other sources of starch and protein. We sell our corn oil to poultry and biodiesel customers. We do not market co-products from other ethanol producers.

&#160;

Acquisition of Aventine 

&#160; 

On July 1, 2015, we consummated our acquisition of Aventine Renewable Energy Holdings, Inc., now known as Pacific Ethanol Central, LLC, or Aventine, under the terms of an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of December 30, 2014 by and among Pacific Ethanol, Inc., AVR Merger Sub, Inc., one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, and Aventine. Under the terms of the acquisition, Aventine became one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries.

&#160;

We believe the Aventine acquisition is resulting in a number of synergies and strategic advantages. We believe the acquisition has spread commodity and basis price risks across diverse markets and products, assisting in our efforts to optimize margin management; improve our hedging opportunities with a greater correlation to the liquid physical and paper markets in Chicago; and increase our flexibility and alternatives in feedstock procurement for our Midwest and Western production facilities. The acquisition also expands our marketing reach into new markets and extends our mix of co-products. We believe the acquisition will enable us to have deeper market insight and engagement in major ethanol and feed markets outside the Western United States, thereby improving pricing opportunities; allow us to establish access to markets in 48 states for ethanol sales and access many markets with ethanol and co-product sales reaching domestic and international customers; and enable us to use our more diverse mix of co-products to generate strong co-product returns. In addition, the acquisition increased our combined ethanol production capacity to 515 million gallons per year and increased our annualized ethanol marketing volume to over 800 million gallons.

&#160;

Business Strategy 

&#160; 

Our primary goal is to advance our position and significantly increase our market share as a leading producer and marketer of low-carbon renewable fuels in the United States. The key elements of our business and growth strategy to achieve this objective include:

&#160;

&#183; Expand ethanol production capacity and distribution infrastructure . We believe the United States ethanol production industry is poised for consolidation. We evaluate and intend to pursue opportunities to acquire additional ethanol production, storage and distribution facilities and related infrastructure as financial resources and business prospects make these acquisitions desirable. To this end, we are examining specific opportunities to extend our current production and marketing platform with strategic and synergistic acquisitions. In addition, we plan to expand our distribution infrastructure by increasing our ability to provide transportation, storage and related logistical services to our customers throughout the United States. &#160;

&#183; Lower the carbon intensity of our ethanol . We plan to further reduce the carbon intensity of the ethanol we produce. We are able to sell this lower carbon intensity ethanol in certain regions at premium prices compared to higher carbon intensity ethanol. We are able to charge premium prices for this ethanol based on state laws and regulations, such as Low-Carbon Fuel Standards enacted in California and Oregon that require blenders to use lower carbon intensity ethanol in their gasoline. When available and cost-effective, we intend to use feedstock other than corn, including cellulosic feedstock, as the raw material used in the production of ethanol to further reduce the carbon intensity of our ethanol. &#160;

&#183; Extend our marketing business into new regional and international markets. We have strengthened our market position in the Midwest through our acquisition of Aventine. We intend to pursue opportunities to extend our marketing business into new regional markets within reach from Aventine&#8217;s plants in Illinois and Nebraska. We also plan to leverage our new relationships with Aventine&#8217;s customers to market and sell additional ethanol sourced from third parties. In addition, we are exploring opportunities to market and sell ethanol internationally. &#160;

&#183; Implement new technologies. We intend to continue to evaluate and implement new equipment and technologies to increase the production yields and efficiencies of our ethanol plants, reduce our use of carbon-based fuels, use other feedstocks, and allow us to produce advanced biofuels as financial resources and market conditions justify these investments. &#160;

Competitive Strengths 

&#160; 

We believe that our competitive strengths include the following:

&#160;

&#183; Our customer and supplier relationships . We have extensive business relationships with customers and suppliers in California and other Western states. We have also established extensive business relationships with new customers and suppliers in the Midwest through our acquisition of Aventine. In addition, we have developed extensive business relationships with major and independent un-branded gasoline suppliers who collectively control the majority of all gasoline sales in those regions. &#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 3 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; Our ethanol distribution network . We believe we have a competitive advantage due to our experience in marketing to customers in major metropolitan and rural markets in the Western United States. We have developed an ethanol distribution network for delivery of ethanol by truck to virtually every significant fuel terminal as well as to numerous smaller fuel terminals throughout California and other Western states. Fuel terminals have limited storage capacity and we have successfully secured storage tanks at many of the terminals we service. In addition, we have an extensive network of third-party delivery trucks available to deliver ethanol throughout the Western United States. In the Midwest, we have the benefit at our Nebraska facilities to sell and deliver products in bulk via unit trains providing us access to western, gulf coast and international import markets. Our Illinois facilities provide excellent logistical access via rail, truck and barge. Its relatively unique wet milling process allows us to extract the highest use and value from each component of the corn kernel. As a result, the wet milling process generates a higher level of cost recovery from corn than that produced at a dry mill. Further, the additional higher valued co-products can be sold at premium prices under fixed price, longer term contracts (up to 12 months) thus providing a more stable source or revenue in what can be a volatile commodity industry. &#160;

&#183; Our s trategic locations . We operate our eight ethanol plants in markets where we believe their individual locations, as well as our overall ethanol production and marketing platform, provide strategic advantages. Our production in both the Western United States and in the Midwest enables us to source ethanol from two different regions, which we believe will allow us to address regional inefficiencies and other challenges such as rail congestion and other supply constraints as well as pricing anomalies. &#160;

o Pacific Ethanol West plants . We operate the Pacific Ethanol West plants in the Western United States where we believe local characteristics create an opportunity to capture a significant production and shipping cost advantage over competing ethanol production facilities in other regions. We believe a combination of factors enable us to achieve this cost advantage, including: &#160;

&#167; Locations near fuel blending facilities lower our ethanol transportation costs while providing timing and logistical advantages over competing locations that require ethanol to be shipped over much longer distances, and in many cases, require double-handling. &#160;

&#167; Locations adjacent to major rail lines allow the efficient delivery of corn in large unit trains from major corn-producing regions, and allow for the efficient delivery of ethanol in large unit trains to other markets, including markets with higher demand. &#160;

&#167; Locations near large concentrations of dairy and/or beef cattle enable delivery of WDG, over short distances without the need for costly drying processes. &#160;

o Pacific Ethanol Central plants . We operate the Pacific Ethanol Central plants in the Midwest which enables us to participate in the largest regional ethanol market in the United States as well as international markets. Our Midwest locations, coupled with our locations in the Western United States, also allow us many advantages over locations solely on the West Coast, including: &#160;

&#167; Locations in diverse markets assist us in spreading commodity and basis price risks across markets and products, supporting our efforts to optimize margin management. &#160;

&#167; Locations in the Midwest enhance our overall hedging opportunities with a greater correlation to the highly-liquid physical and paper markets in Chicago. &#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 4 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#167; Locations in diverse markets support heightened flexibility and alternatives in feedstock procurement for our various production facilities. &#160;

&#167; Locations in the Midwest allow us deeper market insight and engagement in major ethanol and feed markets outside the Western United States, thereby improving pricing opportunities. &#160;

&#183; Our low carbon-intensity ethanol. California and Oregon have enacted Low-Carbon Fuel Standards for transportation fuels. Under these Low-Carbon Fuel Standards, the ethanol we produce at our production facilities in the Western United States has a lower carbon-intensity than most ethanol produced at plants by other producers. This is primarily because the Pacific Ethanol West plants use less energy in their production processes. The ethanol produced in California by other producers, all of which we market, also has a lower carbon-intensity rating than either gasoline or ethanol produced in the Midwest. The lower carbon-intensity rating of ethanol we produce at the Pacific Ethanol West plants or otherwise resell from third-party California producers is valued in the market by our customers and has enabled us to capture premium prices for this ethanol. &#160;

&#183; Modern technologies . Our Pacific Ethanol West plants use the latest production technologies to take advantage of state-of-the-art technical and operational efficiencies to achieve lower operating costs, higher yields and more efficient production of ethanol and its co-products and reduce our use of carbon-based fuels. &#160;

&#183; Our experienced management . Our senior management team has a proven track record with significant operational and financial expertise and many years of experience in the ethanol, fuel and energy industries. Our senior executives, who average approximately 15 years of industry experience, have successfully navigated a wide variety of business and industry-specific challenges and deeply understand of the business of successfully producing and marketing ethanol and its co-products. &#160;

We believe that these competitive strengths will help us attain our goal to advance our position and significantly increase our market share as a leading producer and marketer of low-carbon renewable fuels in the United States.

&#160;

Industry Overview and Market Opportunity 

&#160; 

Overview of Ethanol Market 

&#160;

The primary applications for fuel-grade ethanol in the United States include:

&#160;

&#183; Octane enhancer . On average, regular unleaded gasoline has an octane rating of 87 and premium unleaded gasoline has an octane rating of 91. In contrast, pure ethanol has an average octane rating of 113. Adding ethanol to gasoline enables refiners to produce greater quantities of lower octane blend stock with an octane rating of less than 87 before blending. In addition, ethanol is commonly added to finished regular grade gasoline as a means of producing higher octane mid-grade and premium gasoline. &#160;

&#183; Renewable fuels . Ethanol is blended with gasoline in order to enable gasoline refiners to comply with a variety of governmental programs, in particular, the national Renewable Fuel Standard, or national RFS, which was enacted to promote alternatives to fossil fuels. See &#8220;&#8212;Governmental Regulation.&#8221; &#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 5 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; Fuel blending . In addition to its performance and environmental benefits, ethanol is used to extend fuel supplies. In light of the need for transportation fuel in the United States and the dependence on foreign crude oil and refined products, the United States is increasingly seeking domestic sources of fuel. Much of the ethanol blending throughout the United States is done for the purpose of extending the volume of fuel sold at the gasoline pump. &#160;

The United States ethanol industry is supported by federal and state legislation and regulation. For example, the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, which was signed into law in December 2007, significantly increased the prior national RFS. Under the national RFS, the mandated use of all renewable fuels rises incrementally in succeeding years and peaks at 36.0 billion gallons by 2022. Under the national RFS, approximately 13.6 billion gallons in 2014 and 14.5 billion gallons in 2015 were required from conventional, or corn-based, ethanol. Under the national RFS, 14.4 billion gallons are required from conventional ethanol in 2016. The national RFS allows the Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, to adjust the annual requirement based on certain facts.

&#160;

According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the domestic ethanol industry produced a record of approximately 14.8 billion gallons of ethanol in 2015. We believe that the ethanol market in California alone represented approximately 10% of the national market. However, the Western United States has relatively few ethanol facilities and local ethanol production levels are substantially below the local demand for ethanol. The balance of ethanol is shipped via rail from the Midwest to the Western United States. Gasoline and diesel fuel that supply the major fuel terminals are shipped in pipelines throughout portions of the Western United States. Unlike gasoline and diesel fuel, however, ethanol is not shipped in these types of pipelines because ethanol has an affinity for mixing with water already present in the pipelines. When mixed, water dilutes ethanol and creates significant quality control issues. Therefore, ethanol must be trucked from rail terminals to regional fuel terminals, or blending racks.

&#160;

We believe that approximately 90% of the ethanol produced in the United States is made in the Midwest from corn. According to the Department of Energy, or DOE, ethanol is generally blended at a rate of 10% by volume, but is also blended at a rate of up to 85% by volume for vehicles designed to operate on 85% ethanol. The EPA has increased the allowable blend of ethanol in gasoline from 10% by volume to 15% by volume for model year 2001 and newer automobiles, pending final approvals by certain state regulatory authorities. Some retailers have begun blending at higher rates in states that have approved higher blend rates.

&#160;

Compared to gasoline, ethanol is generally considered to be cleaner burning and contains higher octane. We anticipate that the increasing demand for renewable transportation fuels coupled with limited opportunities for gasoline refinery expansions and the growing importance of reducing CO 2 emissions through the use of renewable fuels will generate additional growth in the demand for ethanol.

&#160;

According to the DOE, total annual gasoline consumption in the United States is approximately 140 billion gallons and total annual ethanol consumption represented approximately 10% of this amount in 2014. The domestic ethanol industry has substantially reached this 10% blend ratio, and we believe the industry has significant potential for growth as the industry migrates to an up to 15% blend ratio, which would translate into an annual demand of up to 20 billion gallons of ethanol.

&#160;

Overview of Ethanol Production Process 

&#160;

Ethanol production from starch- or sugar-based feedstock is a highly-efficient process that we believe now yields substantially more energy from ethanol and its co-products than is required to make the products. The modern production of ethanol requires large amounts of corn, or other high-starch grains, and water as well as chemicals, enzymes and yeast, and denaturants including unleaded gasoline or liquid natural gas, in addition to natural gas and electricity.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 6 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Dry Milling Process 

&#160; 

In the dry milling process, corn or other high-starch grain is first ground into meal, then slurried with water to form a mash. Enzymes are then added to the mash to convert the starch into the simple sugar, dextrose. Ammonia is also added for acidic (pH) control and as a nutrient for the yeast. The mash is processed through a high temperature cooking procedure, which reduces bacteria levels prior to fermentation. The mash is then cooled and transferred to fermenters, where yeast is added and the conversion of sugar to ethanol and CO 2 begins.

&#160;

After fermentation, the resulting &#8220;beer&#8221; is transferred to distillation, where the ethanol is separated from the residual &#8220;stillage.&#8221; The ethanol is concentrated to 190 proof using conventional distillation methods and then is dehydrated to approximately 200 proof, representing 100% alcohol levels, in a molecular sieve system. The resulting anhydrous ethanol is then blended with about 2.5% denaturant, which is usually gasoline, and is then ready for shipment to market.

&#160;

The residual stillage is separated into a coarse grain portion and a liquid portion through a centrifugation process. The soluble liquid portion is concentrated to about 40% dissolved solids by an evaporation process. This intermediate state is called condensed distillers solubles, or syrup. The coarse grain and syrup portions are then mixed to produce WDG or can be mixed and dried to produce dried distillers grain with solubles, or DDGS. Both WDG and DDGS are high-protein animal feed products.

&#160;

Wet Milling Process 

&#160;

In the wet milling process, corn or other high-starch grain is first soaked or &#8220;steeped&#8221; in water for 24 &#8211; 48 hours to separate the grain into its many components. After steeping, the corn slurry is processed first to separate the corn germ, from which the corn oil can be further separated. The remaining fiber, gluten and starch components are further separated and sold.

&#160;

The steeping liquor is concentrated in an evaporator. The concentrated product, called heavy steep water, is co-dried with the fiber component and is then sold as corn gluten feed. The gluten component is filtered and dried to produce corn gluten meal.

&#160;

The starch and any remaining water from the mash is then processed into ethanol or dried and processed into corn syrup. The fermentation process for ethanol at this stage is similar to the dry milling process.

&#160;

Overview of Distillers Grains Market 

&#160;

Distillers grains are produced as a co-product of ethanol production and are valuable components of feed rations primarily to dairies and beef cattle markets, both nationally and internationally. Our plants produce both WDG and DDGS. WDG is sold to customers proximate to the plants and DDGS is delivered by truck, rail and barge to customers in domestic and international markets.

&#160;

Producing WDG also allows us to use up to one-third less process energy thus reducing production costs and lowering the carbon footprint of these plants thereby increasing demand in California where premiums are paid for the low-carbon attributes.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 7 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Historically, the market price for distillers grains has generally tracked the value of corn. We believe that the market price of WDG and DDGS is determined by a number of factors, including the market value of corn, soybean meal and other competitive ingredients, the performance or value of WDG and DDGS in a particular feed formulation and general market forces of supply and demand, including export markets for these co-products. The market price of distillers grains is also often influenced by nutritional models that calculate the feed value of distillers grains by nutritional content, as well as reliability of consistent supply.

&#160;

Customers 

&#160; 

We market and sell through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Kinergy Marketing LLC, or Kinergy, all of the ethanol produced by our eight production facilities. Kinergy also markets ethanol produced by third parties. We have extensive customer relationships throughout the Western and Midwestern United States. Our ethanol customers are integrated oil companies and gasoline marketers who blend ethanol into gasoline. Our customers depend on us to provide a reliable supply of ethanol, and manage the logistics and timing of delivery with very little effort on their side. Our customers collectively require ethanol volumes in excess of the supplies we produce at our eight production facilities. We secure additional ethanol supplies from third party plants in California and other third party suppliers in the Midwest where a majority of ethanol producers are located. We arrange for transportation, storage and delivery of ethanol purchased by our customers through our agreements with third-party service providers in the Western United States as well as in the Midwest from a variety of sources.

&#160;

We also market all of the co-products produced at our eight plants. We do not market co-products from other ethanol producers. Our co-products include WDG, DDGS, wet and dry corn gluten feed, condensed distillers solubles, corn gluten meal, corn germ, corn oil, distillers yeast and CO 2 . We market our distillers grains and other feed co-products to dairies and feedlots, in many cases located near our ethanol plants. These customers use our feed co-products for livestock as a substitute for corn and other sources of starch and protein. We sell our corn oil to poultry and biodiesel customers.

&#160;

Our production segment generated $527.7 million, $450.5 million and $387.5 million in net sales for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively, from the sale of ethanol. Our production segment generated $182.5 million, $111.9 million and $119.7 million in net sales for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively, from the sale of co-products.

&#160;

During 2015, 2014 and 2013, we sold an aggregate of approximately 319.2 million, 183.5 million and 149.7 million gallons of fuel-grade ethanol and 2.1 million, 1.5 million and 1.3 million tons of ethanol co-products, respectively.

&#160;

Our marketing segment generated $481.0 million, $545.0 million and $401.3 million in net sales for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively, from the sale of ethanol.

&#160;

During 2015, 2014 and 2013, we produced or purchased ethanol from third parties and resold an aggregate of approximately 594 million, 400 million and 302 million gallons of fuel-grade ethanol to approximately 69, 41 and 37 customers, respectively. Sales to our four largest customers, Chevron Products USA, Valero Energy Corporation, Sinclair Oil Corporation and Tesoro Refining and Marketing Company LLC in 2015, 2014 and 2013 represented an aggregate of approximately 45%, 59% and 58%, of our net sales, respectively. Sales to each of our other customers represented less than 10% of our net sales in each of 2015, 2014 and 2013.

&#160;

Suppliers 

&#160; 

Production Segment 

&#160; 

Our ethanol production operations are dependent upon various raw materials suppliers, including suppliers of corn, natural gas, electricity and water. The cost of corn is the most important variable cost associated with our ethanol production. We source corn for our plants using standard contracts, including spot purchase, forward purchase and basis contracts. When resources are available, we seek to limit the exposure of our ethanol production operations to raw material price fluctuations by purchasing forward a portion of our corn requirements on a fixed price basis and by purchasing corn and other raw materials futures contracts.

&#160;

During 2015, 2014 and 2013, purchases of corn from our three largest suppliers represented an aggregate of approximately 41%, 53% and 59% of our total corn purchases, respectively, for those periods. Purchases from each of our other corn suppliers represented less than 10% of total corn purchases in each of 2015, 2014 and 2013.

&#160;

Marketing Segment 

&#160;

Our marketing operations are dependent upon various third-party producers of fuel-grade ethanol. In addition, we provide ethanol transportation, storage and delivery services through third-party service providers with whom we have contracted to receive ethanol at agreed upon locations from our third party suppliers and to store and/or deliver the ethanol to agreed-upon locations on behalf of our customers. These contracts generally run from year-to-year, subject to termination by either party upon advance written notice before the end of the then current annual term.

&#160;

During 2015, 2014 and 2013, we purchased and resold from third parties an aggregate of approximately 275.3 million, 215.4 million and 151.4 million gallons, respectively, of fuel-grade ethanol.

&#160;

During 2015, 2014 and 2013, purchases of fuel-grade ethanol from our three largest third-party suppliers represented an aggregate of approximately 37%, 68% and 77% of our total third party ethanol purchases, respectively, for those periods. Purchases from each of our other third party ethanol suppliers represented less than 10% of total third-party ethanol purchases in each of 2015, 2014 and 2013.

&#160; 

Commodity Risk Management 

&#160;

We employ various risk mitigation techniques. For example, we may seek to mitigate our exposure to commodity price fluctuations by purchasing forward a portion of our corn and natural gas requirements through fixed-price or variable-price contracts with our suppliers, as well as entering into derivative contracts for ethanol, corn and natural gas. To mitigate ethanol inventory price risks, we may sell a portion of our production forward under fixed- or index-price contracts, or both. We may hedge a portion of the price risks by selling exchange-traded futures contracts. Proper execution of these risk mitigation strategies can reduce the volatility of our gross profit margins. However, given the nature of our business, we cannot effectively hedge against extreme volatility or certain market conditions. For example, ethanol prices, as reported by the Chicago Board of Trade, or CBOT, ranged from $1.31 to $1.69 per gallon during 2015 and $1.50 to $3.52 per gallon during 2014 and corn prices, as reported by the CBOT, ranged from $3.48 to $4.34 per bushel during 2015 and from $3.21 to $5.16 per bushel during 2014.

&#160;

Marketing Arrangements 

&#160; 

We market all the ethanol produced at our eight production facilities. In addition, we have exclusive ethanol marketing agreements with two third-party ethanol producers, Calgren Renewable Fuels, LLC and AE Advanced Fuels Keyes, Inc., to market and sell their entire ethanol production volumes. Calgren Renewable Fuels, LLC owns and operates an ethanol production facility in Pixley, California with annual production capacity of 55 million gallons. AE Advanced Fuels Keyes, Inc. owns and operates an ethanol production facility in Keyes, California with annual production capacity of 55 million gallons. We intend to evaluate and pursue opportunities to enter into marketing arrangements with other third-party ethanol producers as business prospects make these marketing arrangements advisable.

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

We are the sixth largest producer of ethanol in the United States based on annualized volumes and operate in the highly competitive ethanol production and marketing industry. The largest ethanol producers in the United States are Archer Daniels Midland Company and Valero Energy Corporation, collectively with over 20% of the total installed ethanol production capacity in the United States. In addition, there are many mid-size producers with several plants under ownership, smaller producers with one or two plants, and several ethanol marketers that create significant competition. Overall, we believe there are over 200 ethanol production facilities in the United States with a total installed production capacity of approximately 15.6 billion gallons and many brokers and marketers with whom we compete for sales of ethanol and its co-products.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 10 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

We believe that our competitive strengths include our customer and supplier relationships, our extensive ethanol distribution network, our strategic locations, our low carbon ethanol, our use of modern technologies at our production facilities and our experienced management. We believe that these advantages will help us to attain our goal to advance our position and significantly increase our market share as a leading producer and marketer of low-carbon renewable fuels in the United States.

&#160;

Most of the largest metropolitan areas in the United States have fuel terminals served by rail, but other major metropolitan areas and more remote smaller cities and rural areas do not. We believe that we have a competitive advantage in the Western United States in particular due to our experience in marketing to the segment of customers in major metropolitan and rural markets in the Western United States. We manage the complicated logistics of shipping ethanol to intermediate storage locations throughout the Western United States and trucking the ethanol from these storage locations to blending racks where the ethanol is blended with gasoline. We believe that by establishing an efficient service for truck deliveries to these more remote locations, we have differentiated ourselves from our competitors on the West Coast. In addition, due to our Pacific Ethanol West plant locations, we believe that we benefit from our ability to increase spot sales of ethanol from those plants following ethanol price spikes caused from time to time by rail delays in delivering ethanol from the Midwest to the Western United States.

&#160;

Our strategic locations in the Western United States designed to capitalize on cost efficiencies may nevertheless result in higher than expected costs as a result of more expensive raw materials and related shipping costs, including corn, which generally must be transported from the Midwest. If the costs of producing and shipping ethanol and its co-products over short distances are not advantageous relative to the costs of obtaining raw materials from the Midwest, then the benefits of our strategic locations on the West Coast may not be realized.

&#160;

Governmental Regulation 

&#160;

Our business is subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the production of renewable fuels, the protection of the environment and in support of the corn and ethanol industries. These laws, their underlying regulatory requirements and their enforcement, some of which are described below, impact, or may impact, our existing and proposed business operations by imposing:

&#160;

&#183; restrictions on our existing and proposed business operations and/or the need to install enhanced or additional controls; &#160;

&#183; the need to obtain and comply with permits and authorizations; &#160;

&#183; liability for exceeding applicable permit limits or legal requirements, in some cases for the remediation of contaminated soil and groundwater at our facilities, contiguous and adjacent properties and other properties owned and/or operated by third parties; and &#160;

&#183; specifications for the ethanol we market and produce. &#160;

In addition, some governmental regulations are helpful to our ethanol production and marketing business. The ethanol fuel industry is supported by federal and state mandates and environmental regulations that favor the use of ethanol in motor fuel blends in North America. Some of the governmental regulations applicable to our ethanol production and marketing business are briefly described below.

&#160;

National Energy Legislation 

&#160; 

The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, which was signed into law in December 2007, significantly increased the prior national RFS. The national RFS significantly increases the mandated use of renewable fuels, rising incrementally each year, to 36.0 billion gallons by 2022.

&#160;

Under the provisions of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, the EPA has the authority to waive the mandated national RFS requirements in whole or in part. To grant a waiver, the EPA administrator must determine, in consultation with the Secretaries of Agriculture and Energy, that there is inadequate domestic renewable fuel supply or implementation of the requirement would severely harm the economy or environment of a state, region or the United States as a whole.

&#160;

Legislation aimed at reducing or eliminating the renewable fuel use required by the national RFS has been introduced in the United States Congress. On February 4, 2015, the RFS Elimination Act (H.R. 703) was introduced in the House of Representatives. The bill would fully repeal the national RFS. Also introduced on February 4, 2015, was the RFS Reform Act (H.R. 704), which prohibits corn-based ethanol from meeting the national RFS requirements, caps the amount of ethanol that can be blended into conventional gasoline at 10%, and requires the EPA to set requirements for cellulosic biofuels at actual production levels. On February 3, 2015, a bill ( H.R. 21 ) was introduced in the House of Representatives to vacate the waiver issued by EPA allowing the use of 15% ethanol blends in certain light-duty vehicles.

&#160;

In the Senate, the Corn Ethanol Mandate Elimination Act of 2015 (S. 577) was introduced on February 26, 2015. The bill would eliminate corn ethanol as qualifying as a renewable fuel under the national RFS. On March 18, 2015, the American Energy Renaissance Act of 2015 (S. 791) was introduced in the Senate. Companion legislation (H.R. 1487) was introduced in the House of Representatives on March 19, 2015. Among other provisions, the bill would phase out the national RFS between 2016 and 2019 and fully repeal the program in 2020. The Renewable Fuel Standard Repeal Act (S. 1584) was introduced in the Senate on June 16, 2015. It would fully repeal the national RFS.

&#160;

All of these bills were assigned to a congressional committee, which will consider them before possibly sending any of them on to the House of Representatives or the Senate as a whole.

&#160;

E15 (a Blend of Gasoline and Ethanol ) 

&#160; 

The EPA has allowed fuel and fuel-additive manufacturers to introduce into commercial gasoline that contains greater than 10% ethanol by volume, up to 15% ethanol by volume, or E15, for vehicles from model year 2001 and beyond. Additional changes to some states&#8217; laws to allow for the use of E15 are still required, however, commercial sale of E15 has begun in some states.

&#160;

State Energy Legislation and Regulations 

&#160; 

In January 2007, California&#8217;s Governor signed an executive order directing the California Air Resources Board to implement California&#8217;s Low-Carbon Fuel Standard for transportation fuels. California&#8217;s Low-Carbon Fuel Standard requires fuel suppliers to reduce the carbon intensity of transportation fuels to 10% below 2010 levels by 2020. The Governor&#8217;s office estimates that the standard will have the effect of increasing current renewable fuels use in California by three to five times by 2020.

&#160;

The California Air Resources Board has engaged in a comprehensive process to re-adopt California&#8217;s Low-Carbon Fuel Standard for transportation fuels through 2020 and is expected to extend this through 2030 applying aggressive new carbon intensity reduction targets for the final 10 years. We believe the revised program will be beneficial as we produce among the lowest carbon intensity ethanol commercially available, and we receive a premium for the fuel we sell into the California marketplace, which we expect will increase as the compliance curve steepens beginning in 2016.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 12 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

A program similar to California&#8217;s Low-Carbon Fuel Standard has also been adopted in Oregon and the Canadian province of British Columbia, and is under discussion in Washington State. These regions, together with California, represent a very large segment of the overall demand for transportation fuels in the United States.

&#160;

Additional Environmental Regulations 

&#160; 

In addition to the governmental regulations applicable to the ethanol production and marketing industry described above, our business is subject to additional federal, state and local environmental regulations, including regulations established by the EPA, the San Joaquin Valley Regional Water Quality Control Board, the San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District and the California Air Resources Board. We cannot predict the manner or extent to which these regulations will harm or help our business or the ethanol production and marketing industry in general.

&#160;

Employees 

&#160; 

As of March 14, 2016, we had approximately 465 full-time employees. We believe that our employees are highly-skilled, and our success will depend in part upon our ability to retain our employees and attract new qualified employees, many of whom are in great demand. Approximately 135 of our employees are presently represented by a labor union, covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have never had a work stoppage or strike and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.
