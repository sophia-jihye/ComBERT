OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES 

We are offering the following sections in our journal to target Chinese speaking advertisers and readers in Houston, Texas. There is no guarantee that the advertisers in the industries discussed in this section will choose to purchase advertisements in our journal:

Our proposed journal will devote a special section for the buying and selling of homes in Texas. We believe as the economic downturn worsened, home builders and developers had a harder time selling their new homes, and bankers foreclosed those properties to be liquidated. Our proposed journal is free and accessible at the Chinese speaking neighborhood supermarkets. We have permissions from the local supermarkets to place these freestanding newspaper racks in their designated locations. The local supermarkets do not charge a fees for placing newspaper racks within the designated supermarket as long as we provide our own metal newspaper. We anticipated our real estate listings provide photos, features, and amenities. Our proposed journal goes beyond real estate listings.

Our proposed journal will devote a special section for travel agencies. All travel agents are welcomed to advertise in our journal. We believe our readers will be able to get discount coupons for some travel and tour packages from our advertisers. We will not restricted our advertisers that do not offer discount coupons. We believe that there will be a demand from our readership for travel agents. We believe our advertisers will offer travel coupons, discounted tours and airline tickets directly to our readers. We believe that these promotions from travel agencies will increase our journal's popularity in the community.

Our proposed journal will devote a special section for restaurant advertisers. There are many restaurants in the Chinese speaking communities that offer Chinese, Japanese, and Vietnamese dishes. The restaurant business is highly competitive. We believe our journal can provide a platform to promote a restaurant's business. A section will be devoted for the promotion of special dishes from various restaurants.

Our proposed journal will devote a section for an entertainment guide. This section is the journal's one-stop local entertainment guide. Our reader can go and find out what to do in Houston, from the hot bars, to the latest events, music, movies, styles, and TV.

Our proposed journal will devote a section for business advertisement. We plan to support our growth through business advertisements. We believe that there will be advertisements for businesses, special events, classifieds, and other revenue building advertisements will draw the readers to the journal.

MARKETING AND PROMOTION STRATEGIES: 

&#160; 

According to the 2011 Census, Texas is the second most populous U.S. state, next to New York. Texas has experienced strong population growth in recent years. The population growth is mainly in the major cities such as Austin, El Paso, Dallas, Houston, and San Antonio. The Chinese American population in our targeted market in Houston is 24,001. There is no available information regarding the number of Chinese-American who could read Chinese in Houston. We will start operations in Houston, Texas and expand to the California and New York Market within five years. There is no guarantee that we will be able start our journal in Houston or to expand to New York and California within five years.

&#160;

Our proposed journal is a local, free pick up journal that relies totally on advertising revenue from businesses that want to target a niche in the market of Chinese-Americans. Our Proposed journal will be founded on the principle of creating a publication and marketing for businesses who wish to reach the Chinese-American consumer. We believe our proposed journal will not be successful unless our advertising campaigns provide effective results for the businesses that buy ad space.

&#160;

ADVERTISING FOR BUSINESS: 

&#160;

Our advertising service begins with an initial concept and design. Our independent printing contractors charge $25 for each advertising design project. Our estimated yearly budget for $800 for design already included the charge of $25 for each advertising design project. We have no intention to hire our staff designers. We believe that advertising is about more than just making the sale. We believe that successful advertising helps our clients&#8217; businesses gain long-term, loyal customers. We believe that the advertising services of Global Seed Journal give organizations the opportunity to increase public awareness through consistent and frequent advertising opportunities. We have our printing contractors to provide the initial concept and design services for our advertisers.

&#160;

Global Seed Journal offers different approaches to connect with our client&#8217;s consumer-base. (a) The travel agency advertisers can offer discount coupons and special tour promotions directly to the consumers. (b) Advertisers such as medical doctors, accountants, attorneys and real estate agents could provided their news releases and special content writings with a focus to their targeted consumers. (c) Other advertisers such as the local supermarkets could offer their weekly specials to their targeted consumers. We take great care in developing the options to fulfill the advertising needs of our customers. The City of Houston will be divided into four selling/distribution zones but the journal's contents and the pricing for advertising space are the same for the advertisers.

&#160;

Our sales representatives will find customers through cold calls and direct sales. Each representative will be trained on presenting the journal to potential advertisers. The process of selling to new advertisers is as follow: Get out the phone book and call them, compile a list of targeted advertisers, set up appointments to meet with potential advertisers. We believe that the sales representatives are key to the success of our business because the sales representatives are able to solicit new accounts in the Chinese communities. We believe that as time goes by and journal recognition increases, so will the advertiser's acceptance.

BUSINESS STRATEGIES 

&#160;

Our market entry strategy will be focused on Chinese communities in Houston, Texas. There is a market for advertisers in Houston, Texas. We will be hiring two sales representatives to solicit advertising accounts through telephone solicitations and personal visits. Our competitors are monthly Chinese language publishers who offer similar products and services in Houston, Texas. We will also compete with other advertisers including English language journals and newspapers. Our initial monthly circulation will be 2,000 copies in Houston, Texas. We intend to increase to 3,500 copies gradually as soon as we are able to sign up more advertisers. We will be initially offering our journal, Global Seed Journal , with front cover in colors and freely distributed to the Chinese communities. As soon as we have achieved a monthly circulation of 10,000 copies in Houston, Texas, we will be adding electronic version of our journal in the internet. One of our business strategies is to expand our readership to other Chinese communities in the United States. Once we have implemented our journal in the electronic format, we believe that we will be able to attract more advertisers and readers.

COMPETITION 

We believe our journal competes with several competitors locally in Houston. Our competitors have more prominent brand names and more established with larger market shares; they have greater financial and other resources than we do. We compete based on the followings; the platform on which our products are offered; the way we market and promote our products and services; the effectiveness of the distribution of our products and services. We believe our success in attracting advertisers depends in large part on our ability to identify and successfully respond to customer trends and preferences.

Management believes that the protection of our intellectual property rights is a key component of our operating strategy. Once our logo is registered with the U.S. Patent office, our potential competitors no longer able to use our company's logo.
