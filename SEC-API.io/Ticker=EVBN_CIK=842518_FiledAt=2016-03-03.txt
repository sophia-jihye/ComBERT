EVANS BANCORP, INC. 

&#160; 

Evans Bancorp, Inc. (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) is a New York business corporation which is registered as a financial holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the &#8220;BHCA&#8221;). The principal office of the Company is located at One Grimsby Drive, Hamburg, NY 14075 and its telephone number is (716) 926-2000. This facility is occupied by the Office of the President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, as well as the Administrative and Loan Divisions of Evans Bank. The Company was incorporated on October 28, 1988, but the continuity of its banking business is traced to the organization of the Evans National Bank of Angola on January 20, 1920. Except as the context otherwise requires, the Company and its direct and indirect subsidiaries are collectively referred to in this report as the &#8220;Company.&#8221; The Company&#8217;s common stock is traded on the NYSE MKT under the symbol &#8220;EVBN.&#8221; 

&#160; 

At December 31, 2015, the Company had consolidated total assets of $93 9 million, deposits of $803 million and stockholders&#8217; equity of $ 91 million. 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s primary business is the operation of its subsidiaries. It does not engage in any other substantial business activities. The Company has two direct wholly-owned subsidiaries: (1) Evans Bank, N.A. (the &#8220;Bank&#8221;), which provides a full range of banking services to consumer and commercial customers in Western New York; and (2) Evans National Financial Services, LLC (&#8220;ENFS&#8221;), which owns 100% of the membership interests in The Evans Agency, LLC (&#8220;TEA&#8221;), which sells various premium-based insurance policies on a commission basis. At December 31, 2015, the Bank represented 99% and ENFS represented 1% of the consolidated assets of the Company. Further discussion of our segments is included in Note 18 to the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

&#160;

The Bank offers a variety of loan products to its customers, including commercial and consumer loans and commercial and residential mortgage loans. 

&#160; 

As is the case with banking institutions generally, the Bank&#8217;s operations are significantly influenced by general economic conditions and by related monetary and fiscal policies of banking regulatory agencies, including the Federal Reserve Board (&#8220;FRB&#8221;) and FDIC. The Bank is also subject to the supervision, regulation and examination of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency of the United States of America (the &#8220;OCC&#8221;). 

&#160;

&#160; 

Other Subsidiaries 

&#160; 

In addition to the Bank and TEA, the Company has the following direct and indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries: 

&#160; 

Evans National Holding Corp. (&#8220;ENHC&#8221;). ENHC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Bank, operates as a real estate investment trust that holds commercial real estate loans and residential mortgages, providing additional flexibility and planning opportunities for the business of the Bank. 

&#160; 

Evans National Financial Services, LLC (&#8220;ENFS&#8221;). ENFS is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. ENFS's primary business is to own the business and assets of the Company&#8217;s non-banking financial services subsidiaries. 

&#160; 

Frontier Claims Services, Inc. (&#8220;FCS&#8221;). FCS is a wholly-owned subsidiary of TEA and provides claims adjusting services to various insurance companies. 

&#160; 

Evans National Leasing, Inc. (&#8220;ENL&#8221;). ENL, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Bank, provided direct financing leasing of commercial small-ticket general business equipment to companies located throughout the contiguous 48 United States. The Company exited the leasing bu siness in 2009 and currently has only minimal activity, primarily collecting recoveries of previously charged off leases . 

&#160; 

The Company also has two special purpose entities: Evans Capital Trust I, a statutory trust formed in September 2004 under the Delaware Statutory Trust Act, solely for the purpose of issuing and selling certain securities representing undivided beneficial interests in the assets of the trust, investing the proceeds thereof in certain debentures of the Company and engaging in those activities necessary, advisable or incidental thereto; and ENB Employers Insurance Trust, a Delaware trust company formed in February 2003 for the sole purpose of holding life insurance policies under the Bank&#8217;s bank-owned life insurance (&#8220;BOLI&#8221;) program. 

&#160; 

The Company operates in two operating segments &#8211; banking activities and insurance agency activities. See Note 18 to the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on the Company&#8217;s operating segments. 

&#160; 

MARKET AREA 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s primary market area is Erie County, Niagara County, northern Chautauqua County and northwestern Cattaraugus County, NY. This primary market area is the area where the Bank principally receives deposits and makes loans and TEA sells insurance. 

&#160; 

MARKET RISK 

&#160; 

For information about, and a discussion of, the Company's "Market Risk," see Part II, Item 7 "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Market Risk" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

&#160; 

COMPETITION 

&#160; 

All phases of the Company&#8217;s business are highly competitive. The Company competes actively with local, regional and national financial institutions, as well as with bank branches and insurance agency offices in the Company&#8217;s primary market area of Erie County, Niagara County, northern Chautauqua County, and northwestern Cattaraugus County, NY. These Western New York counties have a high density of financial institutions, many of which are significantly larger and have greater financial resources than the Company. The Company faces competition for loans and deposits from other commercial banks, savings banks, internet banks, savings and loan associations, mortgage banking companies, credit unions, insurance 

&#160;

companies and other financial services companies. The Company faces additional competition for deposits and insurance business from non-depository competitors such as the mutual fund industry, securities and brokerage firms, and insurance companies and brokerages. In the personal insurance area, the majority of TEA&#8217;s competition comes from direct writers, as well as some small local agencies located in the same towns and villages in which TEA has offices. In the commercial business segment, the majority of the competition comes from larger agencies located in and around Buffalo, NY. By offering the large number of carriers which it has available to its customers, TEA has attempted to remain competitive in all aspects of its business. 

&#160; 

As an approximate indication of the Company&#8217;s competitive position, in Erie County, NY, where 13 of the Company&#8217;s banking offices are located, the Bank had the sixth most deposits according to the FDIC&#8217;s annual deposit market share report as of June 30, 2015 with 2% of the total market&#8217;s deposits of $37 billion. By comparison, the market leaders, M&#38;T Bank and Fi rst Niagara Financial Group, had 7 8 % of the county&#8217;s deposits combined. The Company attempts to be generally competitive with all financial institutions in its service area with respect to interest rates paid on time and savings deposits, service charges on deposit accounts, and interest rates charged on loans. 

&#160; 

SUPERVISION AND REGULATION 

&#160; 

Bank holding companies and banks are extensively regulated under both federal and state laws and regulations that are intended to protect depositors and customer s. Additionally, b ecause the Company is a public company with shares traded on the NYSE MKT, it is subject to regulation by the Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as the listing standards required by NYSE MKT. To the extent that the following summary describes statutory and regulatory provisions, it is qualified in its entirety by reference to the particular statutory and regulatory provisions. Any change in the applicable law or regulation, or a change in the way such laws or regulations are interpreted by regulatory agencies or courts, may have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations. 

&#160; 

Bank Holding Company Regulation (BHCA) 

&#160; 

As a financial holding company registered under the BHCA, the Company and its non-banking subsidiaries are subject to regulation and supervision under the BHCA by the FRB. The FRB requires periodic reports from the Company, and is authorized by the BHCA to make regular examinations of the Company and its subsidiaries. 

&#160; 

The Company is required to obtain the prior approval of the FRB before merging with or acquiring all or substantially all of the assets of, or direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of, a bank or bank holding company. The FRB will not approve any acquisition, merger or consolidation that would have a substantial anti-competitive result, unless the anti-competitive effects of the proposed transaction are outweighed by a greater public interest in meeting the needs and convenience of the public. 

&#160; 

Subject to various exceptions, the BHCA and the Change in Bank Control Act of 1978, together with related regulations, require FRB approval before any person or company acquires &#8220;control&#8221; of a bank holding company. Control is conclusively presumed to exist if an individual or company acquires 25% or more of any class of voting securities of the bank holding company. Rebuttable control is presumed to exist if a person or company acquires 10% or more, but less than 25%, of any class of the bank holding company&#8217;s voting securities. 

&#160; 

The FRB also considers managerial, capital and other financial factors in acting on acquisition or merger applications. A bank holding company may not engage in, or acquire direct or indirect control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any company engaged in any non-banking activity, unless such activity has been determined by the FRB to be closely related to banking or managing banks. The FRB has identified by regulation various non-banking activities in which a bank holding company may engage with notice to, or prior approval by, the FRB. 

&#160; 

The FRB has enforcement powers over financial holding companies and their subsidiaries, among other things, to interdict activities that represent unsafe or unsound practices or constitute violations of law, rule, regulation, administrative orders, or written agreements with a federal bank regulator. These powers may be exercised through the issuance of cease and desist orders, civil monetary penalties or other actions. 

&#160; 

Under Regulation Y, a bank holding company must serve as a source of financial and managerial strength for its subsidiary banks and must not conduct its operations in an unsafe or unsound manner. Additionally, Regulation Y requires a bank 

&#160;

holding company to give the FRB prior notice of any redemption or repurchase of its own equity securities, if the consideration to be paid, together with the consideration paid for any repurchases in the preceding year, is equal to 10% or more of the company&#8217;s consolidated net worth. The FRB may oppose the transaction if it believes that the transaction would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice or would violate any law or regulation. There is an exception for bank holding companies that are well-managed, well capitalized, and not subject to any unresolved supervisory issues. To date, the Company has qualified for this exception. As another example, a bank holding company may not impair its subsidiary bank&#8217;s soundness by causing it to make funds available to non-banking subsidiaries or their customers if the FRB believed it not prudent to do so. 

&#160; 

Bank holding companies and their subsidiary banks are also subject to the provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act (&#8220;CRA&#8221;). Under the terms of the CRA, the FRB (or other appropriate bank regulatory agency, in the case of the Bank, the OCC) is required, in connection with its examination of a bank, to assess such bank&#8217;s record in meeting the credit needs of the communities served by that bank, including low and moderate-income neighborhoods. Furthermore, such assessment is taken into account in evaluating any application made by a bank holding company or a bank for, among other things, approval of a branch or other deposit facility, office relocation, a merger or an acquisition of bank shares. 

&#160; 

Supervision and Regulation of Bank Subsidiaries 

&#160; 

The Bank is a nationally chartered banking corporation subject to supervision, examination and regulation by the FRB, the FDIC and the OCC. These regulators have the power to enjoin &#8220;unsafe or unsound practices,&#8221; require affirmative action to correct any conditions resulting from any violation or practice, issue an administrative order that can be judicially enforced, direct an increase in capital, restrict the growth of a bank, assess civil monetary penalties, and remove a bank&#8217;s officers and directors. 

&#160; 

The operations of the Bank are subject to numerous statutes and regulations. Such statutes and regulations relate to required reserves against deposits, investments, loans, mergers and consolidations, issuance of securities, payment of dividends, establishment of branches, and other aspects of the Bank&#8217;s operations. Various consumer laws and regulations also affect the operations of the Bank, including state usury laws, laws relating to fiduciaries, consumer credit and equal credit, fair credit reporting, and privacy of non-public financial information. 

&#160; 

The Bank is subject to Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation W thereunder, which govern certain transactions, such as loans, extensions of credit, investments and purchases of assets between member banks and their affiliates, including their parent holding companies. These restrictions limit the transfer from its subsidiaries, including the Bank, of funds to the Company in the form of loans, extensions of credit, investments or purchases of assets (collectively, &#8220;Transfers&#8221;), and they require that the Bank&#8217;s transactions with the Company be on terms no less favorable to the Bank than comparable transactions between the Bank and unrelated third parties. Transfers by the Bank to any affiliate (including the Company) are limited in amount to 10% of the Bank&#8217;s capital and surplus, and transfers to all affiliates are limited in the aggregate to 20% of the Bank&#8217;s capital and surplus. Furthermore, such loans and extensions of credit are also subject to various collateral requirements. These regulations and restrictions may limit the Company&#8217;s ability to obtain funds from the Bank for its cash needs, including funds for acquisitions, and the payment of dividends, interest and operating expenses. 

&#160; 

The Bank is prohibited from engaging in certain tying arrangements in connection with any extension of credit, lease or sale of property or furnishing of services. For example, the Bank may not generally require a customer to obtain other services from the Bank or the Company, and may not require the customer to promise not to obtain other services from a competitor as a condition to an extension of credit. The Bank is also subject to certain restrictions imposed by the Federal Reserve Act on extensions of credit to executive officers, directors, principal stockholders or any related interest of such persons. Extensions of credit: (i) must be made on substantially the same terms (including interest rates and collateral) as those prevailing at the time for, and following credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than those applicable to, comparable transactions with persons not covered above and who are not employees, and (ii) must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features. The Bank is also subject to certain lending limits and restrictions on overdrafts to such persons. A violation of these restrictions may result in the assessment of substantial civil monetary penalties on the Bank or any officer, director, employee, agent or other person participating in the conduct of the affairs of the Bank or the imposition of a cease and desist order. 

&#160; 

As insurer, the FDIC imposes deposit insurance premiums and is authorized to conduct examinations of and to require reporting by, insured institutions. It may also prohibit an insured institution from engaging in any activity the FDIC 

&#160;

determines by regulation or order to pose a serious threat to the FDIC. The FDIC also has the authority to initiate enforcement actions against insured institutions. The FDIC may terminate the deposit insurance of any insured depository institution, including the Bank, if it determines after a hearing that the institution has engaged or is engaging in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, order or any condition imposed by an agreement with the FDIC. 

The FDIC has adopted a risk-based premium system that provides for quarterly assessments based on an insured institution&#8217;s ranking in one of four risk categories based on their examination ratings and capital ratios. In addition, all FDIC-insured institutions are required to pay assessments to the FDIC to fund interest payments on bonds issued by the Financing Corporation (&#8220;FICO&#8221;), a mixed-ownership Federal government corporation established to recapitalize the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation. The current annualized assessment rate is 0.62 basis points, or approximately 0.16 basis points per quarter. These assessments will continue until the Financing Corporation bonds mature in 2019. Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the deposit insurance assessment base was redefined in 2011 to reflect consolidated total assets less average tangible equity. The result is that larger financial institutions, which have more assets leveraged with non-deposit wholesale funds, generally have paid a greater percentage of the aggregate insurance assessment and smaller banks, including the Bank, have paid less. 

Regulations promulgated by the FDIC pursuant to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 place limitations on the ability of certain insured depository institutions to accept, renew or rollover deposits by offering rates of interest which are significantly higher than the prevailing rates of interest on deposits offered by other depository institutions having the same type of charter in such depository institutions&#8217; normal market area. Under these regulations, well-capitalized institutions may accept, renew or rollover such deposits without restriction, while adequately capitalized institutions may accept, renew or rollover such deposits with a waiver from the FDIC (subject to certain restrictions on payment of rates). Undercapitalized institutions may not accept, renew or rollover such deposits. 

&#160; 

Under the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989, a depository institution insured by the FDIC can be held liable for any loss incurred by, or reasonably expected to be incurred by, the FDIC in connection with: (i) the default of a commonly controlled FDIC-insured depository institution, or (ii) any assistance provided by the FDIC to a commonly controlled FDIC-insured institution in danger of default. &#8220;Default&#8221; is defined generally as the appointment of a conservator or receiver, and &#8220;in danger of default&#8221; is defined generally as the existence of certain conditions indicating that, in the opinion of the appropriate banking agency, a &#8220;default&#8221; is likely to occur in the absence of regulatory assistance. 

&#160; 

In addition to the foregoing, federal regulators have adopted regulations and examination procedures promoting the safety and soundness of institutions by specifically addressing, among other things: (i) internal controls, information systems and internal audit systems; (ii) loan documentation; (iii) credit underwriting; (iv) interest rate exposure; (v) asset growth; (vi) ratio of classified assets to capital; (vii) minimum earnings; and (viii) compensation and benefits standards for management officials. FRB regulations, for example, generally require a bank holding company to give the FRB prior notice of any redemption or repurchase of the bank holding company&#8217;s equity securities, if the consideration to be paid, together with the consideration paid for any repurchases or redemptions in the preceding year, is equal to 10% or more of the company's consolidated net worth. The Federal Reserve Board has broad authority to prohibit activities of bank holding companies and their non-banking subsidiaries which represent unsafe and unsound banking practices or which constitute violations of laws or regulations, and can assess civil money penalties for certain activities conducted on a knowing and reckless basis, if those activities caused a substantial loss to a depository institution. 

Dividends paid by the Bank have been the Company's primary source of operating funds and are expected to be for the foreseeable future. Capital adequacy requirements serve to limit the amount of dividends that may be paid by the Bank. Under OCC regulations, the Bank may not pay a dividend, without prior OCC approval, if the total amount of all dividends declared during the calendar year, including the proposed dividend, exceed the sum of its retained net income to date during the calendar year and its retained net income over the preceding two years. As of December 31, 2015, approximately $ 15 .6 million was available for the payment of dividends without prior OCC approval. The Bank&#8217;s ability to pay dividends is also subject to the Bank being in compliance with regulatory capital requirements. As indicated below, at December 31, 2015, the Bank was in compliance with these requirements. 

Because the Company is a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank, the Company's right to participate in the distribution of assets of the Bank in the event of the Bank's liquidation or reorganization would be subject to the prior claims of the Bank's creditors. In the event of a liquidation or other resolution of an insured depository institution, the claims of 

&#160;

depositors and other general or subordinated creditors are entitled to a priority of payment over the claims of unsecured, non-deposit creditors, including a parent bank holding company (such as the Company) or any shareholder or creditor thereof. 

The FRB, the OCC and other federal banking agencies have broad enforcement powers, including the power to terminate deposit insurance, to impose substantial fines and other civil and criminal penalties, and to appoint a conservator or receiver for the assets of a regulated entity. Failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations and supervisory agreements could subject the Company or its subsidiaries, as well as officers, directors and other institution-affiliated parties of these organizations, to administrative sanctions and potential civil monetary penalties. 

&#160; 

Capital Adequacy 

&#160; 

The Company and its subsidiary bank are required to comply with applicable capital adequacy standards established by the federal banking agencies. &#160; The risk-based capital standards that were applicable to the Company and its subsidiary bank through December 31, 2014 were based on the 1988 Capital Accord, known as Basel I, of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the &#8220;Basel Committee&#8221;). &#160; However, in July 2013, the Federal Reserve Board, the OCC , and the FDIC approved final rules (the &#8220;New Capital Rules&#8221;) establishing a new comprehensive capital framework for U.S. banking organizations. &#160; These rules went into effect as to the Company and its subsidiary bank on January 1, 2015, subject to phase-in periods for certain components and other provisions. 

&#160; 

Basel III and the New Capital Rules . The New Capital Rules generally implement the Basel Committee&#8217;s December 2010 final capital framework referred to as &#8220;Basel III&#8221; for strengthening international capital standards. &#160; The New Capital Rules substantially revise the risk-based capital requirements applicable to bank holding companies and their depository institution subsidiaries, including Evans Bancorp, Inc., and Evans Bank N.A., as compared to the U.S. general risk-based capital rules that were applicable to the Company through December 31, 2014. &#160; The New Capital Rules revise the definitions and the components of regulatory capital, as well as address other issues affecting the numerator in banking institutions&#8217; regulatory capital ratios. The New Capital Rules also address asset risk weights and other matters affecting the denominator in banking institutions&#8217; regulatory capital ratios. 

&#160; 

Among other matters, the New Capital Rules: (i) introduce a new capital measure called &#8220;Common Equity Tier 1&#8221; (&#8220;CET1&#8221;) and related regulatory capital ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets; (ii) specify that Tier 1 capital consists of CET1 and &#8220;Additional Tier 1 capital&#8221; instruments meeting certain revised requirements; (iii) mandate that most deductions/adjustments to regulatory capital measures be made to CET1 and not to the other components of capital; and (iv) expand the scope of the deductions from and adjustments to capital as compared to the previous regulations. 

&#160; 

Pursuant to the New Capital Rules, the minimum capita l ratios as of January 1, 2015 we re as follows: 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

4.5% CET1 to risk-weighted assets; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

6.0% Tier 1 capital (that is, CET1 plus Additional Tier 1 capital) to risk-weighted assets; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

8.0% Total capital (that is, Tier 1 capital plus Tier 2 capital) to risk-weighted assets; and 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

4.0% Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets as reported on the consolidated financial statements (known as the &#8220;leverage ratio&#8221;). 

&#160; 

The New Capital Rules also introduce a new &#8220;capital conservation buffer,&#8221; composed entirely of CET1, on top of these minimum risk-weighted asset ratios. &#160; The capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. &#160; Banking institutions with a ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets above the minimum but below the capital conservation buffer will face constraints on dividends, equity and other capital instrument repurchases and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall. &#160; Thus, when fully phased-in on January 1, 2019, the capital standards applicable to the Company will include an additional capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of CET1, effectively resulting in minimum ratios inclusive of the capital conservation buffer of (i) CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 7%, (ii) Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.5%; (iii) Total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 10.5% and (iv) a minimum leverage ratio of 4%, calculated as the ratio of Tier 1 capital to average assets. 

&#160; 

The New Capital Rules provide for a number of deductions from and adjustments to CET1. &#160; These include, for example, the requirement that mortgage servicing rights, deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences that could not be realized through net operating loss carrybacks and significant investments in non-consolidated financial entities be deducted from 

&#160;

CET1 to the extent that any one such category exceeds 10% of CET1 or all such items, in the aggregate, exceed 15% of CET1. 

&#160; 

In addition, t he New Capital Rules include certain exemptions to address concerns about the regulatory burden on community banks. For example, banking organizations with less than $15 billion in consolidated assets as of December 31, 2009 are permitted to include in Tier 1 capital trust preferred securities and cumulative perpetual preferred stock issued and included in Tier 1 capital prior to May 19, 2010 on a permanent basis, without any phase out (subject to a limit of 25% of Tier 1 capital). Also, community banks were able to elect on a one time basis in their March 31, 2015 quarterly filings to opt-out of the onerous requirement to include most accumulated other comprehensive income (&#8220;AOCI&#8221;) components in the calculation of common equity Tier 1 capital and, in effect, retain the AOCI treatment under the current capital rules. Under the New Capital Rules, the Company made a one-time, permanent election to continue to exclude AOCI from capital. 

&#160; 

The Federal Deposit Insurance Act (the &#8220;FDIA&#8221;) establishes a system of regulatory remedies to resolve the problems of undercapitalized institutions, referred to as the prompt corrective action. &#160; The federal banking regulators have established five capital categories (&#8220;well-capitalized,&#8221; &#8220;adequately capitalized,&#8221; &#8220;undercapitalized,&#8221; &#8220;significantly undercapitalized&#8221; and &#8220;critically undercapitalized&#8221;) and must take certain mandatory supervisory actions, and are authorized to take other discretionary actions, with respect to institutions which are undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized. &#160; The severity of these mandatory and discretionary supervisory actions depends upon the capital category in which the institution is placed. &#160; Generally, subject to a narrow exception, the FDIA requires the banking regulator to appoint a receiver or conservator for an institution that is critically undercapitalized. &#160; The FDIC has specified by regulation the relevant capital levels for each category, which are printed below. The Federal Reserve Board and the OCC have specified the same or similar levels for each category. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#8220;Well-Capitalized&#8221; 

&#160; 

&#8220;Adequately Capitalized&#8221; 

CET1 ratio of 6.5% 

Leverage Ratio of 5%,

Total Capital ratio of 10%, and 

Not subject to a written agreement, order, capital directive or regulatory remedy directive requiring a specific capital level. 

&#160; 

CET1 ratio of 4.5% 

Leverage Ratio of 4%, 

Tier 1 Capital ratio of 6%, and 

Total Capital ratio of 8%. 

&#160; 

&#8220;Undercapitalized&#8221; 

&#160; 

&#8220;Significantly Undercapitalized&#8221; 

CET1 Ratio of less than 4.5%

&#160; &#160; 

Tangible equity to total assets less than 2%. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

For purposes of these regulations, the term &#8220;tangible equity&#8221; includes core capital elements counted as Tier 1 Capital for purposes of the risk-based capital standards plus the amount of outstanding cumulative perpetual preferred stock (including related surplus), minus all intangible assets with certain exceptions. 

&#160; 

An institution that is classified as well-capitalized based on its capital levels may be classified as adequately capitalized, and an institution that is adequately capitalized or undercapitalized based upon its capital levels may be treated as though it were undercapitalized or significantly undercapitalized, respectively, if the appropriate federal banking agency, after notice and opportunity for hearing, determines that an unsafe or unsound condition or an unsafe or unsound practice warrants such treatment. 

&#160; 

&#160;

An institution that is categorized as undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized is required to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan to its appropriate federal banking regulator. &#160; Under the FDIA, in order for the capital restoration plan to be accepted by the appropriate federal banking agency, a BHC must guarantee that a subsidiary depository institution will comply with its capital restoration plan, subject to certain limitations. &#160; The BHC must also provide appropriate assurances of performance. &#160; The obligation of a controlling BHC under the FDIA to fund a capital restoration plan is limited to the lesser of 5.0% of an undercapitalized subsidiary&#8217;s assets or the amount required to meet regulatory capital requirements. &#160; An undercapitalized institution is also generally prohibited from increasing its average total assets, making acquisitions, establishing any branches or engaging in any new line of business, except in accordance with an accepted capital restoration plan or with the approval of the FDIC. &#160; Institutions that are significantly undercapitalized or undercapitalized and either fail to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan or fail to implement an approved capital restoration plan may be subject to a number of requirements and restrictions, including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized, requirements to reduce total assets and cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks. &#160; Critically undercapitalized depository institutions failing to submit or implement an acceptable capital restoration plan are subject to appointment of a receiver or conservator.

Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act 

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (&#8220;Dodd-Frank Act&#8221;) , &#160; enacted in 2010, is widely regarded as the most sweeping change to financial regulation since the Great Depression. The law wa s intended to promote robust supervision and regulation of financial firms; establish comprehensive supervision of financial markets; protect consumers and investors from financial abuse; provide the government with the tools to manage a financial crisis; and raise international regulatory standards and improve international cooperation. Some of the most significant aspects of The Dodd-Frank Act include: 

I. 

The creation of a new oversight regulator, the Financial Stability Oversight Council. The council of regulators monitors the financial system for systemic risk and will determine which entities pose significant systemic risk and should be subject to greater federal regulation and oversight. 

&#160; 

II. 

The Collins Amendment, which requires the federal banking agencies to establish minimum leverage capital and risk-based capital requirements for insured depository institutions, depository institution holding companies and non-bank financial companies supervised by the FRB (also known as systemically significant financial institutions). The Collins Amendment provides that certain hybrid financial instruments, such as trust preferred securities, issued on or after May 19, 2010, will be excluded from Tier 1 capital. For certain large depository institution holding companies (greater than $15 billion in assets at December 31, 2009 ), hybrid financial instruments issued before May 19, 2010 must be phased out of Tier 1 capital over a three-year period beginning January 1, 2013. The Company was well below th is threshold at December 31, 2009 . At December 31, 201 5 , the Company had $11.3 million in trust preferred securities included in Tier 1 capital. 

&#160; 

III. 

The Durbin Amendment, which provided that interchange fees that a card issuer or payment network receives or charges for debit transactions will now be regulated by the FRB and must be &#8220;reasonable and proportional&#8221; to the cost incurred by the card issuer in authorizing, clearing and settling the transaction. The pricing provisions of the Durbin Amendment apply to card issuing financial institutions with more than $10 billion in assets. The Durbin Amendment also prohibits all issuers and networks from restricting the number of networks over which electronic debit transactions may be processed to less than two unaffiliated networks, and prohibits issuers and networks from inhibiting a merchant&#8217;s ability to direct the routing of the electronic debit transaction over any network that the issuer has enabled to process them. Although the Bank is exempt from the pricing provisions of the Durbin Amendment, it may be impacted by this provision if it has to match the reduced rates being offered by larger competitors. Such a result could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s results of operations and cash flows. 

&#160; 

IV. 

A number of deposit insurance reforms, which have generally benefited the Bank. First, the Dodd-Frank Act redefined the deposit insurance assessment base to reflect consolidated total assets less average tangible equity. The result is that larger financial institutions, which have more assets leveraged with non-deposit wholesale 

&#160;

funds, have paid a greater percentage of the aggregate insurance assessment, while smaller banks (such as the Bank) have paid less than they would have under the prior rules. The Dodd-Frank Act also increased the minimum reserve ratio of the Deposit Insurance Fund from 1.15% to 1.35%, but exempted institutions with assets less than $10 billion from funding the cost of the increase. The title also permanently increased deposit insurance coverage to $250,000 per account (subject to certain limitations). 

&#160; 

V. 

A permanent exemption from the provisions of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (&#8220;SOX&#8221;), which requires that public companies receive an opinion from their external auditors as to the effectiveness of their internal control over financial reporting, for companies with a public market capitalization under $75 million. As a smaller reporting company, the Company qualifies for this exemption. However, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors and the Company&#8217;s management have decided to continue to voluntarily comply with SOX 404(b) as they believe it is in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders. 

&#160; 

VI. 

Establishment of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the &#8220;CFPB&#8221;), an independent agency with the authority to prohibit practices that it finds to be unfair, deceptive, or abusive, in addition to requiring certain disclosures. 

&#160; 

VII. 

The imposition of new regulations on mortgage loan originators, including the imposition of new disclosure requirements and appraisal reforms, such as: the creation of a mortgage originator duty of care; the establishment of certain underwriting requirements designed to ensure that at the time of origination the consumer has a reasonable ability to repay the loan; the creation of document requirements intended to eliminate &#8220;no document&#8221; and &#8220;low document&#8221; loans; the prohibition of steering incentives for mortgage originators; a prohibition on yield spread premiums and prepayment penalties in some cases; and a provision that allows borrowers to assert as a foreclosure defense a contention that the lender violated the anti-steering restrictions or the reasonable repayment requirements. 

&#160; 

VIII. 

In December 2013, five federal agencies (including the FRB and the OCC) adopted a final regulation implementing the &#8220;Volcker Rule&#8221; provision of the Dodd-Frank Act. The Volcker Rule generally prohibits insured banks and their affiliates from proprietary trading or from acquiring or retaining any equity, partnership or other ownership interest in, sponsoring or having certain other relationships with a hedge fund or a private equity fund, subject to certain exceptions. T he Volcker Rule did not have a n &#160; impa ct on the operations of the Company or the Bank, as they generally do not engage in the activities prohibited by the Volcker Rule. 

&#160; 

Regulation of Insurance Agency Subsidiary 

&#160; 

TEA is regulated by the New York State Insurance Department. As of the date of this report, TEA meets and maintains all licensing and continuing education requirements required by the State of New York. 

&#160; 

Monetary Policy and Economic Control 

&#160; 

The commercial banking business is affected not only by general economic conditions, but also by the monetary policies of the FRB. Changes in the discount rate on member bank borrowing, availability of borrowing at the &#8220;discount window,&#8221; open market operations, the imposition of changes in reserve requirements against member banks&#8217; deposits and assets of foreign branches and the imposition of and changes in reserve requirements against certain borrowings by banks and their affiliates are some of the instruments of monetary policy available to the FRB. These monetary policies are used in varying combinations to influence overall growth and distributions of bank loans, investments and deposits, and this use may affect interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits. The monetary policies of the FRB have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks and are expected to continue to do so in the future. The monetary policies of these agencies are influenced by various factors, including inflation, unemployment, and short-term and long-term changes in the international trade balance and in the fiscal policies of the United States Government. Future monetary policies and the effect of such policies on the future business and earnings of the Company cannot be predicted. 

&#160;
