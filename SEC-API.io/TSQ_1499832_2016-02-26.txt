 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

Description of Business 

&#160; 

Townsquare Media, Inc. is a media, entertainment and digital marketing solutions company principally focused on small and mid-sized markets across the United States As of December 31, 2015, our assets included 309 radio stations and more than 325 local websites in 66 U.S. markets, approximately 650 live events with nearly 18 million annual attendees in the U.S. and Canada, a digital marketing solutions company serving approximately 8,000 small to medium sized businesses, and one of the largest digital advertising networks focused on music and entertainment reaching more than 60 million unique visitors each month. Our brands include local media assets such as WYRK , KLAQ , K2 &#32;and NJ101.5 ; music festivals such as Mountain Jam , WE Fest &#32;and the Taste of Country Music Festival ; touring lifestyle and entertainment events such as the America on Tap &#32;craft beer festival series, the Insane Inflatable 5K &#32;obstacle race series, and North American Midway Entertainment , North America&#8217;s largest mobile amusement company; and tastemaker music and entertainment owned and affiliated websites such as XXL.com , TasteofCountry.com , Loudwire.com , JustJared.com &#32;and BrooklynVegan.com . 

&#160; 

Local Advertising 

Our Local Advertising segment is composed of 309 owned and operated radio stations and over 325 owned and operated local websites in 66 small and mid-sized markets. Our radio stations capture the number one market share of radio revenue in 44 out of our 66 markets, with 21 capturing the number two market share. Almost all of our radio stations have local companion websites that utilize the station brands and are populated with proprietary, original content created and curated by our local media personalities. Nearly all of our radio stations are available to be streamed online via their local companion websites, as well as our proprietary mobile application, radioPup. 

We believe that we are the largest and best-capitalized owner and operator of radio stations that focuses solely on serving audiences and advertisers in small and mid-sized markets. These markets have historically exhibited lower volatility in radio advertising spending, unemployment rates and real estate values as compared to U.S. national averages. These markets also typically have fewer media competitors than large markets. Our Local Advertising operations are organized around a regional strategy with cluster concentrations in and around the Northeast, Upper Midwest, Texas and the Mountain West. 

Our radio stations and local websites are broadly diversified in terms of brand, music format and target demographics. Many of our brands enjoy a long, often multi-decade, heritage in our markets, increasing their relevance and resonance with our audience. The strength of our brands, combined with the size and targeted nature of our audience, enables us to compete for advertising expenditures against television and print media as well as other radio operators and digital media companies. Our local websites leverage our radio brands, extensive and integrated on-air promotion and the relevant, often local, content to drive audience engagement. We also use our brands&#8217; social media channels to drive traffic to our local websites where we are able to monetize the resulting audience engagement. All of our local websites are search engine and mobile optimized. 

Live Events 

Our Live Events segment is composed of a diverse range of live events, which we create, promote and produce, including music concerts, multi-day music festivals, consumer expositions and trade shows, athletic events, lifestyle events, as well as mobile amusement parks at fairs and other forms of entertainment. Our live events are local, family oriented and community-based in nature and offer unique, out-of-home experiences for our audience as well as sponsorship, exhibit space and activation opportunities for our advertisers. We also offer event production services to third parties and own a proprietary ticketing platform. 

Over the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, and pro forma for the Transactions, we produced approximately 650 live events that attracted approximately 18 million attendees in the U.S. and Canada. Approximately 

90% of these events are annually recurring branded franchises such as El Paso's Balloonfest , Utica's FrogFest , the Insane Inflatable 5K , and the state and local fairs at which we operate the amusement attractions, including rides, games and concessions such as the Eastern States Exposition &#32;and the Calgary Stampede &#32;and multi-day music festivals, such as WE Fest &#32;and Mountain Jam . We replicate live events that demonstrate a track record of success in additional markets, many of which are within our Local Advertising footprint, where we are able to utilize existing assets and employees, a templated syndication process we refer to as "Events in a Box". 

We often customize live events that we operate in our Local Advertising markets to offer entertainment that complements the formats of our radio stations and local websites, reinforcing our brand integration while allowing us to further monetize our existing audience and advertiser relationships. Our live events in our Local Advertising markets are typically executed by our in-market teams, while leveraging centralized underwriting, talent booking and general and administration infrastructure. 

Other Media and Entertainment 

Our Other Media and Entertainment business is primarily composed of our digital marketing solutions offering, national digital assets and e-commerce offering and also includes miscellaneous revenue. These assets extend our audience and advertiser reach into and beyond our Local Advertising markets. 

Digital Marketing Solutions 

We offer digital marketing solutions, on a subscription basis, to small and mid-sized local and regional businesses ("SMBs") in small and mid-sized markets across the United States, including markets in which we operate our Local Advertising segment. Our digital marketing solutions, offered under the brand name Townsquare Interactive, include traditional and mobile-enabled website development and hosting services, search engine and online directory optimization services, online reputation management and social media management. 

National Digital Assets 

We own and operate a portfolio of 16 music and entertainment focused national websites, including Taste of Country , XXL &#32;, PopCrush , ScreenCrush , Ultimate Classic Rock , Loudwire , and ComicsAlliance . We employ a dedicated 

advertising sales force based in New York with a presence in Los Angeles, Chicago, Detroit and Dallas. 

We own and operate the nation&#8217;s largest digital advertising network focused on music content. This digital advertising network provides services such as advertising sales representation and advertising trafficking to approximately 150 third-party music and entertainment focused affiliate websites, such as Just Jared , Hype Machine, Brooklyn Vegan and RapUp . In most cases, the digital properties we represent through our digital advertising network do not employ a sales force to pursue advertising revenue. We are compensated for the services we provide to our affiliate websites through revenue-sharing arrangements. 

The scale of our national audience reach complements our Local Advertising assets and allows us to deliver a compelling value proposition to national advertisers, such as Toyota, McDonalds, Mazda and Apple, seeking to reach media and entertainment enthusiasts. 

E-Commerce 

We offer e-commerce products to consumers and advertisers through Seize the Deal, our proprietary deal and auction platform. Seize the Deal enables small businesses, some of which may not have the resources to utilize our Local Advertising products, to sell certain of their products and services online through our auction platform. Our auction platform supports over 106 local auctions annually, which are often used as a gateway to a broader advertising relationship with Townsquare. 

Competitive Strengths 

We believe that we are well-positioned to capitalize on the following competitive strengths to achieve further growth in our future performance: 

National Scale and Media Expertise, on a Local Level, in Small and Mid-Sized Markets. 

Our scale, national reach and expertise in media and entertainment across our portfolio of Local Advertising assets in small and mid-sized markets provide significant competitive advantages. 

Large-Market Products, Technology and Practices Deployed in Small and Mid-Sized Markets. 

Our flexible and customized content management system, digital advertising products and delivery capabilities, mobile applications, digital marketing solutions capabilities, online video content and repeatable live event templates allow us to deliver world-class products supported by advanced technology in small and mid-sized markets. We believe with our scale we can offer superior solutions for advertisers and audiences alike as compared to many of our local competitors. 

National Scale with Local Focus. &#160; 

We believe we are the largest and best-capitalized owner and operator of radio stations focused solely on small and mid-sized markets in the United States. This national scale allows us to have greater relevance to, and recognition from, our advertising clients while sharing best practices for strategy and operations across our asset portfolio. 

Captive Local Audience Drives Superior Opportunity in Small and Mid-Sized Markets. 

The competitive and economic environments found in small and mid-sized markets, particularly the markets where we have an established presence, provide significant advantages to us and, we believe, reduce the volatility in our financial results. 

Attractive Competitive Landscapes. 

There are fewer and less well-capitalized, local media competitors across our small and mid-sized markets relative to larger markets. In 43 of our 66 local markets, we do not compete against any of the five largest English language national radio competitors, as measured by revenue. We believe this competitive landscape allows our brands to gain a greater share of both audience and advertising expenditures in our markets than what is generally achieved by peers operating in large markets. 

Lower Economic Volatility in Small and Mid-Sized Markets. 

Our markets have, on average, exhibited lower volatility in radio advertising spending, unemployment rates and real estate values as compared to national averages, resulting in more stable radio advertising revenue compared to the national average historically. 

Strategically Assembled Market Portfolio Characterized by Stable, Locally Significant Institutions. 

We have assembled our radio station assets and most of our live events operations across a collection of small and mid-sized markets, organized in regional clusters, supported by stable, locally significant institutions such as universities, military bases, state capitals, state fairs, regional medical centers and retail hubs. We believe these stabilizing institutions will further reduce the volatility of advertising spending in our markets. 

#1 or #2 Revenue Market Share in Nearly All of Our Markets. 

Our brands, in the aggregate, capture the largest or the second largest radio revenue share in 65 of our 66 markets, and in 44 markets we are ranked number one. This leading market share position is indicative of our audience reach and engagement as well as our relevance to advertisers in our markets. 

Strong Relationships with Local and Regional Advertisers. 

In the year ended December 31, 2015, we generated approximately 83% of our revenue across our reportable segments from a broad array of local and regional advertisers in a number of industries, including automotive dealers, banking and mortgage service providers, furniture and home furnishings retailers, food and beverage service providers, healthcare service providers and media and telecommunications service providers. We generate a majority of our Local Advertising revenue by selling directly to local advertisers, as well as to local and regional advertising agencies which affords us the opportunity to better present our products to advertisers, cross sell products and more directly influence their advertising expenditure decisions. 

Geographic Diversification with Strength in Northeast, Upper Midwest, Texas and Mountain West. 

Our Local Advertising assets are geographically diversified, which helps to mitigate potential regional economic volatility and inclement weather events. By clustering our markets in certain geographic regions we are able to create compelling audience coverage for regional advertisers and to benefit from scale economies. 

Diversified and Integrated Product Offering - Townsquare Everywhere. 

Our diversified product offerings substantially differentiate us from our competition. This allows us to provide superior solutions to both our audience and advertisers, underpins our growth strategy and, we believe, helps to mitigate the risks associated with advertising revenue concentration. 

Audience Engagement In and Out-of-Home, Across Multiple Platforms. 

We offer our audience the ability to access our branded content on-air, online and on-site across multiple distribution channels. We believe that leveraging technology to make our branded content experiences accessible between devices and locations strengthens our audience engagement. 

Targeted Audience Reach, Closer to the Point of Sale, to Local, Regional and National Advertisers. 

A significant portion of our audience engagement occurs when our audience is out-of-home, particularly in the car, in the office or at our live events. Our audience frequently interacts with our content in close proximity to purchase events. 

Launch Point for Non-Radio Products. 

Our radio reach and engagement provide a powerful promotional vehicle from which we are able to grow our existing and new websites, online radio streams, mobile applications, digital marketing solutions and live events. We believe that the increased interaction with consumers across these new products and platforms in turn reinforces consumer loyalty and affinity toward our radio brands and enables us to develop and grow complementary products in our markets. 

Diversified Revenue Base. 

We generate revenue from a diversified base of products and services, advertisers and markets. In the year ended December 31, 2015, pro forma for the Transactions, approximately 50% of our net revenue was derived from sources other than the sale of terrestrial radio station advertising. We refer to this revenue as non-spot revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2015, no single advertiser represented more than 1% of our revenue, no advertising category 

represented more than 20% of our revenue and we did not generate more than 10% of our revenue in any one market or 15% of our revenue in any one state. 

Monetization of Our Audience Relationships. 

We believe that our diversified and integrated product and service offerings, which we refer to as Townsquare Everywhere , combined with our leading market position in small and mid-sized markets based on radio revenue share, together may enable us to generate higher total revenue per audience member than radio station owners focused on larger markets. 

Influential Local and National Brands. 

Strong Brand Recognition with Deep Local Heritage. 

We believe our brands are well positioned, both to defend their competitive position in the radio medium and to expand their competitive position online, on mobile devices and in live events, which will allow for greater audience reach and deeper, more frequent interaction with our audience. 

Original Live Events and Nationally Oriented Digital Brands Delivering Significant Audience Growth. 

In addition to our heritage brands, we have established several new brands that have experienced significant audience growth since their inception. 

Focus On Providing Original Entertainment, Music and Lifestyle Media Experiences to Our Audience. 

We believe that our focus on providing original entertainment, music and lifestyle media experiences to our audience is the key driver of our powerful audience reach and engagement metrics. 

Market Leadership in High-Quality, Live and Locally-Focused Content. 

In our markets, we are among the largest providers of locally-focused content available to consumers, including in-car commuters. The quality and availability of our locally-focused content allows our brands to distinguish themselves from other local advertising offerings, attract larger audiences and build a loyal audience base. Several of our competitors, particularly in print media, are reducing the amount of original local content they are producing or creating pay-walls that restrict access to their digital content. We believe these trends will continue to advantage our offerings versus other media offerings. 

Expertise in Music and Entertainment. 

We believe that our expertise in the creation of music and entertainment content represents the foundation of our audience value proposition and is, in part, responsible for many of the strong metrics evidencing our broad and deep audience engagement, our ability to attract employees who excel at content production and our success with advertisers seeking to reach the valuable consumers attracted by our premium content. 

Attractive Radio Industry Fundamentals. 

The local media industry is an important medium for advertisers to reach targeted local consumers and for consumers to engage with relevant local content and events. Radio is a significant component of total local advertising spend as it remains a highly relevant and important medium for consumers. 

Stable and Engaged Audience Base. &#160; 

&#160; 

Despite the increased number of alternative mediums, terrestrial radio has experienced negligible audience fragmentation over the past 40 years and remains a significant source of daily media exposure. According to the Radio 

Advertising Bureau, in the third quarter of 2015 terrestrial radio broadcasts reached approximately 93% of American adults age 18+ each week, approximately unchanged since 1970. 

Cost-Effective Value Proposition to Advertisers. &#160; 

Given the stability of its audience, its broad reach and its relatively low cost as compared to competing advertising mediums such as television, we believe radio continues to offer an attractive value proposition to advertisers. 

Trusted and Socially-Influential Local Media Personalities. &#160; 

Research suggests that radio personalities are trusted by their audience and are socially influential. Six out of ten listeners in a joint Clear Channel/University of Southern California study, released in April 2014, say radio on-air personalities are "like a friend," whose opinions they trust. Additionally, more than half of the study participants agreed that they trust brands, products and services recommended by their favorite on-air personality. 

Free Delivery of Local Content to End-Users. &#160; 

Terrestrial radio&#8217;s free content distribution model provides an effective competitive advantage against other mediums, particularly those that deploy a subscription-based business model or rely on costs associated with internet connectivity or bandwidth use. In most of our markets, radio represents the only local content available to consumers free of charge. 

Key Provider of Safety Information and Charitable Support in the Communities We Serve. 

Our radio stations and local websites, together with our employees, play a vital role in the communities we serve by providing emergency information in times of crisis and by supporting a wide variety of charitable endeavors. During weather and other emergencies, our audience and government officials rely on our radio stations to disseminate critical, occasionally life-saving, information. Our radio stations and local websites also routinely support charity and community events through on-air and digital promotions to bolster fundraising activities and emergency relief efforts. These efforts further strengthen our position with both our audience and our advertisers. 

Reliable and Substantial Cash Flow Generation. 

Our business enjoys strong cash flow generation owing to the relatively limited capital needs of our operation. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded $14.7 million of capital expenditures which represented 3.3% of net revenue during the same period. In addition, we benefit from certain tax attributes to generate tax deductions which have historically limited the amount of cash taxes we pay. 

Strong, Experienced and Incentivized Management Team and Committed, Well-Capitalized Sponsors. 

We have an experienced senior management team with a proven, multi-disciplinary track record of delivering results for stakeholders. Further, certain funds managed by Oaktree Capital Management, L.P. ("Oaktree") own a majority of our equity. Oaktree is a leading global investment management firm focused on alternative markets and provides strong sponsorship, strategic support and financial resources for our continued growth. 

Operating Strategy 

The principal features of our operating strategy are: 

Diversify Revenue Mix by Continuing to Grow Digital and Live Events Revenue Streams. 

The natural synergies between our products allow us to leverage our operating structure and better monetize existing audience and advertiser relationships. Based on our recent success, we intend to continue to increase our digital 

audience, roll out new digital products and increase the contribution from our live events we operate, both organically and through acquisitions. 

Solidify Our Position in Our Markets. 

Our market positioning is supported by the demonstrable and consistent positive results our products produce for advertisers. The price point for radio advertising on a cost per thousand basis is lower than most other local media which deliver similar scale. This makes radio more affordable and accessible for the type of small and mid-sized businesses typically found in our markets. 

Continue to Develop New Products That Foster Interaction with Our Audience Across Multiple Mediums and Increase Monetization Opportunities. 

Our audience reach, combined with our direct relationship with local advertisers in our markets, positions us to launch and monetize new products and services, further diversifying and growing our revenue. In recent years, we have introduced a mobile station streaming application (radioPup), an e-commerce product (Seize the Deal) and a digital presence and marketing solutions platform (Townsquare Interactive). In addition to delivering non-spot revenue growth, these products and services frequently appeal to advertisers in our markets who may not access our radio products, thereby increasing our overall customer base and advertising market share. 

Continue to Build Our Premium Portfolio of Brands. 

Our branding strategy is fundamental to growing our audience and revenue. Across our markets, we have a large portfolio of distinct local brands that resonate with and appeal to our audiences. Many of our brands have several decades of heritage in our markets. Consumers associate our brands with high quality, locally-relevant content and entertainment. We intend to continue to invest in marketing and promotions in support of our brands and to actively participate in community events to increase our local market presence. 

Focus on Differentiated Live and Local Content. 

We generally provide a larger proportion of live and local content relative to other local media offerings in our markets. We believe such live and local content is more engaging to our audience and significantly differentiates our offerings in an increasingly crowded media landscape, mitigating the threat of audience attrition. Many audio media offerings that we compete with, including Pandora, Spotify and SiriusXM, do not offer local content in our markets. We intend to continue providing audiences with this differentiated content and enjoy the advantages it provides us with our audience and our advertisers. 

Deepen Relationships with Advertisers to Increase Share of Advertising Spend. 

We are committed to growing our sales force, training our sales personnel and investing in programs that allow us to deepen relationships with our advertisers, including developing new products that will allow our content, and our advertisers, to reach a broader audience more frequently and in more locations. Over time, we believe we can capture a greater share of the advertising expenditure in our markets across all mediums. 

Capitalize on Strong Positions and Brands in News/Talk/Sports, Country and Rock Formats. 

We own 72, 68 and 53 radio stations, representing approximately 23%, 22% and 17% of our radio stations, respectively, which are formatted with News/Talk/Sports, Country and Rock content, respectively. The majority of our radio stations airing these formats capture the largest audience among radio stations airing similar content in their respective markets, as ranked by Nielsen or other ratings services. We create audio programming, online content and live events which leverage our strength in these formats, together with the strength of our brands. We intend to continue to use our expertise and knowledge in these formats to share best practices and optimize content across our portfolio, in order to maximize audience aggregation within these formats. 

Leverage Scalable Structure and Continue to Improve Operating Efficiencies Across Our Company. 

Our various media products share common, largely fixed-cost operating infrastructure, resulting in significant scale economies. We also negotiate vendor contracts with key suppliers on a centralized basis, which reduces costs. As a result, as we grow our revenue, a significant majority of each incremental dollar of revenue is converted into incremental earnings. 

Acquisition Strategy 

The principal features of our acquisition strategy are: 

Prudently Pursue Attractively-Valued Acquisition Opportunities. 

We have a successful track record of integrating acquisitions. We intend to continue to pursue attractively-priced acquisitions of radio stations, digital properties and live events. We target assets that have strong brands, enjoy leading market share positions, generate strong cash flow and generally possess traits consistent with our existing assets. In addition, acquiring assets allows us to further achieve certain economies of scale, share best practices across a broader platform and diversify our revenue base across our properties and geographies. 

Add to Our Portfolio of Attractive Radio Station Clusters. 

Since our current senior management team founded the Company in 2010, we have expanded our radio station portfolio from 60 to 309 by completing 11 radio transactions. Radio station ownership in the United States remains significantly fragmented with over 3,000 owners operating over 10,000 commercial radio stations. While FCC ownership limitations restrict, in some cases, our ability to acquire incremental radio stations in certain of our markets, there remain a large number of markets with characteristics that are consistent with Townsquare&#8217;s acquisition criteria, in which we have no presence today. Given our acquisition track record, we are viewed by many sellers of radio stations to be a potential buyer of their stations, which has provided us with the opportunity to review the majority of properties sold in recent years. We expect to remain active and disciplined from a valuation perspective in the radio station marketplace. 

Augment the Growth of Our Digital and Live Events Product Offerings Through Acquisitions. 

In addition to our radio acquisition activity, since 2010 we have executed more than thirty acquisitions of assets in the digital and live events sectors, including certain assets of AOL Music, multi-day music festivals WE &#32; Fest , Mountain Jam &#32;and Country Jam , various trade shows and other live events properties. We also acquired NAME, North America's largest mobile amusement company, in September, 2015, which further extends our multi-product, cross-platform offering and provides additional geographic and revenue diversification. In these acquisitions, we were able to leverage our existing platform in combination with the acquired assets to drive operating efficiencies and financial performance. In many cases, we are able to template acquired live event properties and syndicate them into additional markets across our footprint. We expect to remain active in the digital and live events acquisition marketplace. 

Evaluate New Product Opportunities. 

We have evaluated a number of acquisition opportunities in other sectors that we view as adjacent and complementary to our existing asset portfolio. We expect to continue to consider such opportunities and potentially transact in the event that we find assets that provide a natural extension to our core competencies, further diversify our revenue and demonstrate a risk-reward profile that meets our stringent requirements. 

Sources of Revenue 

We generate revenue by selling multiple products and services across a range of media platforms. We approach our media products holistically, maximizing our revenue potential by pursuing integrated cross-platform sales and solutions for our advertising clients. Specifically, we offer advertisers cross-platform packages that incorporate our 

audience reach across radio, websites, social media, online video, mobile, digital marketing solutions, e-commerce and live events. 

Our revenue is generated primarily through the integrated sale of the following solutions: 

Local Advertising 

&#8226; 

Spot radio advertisements sold to local, regional and national advertisers. 

&#8226; 

Sponsorships, live reads and endorsements sold to local, regional and national advertisers. 

&#8226;

&#8226; 

Barter-based auctions sold to local and regional advertisers. 

&#8226; 

Display, sponsorship and video advertising, including custom developed digital advertisement products, on our affiliated, owned and operated local websites to local, regional and national advertisers. Display and sponsorship advertising on our mobile application, radioPup, sold to local, regional and national advertisers. 

&#8226; 

Advertising and sponsorships in our radio stations&#8217; online radio streams accessible on computing devices as well as on mobile devices through our mobile application, radioPup, sold to local, regional and national advertisers. 

&#8226;

Live Events 

&#8226; 

Tickets, merchandise, rides, food and other concessions and other ancillary products and services sold to our audience. 

&#8226; 

Sponsorships, exhibit space and activations sold to our local, regional and national advertisers. 

&#8226;

Other Media and Entertainment 

&#8226;

&#8226; 

E-Commerce offerings, including daily deals, ongoing deals and auctions sold to local and regional advertisers. 

&#8226; 

Display, sponsorship and video advertising, including custom developed digital advertisement products, on our owned and operated national websites as well as our affiliate websites sold to local, regional and national advertisers. 

&#8226; 

Sponsored video content, including branded content series, often featuring musicians or other celebrities, and distributed across our portfolio of digital properties and social media channels, sold to local, regional and national advertisers. 

&#160; 

We are positioned to generate growth in revenue by increasing audience interaction with our radio stations, local and national websites, online radio streams, mobile applications and live events, which lead to an enhanced share of advertising expenditures, as well as an increased share of consumer spending. 

Our Industry 

The local media industry is an important medium for advertisers to reach targeted local consumers and for consumers to engage with relevant local content and events. According to SNL Kagan, in 2015 local advertising spending across all U.S. major media categories totaled $75.0 billion. Since 2010, U.S. local advertising has increased at a 1.2% compound annual growth rate and is projected to grow at a 4.0% compound annual growth rate through 2020. In 2015, local advertising spending on radio and digital, among our target categories, totaled $34.2 billion while consumer spending on live event tickets and advertiser spending on live event sponsorships, event marketing, and activation opportunities were additional substantial and growing markets. Since 2010, U.S. local advertising spending on radio and digital has increased at a 9.3% compound annual growth rate and is projected to grow at a 7.8% compound annual growth rate through 2020. 

Radio. The primary source of revenue for radio broadcasting companies is the sale of advertising time to local, regional and national spot advertisers, and national network advertisers. According to SNL Kagan, over the past 10 years radio advertising has generally represented approximately 6.3% to 7.9% of the overall U.S. advertising market, and has typically followed macroeconomic growth trends. In 2015, radio advertising revenue reached $14.3 billion of which $10.6 billion was local radio advertising. The radio industry has a stable and engaged audience base and continues to be one of the core methods for advertisers to reach their targeted audience. According to the Radio Advertising Bureau, in the third quarter of 2015, terrestrial radio broadcasts reached approximately 93% of American adults age 18+ each week, a level that has remained substantially unchanged since 1970. 

Digital. &#32;The primary source of revenue for national and local websites, accessed either from a PC, tablet or mobile device, is the sale of search ads, display ads and video advertising directly to advertisers and indirectly through advertising networks and exchanges. According to SNL Kagan, in 2015 digital advertising revenue reached $57.3 billion of which $23.6 billion was local. Since 2010, local digital advertising has represented one of the fastest growing local media advertising categories with a compounded annual growth rate of 17.3%, outpacing national advertising which grew at 16.5%. Local digital advertising is projected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate of 10.7% through 2020 and continue to gain market share on national advertising which is projected to grow at 4.6%. 

Live Events. The primary source of revenue for live events is the sale of tickets to attendees and sponsorships, event marketing, and activation opportunities for local, regional and national advertisers. According to IBIS World, total revenue from the U.S. live event industry, which includes the creation, management and promotion of live performances and events, ranging from concerts and theater performances to state fairs and air shows, grew to $25.1 billion in 2015, up from $20.0 billion in 2010, which represents a 4.7% compounded annual growth rate. Live event industry revenue is projected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate of 5.0% through 2020. For 2015, Pollstar estimates the total size of the North American live concert industry at $6.9 billion, up from $4.3 billion in 2010, which represents a compound annual growth rate of 12.9%. Concert tour attendance increased in 2015, as measured by the top 100 grossing North American concert ticket sales, which increased by 10.2% to over 42 million, representing a record high. 

Competition 

The local media industry is very competitive. The success of each of our radio stations, digital properties and live events depends largely upon each product&#8217;s ability to attract audience, pricing, the number of local media competitors and the overall demand for advertising within individual markets. We mitigate these competitive pressures by focusing on small to mid-sized markets, where there are fewer and less well-capitalized local media competitors across all mediums, including radio stations, broadcast television stations, pay television networks, locally-focused websites, live events, outdoor advertising, newspapers, magazines and directories. The lack of competition often allows our brands to garner a greater share of both the local audience and advertising expenditures in our markets. 

Radio 

Our radio stations compete for audiences and advertising revenue directly with other radio stations within their respective markets as well as with other alternative mediums including satellite radio, television, print and digital media. Additionally, new online music services have begun to sell advertising locally, creating additional competition for both audience and advertisers. By building strong brands with a targeted audience consisting of specific demographic groups in each of our markets, we are able to attract advertisers seeking to reach those particular audiences. 

Factors that affect a radio station&#8217;s competitive position include its brand identity and audience loyalty, management experience, the radio station&#8217;s local audience rank in its market (which is highly affected by the competitive radio landscape in a market and format changes that occur from time to time), transmitter power and location, assigned frequency, audience characteristics, local program acceptance and the number and characteristics of other radio stations and other advertising media in the market area. We attempt to improve our competitive position in each market by constantly researching and improving the content of our radio stations and websites, implementing advertising campaigns aimed at the demographic groups for which our radio stations target content and managing our sales efforts to attract a larger share of advertising dollars for each radio station individually. 

Local Digital Content 

Our websites compete for audiences and advertisers directly with other local radio station websites, television station websites, newspaper websites, online directories, local sections of national digital properties, blogs and other types of locally focused websites, as well as all national and international websites. We attempt to improve our competitive position, maximize our audience and grow our revenue by focusing on high quality, differentiated local content and by providing innovative and effective advertising integration for our customers. 

Live Events 

Our live events compete for audiences and sponsorships with both national competitors, such as Live Nation and AEG, and a variety of local or regional competitors, promoters and event marketing companies. Additionally, we compete with venue operators, including arenas, theaters and casinos, which bring in live entertainment directly. 

Digital Marketing Solutions 

The market for local online advertising solutions is competitive and dynamic. Some of our competitors enjoy substantial competitive advantages, such as greater name recognition, longer operating histories and larger marketing budgets, as well as substantially greater financial, technical and other resources. Our competitors include large internet marketing providers, offline media companies such as yellow page publishers, newspaper and television companies as well as other local SMB marketing providers. 

National Digital Content 

Our national digital assets compete for audience and advertisers with a diverse and large pool of advertising, media and internet companies. We expect that this competition will persist in the future as a result of the continuing maturation of the industry and a lack of significant barriers to entry. Our success will depend upon a number of factors, including the quality of content on our owned and operated as well as our affiliated websites, the ability to manage search engine optimization efforts to direct traffic to these websites, our customer service and support efforts, our sales and marketing efforts and the ability to remain price competitive. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015, we employed approximately 2,900 full and part-time employees. Additionally, we hire approximately 900 seasonal workers between March and November of each year. None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements and we consider our relations with our employees to be satisfactory. 

We employ individuals in a large variety of roles. On occasion, in order to protect our interests we enter into employment agreements with certain of our employees, including members of senior management, product leaders, Local Advertising market general managers and selected sales personnel and local media personalities. We do not believe that the loss of any one these individuals, excluding certain key members of our senior management, would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations, taken as a whole. Our risks related to losing key members of our senior management are more fully described in the section titled "Risk Factors."

Federal Regulation of Radio Broadcasting 

General 

The ownership, operation and sale of radio stations, including those licensed to us, are subject to the jurisdiction of the FCC, which acts under authority of the Communications Act. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 amended the Communications Act and directed the FCC to change certain of its broadcast rules. Among its other regulatory responsibilities, the FCC issues permits and licenses to construct and operate radio stations; assigns broadcast frequencies; determines whether to approve changes in ownership or control of radio station licenses; regulates transmission equipment, operating power and other technical parameters of radio stations; adopts and implements regulations and policies that directly or indirectly affect the ownership, operation and employment practices of radio stations; regulates the content of some forms of radio broadcast content; and has the authority under the Communications Act to impose penalties for violations of its rules. 

The following is a brief summary of certain provisions of the Communications Act and relevant FCC rules and published policies (collectively, the "Communications Laws"). This description does not purport to be comprehensive and reference should be made to the Communications Laws, public notices, and decisions issued by the FCC for further information concerning the nature and extent of federal regulation of radio stations. Failure to observe the provisions of the Communications Laws can result in the imposition of various sanctions, including monetary forfeitures and the grant of a "short-term" (less than the maximum term) license renewal. For particularly egregious violations, the FCC may deny a radio station&#8217;s license renewal application, revoke a radio station&#8217;s license, or deny applications in which an applicant seeks to acquire additional broadcast properties. 

License Grant and Renewal 

Radio broadcast licenses are generally granted and renewed for terms of eight years. Licenses are renewed by filing an application with the FCC. Petitions to deny license renewal applications may be filed by interested parties, including members of the public. While we are not currently aware of any facts that would prevent the renewal of our 

licenses to operate our radio stations, there can be no assurance that any of our licenses will be renewed for a full term without adverse consequences. 

&#160; 

Service Areas 

Each class of FM station has the right to broadcast with a certain amount of power from an antenna located at a certain height. The most powerful FM radio stations are Class C FM radio stations, which may operate with the equivalent of up to 100 kilowatts of effective radiated power ("ERP") at an antenna height of up to 1,968 feet above average terrain. These radio stations typically provide service to large areas that cover one or more counties. There are also Class C0, C1, C2 and C3 FM radio stations which may operate with progressively less power and/or antenna 

height. Class B FM stations operate with the equivalent of up to 50 kilowatts ERP at an antenna height of up to 492 feet above average terrain. Class B radio stations typically serve large metropolitan areas and their outer suburban areas. There are also Class B1 radio stations that can operate with up to 25 kilowatts ERP at an antenna height of up to 328 feet above average terrain. Class A FM radio stations may operate with the equivalent of 6 kilowatts ERP at an antenna height of up to 328 feet above average terrain, and generally serve smaller cities and towns or suburbs of larger cities. 

The area served by an AM radio station is determined by a combination of frequency, transmitter power, antenna orientation and soil conductivity. To determine the effective service area of an AM radio station, the radio station&#8217;s power, operating frequency, antenna patterns and its day/night operating modes are required. The area served by an FM radio station is determined by a combination of transmitter power and antenna height, with radio stations divided into eight classes according to these technical parameters, as set forth above. 

The following tables set forth, as of February 18, 2016, the market, call letters, cities of license, frequencies and FCC license expiration dates and our station clusters&#8217; revenue rankings as reported by Nielsen of all our owned radio stations and all stations operated under Time Brokerage Agreements ("TBAs") or Local Marketing Agreements ("LMAs").

Regulatory Approvals 

The Communications Laws prohibit the assignment or transfer of control of a broadcast license without the prior approval of the FCC. In determining whether to grant an application for assignment or transfer of control of a broadcast license, the Communications Act requires the FCC to find that the assignment or transfer would serve the public interest. The FCC considers a number of factors in making this determination, including (i) compliance with various rules limiting common ownership of media properties, (ii) the financial and "character" qualifications of the assignee or transferee (including those parties holding an "attributable" interest in the assignee or transferee), (iii) compliance with the Communications Act&#8217;s foreign ownership restrictions, and (iv) compliance with other Communications Laws, including those related to content and filing requirements. 

As discussed in greater detail below, the FCC may also review the effect of proposed assignments and transfers of broadcast licenses on economic competition and diversity. See "Antitrust and Market Concentration Considerations." 

Ownership Matters 

The Communications Act restricts us from having more than one-fourth of our equity owned or voted by non-U.S. persons, foreign governments or non-U.S. entities. 

The Communications Laws also generally restrict (i) the number of radio stations one person or entity may own, operate or control in a local market and (ii) the common ownership, operation or control of radio stations and television broadcast stations serving the same local market and the common ownership, operation or control of a radio station and a daily newspaper serving the same local market. 

None of these multiple and cross ownership rules requires any change in our current ownership of radio stations. The Communications Laws could limit the number of additional radio stations that we may acquire in the future in our existing markets as well as new markets. 

The FCC generally applies its television/radio/newspaper cross-ownership rules and its broadcast multiple ownership rules by considering the "attributable" or cognizable interests held by a person or entity. With some exceptions, a person or entity will be deemed to hold an attributable interest in a radio station, television station or daily newspaper if the person or entity serves as an officer, director, partner, stockholder, member, or, in certain cases, a debt holder of a company that owns that broadcast station or newspaper. Whether that interest is attributable and thus subject to the FCC&#8217;s multiple ownership rules is determined by the FCC&#8217;s attribution rules. If an interest is attributable, the FCC treats the person or entity who holds that interest as an "owner" of the radio station, television station or daily newspaper in question, and that interest thus counts against the person in determining compliance with the FCC&#8217;s ownership rules. 

With respect to a partnership (or limited liability company), only the interest of a general partner (or managing member) is attributable if the entity&#8217;s organizational documents include certain terms. With respect to a corporation, officers, directors and persons or entities that directly or indirectly hold 5.0% or more of the corporation&#8217;s voting stock (20.0% or more of such stock in the case of insurance companies, investment companies, bank trust departments and certain other "passive investors" that hold such stock for investment purposes only) generally are attributed with ownership of the radio stations, television stations and daily newspapers owned by the corporation. As discussed below, participation in an LMA or a JSA also may result in an attributable interest. See "Local Marketing Agreements" and "Joint Sales Agreements." 

The following interests generally are not attributable: 

1. 

debt instruments, non-voting stock, and options and warrants for voting stock, partnership interests, or membership interests that have not yet been exercised; 

2. 

limited partnership or limited liability company membership interests where (a) the limited partner or member is not "materially involved" in the media-related activities of the partnership or limited liability company, and (b) the limited partnership agreement or limited liability company agreement expressly "insulates" the limited partner or member from such material involvement by inclusion of provisions specified in FCC rules; and 

3. 

holders of less than 5.0% of an entity&#8217;s voting stock. Non-voting equity and debt interests which, in the aggregate, constitute more than 33.0% of a radio station&#8217;s "enterprise value" (which consists of the total equity and debt capitalization) are considered attributable in certain circumstances. 

In March 2014, as part of its periodic review of broadcast ownership rules required by the Communications Act, the FCC issued a Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking seeking comment on its multiple ownership rules and certain proposed changes to them. The proposals include permitting local radio/newspaper cross-ownership. The FCC also asked for comment on whether to eliminate its radio/television cross-ownership rule. We cannot predict the outcome of this or other proceedings or whether any new rules adopted by the FCC will have a material adverse effect on us. 

Content and Operation 

The Communications Act requires broadcasters to serve the "public interest." To satisfy that obligation, broadcasters are required by the Communications Laws to present content that is responsive to community problems, needs and interests and to maintain certain records demonstrating such responsiveness. Complaints from audiences concerning a radio station&#8217;s content may be filed at any time and will be considered by the FCC both at the time they are filed and in connection with a licensee&#8217;s renewal application. FCC rules also require broadcasters to provide equal employment opportunities ("EEO") in the hiring of new personnel, to abide by certain procedures in advertising employment opportunities, to make information available on employment opportunities on their websites (if they have one), and maintain certain records concerning their compliance with EEO rules. The FCC will entertain individual complaints concerning a broadcast licensee&#8217;s failure to abide by the EEO rules and also conducts random audits on broadcast licensees&#8217; compliance with EEO rules. We have been the subject of several EEO audits. To date, none of those audits has disclosed any major violation that would have a material adverse effect on our operations. Radio stations also must follow provisions in the Communications Laws that regulate a variety of other activities, including political advertising, the broadcast of obscene or indecent content, sponsorship identification, the broadcast of contests and lotteries, and technical operations (including limits on radiofrequency radiation). 

On May 31, 2007, the FCC proposed the adoption of certain rules and other measures to enhance the ability of radio stations to provide content responsive to the needs and interests of their respective communities. The measures proposed include the establishment of guidelines in FCC rules to evaluate the nature and quantity of non-entertainment content provided by the broadcaster, and the requirement that radio stations make their local public inspection files available over the internet. On January 28, 2016, the FCC adopted certain rules requiring radio stations to make their local public files available over the internet on a system hosted by the FCC. The requirements will be phased in over time, starting with stations in the top 50 Nielsen markets with five or more full-time employees. The rules will apply to other stations two years later, on March 1, 2018. Also on January 28, 2016, the FCC proposed adoption of certain 

rules to strengthen the Emergency Alert System ("EAS"). The proposals are intended to facilitate involvement on the state and local levels, support greater testing and awareness of the system, leverage technological advances, and enhance EAS security. We cannot predict at this time to what extent, if any, the FCC&#8217;s proposals will be adopted or the impact which adoption of any one or more of those proposals will have on our Company. 

Local Marketing Agreements 

A number of radio stations, including certain of our radio stations, have entered into LMAs (also known as Time Brokerage Agreements ("TBA")). In a typical LMA, the licensee of a radio station makes available, for a fee, airtime on its radio station to a party which supplies content to be broadcast during that airtime and collects revenue from advertising aired during such content. LMAs are subject to compliance with the antitrust laws and the Communications Laws, including the requirement that the licensee must maintain independent control over the radio station and, in particular, its personnel, content and finances. The FCC has held that such agreements do not violate the Communications Laws as long as the licensee of the radio station receiving content from another station maintains ultimate responsibility for, and control over radio station operations and otherwise ensures compliance with the Communications Laws. 

A radio station that brokers more than 15.0% of the weekly content hours on another radio station in its market will be considered to have an attributable ownership interest in the brokered radio station for purposes of the FCC&#8217;s ownership rules. As a result, a radio station may not enter into an LMA that allows it to program more than 15.0% of the weekly content hours of another radio station that it could not own under the FCC&#8217;s multiple ownership rules. 

Joint Sales Agreements 

From time to time, radio stations enter into JSAs. A typical JSA authorizes one radio station to sell another radio station&#8217;s advertising time and retain the revenue from the sale of that airtime. A JSA typically includes a periodic payment to the radio station whose airtime is being sold (which may include a share of the revenue being collected from the sale of airtime). Like LMAs, JSAs are subject to compliance with antitrust laws and the Communications Laws, including the requirement that the licensee must maintain independent control over the radio station and, in particular, its personnel, content and finances. The FCC has held that such agreements do not violate the Communications Laws as long as the licensee of the radio station whose time is being sold by another station maintains ultimate responsibility for, and control over, radio station operations and otherwise ensures compliance with the Communications Laws. 

Under the Communication Laws, a radio station owner that sells more than 15.0% of the weekly advertising time of another radio station in the same market will be attributed with the ownership of that other station. In that situation, a station cannot have a JSA with another station in the same market if the FCC&#8217;s ownership rules would otherwise prohibit that common ownership. 

Antitrust and Market Concentration Considerations 

Potential future acquisitions, to the extent they meet specified size thresholds, will be subject to applicable waiting periods and possible review under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the "HSR Act"), by the DOJ or the FTC, either of whom can be required to evaluate a transaction to determine whether that transaction should be challenged under the federal antitrust laws. Transactions are subject to the HSR Act only if the acquisition price or fair market value of the radio stations to be acquired is above a certain threshold that increases periodically (presently $78.2 million as of February 25, 2016). Our acquisitions have not met this threshold. Acquisitions that are not required to be reported under the HSR Act may still be investigated by the DOJ or the FTC under the antitrust laws before or after consummation. At any time before or after the consummation of a proposed acquisition, the DOJ or the FTC could take such action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary, including seeking to enjoin the acquisition or seeking divestiture of the business acquired or certain of our other assets. The DOJ has reviewed numerous radio station acquisitions where an operator proposes to acquire additional radio stations in its existing markets or multiple radio stations in new markets and has challenged a number of such transactions. Some of these challenges have resulted in consent decrees requiring the sale of certain radio stations, the termination of LMAs or other relief. In general, the Department of Justice has more closely scrutinized radio mergers and acquisitions resulting 

in local market shares in excess of 35.0% of local radio advertising revenue, depending on format, signal strength and other factors. There is no precise numerical rule, however, and certain transactions resulting in more than 35.0% revenue shares have not been challenged, while certain other transactions may be challenged based on other criteria such as audience shares in one or more demographic groups as well as the percentage of revenue share. We estimate that we have more than a 35.0% share of radio advertising revenue in many of our markets. 

The DOJ enforces the antitrust laws in the broadcasting industry and there can be no assurance that one or more of our pending or future acquisitions will not be the subject of an investigation or enforcement action by the DOJ. Similarly, there can be no assurance that the DOJ, the FTC or the FCC will not prohibit such acquisitions, require that they be restructured, or require that we divest radio stations we already own. In addition, private parties may under certain circumstances bring legal action to challenge an acquisition. 

As part of its review of certain radio station acquisitions, the DOJ has stated publicly that it believes that commencement of operations under LMAs, JSAs and other similar agreements customarily entered into in connection with radio station ownership assignments and transfers prior to the expiration of the waiting period under the HSR Act could violate the HSR Act. In connection with acquisitions subject to the waiting period under the HSR Act, we will not commence operation under an LMA, a JSA, or similar agreement of any affected radio station to be acquired until the waiting period has expired or been terminated.
