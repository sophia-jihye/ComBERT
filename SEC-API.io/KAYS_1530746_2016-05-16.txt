Background 

&#160;

Kaya Holdings, Inc. (f/k/a Alternative Fuels Americas, Inc.), (&#8220;KAYS&#8221;, &#8220;&#8221;we&#8221;, &#8220;us&#8221;, &#8220;our&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) was incorporated in Delaware in 1993 under the name Gourmet Market, Inc. and has engaged in a number of businesses. Its name was changed on May 11, 2007 to Netspace International Holdings, Inc. (&#8220;Netspace&#8221;). Netspace acquired 100% of the capital stock of Alternative Fuels Americas, Inc., a Florida corporation in January 2010 in a stockforstock transaction and issued 100,000 shares of Series C convertible preferred stock to existing shareholders of the Florida corporation. The Company&#8217;s name was changed in October 2010 Netspace International Holdings, Inc. to Alternative Fuels Americas, Inc.

&#160;

From 20102014 the Company was engaged in seeking to develop a biofuels business. In January 2015 the Company determined that it was in the best interests of its stockholders to discontinue its biofuel development activities, and to instead leverage its agricultural and business development experience and focus all its resources on the development of legal medical and recreational marijuana opportunities in the United States and in select international markets.

&#160;

In 2014, KAYS incorporated a subsidiary, Marijuana Holdings Americas, Inc. a Florida corporation (&#8220;MJAI&#8221;). Through MJAI, KAYS has focused on the development of opportunities within the legal recreational and medical marijuana sectors in the United States. In March 2014, MJAI, through an Oregon subsidiary, applied for and was awarded its first license to operate a Medical Marijuana Dispensary (&#8220;MMD&#8221;). The Company developed the KayaShack&#8482; brand for its retail operations and on July 3, 2014 opened its first Kaya Shack&#8482; Medical Marijuana Dispensary in Portland, Oregon, thereby becoming the first US publicly traded company to own and operate a MMD. Initial customer acceptance and media coverage was very positive, including many references to KAYS as the &#8220;Starbucks of Medical Marijuana&#8221; by television news stations, news print publications and online news sources. In March 2015, the Company changed its name to Kaya Holdings, Inc. to better reflect its new plan of operations. 

&#160; 1 &#160; 

&#160; 

In April 2015 KAYS commenced its own medical marijuana grow operations for the cultivation and harvesting of legal marijuana, thereby becoming the the first US publicly traded company to own a majority interest in a vertically integrated legal marijuana enterprise in the United States. The Company opened its second MMD (and first Kaya Shack&#8482; Marijuana Superstore) in October 2015 in Salem, Oregon. During 2015, the Company also consolidated its grow operations and manufacturing operations into a single facility in Portland, Oregon.In October 2015, Oregon commenced legal recreational marijuana sales, which are initially being conducted solely through State Licensed MMDs including those operated by the Company. The Company plans to open at least two additional dispensaries in Oregon during 2016, and in April 2016 entered into leases and filed increased applications for the next 2 locations. 

&#160;

&#160;

General 

&#160;

Following the successful introduction of legal recreational marijuana in Colorado and Washington, the Company incorporated MJAI, its majority-owned subsidiary, to operate as a grower, processor, distributor and/or retailer of legal recreational and/or medical marijuana in jurisdictions where it is legal in accordance with State law. After an evaluation of several factors including barriers to entry, costs and potential, the Company targeted Oregon as the first market within which to open a state licensed MMD.

&#160;

In March 2014, MJAI, through an Oregon subsidiary, applied for and was awarded its first license to operate a MMD. The Company developed the KayaShack&#8482; brand for its retail operations and on July 3, 2014 opened the first Kaya Shack at 1719 SE Hawthorne Boulevard in Portland, Oregon. In April 2015 KAYS commenced its own medical marijuana grow operations for the cultivation and harvesting of legal marijuana. In October 2015, concurrent with Oregon commencing legal sales of recreational marijuana through MMDs KAYS opened its second retail operation in Salem, Oregon, the KayaShack&#8482; Marijuana Superstore. The Company houses its marijuana grow and manufacturing facilities at the KayaShack&#8482; West Coast Base of Operations in Portland. The Company plans to open at least two additional dispensaries in Oregon during 2016.

&#160;

Market Overview 

&#160;

According to an article published by CBS News Moneywatch, the legal marijuana industry is the fastest growing business in the United States. Steve Berg, a former managing director of Wells Fargo Bank has published a report citing Cannabis as being one of the fastest growing domestic industries, citing that &#8220;Domestically, we weren't able to find any market that is growing as quickly.&#34;

&#160;

According to the New York Times, Arcview, (a group active in tracking the legal marijuana industry) has published a report stating that legal marijuana sales have increased from $4.6 billion in 2014 to $5.4 billion. Forecasts for 2016 are up 25% to $7.7 billion with the 2020 mark potentially exceeding $22 billion.

&#160;

Estimates from various sources for the size of the long term market range from up to an excess of $100 billion if Federal Prohibition is repealed and marijuana sales become legal in all 50 states and Washington D.C. (for perspective beer is approximately a $100 billion market, with wine just under $30 billion and coffee approximately $12 billion).

&#160;

Twenty-seven states and the District of Columbia have either legalized medical marijuana or decriminalized marijuana possession -- or both. Additionally, four states have voted-in recreational marijuana laws with active legal cannabis economies flourishing in Colorado and Washington. Effective October 1, 2015 Oregon commenced early recreational sales of marijuana (&#8220;flower&#8221; only, no concentrates or edibles) through existing medical marijuana dispensaries, with full recreational licensing and sales scheduled to begin in 2016.

&#160;

Potential legislative actions and ballot initiatives are planned over the next two years for several states including Arizona, California, Florida, Hawaii, Maine, Massachusetts, Missouri, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Ohio.

Kaya Shack&#8482; Medical Marijuana Dispensaries and Recreational Marijuana Retail Stores 

&#160;

Kaya Holdings operates the Kaya Shack&#8482; brand of medical marijuana dispensaries.

&#160;

Dubbed by the mainstream press as the &#8220;Starbucks of Marijuana&#8221; after our first store opened in July, 2014, our operating concept is simple to deliver a consistent customer experience (quality products, fair prices and superior customer service) to a broad and diverse base of customers. Kaya Shack&#8482; meets the quality needs of the &#8220;marijuana enthusiast&#8221;, the comfort and atmosphere of all including &#8220;soccer moms&#8221; and the price sensitivities of casual smokers.

&#160;

The Kaya Shack&#8482; brand communicates positive thinking and joy, with signs adorning the walls that read &#8220;It&#8217;s a Good Day to have a Good Day&#8221; and &#8220;Some of our Happiest Days Haven&#8217;t Even Happened Yet&#8221; , and our signature &#8220;Be Kind&#8221; .

&#160;

Kaya Shack&#8482; Stores are open 7 days a week from 8:00 am to 9:00 pm. Operations follow an operational manual that details procedures for 18 areas of operation including safety, compliance, store opening, store closing, merchandising, handling of cash, inventory control, product intake, store appearance and employee conduct.

&#160;

In compliance with regulations, all marijuana and marijuana infused products sold through our stores are quality tested by independent labs to assure adherence to strict quality and purity standards.

&#160;

Our two currently operating locations operate as medical marijuana dispensaries (MMDs), and as of October 1, 2015 they became licensed to offer recreational sales pursuant to a bill passed by both Houses of the Oregon Legislature. When recreational licenses are available in 2016 we will apply for retail sales licenses for bothl locations but still intend to service our medical marijuana patients as the law permits. We intend to open at least two additional retail outlets in Oregon during 2016, and in April 2016 entered into leases and filed increased applications for the next 2 locations. 

&#160;

CBS Oregon Affiliate KOIN Channel 6 Television News featured Kaya Holdings and the Kaya Shack&#8482; Retail Marijuana Store in Portland, Oregon on the eve of recreational sales, and spotlighted the company&#8217;s stock and status as the first fully reporting US Public Company to commence legal recreational marijuana sales.

Retail Locations 

&#160; 

I. Kaya Shack&#8482; , 1719 SE Hawthorne Blvd., Portland, Oregon 

&#160; &#160; 

&#160; &#160; &#160; 

Our flagship Hawthorne Boulevard Store opened July 3, 2014. The location is prime Portland real estate, located in an area that many term as &#8220;the Greenwich Village of Portland&#8221;.

&#160;

The Portland facility rotates through approximately 100 different strains throughout the year and in any given month features over 35 popular strains of marijuana including our proprietary, high-grade &#8220;Kaya Kush&#8221; (independent testing performed on 3/10/2016 confirms a total THC/Cannabinoid content of approximately 28%). Our stores also feature various concentrates, including butane hash oil (B.H.O.) and CO2 oil extract (wax, shatter) which range in potency from approximately 40% to over 80% THC, as well as high grade Oils and Tinctures, high CBD &#8211; low THC strains and &#8220;Kaya Candies&#8221;, &#8220;Kaya Caramels&#8221; and an assortment of cookies and cakes for patients who do not smoke.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

II. Kaya Shack &#8482; Marijuana Superstore, South Salem, Oregon 

&#160;

&#160; &#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Our second location (the first Kaya Shack&#8482; Marijuana Superstore) opened for business on October 17, 2015 in South Salem, Oregon in time to take advantage of early recreational sales.

&#160;

The store is located in first class strip mall space adjacent to &#8220;Little Caesars Pizza&#8221; and &#8220;Aaron Rents&#8221;, with a footprint roughly three times the size of our first Kaya Shack&#8482; in Portland. The location and floorplan was carefully chosen with an eye towards concept expansion to enhance revenues and broaden branding opportunities.

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

In addition to the recreational and medical marijuana products as offered at our Hawthorne location, the space allows for additional products and concept innovations to be introduced. These include the Kaya Caf&#233; Juice Bar &#8482; (featuring THC and CBD enhanced juices and beverages) and the Kaya Clone Room &#8482; (supplying marijuana plants and home cultivation accessories) and additional unique on-site concepts.

&#160; 5 &#160; 

&#160; 

Additional Retail Outlets 

&#160;

In April 2016, the Company entered into leases for two additional retail outlets in Salem, Oregon (III and IV which are listed below). Subject to securing necessary licensing and completing facility buildout, we plan to open these locations in summer of 2016 as well:

&#160; 

III. Kaya Shack&#8482; Marijuana Superstore, North Salem, Oregon &#160;

&#160; 

Our third Kaya Shack&#8482; is targeted to open in summer of 2016 in North Salem, Oregon.

&#160; 

On April 1, 2016 the Company executed a lease with the landlord and has subsequently filed for an updated provisional license from the Oregon Medical Marijuana Program (OMMP). Upon securing the updated provisional license from the OMMP (anticipated but not yet received) the Company intends to commence with site buildout and final licensing procedure.

&#160;

As with the South Salem Store, the location is first class space, adjacent to Starbucks Coffee and has a footprint of approximately 2600 square feet. This will be our largest location yet and will be our intended &#8220;Marijuana Superstore&#8221; model going forward. In addition to the benefits of our South Salem store, this location was chosen with an eye towards completing market penetration of the Salem Metropolitan Area which hosts a population of approximately 400,000 people. We also intend to expand our product offerings here as well as utilize the additional space to host community events we hope will help make the Kaya Shack&#8482; a destination for cannabis consumers.

&#160; 

IV. Kaya Shack&#8482; Marijuana Superstore, Central Salem, Oregon 

&#160;

Our fourth Kaya Shack&#8482; is also targeted to open in summer of 2016 in Central Salem, Oregon.

&#160;

On April 1, 2016 the Company executed a lease with the landlord and now subsequently filed for a provisional license from the OMMP. Upon securing the provisional license from the OMMP (approved but not yet received) the Company indents to commence with the building and find licensing proceduer.

&#160;

As with the other Salem Stores the location is first class space, adjacent to fast food stores and nearby popular national retail chain stores. It also has a footprint of approximately 2600 square feet and will be constructed using our &#8220;Marijuana Superstore&#8221; model.

KayaFarms&#8482; Consolidated Marijuana Grow and Manufacturing Facility, West Coast Base of Operations 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

Kaya Holdings operates the Kaya Farms&#8482; West Coast Base of Operations, which houses its marijuana grow operations and manufacturing facility. This enables us to provide its Kaya Shack&#8482; dispensaries with top grade connoisseur quality marijuana products including flower, concentrates and extracts, and edibles.

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 7 &#160; 

&#160; 

I n August 2015, the Company leased a 6,000 square foot facility in central Portland to serve as its West Coast Base of Operations and to consolidate our grow and manufacturing operations in a single location, including all grow equipment, plants and related Oregon Medical Marijuana Program (OMMP) grow licenses and patient grow cards into the new facility. In late March 2016, the Company filed for additional OMMP grow licenses and patient grow cards which will allow us to double our production capability, while we sort out obtaining new Oregon Liquor Control Commission (OLCC) Recreational Grow Licensing (whether at this location or elsewhere) so that we are able to maintain an increased and uninterrupted supply chain. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

While the Company hopes to maintain long-term operations at this site, capital improvements and equipment purchase are being done in a manner that would allow for relocation to another facility in the event that licensing laws currently under development mandated operational relocation. Our end goal is designed to increase the perpetual harvest room model to potentially include more than 100 strains of marijuana and substantially increase our production volume while lowering costs.

New Brand Launched 

&#160;

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The Company recently introduced a signature line of strain-specific connoisseur-grade, pre-rolled cannabis cigarettes branded as &#8220;Kaya Buddies&#8482;&#8221;. The brand, marketed under the tagline &#8220;Buds with Benefits&#8221;, features over 25 different strains of connoisseur-grade, high quality cannabis and proprietary specialty blends. The Kaya Buddies&#8482; cannabis cigarettes, made from 100% cannabis bud only, was launched in mid-March in the Kaya Shack&#8482; stores in Oregon and are targeted to service the exploding legal recreational marijuana market.

&#160;

Limited test marketing of the Kaya Buddies&#8482; cannabis cigarettes resulted in a sales increase of approximately 100% for the month of February versus sales of non-branded generic cannabis pre-rolls for the month of January, without any marketing efforts, which we are now ramping up with the assistance of our marketing team.

&#160;

Kaya Buddies&#8482; cannabis cigarettes are first being marketed through our internal retail network but are also being targeted for potential distribution lines to other dispensaries. Additionally, the Company is evaluating different manufacturing opportunities and related activities at the space for a wide range of marijuana production activites.

&#160;

&#160; 

Florida 

&#160;

&#160; 

Medical Marijuana has qualified for Florida&#8217;s November 2016 Ballot, and KAYS and its associates have been asked to play a role in the passage of the effort.

&#160;

Analysts have estimated that Florida's Medical Marijuana Market could be second only to California (which has hundreds of thousands of patients and annual sales estimated to exceed $700 million).

&#160;

KAYS has established a firm position in the emerging Florida market through founding and sponsoring of the Florida Cannabis Industry Association and alliances with other groups seeking passage of medical marijuana/recreational legislation in Florida. Judging from the experiences in other states, such as Colorado, Oregon and Nevada, the local Cannabis Industry Association is a leading force in the construction and passage of the legislation that decriminalizes marijuana and permits its legal cultivation, distribution, possession and sale for recreational and/or medicinal purposes. Through leadership efforts in the Florida Cannabis Industry Association and an alliance with the Drug Policy Alliance their lobbying affiliate, Drug Policy Action, the Company expects to be well positioned in helping to shape the legislation and obtain licenses if medical marijuana and/or recreational marijuana is eventually legalized in the highly coveted Florida market.

&#160;

Other Markets 

&#160;

The Company intends to seek additional licensing opportunities in various states and territories throughout the country which have legalized recreational and/or medical marijuana use, as well as select states and territories where legalization is pending or is otherwise under consideration through joint efforts with the Drug Policy Alliance and their lobbying affiliate, Drug Action and other activists and lobbyists.

&#160;

Other potential future target markets include Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois, Michigan, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, Vermont, Washington D.C., Washington State and others.

&#160;

&#160; 22 &#160; 

&#160; 

Growth Strategy 

&#160;

The Company has established a well-defined strategy for entering and maintaining a strong presence in the legal marijuana sector. The cornerstones of this strategy include:

&#160;

&#8226; All operations are to be conducted in accordance with state and local laws and regulations and guidance outlined in the U.S. Department of Justice &#8220;Cole Memo&#8221; dated August 29, 2013. &#8226; The Company will seek to operate in a vertically integrated manner (grow, process and sell) wherever permitted by law. In states where vertical integration is not permitted, the Company plans to determine which of the permitted activities offers the most potential for growth and value creation. &#8226; The Company will seek to engage, sponsor or lead local advocacy and lobbying groups that have a significant impact on the evolution and character of laws and the regulations under which legal marijuana operations are implemented in select markets. &#8226; The Company shall work with law enforcement and government officials to insure compliance with all regulations. 

&#160;

Marketing and Sales 

&#160;

The Company will only market its legal marijuana as in compliance with applicable State law.

&#160;

The Company launched Kaya Shack&#8482;&#8217;s marketing campaign on January 1, 2015, prior to which the store&#8217;s customer base was organically developed. The plan is comprised of 4 cornerstones:

&#160;

&#8226; Promoting and establishing the Kaya Shack&#8482; brand. &#8226; A positive and active online presence. &#8226; Daily specials and promotions. &#8226; Quirky and fun holiday specials. &#160; 

The core strategic marketing objectives include:

&#160; 

&#8226; Establish the Kaya Shack&#8482; Brand &#8211; positioning the Company&#8217;s brand to have positive and value related associations with all prospective and existing customers. &#8226; Operate Cooperatively - cooperation, as a strategy, helps develop a network of suppliers and marketing channels able to promote Kaya Shack&#8482;. &#8226; Deliver Value - customer value is achieved when the perceived value of what we sell along with the value of the experience we deliver exceeds the price we charge. &#8226; Drive Customer Traffic - the only two ways to increase store income is to sell more to our existing customers and attract new customers. Programs are in place to accomplish both tasks. &#160;

&#160; 23 &#160; 

&#160; 

Government Regulation 

&#160; 

General 

&#160; 

We are subject to general business regulations and laws, as well as regulations and laws directly applicable to our operations. As we continue to expand the scope of our operations, the application of existing laws and regulations could include matters such as pricing, advertising, consumer protection, quality of products, and intellectual property ownership. In addition, we will also be subject to new laws and regulations directly applicable to our activities.

&#160;

Any existing or new legislation applicable to us could expose us to substantial liability, including significant expenses necessary to comply with such laws and regulations, which could hinder or prevent the growth of our business.

&#160;

Federal, state and local laws and regulations governing legal recreational and medical marijuana use are broad in scope and are subject to evolving interpretations, which could require us to incur substantial costs associated with compliance. In addition, violations of these laws or allegations of such violations could disrupt our planned business and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, it is possible that additional or revised federal, state and local laws and regulations may be enacted in the future governing the legal marijuana industry. There can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with any such laws and regulations and its failure to do so could significantly harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

The legal marijuana sector is rapidly growing and the Company faces significant competition in the operation of MMDS and Grow facilities. Many of these competitors will have far greater experience, more extensive industry contacts and greater financial resources than the Company. There can be no assurance that we can adequately compete to succeed in our business plan.

&#160;

Employees 

&#160;

As of the date of this Annual Report, our Oregon operations have a total of seventeen (17) part-time store employees including budtenders, trimmers, growers, and 3 full-time employees- a Store Manager, a Sales and Marketing Coordinator and the Director of Dispensary and Grow Operations. Additionally we engage several consultants to assist with daily duties and business plan implementation and execution. Additional employees will be hired and other consultants engaged in the future as our business expands.
