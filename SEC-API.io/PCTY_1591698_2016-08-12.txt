Overview 

&#160; 

We are a cloud-based provider of payroll and human capital management, or HCM, software solutions for medium-sized organizations, which we define as those having between 20 and 1,000 employees. Our comprehensive and easy-to-use solutions enable our clients to manage their workforces more effectively. As of June 30, 2016, we served approximately 12,500 clients across the U.S., which on average had over 100 employees. Our solutions help drive strategic human capital decision-making and improve employee engagement by enhancing the human resource, payroll and finance capabilities of our clients. 

&#160; 

Our multi-tenant software platform is highly configurable and includes a unified suite of payroll and HCM applications, such as time and labor tracking, benefits and talent management. Our solutions have been organically developed from our core payroll solution, which we believe is the most critical system of record for medium-sized organizations and an essential gateway to other HCM functionality. Our payroll and HCM applications use a unified database and provide robust on-demand reporting and analytics. Our platform provides intuitive self-service functionality for employees and managers combined with seamless integration across all our solutions. We supplement our comprehensive software platform with an integrated implementation and client service organization, all of which are designed to meet the needs of medium-sized organizations. 

&#160; 

Effective management of human capital is a core function in all organizations and requires a significant commitment of resources. Organizations are faced with complex and ever-changing requirements, including diverse federal, state and local regulations across multiple jurisdictions. In addition, the workplace operating environment is rapidly changing as employees increasingly become mobile, work remotely and expect an end user experience similar to that of consumer-oriented Internet applications. Medium-sized organizations operating without the infrastructure, expertise or personnel of larger enterprises are uniquely pressured in this complex and dynamic environment. Existing solutions offered by third-party payroll service providers can have limited capabilities and configurability while enterprise-focused software vendors can be expensive and time-consuming to implement and manage. We believe that medium-sized organizations are better served by solutions designed to meet their unique needs. 

&#160; 

Our solutions provide the following key benefits to our clients: 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Comprehensive cloud-based platform optimized to meet the payroll and HCM needs of medium-sized organizations;

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Modern, intuitive user experience and self-service capabilities that significantly increase employee engagement;

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Flexible and configurable platform that aligns with business processes and centralizes payroll and HCM data;

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Software as a service, or SaaS, delivery model that reduces total cost of ownership for our clients; and

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Seamless data integration with our extensive partner ecosystem that saves time and expense and reduces the risk of errors.

&#160; 

We market and sell our products primarily through our direct sales force. We generate sales leads through a variety of focused marketing initiatives and from our extensive referral network of 401(k) advisors, benefits administrators, insurance brokers, third-party administrators and HR consultants. We derive revenue from a client based on the solutions purchased by the client, the number of client employees and the amount, type and timing of services provided in respect of those client employees. Our annual revenue retention rate was greater than 92% in each of the fiscal years 2014, 2015 and 2016. Our total revenues increased from $108.7 million in fiscal 2014 to $152.7 million in fiscal 2015, representing a 40% year-over-year increase and to $230.7 million in fiscal 2016, representing a 51% year-over-year increase. Our recurring revenues increased from $101.9 million in fiscal 2014 to $144.1 million in fiscal 2015, representing a 41% year-over-year increase, and to $220.1 million in fiscal 2016, representing a 53% year-over-year increase. Although we do not have long-term contracts with our clients and our agreements with clients are generally terminable on 60 days&#146; or less notice, our recurring revenue model provides significant visibility into our future operating results. 

&#160; 

Industry Background 

&#160; 

Effective management of human capital is a core function for all organizations and requires a significant commitment of resources. Identifying, acquiring and retaining talent is a priority at all levels of an organization. In today&#146;s increasingly complex business and regulatory environment, organizations are being pressured to manage critical payroll and HCM functions more effectively, automate manual processes and decrease their operating costs. 

&#160; 

Complex and Dynamic Tax and Regulatory Environment 

&#160; 

The tax and regulatory environment in the United States is complex and dynamic. Organizations are subject to a myriad of tax, benefit, workers compensation, healthcare and other rules, regulations and reporting obligations. In addition to U.S. federal taxing and regulatory authorities, there are more than 10,000 state and local tax codes in the United States. Further, federal, state and local government agencies continually enact and amend the rules, regulations and reporting requirements with which organizations must comply. 

&#160; 

Growing Demand for Mobility and Enhanced User Experience 

&#160; 

Connectivity and mobility are enabling employees to spend less time in traditional office environments and more time working remotely. This trend increases the demand for advanced and intuitive solutions that improve collaboration and foster employee engagement, such as remote self-service access to payroll and timesheet reporting, HR and benefits portals and other talent management applications. Given the prominence of consumer-oriented Internet applications, employees expect the user experience and accessibility of internal systems to be similar to those of the latest Internet applications, such as LinkedIn, Amazon and Facebook. 

&#160; 

Medium-Sized Organizations Face Unique Challenges 

&#160; 

Medium-sized organizations functioning without the infrastructure, expertise or personnel of larger enterprises are uniquely pressured in the current complex and dynamic environment. Employees in these medium-sized organizations often perform multiple job functions, and many medium-sized organizations have limited financial, technical and other resources needed to effectively manage their critical business requirements and to build and maintain the systems required to do so. 

&#160; 

Large Market Opportunity for Payroll and HCM Solutions 

&#160; 

According to market analyses published by International Data Corporation, or IDC, titled Worldwide and U.S. Human Capital Management Applications 2015-2019 Forecast (June 2015) and U.S. Payroll Outsourcing Services Forecast, 2015-2019 (November 2015), the U.S. market for HCM applications and payroll outsourcing services is estimated to be $25 billion in 2016. The market opportunity is driven by the importance of payroll and HCM solutions to the successful management of organizations. 

&#160; 

To estimate our addressable market, we focus our analysis on the number of U.S. medium-sized organizations and the number of their employees. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, there were over 597,000 firms with 20 to 999 employees in the U.S. in 2013, employing over 42 million persons. We estimate that if clients were to buy our entire suite of existing solutions at list prices, they would spend approximately $270 per employee annually. Based on this analysis, we believe our current target addressable market is approximately $11.0 billion. Our existing clients do not typically buy our entire suite of solutions, and as we continue to expand our product offerings, we believe that we have an opportunity to increase the amount clients spend on payroll and HCM solutions per employee and to expand our addressable market. 

&#160; 

Organizations Are Increasingly Transitioning to SaaS Solutions 

&#160; 

SaaS solutions are easier and more affordable to implement and operate than those offered by traditional software providers. SaaS solutions also enable software updates with greater frequency and without new hardware investments, enabling organizations to better react to changes in their environments. Many organizations are transitioning to SaaS solutions for front-office business applications such as salesforce management. Similarly, we believe organizations are adopting back-office SaaS applications, such as payroll and HCM, with increasing frequency. According to a market analysis published by IDC, titled Worldwide SaaS and Cloud 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Software 2015-2019 Forecast and 2014 Vendor Shares (August 2015), the U.S. SaaS market is estimated to be $46 billion in 2016 and is projected to grow at a 17% compound annual growth rate from 2014 to 2019. 

&#160; 

Limitations of Existing Solutions 

&#160; 

We believe that existing payroll and HCM solutions have limitations that cause them to underserve the unique needs of medium-sized organizations. Existing payroll and HCM solutions include: 

&#160; 

&#183; Traditional Payroll Service Providers . Traditional payroll service providers are primarily focused on delivery of a variety of payroll processing services, insurance products and HR business process outsourcing solutions. Many of these solutions offer limited capabilities and integration beyond traditional payroll processing. The lack of a unified and configurable payroll and HCM suite can diminish the effectiveness of a system, detract from user experience and limit integration with other solutions. In addition, we believe that certain traditional payroll service providers often do not provide a high-quality client service experience.

&#160; 

&#183; Enterprise-Focused Payroll and HCM Software Vendors . Enterprise-focused software vendors offer solutions and services that are designed for the complex needs and structures of large enterprises. As a result, their solutions can be expensive, complex and time-consuming to implement, operate and maintain.

&#160; 

&#183; HCM Point Solution Providers . Many HCM point solutions lack integrated payroll functionality. The implementation and management of multiple point solutions and the reliance on multiple service organizations can be challenging and expensive for medium-sized organizations.

&#160; 

&#183; Manual Processes for Payroll and HCM Functions . Manual payroll and HCM processes require increased HR, payroll and finance personnel involvement, resulting in higher costs, slower processing and greater risks of data entry errors.

&#160; 

Given the challenges medium-sized organizations face operating in complex and dynamic environments and the limited ability of traditional offerings to address these challenges, we believe there is a significant market opportunity for a comprehensive, unified SaaS solution designed to serve the payroll and HCM needs of medium-sized organizations. 

&#160; 

Segment Information 

&#160; 

Our chief operating decision maker reviews our financial results in total when evaluating financial performance and for purposes of allocating resources. We have thus determined that we operate in a single cloud-based software solution reporting segment. 

&#160; 

Our Solution 

&#160; 

We are a cloud-based provider of payroll and HCM software solutions for medium-sized organizations. Our solutions enable medium-sized organizations to more efficiently manage payroll and human capital in their complex and dynamic operating environments. As of June 30, 2016, we served approximately 12,500 clients across the U.S., which on average had over 100 employees. 

&#160; 

The key benefits of our solution include the following: 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Comprehensive Platform Optimized for Medium-Sized Organizations. Our solutions empower finance and HR professionals in medium-sized organizations to drive strategic human capital decisions by providing enterprise-grade payroll and HCM applications, including robust reporting and analytics. Our unified platform fully automates payroll and HCM processes, enabling our clients to focus on core business activities. Our solutions help our clients attract, retain and manage their employees within a single, comprehensive system.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Modern, Intuitive User Experience. Our intuitive, easy-to-use interface is based on current technology and automatically adapts to users&#146; devices, including mobile platforms, thereby significantly increasing accessibility of our solutions and decreasing the need for training. Our platform&#146;s self-service functionality and performance management applications provide employees with an engaging experience. Our performance management applications include peer-to-peer employee recognition and social employee profiles that create a reward and recognition environment resulting in greater employee engagement.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Flexible and Configurable Platform. We design our solutions to be flexible and configurable, allowing our clients to match their use of our software with their specific business processes and workflows. Our platform has been organically developed from a common code base, data structure and user interface, providing a consistent user experience with powerful features that are easily adaptable to our clients&#146; needs. Our systems centralize payroll and HCM data, minimizing inconsistent and incomplete information that can be produced when using multiple databases.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Highly-Attractive SaaS Solution for Medium-Sized Organizations . Our solutions are cloud-based and offered on a subscription basis, making them easier and more affordable to implement, operate and update and enabling our clients to focus less on their IT infrastructure and more on their core businesses. Our cloud-based software can be operated by a single administrator without the support of an in-house information technology department. Our multi-tenant and modern

&#160; 

&#160; 

architecture allows for frequent software enhancements thereby enabling our clients to react to a rapidly changing and complex operating environment. Our cloud-based platform enables our clients to scale their businesses without having to acquire additional hardware or to resolve the integration challenges that often result from traditional outsourcing solutions. 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Seamless Integration with Extensive Ecosystem of Partners . Our platform offers our clients automated data integration with over 200 related third-party partner systems, such as 401(k), benefits and insurance provider systems. This integration reduces the complexity and risk of error of manual data transfers and saves time for our clients and their employees. We integrate data with these related systems through a secure connection, which significantly decreases the risk of unauthorized third-party access and other security breaches. Our direct and automated data transmission improves the accuracy of data and facilitates data collection in our partners&#146; systems. We believe having automated data integration with a payroll and HCM provider like us differentiates our partners&#146; product offerings, strengthening their competitive positioning in their own markets.

&#160; 

Our Strategy 

&#160; 

We intend to strengthen and extend our position as a provider of cloud-based payroll and HCM software solutions to medium-sized organizations. Key elements of our strategy include: 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Grow Our Client Base . We believe that our current client base represents only a small portion of the medium-sized organizations that could benefit from our solutions. While we served approximately 12,500 clients across the U.S. as of June 30, 2016, there were over 597,000 firms with 20 to 999 employees in the United States, employing more than 42 million persons, according to the U.S. Census Bureau in 2013. In order to acquire new clients, we plan to continue to grow our sales organization aggressively across all U.S. geographies.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Expand Our Product Offerings . We believe that our leadership position is in significant part the result of our investment and innovation in our product offerings designed for medium-sized organizations. Therefore, we plan to increase investment in software development to continue to advance our platform and expand our product offerings. For example, we released ACA Enhanced in fiscal year 2016, which provides a compliance and reporting solution for the Affordable Care Act. We will be releasing Paylocity Recruiting in fiscal year 2017, which is an applicant tracking tool that automates critically important steps in the hiring and decision making process.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Increase Average Revenue Per Client . Our average revenue per client has consistently increased in each of the last three years as we have broadened our product offerings. We plan to further grow average revenue per client by selling a broader selection of products to new and existing clients.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Extend Technological Leadership . We believe that our organically developed cloud-based multi-tenant software platform, combined with our unified database architecture, enhances the experience and usability of our products, providing what we believe to be a competitive advantage over alternative solutions. Our modern, intuitive user interface utilizes features found on many popular consumer Internet sites, enabling users to use our solutions with limited training. We plan to continue our technology innovation, as we have done with our mobile applications, social features and analytics capabilities.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Further Develop Our Referral Network . We have developed a strong network of referral participants, such as 401(k) advisors, benefits administrators, insurance brokers, third-party administrators and HR consultants that recommend our solutions and provide referrals. We believe that our platform&#146;s automated data integration with over 200 related third-party partner systems is valuable to our referral participants, as they are able to access payroll and HR data through a single system which decreases complexity and cost and complements their own product offerings. We plan to increase integration with third-party providers and expand our referral network to grow our client base and lower our client acquisition costs.

Implementation and Client Services 

&#160; 

Delivering our clients a positive experience is an essential element of our ability to sell our solutions and retain our clients. We provide our clients with a single point-of-contact supplemented by teams with deep technical and subject matter expertise. The single point of contact allows our account managers to better understand our clients&#146; needs, which we believe strengthens our client relationships. 

&#160; 

Implementation and Training Services 

&#160; 

Our clients are medium-sized organizations that are typically migrating to our platform from a competitive solution or are adopting an online payroll and HCM solution for the first time. These organizations often have limited internal resources and generally rely on us to implement our solutions. 

&#160; 

We typically implement our Paylocity Web Pay product within only three to four weeks, and any additional products thereafter, as requested by the client. Each client is guided through the implementation process by an implementation consultant who serves as a single point-of-contact for all implementation matters. We believe our ability to rapidly implement our solutions is principally due to the combination of our emphasis on engagement with the client, our standardized methodology, our cloud-based architecture and our highly-configurable, easy-to-use products. 

&#160; 

We offer our clients the opportunity to participate in formal training designed to increase their ability to further utilize the functionality of our products within their organizations. Our training courses are designed to enable selected employees of our clients to develop expertise in our solutions and act as a first-level support resource for their colleagues. 

&#160; 

In order to ensure client satisfaction, a team of client service representatives conducts a comprehensive audit of a client&#146;s account after the client has completed the implementation process. Thereafter, the client is transitioned to our client service team. 

&#160; 

Client Service 

&#160; 

Our client service model is designed to serve the needs of medium-sized organizations and to build loyalty by developing strong relationships with our clients. We strive to achieve high revenue retention, in part, by delivering high-quality service. Our revenue retention was greater than 92% in each of fiscal 2014, 2015 and 2016. 

&#160; 

Each client is assigned an account manager who serves as the central point-of-contact for any questions or support needs. We believe this approach enhances our client service by providing each client with a single person who understands the client&#146;s business, responds quickly and is accountable for the client experience. Our account managers are supplemented by teams with deep technical and subject matter expertise who help to expediently and effectively address client needs. We also proactively solicit client feedback through ongoing surveys from which we receive actionable feedback that we use to enhance our client service processes. 

&#160; 

Tax and Regulatory Services 

&#160; 

Our software contains a rules engine designed to make accurate tax calculations that is continually updated to support all pertinent legislative changes across all U.S. jurisdictions. Our tax filing service provides a variety of solutions to our clients including processing payroll tax deposits, preparing and filing quarterly and annual tax returns and amendments and resolving client tax notices. 

&#160; 

Clients 

&#160; 

As of June 30, 2016, we provided our solutions to approximately 12,500 clients in all U.S states. Although many clients have multiple divisions, segments or locations, we only count such clients once for these purposes. 

&#160; 

Our clients include for-profit and non-profit organizations across industries including business services, financial services, healthcare, manufacturing, restaurants, retail, technology and others. For each of the three years ended June 30, 2014, 2015 and 2016, no client accounted for more than 1% of our revenues. 

&#160; 

Sales and Marketing 

&#160; 

We market and sell our products and services primarily through our direct sales force. Our direct sales force includes sales representatives who have defined geographic territories throughout the U.S. We seek to hire experienced sales representatives wherever they are located, and believe we have room to grow the number of sales representatives in each of our territories. 

&#160; 

The sales cycle begins with a sales lead generated by the sales representative through our third-party referral network, a client referral, our telemarketing team, our external website, e-mail marketing or territory- based activities. Through one or more on-site visits, phone-based sales calls, or web demonstrations, sales representatives perform in-depth analysis of prospective clients&#146; needs and demonstrate our solutions. We employ sophisticated software to track, classify and manage our sales representatives&#146; pipeline of potential clients. We support our sales force with a marketing program that includes seminars and webinars, email marketing, social media marketing, broker events and web marketing. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Referral Network 

&#160; 

As a core element of our business strategy, we have developed a referral network of third-party service providers, including 401(k) advisors, benefits administrators, insurance brokers, third-party administrators and HR consultants, that recommend our solutions and provide referrals. Our referral network has become an increasingly important component of our sales process, and in fiscal 2016, greater than 30% of our new client revenue originated by referrals from participants in our referral network. 

&#160; 

We believe participants in our referral network refer potential clients to us because we do not provide services that compete with their own and because we offer third parties the ability to integrate their systems with our platform. Unlike other payroll and HCM solution providers who also provide retirement plans, health insurance and other products and services competitive with the offerings of the participants in our referral network, we focus only on our core business of providing cloud-based payroll and HCM solutions. In some cases we have formalized relationships in which we are a recommended vendor of these participants. In other cases, our relationships are informal. We typically do not compensate these participants for referrals. 

&#160; 

Partner Ecosystem 

&#160; 

We have developed a partner ecosystem of third-party systems, such as 401(k), benefits and insurance provider systems, with whom we provide automated data integration for our clients. These third-party providers require certain financial information from their clients in order to efficiently provide their respective services. After securing authorization from the client, we exchange payroll data with these providers. In turn, these third-party providers supply data to us, which allows us to deliver comprehensive benefit management services to our clients. We believe our ability to integrate our systems with those of these partners adds value to our mutual clients and to our partners. 

&#160; 

We have also developed our solutions to integrate with a variety of other systems used by our clients, such as accounting, point of sale, banking, expense management, recruiting, background screening and skills assessment solutions. We believe our clients benefit from an integrated and seamless solution. 

&#160; 

Technology 

&#160; 

We offer our solutions on a cloud-based platform that leverages a unified database architecture and a common code base that we organically developed. Clients do not need to install our software in their data centers and can access our solutions through any mobile device or web browser with Internet access. 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Multi-Tenant Architecture. Our software solutions were designed with a multi-tenant architecture. This architecture gives us an advantage over many disparate traditional systems which are less flexible and require longer and more costly development and upgrade cycles.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Mobile Focused. We employ mobile-centric principles in our solution design and development. We believe that the increasing mobility of employees heightens the importance of access to our solutions through mobile devices, including smart phones and tablets. Our mobile experience provides our clients and their employees with access to our solutions through virtually any device having Internet access. We bring the flexibility of a secure, cloud-based solution to users without the need to access a traditional desktop or laptop computer.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Security. We maintain comprehensive security programs designed to ensure the security and integrity of client and employee data, protect against security threats or data breaches and prevent unauthorized access. We regulate and limit all access to servers and networks at our data centers. Our systems are monitored for irregular or suspicious activity, and we have dedicated internal staff perform security assessments for each release. Our systems undergo regular penetration testing and source code reviews by an independent third-party security firm.

&#160; 

We host our solutions at our primary data center at our corporate headquarters in Arlington Heights, Illinois. We also utilize data centers at third-party facilities in Franklin Park, Illinois and Kenosha, Wisconsin for backup and disaster recovery. We supply the hardware infrastructure and are responsible for the ongoing maintenance of our equipment at all data center locations. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

The market for payroll and HCM solutions is fragmented, highly competitive and rapidly changing. Our competitors vary for each of our solutions and include enterprise-focused software providers, such as Ultimate Software Group, Inc., Workday, Inc., SAP AG, Oracle Corporation and Ceridian Corporation; payroll service providers, such as Automatic Data Processing, Inc., Paychex, Inc., Paycom Software, Inc., Paycor, Inc. and other regional providers; and HCM point solutions providers, such as Cornerstone OnDemand, Inc. 

&#160; 

We believe the principal competitive factors on which we compete in our market include the following: 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Focus on medium-sized organizations;

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Breadth and depth of product functionality;

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Configurability and ease of use of our solutions;

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Modern, intuitive user experience;

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Benefits of a cloud-based technology platform;

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Ability to innovate and respond to client needs rapidly;

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Domain expertise in payroll and HCM;

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Quality of implementation and client service;

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Ease of implementation;

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Real-time web-based payroll processing; and

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Integration with a wide variety of third-party applications and systems.

&#160; 

We believe that we compete favorably on these factors within the medium-sized organization market. We believe our ability to remain competitive will largely depend on the success of our continued investment in sales and marketing, research and development and implementation and client services. 

&#160; 

Research and Development 

&#160; 

We invest heavily in research and development to continuously introduce new applications, technologies, features and functionality. We are organized in small product-centric teams that utilize an agile development methodology. We focus our efforts on developing new applications and core technologies and on further enhancing the usability, functionality, reliability, performance and flexibility of existing applications. 

&#160; 

Research and development costs, including research and development costs that were capitalized, were $15.0 million, $24.7 million and $36.3 million for the years ended June 30, 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively. Our research and development personnel are principally located at our headquarters, although we seek to hire highly experienced personnel wherever they are located. 

&#160; 

Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

Our success is dependent, in part, on our ability to protect our proprietary technology and other intellectual property rights. We rely on a combination of trade secrets, copyrights and trademarks, as well as contractual protections to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. We require our employees, consultants and other third parties to enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements and control access to software, documentation and other proprietary information. Although we rely on laws respecting intellectual property rights, including trade secret, copyright and trademark laws, as well as contractual protections to establish and protect our intellectual property rights, we believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel, creation of new modules, features and functionality and frequent enhancements to our applications are more essential to establishing and maintaining our technology leadership position. 

&#160; 

Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary technology and our intellectual property rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to misappropriate our rights or to copy or obtain and use our proprietary technology to develop applications with the same functionality as our applications. Policing unauthorized use of our technology and intellectual property rights is very difficult. 

&#160; 

We expect that providers of payroll and HCM solutions such as ours may be subject to third-party infringement claims as the market and the number of competitors grows and the functionality of applications in different industry segments overlaps. Any of these or other third parties might make a claim of infringement against us at any time. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

As of June 30, 2016, we had approximately 1,800 full-time employees, of which 620 were in client services and operations, 420 were in client implementation, 365 were in sales and marketing, 250 were in research and development and 145 were in general 

&#160; 

&#160; 

and administrative. None of our employees is represented by a union or is party to a collective bargaining agreement, and we have not experienced any work stoppages. We believe we have good relations with our employees and that our culture benefits our clients and supports our growth. Our management team is committed to maintaining and improving our culture even as we grow rapidly.
