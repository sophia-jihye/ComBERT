Business of ADMA 

&#160;

Overview 

&#160;

ADMA Biologics is a late stage biopharmaceutical company that develops, manufactures, and intends to market specialty plasma-based biologics for the treatment and prevention of certain infectious diseases. Our targeted patient populations include immune-compromised individuals who suffer from an underlying immune deficiency disorder or who may be immune-suppressed for medical reasons. Our product candidates are intended to be used by physician specialists focused on caring for immune-compromised patients at risk of contracting infectious diseases. 

Our lead product candidate, RI-002, is intended for the treatment of Primary Immune Deficiency Disease, or PIDD, and has completed a pivotal Phase III clinical study. In the third quarter of 2015, we submitted and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, accepted for review, a Biologics License Application, or BLA, for RI-002 for the treatment of PIDD. The FDA could approve this BLA within approximately one year of its filing, in which case potential first commercial sales could occur as early as the fourth quarter of 2016. As part of our currently ongoing commercialization efforts, we plan to increase our initiatives by hiring a small, specialty sales force to market RI-002 to hospitals, physician offices/clinics, and other specialty treatment organizations. We anticipate staffing our company with additional personnel for patient support, medical affairs, quality assurance, regulatory affairs, scientific affairs, reimbursement, inventory and logistics, human resources, and financial and operational management. If and when we receive FDA approval, we may also use a network of national distributors to assist with order fulfillment for RI-002 for use by healthcare professionals and hospitals. 

RI-002 achieved positive data in its clinical trials. RI-002 has been administered for a total of 793 infusions with zero serious adverse events to 59 patients in 9 treatment centers throughout the United States in a pivotal Phase III clinical trial. RI-002 is an injectable immune globulin derived from human plasma, enriched with standardized high levels of naturally occurring polyclonal antibodies ( e.g. , streptococcus pneumoniae, H. influenza type B, CMV, measles, tetanus, etc.) as well as high levels of antibodies targeted to Respiratory Syncytial Virus, or RSV. Our patented, microneutralization assay allows us to standardize RI-002's potency by effectively identifying and isolating hyperimmune donor plasma with high-titer RSV antibodies, thereby allowing us to differentiate our immune globulin and may potentially garner a premium price. 

&#160; 

PIDD, a genetic disorder that causes a deficient or absent immune system, is caused by hereditary or genetic defects and can affect anyone regardless of age or gender. PIDD patients are more vulnerable to infections and more likely to suffer complications from these infections. Intravenous immune globulin, or IVIG, is a plasma derived product that is used to prevent serious infections in patients with PIDD. It is comprised of polyclonal antibodies, which are proteins produced by B-cells that are used by the body's immune system to neutralize foreign objects such as bacteria and viruses. RI-002, a specialty IVIG with standardized levels of high-titer RSV antibodies, is intended to prevent infections in PIDD patients. The polyclonal antibodies which are present in RI-002 are expected to prevent infections in immune-compromised patients. It is estimated that there are about 250,000 diagnosed PIDD patients in the United States, approximately half of whom are treated with IVIG regularly. In the United States, sales of immune globulin products for all its uses were reported to be approximately $4.8 billion in 2014. Since the introduction of IVIG therapy, the incidence of infections in IVIG-treated patients has dropped significantly. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

On December 3, 2014, we announced that RI-002 demonstrated positive Phase III results and successfully achieved its primary endpoint, that the treatment with RI-002 resulted in no Serious Bacterial Infections, or SBIs, observed in study subjects during the trial. On February 22, 2015, at the 2015 American Academy of Allergy Asthma &#38; Immunology Annual Meeting, scientific investigators reported on the secondary outcomes that included: a total of 1.66 days per patient per year lost from work or school due to infection; one hospitalization due to a non-serious infection, unrelated to RI-002, of only five days duration in the entire study; and IgG trough levels above those required by the FDA for IVIG products. Additionally, there was a marked increase in all of the measured specific anti-pathogen antibodies in PK subjects (n=31). The mean of maximum fold increases in specific antibody levels after infusion of RI-002 ranged from 1.9 fold (S. pneumonia type 19A) to 5.3 fold (RSV), which were statistically significant fold increases from the pathogen's specific measured baselines. 

The safety profile of RI-002 is comparable to that of other immune globulins. These secondary outcome results follow the prior announcement that the trial achieved its primary endpoint with zero reported acute or SBI in the course of the trial. 

The trial was conducted as a single arm study in which patients were treated approximately once per month for a period of 12 months plus 90 days for follow up. Fifty-nine patients were enrolled in 9 treatment centers in the United States. The pivotal Phase III primary endpoint followed published FDA industry guidance, which provides for a reduction in the incidence of serious infections to less than one per year in each subject receiving IVIG. The secondary outcome was safety and included other pharmacokinetic, or PK, data collection points including antibody titers for certain agents, including RSV antibody levels at various time points after infusion. Following the FDA's published &#8220;Guidance for Industry: Safety, Efficacy, and Pharmacokinetic Studies to Support Marketing of Immune Globulin Intravenous (Human) as a Replacement Therapy for Primary Humoral Immunodeficiency,&#8221; or FDA Guidance for Industry, for our protocol, should provide that a successful single Phase III trial and BLA submission, should lead to FDA approval. 

RI-002&#8217;s predecessor product candidate, RI-001 was the subject of a Phase II randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled human clinical trial in RSV-infected, immune-compromised patients. In that trial, RI-001 treated patients demonstrated a statistically significant rise in anti-RSV titers compared to patients receiving placebo. RI-002 is an improved formulation of our prior product candidate RI-001. RI-002 is manufactured using the same FDA-approved contract manufacturing facility as its predecessor. To date, RI-002 has demonstrated improved production yields, an improved stability profile and comparable anti-RSV antibody titer potency levels relative to the prior formulation. 

We operate two FDA-licensed, German Health Authority, or GHA, and Korean Ministry of Food and Safety, or MFDS, certified source plasma collection facilities at our ADMA BioCenters located in Norcross, Georgia and Marietta, Georgia, which provide us with a portion of our blood plasma for the manufacture of RI-002. During the third quarter of 2014, we completed the expansion of our Norcross, Georgia ADMA BioCenters facility by securing additional rented space to increase our donor and collection screening areas to meet an increase in market demand for source plasma. In 2014, we entered into another lease for a second plasma collection center in Marietta, Georgia, and we completed construction of this new facility during the fourth quarter of 2014. In November 2014, we announced the opening of our second plasma collection center in Marietta, Georgia. A typical plasma collection center, such as those operated by ADMA BioCenters, can collect approximately 30,000 to 50,000 liters of source plasma annually, which may be sold for different prices depending upon the type of plasma, quantity of purchase, and market conditions at the time of sale. Plasma collected from ADMA BioCenters' two Georgia facilities that is not used for making RI-002 is sold to third party customers in the United States, and other locations where we are approved globally under supply agreements or in the open "spot" market. We have entered into long term manufacturing and licensing agreements with Biotest AG and their United States subsidiary, Biotest Pharmaceuticals, Inc., together referred to as Biotest, that provide for the exclusive manufacture of RI-002. At the same time, we granted Biotest an exclusive, royalty-bearing license to market and sell RSV antibody-enriched IVIG in Europe and in other selected territories in North Africa and the Middle East. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

The founders of ADMA have combined greater than 60 years of experience marketing and distributing blood plasma products and devices. With our executive team, members of the board of directors and our commercial team, we collectively possess over 200 years of deep medical, technical, development and commercial experience in the biologics and pharmaceutical industry. 

Our mission is to develop and commercialize plasma-derived, human immune globulins targeted to niche immune-compromised patient populations. We intend to accomplish our mission by achieving the following: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

obtain FDA approval to manufacture and market RI-002 for the treatment of patients with PIDD; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

establish a specialty sales force to commercialize RI-002; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

explore other possible indications ( e.g. , label expansion) for RI-002; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

develop additional plasma-derived products for the treatment and/or prevention of infectious diseases in immune-compromised patient populations; and 

&#160; 

&#183; 

expand our network of ADMA BioCenters facilities, both to maintain control of a portion of our raw material supply and to generate additional revenue through the collection and sale of source plasma to third party customers. 

Our Strategy 

&#160;

Our goal is to be a leader in developing and commercializing specialized, targeted, plasma-derived therapeutics to extend and enhance the lives of individuals who are naturally or medically immune-compromised. 

&#160; 

The key elements of our strategy for achieving this goal are as follows: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Obtain FDA approval of RI-002 as a treatment for PIDD . We have announced that the FDA accepted the BLA for RI-002 for review during the third quarter of 2015. We also have previously announced that RI-002 achieved positive Phase III results and successfully achieved meeting the primary endpoint for the treatment of PIDD in accordance with the FDA Guidance for Industry. We are seeking marketing approval of RI-002 from the FDA during 2016. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Commercialize RI-002 as a treatment for PIDD . We plan to increase our hiring initiatives of a small, specialty sales force to market RI-002 to hospitals, physician offices/clinics, and other specialty treatment and infusion center organizations. We anticipate staffing our company with additional personnel for patient support, medical affairs, quality assurance, regulatory affairs, scientific affairs, reimbursement, inventory and logistics, human resources, and financial and operational management. We may also use a network of national distributors to fulfill orders for RI-002. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Expand RI-002&#8217;s FDA-approved uses . If RI-002 is approved by the FDA as a treatment for PIDD, we plan to evaluate the clinical and regulatory paths to grow the RI-002 franchise through expanded FDA-approved uses. We believe that there may be patient populations beyond PIDD that would derive clinical benefit from RI-002 some of which may be eligible for orphan status. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Develop additional plasma-derived products . Our core competency is in the development and commercialization of plasma-derived therapeutics. We believe there are a number of under addressed medical conditions for which plasma-derived therapeutics may be beneficial. Utilizing our intellectual property patent, which includes our proprietary testing assay and other standardization methods and technologies, we have identified potential new product candidates that we may advance into preclinical activities in the near term. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Develop and expand ADMA BioCenters . In order to maintain control of a portion of our raw material supply as well as generate revenues in advance of RI-002&#8217;s commercialization, we formed ADMA BioCenters, a subsidiary that operates plasma collection facilities in Norcross and Marietta, Georgia. The Norcross and Marietta facilities hold FDA licenses, along with GHA and MFDS certifications. Under the FDA licenses, ADMA BioCenters may collect normal source plasma and high-titer RSV plasma. We sell a portion of our normal source plasma to buyers in the open &#8220;spot&#8221; market. We also plan to use the high-titer RSV plasma collected by ADMA BioCenters in the commercial manufacturing of RI-002. We may initiate other hyperimmune plasma collection programs at ADMA BioCenters' facilities. These programs would be initiated during the normal course of business and are expected to cost less than $1 million to implement. We may also consider growth through the creation and licensing of additional ADMA BioCenters facilities in various regions of the United States. Additional ADMA BioCenters may allow us to cost-effectively secure additional high-titer RSV plasma for RI-002, and potentially increase revenues through the collection and sale of normal source plasma and other hyperimmune plasma to third parties.

The Plasma Industry 

&#160; 

Primary Immunodeficiency Disease 

&#160; 

PIDD is a class of hereditary disorders characterized by defects in the immune system, due to either a lack of necessary antibodies or a failure of these antibodies to function properly. According to the World Health Organization, there are over 150 different presentations of PIDD. As patients suffering from PIDD lack a properly functioning immune system, they typically receive monthly, outpatient infusions of IVIG therapy. Without this exogenous antibody immune support, these patients would be susceptible to a wide variety of infectious diseases. PIDD has an estimated prevalence of 1:1,200 in the United States, or approximately 250,000 people. Of these 250,000 people diagnosed with PIDD in the United States, approximately 125,000 receive monthly infusions of IVIG and it is estimated that over 300,000 patients worldwide receive monthly IVIG infusions for PIDD. 

As most patients with PIDD present with infections, the differential diagnosis and initial investigations for an underlying immune defect are typically guided by the clinical presentation. In subjects with PIDD, individual infections are not necessarily more severe than those that occur in a normal host. Rather, the clinical features suggestive of an immune defect may be the recurring and/or chronic nature of infections with common pathogens that may result in end organ damage, such as bronchiectasis. In addition, subjects with PIDD will often respond poorly to standard antimicrobial therapy or they may have repeated infections with the same pathogen. The virulence of the infecting organism should also be considered, and a subject&#8217;s immune competence should be questioned when invasive infections are caused by low virulence or opportunistic pathogens. For example, infection with the opportunistic pathogens Pneumocystis jiroveci (previously Pneumocystis carinii) or atypical mycobacteria should prompt an investigation for underlying immunodeficiency. Typical clinical presentations for subjects with PIDD are: 

&#183; 

Antibody deficiency and recurrent bacterial infections; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

T-lymphocyte deficiency and opportunistic infections; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Other lymphocyte defects causing opportunistic infections; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Neutrophil defects causing immunodeficiency; and 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Complement deficiencies. 

&#160; 

PIDD can present at any age from birth to adulthood, posing a considerable challenge for the practicing physician to know when and how to evaluate a subject for a possible immune defect. Subjects with marked antibody deficiencies are generally dependent on IVIG therapy for survival. Benefits of adequate IVIG therapy in subjects not able to produce antibodies normally include a reduction of the severity and frequency of infections, prevention of chronic lung disease and prevention of enteroviral meningoencephalitis. Several immune globulin products have already been approved by the FDA. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

RI-002, our IVIG product candidate, contains polyclonal antibodies against various infectious agents ( e.g. , streptococcus pneumoniae, H. influenza type B, CMV, measles, tetanus, etc.) including standardized antibodies against RSV. RSV is a common respiratory virus that often presents during the winter months. Nearly all children will have been infected with RSV by three years of age; however, the immune systems of most healthy children prevent significant morbidity and mortality. Conversely, in patients who are immune-compromised, such as those with PIDD or who have undergone a hematopoietic stem cell or solid organ transplant and may be on immunosuppressive drugs or chemotherapy, RSV infection can be associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Immune-compromised patients historically have a 5% to 15% rate of RSV infection, and, if left untreated, lower respiratory tract RSV infections in immune-compromised patients can result in a mortality rate of up to 40% of infected patients. In hematopoietic stem cell transplant, or HSCT, patients, a subset of the immune-compromised patient population with approximately 25,000 transplants being performed annually in the United States, it is estimated that about 25% of patients treated with the current standard of care (aerosolized Ribavirin) will progress to lower respiratory tract infection, or LRTI, while 41% of patients untreated with the current standard of care will progress to LRTI. 

&#160; 

Plasma - Background, Composition and Manufacturing 

&#160; 

Human blood contains a number of components including: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Red blood cells &#8211; Used to carry oxygen from the lungs to the body; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

White blood cells &#8211; Used by the immune system to fight infection; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Platelets &#8211; Used for blood clotting; and 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Plasma &#8211; Used to carry the aforementioned components throughout the body and provide support in clotting and immunity. 

&#160;

Plasma is the most abundant blood component, representing approximately 55% of total blood volume. Plasma, which is 90% water, is rich in proteins used by the human body for blood clotting and fighting infection. These proteins account for approximately 7% of plasma&#8217;s volume. As plasma contains these valuable proteins, plasma collection and the manufacturing of human plasma-derived therapeutics provide therapeutic benefits for ill patients. 

&#160; 

In order to produce plasma-derived therapeutics that can be administered to ill patients, raw material plasma must be collected from human donors and then manufactured into specialized products. Plasma is collected from healthy donors at FDA-licensed plasma donation centers. To ensure safety of the collected plasma, all plasma donations are tested using FDA-approved methods of Nucleic Acid Testing, or NAT, for various infectious diseases, such as human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, and hepatitis C virus, or HCV. 

Plasma is collected using a process called &#8220;plasmapheresis.&#8221; During plasmapheresis, a donor&#8217;s blood is drawn into a specialized medical device that separates the plasma component through centrifugation, and then returns the other blood components back into the donor&#8217;s bloodstream. Plasmapheresis is performed utilizing an FDA-approved, automated device with a sterile, self-contained collection kit. The plasma that is collected is known as &#8220;normal source plasma.&#8221; There are over 400 plasma donation centers in the United States. As noted in a variety of plasma industry trade reports and related conferences, approximately 28 million liters of source plasma were collected in the United States in 2014. In the United States, a donor may donate plasma a maximum of two times during any seven-day period, with at least two days in between donations. Plasma donation centers in the United States typically pay donors $25 to $50 per donation and some donors with rare or high antibody levels can be paid more. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

In order to isolate the desired therapeutic elements in normal source plasma, it must initially undergo a manufacturing process called &#8220;fractionation.&#8221; The process of fractionation was invented in the 1940&#8217;s by E.J. Cohn and is referred to as the Cohn method or cold ethanol fractionation. First, the source plasma undergoes a process called pooling, in which the individual plasma donations are combined into a pooling tank. Second, the Cohn fractionation method, which is a combination of time, temperature, pH, alcohol concentration, and centrifugation, is used to separate the desired plasma protein components, or &#8220;fractions.&#8221; After fractionation, the separated proteins are then re-suspended and are treated with a solvent detergent treatment process for viral inactivation. Next, other forms of filtration ( e.g. , nanofiltration) are performed as an additional viral removal and viral reduction step. Finally, with the various components separated and purified, the bulk product is formulated and filled into final, finished vials. During these various steps of manufacturing, each lot is reviewed and tested for potency and purity prior to being approved for release. 

&#160; 

The proteins in human plasma fall into four categories: albumin (60% of protein volume), immune globulins (15% of protein volume), coagulation factors (1% of protein volume), and other proteins (24% of protein volume) such as alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor, C1 esterase inhibitor, fibrin sealants and fibrinogen. Many of the other proteins in plasma have yet to be developed into commercial therapies. In the United States, not only are the plasma collection centers subject to FDA licensure, but each plasma protein product that is derived and fractionated from plasma must undergo an approval process with FDA&#8217;s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, or CBER. 

Immune Globulins 

In June 2008, the FDA published the FDA Guidance for Industry outlining the regulatory pathway for the approval of IVIG, for the treatment of PIDD. 

&#160; 

Immune globulins can be administered in three ways: intramuscularly, intravenously or subcutaneously. IVIG principally contains antibodies and, as such, provides passive immunization for individuals who are immune-deficient or who have been exposed to various infectious agents. IVIG is used therapeutically in a variety of immunological diseases/deficiencies, such as PIDD, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, Guillain-Barr&#233; syndrome, Kawasaki disease, bone marrow transplant, and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy. We are aware that other companies are also evaluating IVIG in a clinical study for the treatment of Alzheimer&#8217;s disease. Additionally, IVIG is also used as therapy in a variety of other diseases that do not involve primary or secondary immune deficiencies, such as multiple sclerosis, skin disease, and asthma. These latter uses are referred to as &#8220;off-label&#8221; or evidence-based uses because the FDA has not approved their use in these indications and promotion of such uses is not permitted by FDA unless a BLA or BLA supplement with additional data is approved. Among the various IVIG products, there are only 14 labeled indications approved by the FDA. However, medical literature identifies at least 150 evidence based uses for IVIG, of which approximately 60 are currently included on lists of reimbursable uses by Medicare and other healthcare plans. This provides opportunities for new product development and submissions. 

&#160; 

There are two types of immune globulins, standard and hyperimmune. The difference between standard immune globulins and hyperimmune globulins is that the latter are manufactured using plasma obtained from donors who have elevated amounts (high-titers) of specific antibodies. These high-titer products can be used to treat and prevent diseases that present those specific antigens that are reactive with the high-titer antibodies. Hyperimmune products currently available include hepatitis B, tetanus, rabies cytomegalovirus and RhoD immune globulins. 

&#160; 

As of the date of this report, the worldwide market for plasma-derived therapeutic drug products was approximately $15 billion and the United States market for all plasma-derived products was approximately $7.8 billion. IVIG products accounted for approximately $4.8 billion of sales in the United States in 2014. IVIG products are used to treat primary immune deficiencies, certain autoimmune diseases, and other illnesses for immune-compromised patients and certain neuropathy indications. New research and data, additional labeled indications, an aging population and emerging countries with new markets are all adding to the worldwide growth of IVIG utilization. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

RI-002, Our Lead Product Candidate 

&#160; 

General 

&#160; 

RI-002 is a plasma-derived, polyclonal IVIG, with standardized high levels of antibodies against RSV. RI-002 is initially being developed as a treatment for patients with PIDD. By using our patented proprietary assay, we are able to identify plasma donors with elevated amounts of RSV antibodies, measure these donors&#8217; plasma RSV levels and formulate RI-002 with standardized high levels of RSV antibodies. In addition, by using our assay within manufacturing, we are able to demonstrate consistent lot-to-lot RSV antibody titer potency. To our knowledge, there is no other IVIG product on the market that contains standardized high levels of RSV antibodies and that is produced with reported consistent lot-to-lot potency. RI-002 is an improved formulation of our prior product candidate RI-001. RI-002 is manufactured using the same FDA-approved contract manufacturing facility as its predecessor. To date, RI-002 has demonstrated improved production yields, an improved stability profile and comparable anti-RSV antibody titer potency levels relative to the prior formulation. 

Results of Phase III Clinical Trial 

&#160; 

On December 3, 2014, we announced that RI-002 demonstrated positive Phase III results and successfully achieved its primary endpoint, that treatment with RI-002 resulted in no SBI observed in study subjects during the trial. The trial was conducted as a single arm study in which patients were treated approximately once per month for a period of 12 months plus 90 days thereafter for follow-up. Fifty-nine patients were enrolled in 9 treatment centers in the United States. The pivotal Phase III primary endpoint followed published FDA industry guidance, which provides for a reduction in the incidence of SBI to less than one per year in each subject receiving IVIG. 

&#160;

On February 22, 2015, at the 2015 American Academy of Allergy Asthma &#38; Immunology Annual Meeting, scientific investigators reported on the secondary outcomes that included: a total of 1.66 days per patient per year lost from work or school due to infection; one hospitalization due to a non-serious infection, unrelated to RI-002, of only five days duration in the entire study; and IgG trough levels above those required by the FDA for IVIG products. Additionally, there was a marked increase in all of the measured specific anti-pathogen antibodies in PK subjects (n=31). The mean of maximum fold increases in specific antibody levels after infusion of RI-002 ranged from 1.9 fold (S. pneumonia type 19A) to 5.3 fold (RSV), which were statistically significant fold increases from the pathogen's specific measured baselines. The safety profile of RI-002 is comparable to that of other immune globulins. Following the FDA's guidance for our protocol should provide that a successful single Phase III trial and BLA submission should lead to FDA approval. 

Data from our Phase III trial was presented as an abstract and presentation at the 2015 American Academy of Allergy Asthma &#38; Immunology Annual Meeting on February 22, 2015. The poster presentation was titled: &#8220;Results of a Phase III trial in Patients with PIDD Using an IVIG Containing High Titer Neutralizing Antibody to Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV).&#8221; 

&#160;

Results of Phase II Clinical and Compassionate Use Experience 

&#160; 

We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase II clinical trial to evaluate RI-001, RI-002&#8217;s predecessor product candidate, in immune-compromised, RSV-infected patients. In that trial, RI-001 treated patients demonstrated a statistically significant rise in anti-RSV titers compared to patients receiving placebo. This trial was conducted with 21 patients in the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. The Phase II dose ranging trial demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in the change from baseline RSV titers to Day 18 in the high dose and low dose treatment groups when compared with placebo (p=0.0043 and p=0.0268, respectively). The mean fold increase for high dose was 9.24 (95% CI 4.07, 21.02) and the observed mean fold increase for low dose was 4.85 (95% CI 2.22, 10.59). The mean fold change for placebo treated patients was 1.42 (95% CI 0.64, 3.17). In addition, more patients in the high dose (85.7%) and lose dose (42.9%) groups experienced greater than a 4-fold increase from baseline to Day 18 in RSV titer levels compared to placebo (0%). There were no serious drug-related adverse events reported during the trial. 

From April 2009 through February 2011, RI-001 was also administered to 15 compassionate use patients where physicians requested access to the product for treating their patients with documented lower respiratory tract RSV infections. Serum samples were obtained from 13 patients. Samples showed that patients had a four-fold or greater rise in RSV antibody titers from baseline. Serum samples were not obtained from two patients that received Palivizumab. The drug was well-tolerated in these 15 patients and there were no reports of serious adverse events attributable to RI-001. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

Data from our Phase II trial, compassionate use experience and testing of RI-002 in the cotton rat RSV animal model was presented as an abstract and oral presentation at the 2013 RSV Vaccines for the World Conference held on October 14, 2013. The abstract is titled: &#8220;Polyclonal human IVIG with standardized high-levels of RSV neutralizing antibodies: A summary of animal and human studies.&#8221; 

Manufacturing and Supply 

&#160; 

In order to produce plasma-derived therapeutics that can be administered to patients, raw material plasma is collected from healthy donors at plasma collection facilities licensed by the FDA. ADMA BioCenters, operates two FDA-licensed, GHA and MFDS-certified source plasma collection facilities located in Norcross and Marietta, Georgia, which facilities provide us with a portion of our plasma requirements. By using our patented proprietary assay, we can identify plasma donors with elevated amounts of RSV antibodies and formulate RI-002 with an appropriate RSV titer level to ensure the final product is standardized to contain high levels of RSV antibodies. Once source plasma has been collected, it is then fractionated and purified into specialized therapies, which are used by patients who require them. We have agreements with independent third parties for the sourcing of blood plasma and for the fractionation and purification stages of manufacturing. The contracts are with well-regarded facilities that are fully licensed to manufacture biologics. We are dependent upon our third party suppliers for the manufacture of RI-002. Our principal supplier of source plasma is Biotest. 

&#160; 

In December 2012, we entered into our Manufacturing, Supply and License Agreement with Biotest. Under the agreement, we agreed to purchase exclusively from Biotest our worldwide requirements of RSV immune globulin manufactured from human plasma containing RSV antibodies. The term of the agreement is for a period of ten years from January 1, 2013, renewable for two additional five year periods at the agreement of both parties. We are obligated under this agreement to purchase a minimum of at least one lot of product during each calendar year after the finished product is approved by the FDA. This number is subject to increase at our option. As consideration for Biotest&#8217;s obligations under the agreement, we are obligated to pay a dollar amount per lot of RSV immune globulin manufactured from human plasma containing RSV antibodies, as well as a percentage royalty on the sales thereof and of RI-002, up to a specified cumulative maximum amount. The agreement may be terminated by either party (a) by reason of a material breach if the breaching party fails to remedy the breach within 120 days after receiving notice of the breach from the other party, (b) upon bankruptcy, insolvency, dissolution, or winding up of the other party, or (c) if the other party is unable to fulfill its obligations under the agreement for 120 consecutive days or more as a result of (a) or (b) above. 

&#160; 

Pursuant to the terms of a Plasma Purchase Agreement with Biotest, we have agreed to purchase from Biotest an annual minimum volume of source plasma containing antibodies to RSV to be used in the manufacture of RI-002. This volume will increase at the earlier of our receipt of a BLA from the FDA, or March 31, 2016. We must purchase a to-be-determined and agreed upon annual minimum volume from Biotest, but may also collect high-titer RSV plasma from up to five wholly-owned ADMA BioCenters. During 2015, Biotest and ADMA amended its plasma supply agreement to allow ADMA the ability to collect its raw material RSV high-titer plasma from other third party collection organizations, thus allowing ADMA to expand its reach for raw material supply as we approach commercialization for RI-002. Unless terminated earlier, the agreement expires in November 2021, after which it may be renewed for two additional five-year periods if agreed to by the parties. Either party may terminate the agreement if the other party fails to remedy any material default in the performance of any material condition or obligation under the agreement following notice. Either party may also terminate the agreement, after providing written notice, if a proceeding under any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement of debts, insolvency or receivership law is filed by or against the other party, and is not dismissed or stayed, or a receiver or trustee is appointed for all or a substantial portion of the assets of the other party, or the other party makes an assignment for the benefit of its creditors or becomes insolvent. We may also terminate the agreement upon written notice if the clinical development of our product candidate is halted or terminated, whether by the FDA, a Data Safety Monitoring Board, or any other regulatory authority. Upon termination of the agreement, we must pay for any source plasma already delivered to us and for any source plasma collected under the terms of the agreement. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

On June 22, 2012, we entered into a Plasma Supply Agreement with Biotest for the purchase of normal source plasma from our ADMA BioCenters, Norcross, Georgia facility to be used in Biotest's proprietary products&#8217; manufacturing, which was subsequently amended on February 25, 2014 and then amended and restated on March 23, 2016 . After the initial term, the agreement may be renewed on an annual basis upon the mutual consent of the parties. In addition to any other remedy it may have, either party has the right to terminate the agreement if the other party fails to remedy any material default in the performance of a material condition or obligation under the agreement following written notice. In addition, upon giving the appropriate written notice, either party may terminate the agreement upon the occurrence of any of the following events: a proceeding under bankruptcy, reorganization, agreement of debts, insolvency or receivership law is filed by or against the other party, and is not dismissed or stayed, or a receiver or trustee is appointed for all or a substantial portion of the assets of the other party, or the other party makes an assignment for the benefit of its creditors or becomes insolvent. Neither party can assign the agreement or any of its right or obligations there under without the express written consent of the other party. However, with notice to the other party, either party without the other party&#8217;s consent may assign the agreement to (i) its affiliate, or (ii) a successor to all or substantially all of the assets relating to the business of that party which is involved in the fulfillment of its obligations under the agreement. Under the agreement, Biotest applied to the GHA for, and we have subsequently obtained, GHA certification. 

On June 7, 2012, we entered into a Testing Services Agreement with Quest Diagnostics Clinical Laboratories, Inc., or Quest, in which Quest agreed to provide biomarker testing and related support services for protocol screening and recertification which are exclusive to us. If either party believes the other party is in material breach of any of their obligations under the agreement, the non-breaching party has the right to terminate the agreement by providing the breaching party with written notice specifying the material breach(es) and indicating clearly its intention to terminate the agreement. If the breaching party cures such breach, the non-breaching party&#8217;s notice is void. In addition, either party can terminate the agreement without cause upon written notice. All data, test results, studies and other information generated by Quest in performing services under the agreement will be our sole property. Neither party can assign the agreement or any of its right or obligations under the agreement without the express written consent of the other party, except under specified circumstances. Quest agreed and acknowledged that we paid for the development and validation of the testing assay and as such, the assay is our sole property and shall only be utilized for our benefit. 

&#160; 

Marketing, Sales and Market Research 

&#160; 

We intend to market and sell our product through a small specialty sales force, distribution relationships and other customary industry methods. We will focus our efforts specifically on the easily identifiable treatment centers which specialize in the care and management of immune compromised individuals. We estimate that there are approximately 500 leading specialty programs in the United States which have significant patient populations for PIDD, suitable for treatment with RI-002. We plan to hire our own specialty sales force which will consist of account managers, medical science liaisons and other normal and customary scientific, medical and detail representatives. Our management and board of directors has substantial prior direct marketing, sales and distribution experience with plasma derived drugs, specialty immune globulins and other biological products. We anticipate staffing the company with additional personnel for patient support, medical affairs, quality assurance, regulatory affairs, scientific affairs, reimbursement, supply chain and logistics, human resources, financial and other operational management positions. As is normal and customary in the plasma products industry, we may also use a network of national distribution organizations that have specialty divisions that focus on plasma products to fulfill orders for RI-002. We anticipate that subsequent events and developments may cause our views to change. For a discussion of forward-looking statements, see, &#8220;Forward-Looking Statements&#8221; on page 4 of this annual report on Form 10-K, and &#8220;Item 1A &#8211; Risk Factors.&#8221; 

In our manufacturing, supply and license agreement, we granted Biotest an exclusive license to market and sell RSV antibody-enriched IVIG in Europe and in selected countries in North Africa and the Middle East, collectively referred to as the Territory, to have access to our testing services for testing of Biotest&#8217;s plasma samples using our proprietary RSV assay, and to reference (but not access) our proprietary information for the purpose of Biotest seeking regulatory approval for the RSV antibody-enriched IVIG in the Territory. As consideration for the license, Biotest agreed to provide us with certain services at no charge and also compensate us with cash payments upon the completion of certain milestones. Biotest is also obligated to pay us an adjustable royalty based on a percentage of revenues from the sale of RSV antibody-enriched IVIG in the Territory for 20 years from the date of first commercial sale. Additionally, Biotest has agreed to grant us an exclusive license for marketing and sales in the United States and Canada for Biotest&#8217;s Varicella Zoster Immune Globulin, or VZIG, the terms of which we expect to finalize during 2016. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

Although blood plasma and its derivative proteins are not subject to patent protection, the FDA recognizes each immune globulin product as unique and generally requires a separate Investigational New Drug, or IND, clinical trial and BLA for each as a condition to approval. Regardless of whether competitors are able to develop an assay that can achieve our level of consistency and reproducibility in providing RSV antibody titer data, we believe they would still be required to validate and qualify such an assay as well as conduct clinical trials and undergo an FDA review prior to marketing an immune globulin product. The plasma products industry is highly competitive. We face, and will continue to face, intense competition from both United States-based and foreign producers of plasma products, some of which have lower cost structures, greater access to capital, direct ownership of manufacturing facilities, greater resources for research and development, and sophisticated marketing capabilities. 

&#160; 

These competitors may include: Baxter HealthCare Corporation, CSL Behring, Grifols Biologicals, Octapharma and Biotest. In addition to competition from other large worldwide plasma products providers, we face competition in local areas from smaller entities. In Europe, where the industry is highly regulated and health care systems vary from country to country, local companies may have greater knowledge of local health care systems, more established infrastructures and have existing regulatory approvals or a better understanding of the local regulatory process, allowing them to market their products more quickly. Moreover, plasma therapy generally faces competition from non-plasma products and other courses of treatments. For example, recombinant Factor VIII products compete with plasma-derived products in the treatment of Hemophilia A. 

Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

During the third quarter 2015, we announced that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office or USPTO issued patent number 9,107,906. The patent titled, &#8216;Compositions and Methods for the Treatment of Immunodeficiency&#8217; relates to the use of human plasma immune globulin compositions containing select antibody titers specific for a plurality of respiratory pathogens; methods of identifying human donors and donor samples for use in the compositions; methods of manufacturing the compositions; and methods of utilizing the compositions by prophylactic and or therapeutic treatments ( e.g. , passive immunization). The term of this patent extends to January 2035. We also rely on a combination of patents, trade secrets and nondisclosure and non-competition agreements to protect our proprietary intellectual property and will continue to do so. We also seek to enhance and ensure our competitive position through a variety of means including our unique and proprietary plasma donor selection criteria, our proprietary formulation methodology for plasma pooling, and the proprietary reagents, controls, testing standards, standard operating procedures and methods we use in our anti-RSV microneutralization assay. While we intend to defend against threats to our intellectual property, litigation can be costly and there can be no assurance that our patent will be enforced or that our trade secret policies and practices or other agreements will adequately protect our intellectual property. We seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. These processes, systems, and/or security measures may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies as a result of any such breaches. Third parties may also own or could obtain patents that may require us to negotiate licenses to conduct our business, and there can be no assurance that the required licenses would be available on reasonable terms or at all. 

&#160; 

In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. We also seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors and contractors. Although we rely, in part, on confidentiality, nondisclosure and non-competition agreements with employees, consultants and other parties with access to our proprietary information to protect our trade secrets, proprietary technology, processes and other proprietary rights, there can be no assurance that these agreements or any other security measures relating to such trade secrets, proprietary technology, processes and proprietary rights will be adequate, will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach, that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or that third parties will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or proprietary knowledge. To the extent that our consultants, contractors or collaborators use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. We have filed for other provisional patent applications with the United States which are pending relating to expanded hyperimmune globulin products. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

Government Regulation and Product Approval 

&#160; 

The FDA and comparable regulatory agencies in state and local jurisdictions and in foreign countries impose substantial requirements upon the testing (preclinical and clinical), manufacturing, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, advertising, promotion, import, export, marketing and distribution, among other things, of products and product candidates. If we do not comply with applicable requirements, we may be fined, the government may refuse to approve our marketing applications or allow us to manufacture or market our products, and we may be criminally prosecuted. We and our manufacturers may also be subject to regulations under other federal, state, and local laws. 

&#160; 

United States Government Regulation 

&#160; 

In the United States, the FDA regulates products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and related regulations. The process required by the FDA before our product candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following (although the FDA is given wide discretion to impose different or more stringent requirements on a case-by-case basis): 

&#160; 

&#160; 1. 

completion of extensive preclinical laboratory tests, preclinical animal studies and formulation studies performed in accordance with the FDA&#8217;s good laboratory practice regulations and other regulations; 

&#160;

&#160; 2. 

submission to the FDA of an IND application which must become effective before clinical trials may begin; 

&#160; 3. 

performance of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials meeting FDA requirements to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for each proposed indication; 

&#160; 

&#160; 4. 

manufacturing (through an FDA-licensed contract manufacturing organization) of product in accordance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, to be used in the clinical trials and providing manufacturing information need in regulatory filings; 

&#160; 

&#160; 5. 

submission of a BLA to the FDA; 

&#160; 

&#160; 6. 

satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities at which the product candidate is produced, and potentially other involved facilities as well, to assess compliance with cGMP regulations and other applicable regulations; and 

&#160; 

&#160; 7. 

the FDA review and approval of the BLA prior to any commercial marketing, sale or shipment of the product. 

&#160; 

The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. See &#8220;Risk Factors.&#8221; 

&#160; 

We submit manufacturing and analytical data, among other information, to the FDA as part of an IND application. Subject to certain exceptions, an IND becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, issues a clinical hold to delay a proposed clinical investigation due to concerns or questions about the product or the conduct of the clinical trial, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Our submission of an IND, or those of our collaboration partners, may not result in the FDA allowance to commence a clinical trial. A separate submission to an existing IND must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development. The FDA must also approve certain changes to an existing IND, such as certain manufacturing changes. Further, an independent institutional review board, or IRB, duly constituted to meet FDA requirements, for each medical center proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that center and it must monitor the safety of the study and study subjects until completed. The FDA, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Clinical testing also must satisfy extensive Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, requirements and regulations for informed consent. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

Clinical Trials 

&#160; 

For purposes of BLA submission and approval, clinical trials are typically conducted in the following three sequential phases, which may overlap (although additional or different trials may be required by the FDA as well): 

&#160; 

&#160; 1. 

Phase I clinical trials are initially conducted in a limited population to test the product candidate for safety, dose tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion in healthy humans or, on occasion, in patients, such as cancer patients. 

&#160; 

&#160; 2. 

Phase II clinical trials are generally conducted in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to determine the efficacy of the product candidate for specific targeted indications and to determine tolerance and optimal dosage. Multiple Phase II clinical trials may be conducted by the sponsor to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase III clinical trials. 

&#160; 

&#160; 3. 

Certain Phase III clinical trials are referred to as pivotal trials. When Phase II clinical trials demonstrate that a dose range of the product candidate is effective and has an acceptable safety profile, Phase III clinical trials are undertaken in large patient populations to provide substantial evidence of reproducibility of clinical efficacy results and to further test for safety in an expanded and diverse patient population at multiple, geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. 

&#160; 

A BLA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the product candidate for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. In some cases, the FDA may condition continued approval of a BLA on the sponsor&#8217;s agreement to conduct additional clinical trials, or other commitments. Such post-approval studies are typically referred to as Phase IV studies. 

&#160; 

Biological License Application 

&#160; 

The results of product candidate development, preclinical testing and clinical trials, together with, among other things, detailed information on the manufacture and composition of the product and proposed labeling, and the payment of a user fee, are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA. The FDA reviews all BLAs submitted before it accepts them for filing and may reject the filing as inadequate to merit review or may request additional information to be submitted in a very short time frame before accepting a BLA for filing. Once a BLA is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the application. 

&#160; 

During its review of a BLA, the FDA may refer the application to an advisory committee of experts for their review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved, which information is taken into consideration along with FDA&#8217;s own review findings. The FDA may refuse to approve a BLA and issue a Complete Response Letter, or CRL if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied. In a CRL, it may also require additional clinical or other data, including one or more additional pivotal Phase III clinical trials. Even if such requested data are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval and issue a denial of the BLA. Data from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we do. If the FDA&#8217;s evaluations of the BLA and the clinical and manufacturing procedures and facilities are favorable, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a CRL, which contains the conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the BLA. If a CRL is issued, if and when those items have been resolved to the FDA&#8217;s satisfaction, the FDA will issue an approval letter, authorizing commercial marketing of the product for certain indications. The FDA may withdraw product approval if ongoing regulatory requirements are not met or if safety problems occur after the product reaches the market. In addition, the FDA may require testing, including Phase IV clinical trials, and surveillance programs to monitor the effect of approved products that have been commercialized, and the FDA has the power to prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these post-marketing programs. Products may be marketed only for the FDA-approved indications and in accordance with the FDA-approved label. The FDA generally does not allow drugs to be promoted for &#8220;off-label&#8221; uses &#8211; that is, uses that are not described in the product&#8217;s approved labeling and that differ from those that were approved by the FDA. Furthermore, the FDA generally limits approved uses to those studied in clinical trials. If there are any modifications to the product, including changes in indications, other labeling changes, or manufacturing processes or facilities, we may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new BLA or BLA supplement, which may require us to develop additional data or conduct additional preclinical studies and clinical trials, and/or require additional manufacturing data. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

Satisfaction of the FDA regulations and approval requirements or similar requirements of foreign regulatory agencies typically takes several years, and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product or disease. Typically, if a product candidate is intended to treat a chronic disease, as is the case with RI-002, safety and efficacy data must be gathered over an extended period of time. Government regulation may delay or prevent marketing of product candidates for a considerable period of time and impose costly procedures upon our activities. The FDA or any other regulatory agency may not grant approvals for changes in dose form or new indications for a product candidate on a timely basis, or at all. Even if a product candidate receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific disease states, patient populations and dosages. Further, even after regulatory approval is obtained, later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market. Delays in obtaining, or failures to obtain, regulatory approvals for any of our product candidates would harm our business. In addition, we cannot predict what adverse governmental regulations may arise from future United States or foreign governmental action. 

Other Regulatory Requirements 

&#160; 

Any products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to future FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including certain kinds of monitoring in the manufacturing of our products, recordkeeping requirements and reporting of adverse experiences associated with the product. Product manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMP, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. Failure to comply with the statutory and regulatory requirements can subject a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, such as warning letters, suspension of manufacturing, sales or use, seizure of product, injunctive action or possible fines and other penalties. We cannot be certain that we or our present or future third-party manufacturers or suppliers will be able to comply with the cGMP regulations and other ongoing FDA regulatory requirements. If we or our present or future third-party manufacturers or suppliers are not able to comply with these requirements, the FDA may halt our clinical trials, require us to recall a product from distribution, or withdraw approval of the BLA for that product. 

&#160; 

The FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of products, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the Internet. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy that are approved by the FDA. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in adverse publicity, warning and/or other regulatory letters, corrective advertising and potential major fines and other penalties. 

Regulation of ADMA BioCenters 

&#160; 

All blood and blood product collection and manufacturing centers which engage in interstate commerce must be licensed by the FDA. In order to achieve licensure, the organization must submit a BLA and undergo pre-licensure inspection. Our ADMA BioCenters, located in Norcross and Marietta, Georgia, have completed these requirements and hold FDA licenses along with GHA and MFDS certifications. In order to maintain the license, the facilities operated by ADMA BioCenters will be inspected at least every two years. ADMA BioCenters is also required to submit annual reports to the FDA. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Blood plasma collection and manufacturing centers are also subject to the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments, or CLIA, state licensure, and compliance with industry standards such as the International Quality Plasma Program, or IQPP. Compliance with state and industry standards is verified by means of routine inspection. We believe that both of our ADMA BioCenters facilities are currently in compliance with state and industry standards. Delays in obtaining, or failures to obtain, regulatory approvals for any facilities operated by ADMA BioCenters would harm our business. In addition, we cannot predict what adverse federal and state regulations and industry standards may arise in the future. 

&#160; 

Foreign Regulation 

&#160; 

In addition to regulations in the United States, if we choose to pursue clinical development and commercialization in the European Union, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of any future product. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval of a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country. 

&#160; 

Under European Union regulatory systems, marketing authorizations may be submitted either under a centralized or mutual recognition procedure. The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all European Union member states. The mutual recognition procedure provides for mutual recognition of national approval decisions. Under this procedure, the holder of a national marketing authorization may submit an application to the remaining member states. Within 90 days of receiving the applications and assessment report, each member state must decide whether to recognize approval, refuse it or request additional information. 

Research and Development 

&#160;

ADMA&#8217;s expenditures on research and development were approximately $7.0 million and $9.5 million for fiscal years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

ADMA Biologics, Inc., together with its subsidiaries ADMA Plasma Biologics, Inc. and ADMA BioCenters, Inc., has a total of 74 employees, including 72 full-time employees, as well as additional full and part-time consultants and temporary staff. Over the course of the next year, we anticipate hiring additional full-time employees devoted to sales and marketing, medical and scientific affairs, general and administrative, as well as hiring additional staff to the plasma collection centers as appropriate. We intend to use clinical research organizations, or CROs, third parties and consultants to perform our clinical studies and manufacturing, regulatory affairs and quality control services in addition to corporate marketing, branding and commercialization activities.
