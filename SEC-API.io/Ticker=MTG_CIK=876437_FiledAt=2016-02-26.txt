 Item 1. Business. 

A. General 

We are a holding company and through wholly-owned subsidiaries we provide private mortgage insurance and ancillary services. In 2015, our net premiums written were $1.0 billion and our primary new insurance written was $43.0 billion. As of December 31, 2015, our primary insurance in force was $174.5 billion and our direct primary risk in force was $45.5 billion. For further information about our results of operations, see our consolidated financial statements in Item 8. As of December 31, 2015, our principal mortgage insurance subsidiary, Mortgage Guaranty Insurance Corporation (&#8220;MGIC&#8221;), was licensed in all 50 states of the United States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Guam. During 2015, we wrote new insurance in each of those jurisdictions. 

Business Strategies 

&#32;Our 2016 business strategies include 1) prudently growing insurance in force, 2) pursuing new business opportunities that leverage our core competencies, 3) preserving and expanding our role and that of the private mortgage insurance industry in housing finance policy, 4) managing and deploying capital to optimize creation of shareholder value and 5) developing and diversifying the talents of our co-workers. 

Following are several of the accomplishments we achieved in 2015 that furthered our 2015 business strategies. 

&#8226; 

Increased new insurance written from $33.4 billion in 2014 to $43.0 billion in 2015. The new insurance written is consistent with the Company's risk and return goals and increased insurance in force by 6% year-over-year. 

&#8226; 

Successfully renegotiated external reinsurance transaction in a manner that affords it full credit under the revised private mortgage insurer eligibility requirements ("PMIERs") of the Federal National Mortgage Association (&#8220;Fannie Mae&#8221;) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (&#8220;Freddie Mac&#8221;) for risk ceded under the transaction. 

&#8226; 

Met the revised financial requirements of the PMIERs by their effective date with a comfortable cushion. 

&#8226; 

Worked with the private mortgage insurance industry to influence changes to the draft PMIERs before they became effective. 

&#8226; 

Maintained our traditionally low expense base. 

&#8226; 

Successfully transitioned key senior executive roles, including Chief Executive Officer and Chief Risk Officer. 

Overview of the Private Mortgage Insurance Industry and its Operating Environment 

We established the private mortgage insurance industry in 1957 to provide a private market alternative to federal government insurance programs. Private mortgage insurance covers losses from homeowner defaults on residential mortgage loans, reducing, and in some instances eliminating, the loss to the insured institution if the homeowner defaults. 

Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have been the major purchasers of the mortgage loans underlying new insurance written by private mortgage insurers. In this annual report, we refer to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac collectively as the &#8220;GSEs.&#8221; The GSEs purchase residential mortgages as part of their governmental mandate to provide liquidity in the secondary mortgage market. The GSEs cannot buy low down payment mortgage loans without certain forms of credit enhancement, the primary form of which is private mortgage insurance. Therefore, private mortgage insurance facilitates the sale of low down payment mortgages in the secondary mortgage market to the GSEs and plays an important role in the housing finance system by assisting consumers, especially first-time and lower net-worth homebuyers, to affordably finance homes with less than a 20% down payment. In this annual report, we refer to loans with less than 20% down payments as &#8220;low down payment&#8221; mortgages or loans. Private mortgage insurance also reduces the regulatory capital that depository institutions are required to hold against certain low down payment mortgages that they hold as assets. 

Because the GSEs have been the major purchasers of the mortgages underlying new insurance written by private mortgage insurers, the private mortgage insurance industry in the U.S. is defined in large part by the requirements and practices of the GSEs. These requirements and practices, as well as those of the federal regulators that oversee the GSEs and lenders, impact the operating results and financial performance of private mortgage insurers. In 2008, the federal government took control of the GSEs through a conservatorship process. The Federal Housing Finance Agency (&#8220;FHFA&#8221;) is the conservator of the GSEs and has the authority to control and direct their operations. The U.S. Department of the Treasury reported its recommendations regarding options for 

ending the conservatorship of the GSEs in February 2011, and while it did not provide any definitive timeline for GSE reform, it did recommend using a combination of federal housing policy changes to wind down the GSEs, shrink the government&#8217;s footprint in housing finance (including Federal Housing Administration ("FHA") insurance), and help bring private capital back to the mortgage market. Since then, members of Congress have introduced several bills intended to change the business practices of the GSEs and the FHA, however, no legislation has been enacted. As a result of the matters referred to above, it is uncertain what role the GSEs, FHA and private capital, including private mortgage insurance, will play in the domestic residential housing finance system in the future or the impact of any such changes on our business. In addition, the timing of the impact of any resulting changes on our business is uncertain. Most meaningful changes would require Congressional action to implement and it is difficult to estimate when Congressional action would be final and how long any associated phase-in period may last. See our risk factor titled &#8220;Changes in the business practices of the GSEs, federal legislation that changes their charters or a restructuring of the GSEs could reduce our revenues or increase our losses&#8221; in Item 1A. 

As noted above, the GSEs have private mortgage insurer eligibility requirements, or PMIERs, for private mortgage insurers that insure loans delivered to the GSEs. The GSEs each revised their PMIERs effective December 31, 2015. The financial requirements of the PMIERs require a mortgage insurer&#8217;s &#8220;Available Assets&#8221; (generally only the most liquid assets of an insurer) to equal or exceed its &#8220;Minimum Required Assets&#8221; (which are based on an insurer&#8217;s book and are calculated from tables of factors with several risk dimensions and are subject to a floor amount). While on an overall basis, the amount of Available Assets MGIC must hold in order to continue to insure GSE loans increased under the revised PMIERs over what state regulation currently requires, our reinsurance transaction mitigates the negative effect of the PMIERs on our returns. See "Regulation &#8211; Direct Regulation" below for information about our compliance with the financial requirements of the PMIERs. 

The private mortgage insurance industry is greatly impacted by macroeconomic conditions that affect home loan originations and credit performance of home loans, including unemployment rates, housing prices, restrictions on mortgage credit due to stringent underwriting standards, interest rates, household formations and homeownership rates. The financial crisis and the downturn in the housing market that began in 2007 had a significant negative impact on the industry and our company. During the last several years preceding the financial crisis, the mortgage lending industry increasingly made home loans to individuals with higher risk credit profiles, at higher loan-to-value (&#8220;LTV&#8221;) ratios, and based on less documentation and verification of information regarding the borrower. Beginning in 2007, job creation slowed and the housing markets began slowing in certain areas, with declines in certain other areas. In 2008 and 2009, employment in the U.S. decreased substantially and nearly all geographic areas in the U.S. experienced home price declines. Together, these conditions resulted in significant adverse developments for us and our industry and we reported a net loss in each of 2007 through 2013. The operating environment for private mortgage insurers has been improving in recent years as the economy has been recovering. For 2015, we reported net income of $1,172.0 million. Excluding the effects of the 2015 reversal of the valuation allowance we had recorded against our deferred tax assets, our adjusted net income was $485.3 million, up from $251.9 million in 2014 and our second year of annual profitability since 2006. We present this non-GAAP financial measure, "adjusted net income," to allow comparability between periods of our financial results by excluding the reversal of our valuation allowance, which is a non-recurring, non-cash item that we believe is not indicative of our results of operations. 

During 2015, $220 billion of mortgages were insured with primary coverage by private mortgage insurers, compared to $176 billion in 2014 and $207 billion in 2013. These figures include $4 billion, $8 billion and $32 billion of refinance transactions that were originated under the Home Affordable Refinance Program (&#8220;HARP&#8221;) in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. We do not include HARP transactions in our new insurance written total because we consider them a modification of the coverage on existing insurance in force. The volume of mortgages insured by private mortgage insurers increased in 2015 compared to 2014, as both purchase mortgage originations and refinance transactions increased. Although the 2015 volume was significantly greater than the recent low in 2010 of $70 billion, it remains significantly below the volumes of 2001 through 2007 when, on average, approximately $311 billion of mortgages were insured with primary coverage by private mortgage insurers. 

For most of our business, we and other private mortgage insurers compete directly with federal and state governmental and quasi-governmental agencies that sponsor government-backed mortgage insurance programs, principally the FHA and the Veterans Administration (&#8220;VA&#8221;). The publication Inside Mortgage Finance &#32;estimates that in 2015, the FHA accounted for 40.1% of low down payment residential mortgages that were subject to FHA, VA or primary private mortgage insurance, up from 33.9% in 2014. In the past ten years, the FHA&#8217;s market share has been as low as 15.6% in 2006 and as high as 70.8% in 2009. Factors that influence the FHA&#8217;s market share include relative rates and fees, underwriting guidelines and loan limits of the FHA, VA, private mortgage insurers and the GSEs; flexibility for the FHA to establish new products as a result of federal legislation and programs; returns obtained by lenders for Ginnie Mae securitization of FHA-insured loans compared to those obtained from selling loans to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac for securitization; and differences in policy terms, such as the ability of a borrower to cancel insurance coverage under certain circumstances. We cannot predict how these factors or the FHA&#8217;s share of new insurance written will change in the future. 

&#32; Inside Mortgage Finance &#32;estimates that in 2015, the VA accounted for 24.8% of all low down payment residential mortgages that were subject to FHA, the VA or primary private mortgage insurance, down from 25.4% in 2014, its highest annual market share in ten years. The VA&#8217;s lowest market share in the past ten years was 5.4% in 2007. We believe that the VA&#8217;s market share has generally been increasing because the VA offers 100% LTV loans and charges a one-time funding fee that can be included in the loan amount but no additional monthly expense, and because of an increase in the number of borrowers that are eligible for the VA&#8217;s program. 

Depending on market conditions and expectations, the private mortgage insurance industry also competes with alternatives to mortgage insurance, such as capital market transactions structured to transfer risk of default on residential mortgages, investors willing to hold credit risk on their own balance sheets without credit enhancement, and &#8220;piggyback loans,&#8221; which combine a first lien loan with a second lien loan. 

In addition to the FHA, VA, other governmental agencies and the alternatives to mortgage insurance discussed above, we also compete with other mortgage insurers. The level of competition, including price competition, within the private mortgage insurance industry has intensified over the past several years and is not expected to diminish. See "Our Products and Services &#8211; Sales and Marketing and Competition &#8211; Competition" below for more information about the impact on our business of competition in the private mortgage insurance industry. 

In addition to being subject to the requirements and practices of the GSEs, private mortgage insurers are subject to comprehensive, detailed regulation by state insurance departments. The insurance laws of 16 jurisdictions, including Wisconsin, our domiciliary state, require a mortgage insurer to maintain a minimum amount of statutory capital relative to the risk in force (or a similar measure) in order for the mortgage insurer to continue to write new business. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (&#8220;NAIC&#8221;) previously announced that it plans to revise the minimum capital and surplus requirements for mortgage insurers that are provided for in its Mortgage Guaranty Insurance Model Act. A working group of state regulators is drafting the revisions, although no date has been established by which the NAIC must propose changes to such requirements. 

Due to the changing environment described above, as well as other factors discussed below, at this time we are facing the following significant challenges: 

&#8226; 

Whether competition from other mortgage insurers, the FHA and the VA will result in a loss of our market share, a decrease in our revenues as a result of price competition or an increase in our losses as a result of the effects of competition on underwriting guidelines. 

&#8226; 

Whether private mortgage insurance will remain a significant credit enhancement alternative for low down payment single family mortgages. An increase in the use of alternatives to private mortgage insurance, such as credit-linked note transactions executed in the capital markets, or a possible restructuring or change in the charters of the GSEs, could significantly affect our business. 

&#32;For additional information about these uncertainties, see our risk factors titled &#8220;Competition or changes in our relationships with our customers could reduce our revenues, reduce our premium yields and/or increase our losses,&#8221; &#8220;The amount of insurance we write could be adversely affected if lenders and investors select alternatives to private mortgage insurance&#8221; and &#8220;Changes in the business practices of the GSEs, federal legislation that changes their charters or a restructuring of the GSEs could reduce our revenues or increase our losses&#8221; in Item 1A.

B. Our Products and Services 

Mortgage Insurance 

In general, there are two principal types of private mortgage insurance: &#8220;primary&#8221; and &#8220;pool.&#8221; In our industry, a &#8220;book&#8221; is a group of loans that a mortgage insurer insures in a particular period, normally a calendar year. We refer to the insurance that has been written by MGIC (including MIC for portions of 2012 and 2013) as the &#8220;MGIC Book.&#8221; 

Primary Insurance. &#32;Primary insurance provides mortgage default protection on individual loans and covers a percentage of the unpaid loan principal, delinquent interest and certain expenses associated with the default and subsequent foreclosure or sale approved by us (collectively, the &#8220;claim amount&#8221;). In addition to the loan principal, the claim amount is affected by the mortgage note rate and the time necessary to complete the foreclosure or sale process, which over the past several years has increased, in part, due to new loss mitigation protocols established by servicers and to changes in some state foreclosure laws that may include, for example, a requirement for additional review and/or mediation processes. The insurer generally pays the coverage percentage of the claim amount specified in the primary policy, but has the option to pay 100% of the claim amount and acquire title to the property. Primary insurance is generally written on first mortgage loans secured by owner occupied single-family homes, which are one-to-four family homes and condominiums. Primary insurance can be written on first liens secured by non-owner occupied single-family homes, which are referred to in the home mortgage lending industry as investor loans, and on vacation or second homes. Primary coverage can be used on any type of residential mortgage loan instrument approved by the mortgage insurer. 

References in this document to amounts of insurance written or in force, risk written or in force and other historical data related to our insurance refer only to direct (before giving effect to reinsurance) primary insurance, unless otherwise indicated. Primary insurance may be written on a flow basis, in which loans are insured in individual, loan-by-loan transactions, or may be written on a bulk basis, in which each loan in a portfolio of loans is individually insured in a single, bulk transaction. New primary insurance written was $43.0 billion in 2015, compared to $33.4 billion in 2014 and $29.8 billion in 2013. The 2015 increase compared to 2014 is primarily the result of an increase in purchase mortgage originations and refinance transactions, as well as an increase in our market share within the private mortgage insurance industry. 

The following table shows, on a direct basis, primary insurance in force (the unpaid principal balance of insured loans as reflected in our records) and primary risk in force (the coverage percentage applied to the unpaid principal balance) for the MGIC Book as of the dates indicated.

For loans sold to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, the coverage percentage must comply with the requirements established by the particular GSE to which the loan is delivered. The GSEs have different loan purchase programs that allow different levels of mortgage insurance coverage. Under the &#8220;charter coverage&#8221; program, on certain loans lenders may choose a mortgage insurance coverage percentage that is less than the GSEs&#8217; &#8220;standard coverage&#8221; and only the minimum required by the GSEs&#8217; charters, with the GSEs paying a lower price for such loans. In 2015, nearly all of our volume was on loans with GSE standard or higher coverage. 

For loans that are not sold to the GSEs, the lender determines the coverage percentage from those that we offer. Higher coverage percentages generally result in increased severity, which is the amount paid on a claim. We charge higher premium rates for higher coverage percentages. However, there can be no assurance that the higher premium rates adequately reflect the risks associated with higher coverage percentages. In accordance with GAAP for the mortgage insurance industry, reserves for losses are only established for loans in default. Because, historically, relatively few defaults occur in the early years of a book of business, the higher premium revenue from higher coverage has historically been recognized before any significant higher losses resulting from that higher coverage may be incurred. For more information, see &#8220;&#8211; Exposure to Catastrophic Loss; Defaults; Claims; Loss Mitigation &#8211; Claims.&#8221; 

In general, mortgage insurance coverage cannot be terminated by the insurer. However, subject to certain restrictions as are specified in our master policy and our Gold Cert Endorsement, we may terminate or rescind coverage for, among other reasons, non-payment of premium, certain material misrepresentations made in connection with the application for the insurance policy or if the loan was never eligible for coverage under our policy. For more information including with regard to our Gold Cert Endorsement, see &#8220;&#8211; Exposure to Catastrophic Loss; Defaults; Claims; Loss Mitigation &#8212; Loss Mitigation.&#8221; Mortgage insurance coverage is renewable at the option of the insured lender, at the renewal rate fixed when the loan was initially insured. Lenders may cancel insurance written on a flow basis at any time at their option or because of mortgage repayment, which may be accelerated because of the refinancing of mortgages. In the case of a loan purchased by Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae, a borrower meeting certain conditions may require the mortgage servicer to cancel insurance upon the borrower&#8217;s request when the principal balance of the loan is 80% or less of the home&#8217;s current value. 

Mortgage insurance for loans secured by one-family, primary residences can be canceled under the federal Homeowners Protection Act (the &#8220;HPA&#8221;). In general, the HPA requires a servicer to cancel the mortgage insurance if a borrower requests cancellation when the principal balance of the loan is first scheduled to reach 80% of the original value, or reaches that percentage through payments, if 1) the borrower is current on the loan and has a &#8220;good payment history&#8221; (as defined by the HPA), 2) the value of the property has not declined below the original value, and 3) if required by the mortgage owner, the borrower&#8217;s equity in the property is not subject to a subordinate lien. Additionally, the HPA requires mortgage insurance to terminate automatically when the principal balance of the loan is first scheduled to reach 78% of the original value and the borrower is current on loan payments or thereafter becomes current. Annually, servicers must inform borrowers of their right to cancel or terminate mortgage insurance. The provisions of the HPA described above apply only to borrower paid mortgage insurance, which is described below. 

Coverage tends to continue for borrowers experiencing economic difficulties and living in areas experiencing housing price depreciation. The persistency of coverage for those borrowers coupled with cancellation of coverage for other borrowers can increase the percentage of an insurer&#8217;s portfolio comprised of loans with more credit risk. This development can also occur during periods of heavy mortgage refinancing because borrowers experiencing property value appreciation are less likely to require mortgage insurance at the time of refinancing, while borrowers not experiencing property value appreciation are more likely to continue to require mortgage insurance at the time of refinancing or not qualify for refinancing at all (including if they have experienced economic difficulties) and thus remain subject to the mortgage insurance coverage. 

The percentage of primary new insurance written with respect to loans representing refinances was 19% for 2015, compared to 13% in 2014 and 26% in 2013. When a borrower refinances a mortgage loan insured by us by paying it off in full with the proceeds of a new mortgage that is also insured by us, the insurance on that existing mortgage is cancelled, and insurance on the new mortgage is considered to be new primary insurance written. Therefore, continuation of our coverage from a refinanced loan to a new loan results in both a cancellation of insurance and new insurance written. When a lender and borrower modify a loan rather than replace it with a new one, or enter into a new loan pursuant to a loan modification program, our insurance continues without being cancelled, assuming that we consent to the modification or new loan. As a result, such modifications or new loans, including those modified under HARP, are not included in our new insurance written. 

In addition to varying with the coverage percentage, our premium rates for insurance vary depending upon the perceived risk of a claim on the insured loan and thus take into account, among other things, the loan-to-value ratio, the borrower&#8217;s credit score, whether the loan is a fixed payment loan or a non-fixed payment loan (a non-fixed payment loan is referred to in the home mortgage lending industry as an adjustable rate mortgage), the mortgage term and whether the property is the borrower&#8217;s primary residence. We generally utilize a national, rather than a regional or local, premium rate policy. However, depending upon regional economic conditions, we have made, and may make, changes to our underwriting requirements to implement more restrictive standards in certain markets and for loan characteristics that we categorize as higher risk. Premium rates cannot be changed after the issuance of coverage. 

The borrower&#8217;s mortgage loan instrument may require the borrower to pay the mortgage insurance premium. Our industry refers to the related mortgage insurance as &#8220;borrower-paid.&#8221; If the borrower is not required to pay the premium and mortgage insurance is required in connection with the origination of the loan, then the premium is paid by the lender, who may recover the premium through an increase in the note rate on the mortgage or higher origination fees. Our industry refers to mortgage insurance on such loans as &#8220;lender-paid.&#8221; Most of our primary insurance in force is borrower-paid mortgage insurance. 

There are several payment plans available to the borrower, or lender, as the case may be. Under the single premium plan, the borrower or lender pays us in advance a single payment covering a specified term exceeding twelve months. Under the monthly premium plan, the borrower or lender pays us a monthly premium payment to provide only one month of coverage. Under the annual premium plan, an annual premium is paid to us in advance, and we earn and recognize the premium over the next twelve 

months of coverage, with annual renewal premiums paid in advance thereafter and earned over the subsequent twelve months of coverage. 

During 2015, 2014 and 2013, the single premium plan represented approximately 20%, 15% and 10%, respectively, of our new insurance written. The monthly premium plan represented approximately 80%, 85% and 90%, respectively. The annual premium plan represented less than 1% of new insurance written in each of those years. Our single premium plan policies have increased in part as a result of the 2014 and 2013 reductions in our single premium rates and our selectively matching reduced rates on lender-paid single premium policies being offered by competitors. We expect to receive less lifetime premium from a 2015 lender-paid single premium policy than we would from a 2015 borrower-paid monthly premium policy. Given the 2015 pricing environment, the increased percentage of our new business represented by lender-paid single premium policies reduced our weighted average premium rates on new insurance written. 

In January 2016, we announced our intention to revise our premium rate cards in the near future. We expect that this will result in a decrease in premium rates on some loans with higher credit scores and an increase in premium rates on some loans with lower credit scores. We expect that our premium rate changes will modestly decrease our new insurance written; however, we expect the premium yield on new insurance written to remain approximately the same as on 2015 new insurance written, and our returns on a portfolio basis to be comparable to those we expect to earn on the business we wrote in 2015. 

Pool Insurance. &#32;Pool insurance is generally used as an additional &#8220;credit enhancement&#8221; for certain secondary market mortgage transactions. Pool insurance generally covers the amount of the loss on a defaulted mortgage loan that exceeds the claim payment under the primary coverage, if primary insurance is required on that mortgage loan, as well as the total loss on a defaulted mortgage loan which did not require primary insurance. Pool insurance may have a stated aggregate loss limit for a pool of loans and may also have a deductible under which no losses are paid by the insurer until losses on the pool of loans exceed the deductible. 

We have written no new pool risk since 2009, however, for a variety of reasons, including responding to capital market alternatives to private mortgage insurance and customer demands, we may write pool risk in the future. At each of December 31, 2015 and 2014, 98% of our risk in force was primary insurance and the remaining risk in force was pool insurance. Our direct pool risk in force was $0.7 billion ($0.3 billion on pool policies with aggregate loss limits and $0.4 billion on pool policies without aggregate loss limits) at December 31, 2015, compared to $0.8 billion ($0.3 billion on pool policies with aggregate loss limits and $0.5 billion on pool policies without aggregate loss limits) at December 31, 2014, and $1.0 billion ($0.4 billion on pool policies with aggregate loss limits and $0.6 billion on pool policies without aggregate loss limits) at December 31, 2013. 

Wall Street Bulk Transactions. &#32;In the fourth quarter of 2007, we stopped writing bulk insurance for loans that served as collateral in home equity securitizations (we refer to these as &#8220;Wall Street bulk transactions&#8221;). These securitizations represented approximately 5.0% of our risk in force at December 31, 2015. In general, the loans insured by us in Wall Street bulk transactions consisted of loans with reduced underwriting documentation, cash out refinances that exceed the standard underwriting requirements of the GSEs, A- loans, subprime loans and jumbo loans. A jumbo loan has an unpaid principal balance that exceeds the conforming loan limit. See footnote 2 to the table titled &#8220;Default Statistics for the MGIC Book&#8221; in &#8220;&#8211; Exposure to Catastrophic Loss; Defaults; Claims; Loss Mitigation &#8211; Defaults&#8221; below for the definitions of A-, subprime and reduced documentation loans, as such terms are used in this annual report. The conforming loan limit is the maximum unpaid principal amount of a mortgage loan that can be purchased by the GSEs. See footnote 4 to the table titled &#8220;Characteristics of Primary Risk in Force&#8221; in &#8220;&#8211; Risk in Force and Product Characteristics of Risk in Force&#8221; below for more information about conforming loan limits.

(1) 

Loan-to-value ratio represents the ratio (expressed as a percentage) of the dollar amount of the first mortgage loan to the value of the property at the time the loan became insured and does not reflect subsequent housing price appreciation or depreciation. Subordinate mortgages may also be present. 

(2) 

Includes fixed rate mortgages with temporary buydowns (where in effect the applicable interest rate is typically reduced by one or two percentage points during the first two years of the loan), ARMs in which the initial interest rate is fixed for at least five years and balloon payment mortgages (a loan with a maturity, typically five to seven years, that is shorter than the loan&#8217;s amortization period). 

(3) 

Includes ARMs where payments adjust fully with interest rate adjustments. Also includes pay option ARMs and other ARMs with negative amortization features, which collectively at December 31, 2015 and 2014, represented 0.7% and 0.9%, respectively, of primary risk in force. As indicated in note (2), does not include ARMs in which the initial interest rate is fixed for at least five years. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, ARMs with loan-to-value ratios in excess of 90% represented 0.7% and 0.9%, respectively, of primary risk in force. 

(4) 

Loans within the conforming loan limit have an original principal balance that does not exceed the maximum original principal balance of loans that the GSEs are eligible to purchase. The conforming loan limit, for one unit properties, is subject to annual adjustment and was $417,000 for 2007 and early 2008; this amount was temporarily increased to up to $729,500 in the most costly communities in early 2008 and remained at such level through September 30, 2011. The limit was decreased to $417,000 although it remains $625,500 in high cost communities for loans originated after September 30, 2011. Non-conforming loans are loans with an original principal balance above the conforming loan limit. 

(5) 

Includes cooperatives and manufactured homes deemed to be real estate. 

(6) 

Reduced documentation loans, many of which are commonly referred to as &#8220;Alt-A&#8221; loans, are originated under programs in which there is a reduced level of verification or disclosure compared to traditional mortgage loan underwriting, including programs in which the borrower&#8217;s income and/or assets are disclosed in the loan application but there is no verification of those disclosures and programs in which there is no disclosure of income or assets in the loan application. In accordance with industry practice, loans approved by GSE and other automated underwriting (AU) systems under &#8220;doc waiver&#8221; programs that did not require verification of borrower income are classified by us as &#8220;full documentation.&#8221; Based in part on information provided by the GSEs, we estimate full documentation loans of this type were approximately 4% of 2007 new insurance written. Information for other periods is not available. We understand these AU systems granted such doc waivers for loans they judged to have higher credit quality. We also understand that the GSEs terminated their &#8220;doc waiver&#8221; programs in the second half of 2008. 

(7) 

Represents the FICO score at loan origination. The weighted average &#8220;decision FICO score&#8221; at loan origination for new insurance written in 2015 and 2014 was 744 and 743, respectively. The FICO score for a loan with multiple borrowers is the lowest of the borrowers&#8217; decision FICO scores. A borrower&#8217;s &#8220;decision FICO score&#8221; is determined as follows: if there are three FICO scores available, the middle FICO score is used; if two FICO scores are available, the lower of the two is used; if only one FICO score is available, it is used. A FICO score is a score based on a borrower&#8217;s credit history generated by a model developed by Fair Isaac Corporation. 

Other Products and Services 

Contract Underwriting . &#32;&#32;A non-insurance subsidiary of ours performs contract underwriting services for lenders. In performing those services, we underwrite loans to conform to prescribed guidelines. The guidelines might be the lender's own guidelines or the guidelines of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or a non-GSE investor. These services are provided for loans that require private mortgage insurance as well as for loans that do not require private mortgage insurance. The complaint in the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act ("RESPA") litigation that we settled in 2003, which litigation is referred to in our risk factor titled &#8220;We are involved in legal proceedings and are &#160; subject to the risk of additional legal proceedings in the future&#8221; in Item 1A, alleged, among other things, that the pricing of contract underwriting provided by us violated RESPA. 

Under our contract underwriting agreements, we may be required to provide certain remedies to our customers if certain standards relating to the quality of our underwriting work are not met, and we have an established reserve for such future obligations. The contract remedy expense of the subsidiary performing the contract underwriting services was approximately $1 million, $4 million and $5 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Claims for remedies may be made a number of years after the underwriting work was performed. 

Other . &#32;We provide various fee-based services for the mortgage finance industry, such as analysis of loan originations and portfolios, and mortgage lead generation. 

Reinsurance Agreements 

At December 31, 2015, approximately 76% of our insurance in force was subject to reinsurance agreements, compared to 61% at December 31, 2014. In 2015, approximately 91% of our new insurance written was subject to reinsurance agreements, compared to 90% in 2014. 

External Reinsurance . In April 2013, we entered into a quota share reinsurance agreement with a group of unaffiliated reinsurers that was settled by commutation effective July 1, 2015. Also effective July 1, 2015, we entered into a new quota share reinsurance agreement with the same group of unaffiliated reinsurers which provides coverage on policies that were covered under the 2013 agreement; certain additional in force policies as of July 1, 2015; and all qualifying new insurance written through December 31, 2016. The agreement covers incurred losses, with renewal premium through December 31, 2024. The structure of the 2015 agreement is a 30% quota share for all policies covered, with a 20% ceding commission as well as a profit commission. Generally, under the 2015 agreement, we will receive a profit commission provided that the loss ratio on the loans covered under the agreement remains below 60%. Although reinsuring against possible loan losses does not discharge us from liability to a policyholder, it reduces the amount of capital we are required to retain against potential future losses for the PMIERs, rating agency and insurance regulatory purposes. We are currently allowed full credit under the PMIERs for the risk ceded under the quota share transaction. However, the GSEs' ongoing approval of the transaction is subject to several conditions and it will be reviewed under the PMIERs at least annually by the GSEs. Early termination of the agreement can be elected by us effective December 31, 2018 for a fee, or under specified scenarios for no fee upon prior written notice. Further, at our sole discretion we may elect to terminate the 2015 agreement if we will receive less than 90% of the full PMIERs credit amount for the risk ceded under the agreement in any required calculation period. 

Captive Reinsurance . In a captive reinsurance arrangement, the reinsurer is affiliated with the lender for whom MGIC provides mortgage insurance. Since June 2005, various state and federal regulators have conducted investigations or requested information regarding captive mortgage reinsurance arrangements in which we participated, in part, in order to consider compliance with RESPA. In 2013, we entered into a settlement agreement with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ("CFPB") that resolved a federal investigation of MGIC&#8217;s participation in captive reinsurance arrangements without the CFPB or a court making any findings of wrongdoing. As part of the settlement, MGIC agreed that it would not enter into any new captive reinsurance agreement or reinsure any new loans under any existing captive reinsurance agreement for a period of ten years. In accordance with this settlement, all of our active captive arrangements have been placed into run-off. 

For further information about our reinsurance agreements, see Note 11 &#8211; &#8220;Reinsurance,&#8221; to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8. For further information about investigations and litigation concerning captive reinsurance arrangements, see our risk factor titled "We are involved in legal proceedings and are subject to the risk of additional legal proceedings in the future" in Item 1A. 

Customers 

Originators of residential mortgage loans such as savings institutions, commercial banks, mortgage brokers, credit unions, mortgage bankers and other lenders have historically determined the placement of mortgage insurance written on a flow basis and as a result are our customers. To obtain primary insurance from us written on a flow basis, a mortgage lender must first apply for and receive a mortgage guaranty master policy from us. Our top 10 customers, none of whom represented more than 10% of our consolidated revenues, generated 23.4% of our new insurance written on a flow basis in 2015, compared to 19.5% in 2014 and 23.0% in 2013. Our largest customer accounted for approximately 5% of our flow new insurance written in 2015 compared to approximately 4% in 2014. Our relationships with our customers could be adversely affected by a variety of factors, including premium rates higher than can be obtained from competitors, tightening of and adherence to our underwriting requirements, which may result in our declining to insure some of the loans originated by our customers and insurance rescissions and curtailments that affect the customer. Information about some of the other factors that can affect a mortgage insurer&#8217;s relationship with its customers can be found in our risk factor titled &#8220;Competition or changes in our relationships with our customers could reduce our revenues, reduce our premium yields and/or increase our losses&#8221; in Item 1A. 

Sales and Marketing and Competition 

Sales and Marketing. &#32;&#32;We sell our insurance products through our own employees, located throughout all regions of the United States and in Puerto Rico. 

Competition. &#32;&#32;Our competition includes other mortgage insurers, governmental agencies and products designed to eliminate the need to purchase private mortgage insurance. For flow business, we and other private mortgage insurers compete directly with federal and state governmental and quasi-governmental agencies, principally the FHA and the VA. The FHA and the VA sponsor 

government-backed mortgage insurance programs, and it is estimated that during 2015, 2014 and 2013, they accounted for a combined approximately 64.9%, 59.3% and 63.5% , respectively, of the total low down payment residential mortgages which were subject to FHA, VA or primary private mortgage insurance. For more information about the market share of the FHA and the VA, see &#8220;Overview of the Private Mortgage Insurance Industry and its Operating Environment&#8221; above. 

In addition to competition from the FHA and the VA, we and other private mortgage insurers face competition from state-supported mortgage insurance funds in several states. From time to time, other state legislatures and agencies consider expanding the authority of their state governments to insure residential mortgages. 

The private mortgage insurance industry is highly competitive. We believe that we currently compete with other private mortgage insurers based on pricing, underwriting requirements, financial strength, customer relationships, name recognition, reputation, the strength of our management team and field organization, the ancillary products and services provided to lenders (including contract underwriting services), the depth of our databases covering insured loans and the effective use of technology and innovation in the delivery and servicing of our mortgage insurance products. 

The U.S. private mortgage insurance industry currently consists of seven active mortgage insurers and their affiliates. The names of these mortgage insurers can be found in our risk factor titled &#8220;Competition or changes in our relationships with our customers could reduce our revenues, reduce our premium yields and/or increase our losses&#8221; in Item 1A. Until 2010 the mortgage insurance industry had not had new entrants in many years. Since 2010, two public companies have been formed and began writing business and a worldwide insurer and reinsurer with mortgage insurance operations in Europe completed the purchase of a competitor and is currently writing business. At December 31, 2015, we had the third largest book of direct primary insurance in force. According to Inside Mortgage Finance , through 2010, we had been the largest private mortgage insurer (as measured by new insurance written) for more than ten years. In 2015, we had the second largest market share (as measured by new insurance written) and it was 19.9% in 2015, compared to 19.8% in 2014 and 16.4% in 2013, in each case excluding HARP refinances. 

The mortgage insurance industry historically viewed a financial strength rating of Aa3/AA- as critical to writing new business, in part because it was required in order to maintain the highest level of eligibility with the GSEs before the PMIERs were revised effective December 31, 2015. At the time that this annual report was finalized, the financial strength of MGIC was rated Baa3 (with a stable outlook) by Moody&#8217;s Investors Service and BB+ (with a positive outlook) by Standard &#38; Poor&#8217;s Rating Services. The revised PMIERs replaced the financial strength rating requirements with a requirement that a mortgage insurer&#8217;s &#8220;Available Assets&#8221; (generally only the most liquid assets of an insurer) equal or exceed its &#8220;Minimum Required Assets&#8221; (which are based on an insurer&#8217;s book and are calculated from tables of factors with several risk dimensions and are subject to a floor amount). For further information about the importance of MGIC&#8217;s capital, see our risk factor titled &#8220;We may not continue to meet the GSEs&#8217; mortgage insurer eligibility requirements and our returns may decrease as we are required to maintain significantly more capital in order to maintain our eligibility&#8221; in Item 1A. Depending on the evolution of housing finance reform, the level of issuances of non-GSE mortgage-backed securities (&#8220;MBS&#8221;) may increase in the future. Financial strength ratings may be considered by issuers of non-GSE MBS in determining whether to purchase private mortgage insurance for loans supporting such securities. In assigning financial strength ratings, in addition to considering the adequacy of the mortgage insurer&#8217;s capital to withstand very high claim scenarios under assumptions determined by the rating agency, we believe rating agencies review a mortgage insurer&#8217;s historical and projected operating performance, franchise risk, business outlook, competitive position, management, corporate strategy, and other factors. The rating agency issuing the financial strength rating can withdraw or change its rating at any time. 

Risk Management 

We believe that mortgage credit risk is materially affected by: 

&#8226; 

the borrower&#8217;s credit profile, including the borrower&#8217;s credit history, debt-to-income ratios and cash reserves, and the willingness of a borrower with sufficient resources to make mortgage payments when the mortgage balance exceeds the value of the home; 

&#8226; 

the loan product, which encompasses the loan-to-value ratio, the type of loan instrument, including whether the instrument provides for fixed or variable payments and the amortization schedule, the type of property and the purpose of the loan; 

&#8226; 

origination practices of lenders and the percentage of coverage on insured loans; 

&#8226; 

the size of insured loans; and 

&#8226; 

the condition of the economy, including the direction of change in housing values and employment, in the area in which the property is located. 

We believe that, excluding other factors, claim incidence increases: 

&#8226; 

for loans to borrowers with lower FICO scores compared to loans to borrowers with higher FICO scores; 

&#8226; 

for loans with less than full underwriting documentation compared to loans with full underwriting documentation; 

&#8226; 

during periods of economic contraction and housing price depreciation, including when these conditions may not be nationwide, compared to periods of economic expansion and housing price appreciation; 

&#8226; 

for loans with higher loan-to-value ratios compared to loans with lower loan-to-value ratios; 

&#8226; 

for ARMs when the reset interest rate significantly exceeds the interest rate at the time of loan origination; 

&#8226; 

for loans that permit the deferral of principal amortization compared to loans that require principal amortization with each monthly payment; 

&#8226; 

for loans in which the original loan amount exceeds the conforming loan limit compared to loans below that limit; and 

&#8226; 

for cash out refinance loans compared to rate and term refinance loans. 

Other types of loan characteristics relating to the individual loan or borrower may also affect the risk potential for a loan. The presence of a number of higher-risk characteristics in a loan materially increases the likelihood of a claim on such a loan unless there are other characteristics to lower the risk. 

We charge higher premium rates to reflect the increased risk of claim incidence that we perceive is associated with a loan, although not all higher risk characteristics are reflected in the premium rate. There can be no assurance that our premium rates adequately reflect the increased risk, particularly in a period of economic recession, high unemployment, slowing home price appreciation or housing price declines. For additional information, see our risk factors in Item 1A, including the one titled &#8220;The premiums we charge may not be adequate to compensate us for our liabilities for losses and as a result any inadequacy could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations.&#8221; 

Beginning in late 2007 and into 2008, we implemented a series of changes to our underwriting requirements that were designed to improve the risk profile of our new business. The changes primarily affected borrowers who had multiple risk factors such as a high loan-to-value ratio, a lower FICO score and limited documentation or those financing a home in a market we categorized as higher risk. The loans insured in the periods leading up to the effectiveness of the new requirements continue to experience significantly higher than historical lifetime claim rates and incurred losses. Beginning in September 2009, we have made changes to our underwriting requirements that have allowed certain loans to be eligible for insurance that were not eligible prior to those changes and we expect to continue to make changes in appropriate circumstances in the future. 

Delegated Underwriting and Automated Underwriting. &#32;&#32;In the past, we allowed approved lenders to commit us to insure loans originated through the flow channel using their own underwriting guidelines that we had pre-approved. Subsequently, some lenders developed their own automated underwriting systems. After we reviewed such systems, we agreed to allow certain lenders to commit us to insure loans that their systems approved. From 2000 through January 2007, the use of automated underwriting systems by the GSEs and lenders increased materially. During this same period, we allowed loans approved by the automated underwriting systems of the GSEs and certain approved lenders to be automatically approved for MGIC mortgage insurance. As a result, during this period, a substantial majority of the loans insured by us through the flow channel were approved as a result of loan approvals by automated underwriting systems. Beginning in 2007 and continuing through 2012, loans would not automatically be insured by us even though the loans were approved by the underwriting systems described above. Beginning in 2013, we aligned most of our underwriting requirements with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac for loans that receive and are processed in accordance with certain approval recommendations from a GSE automated underwriting system. As a result of the changes to our underwriting guidelines and requirements, and other factors, our business written beginning in the second half of 2013 is expected to have a somewhat higher claim incidence than business written 2009 through the first half of 2013. However, we believe this business presents an acceptable level of risk. Our underwriting requirements are available on our website at http://www.mgic.com/underwriting/index.html. 

Applications for mortgage insurance are submitted to us through both our delegated and non-delegated options. Under the delegated option, applications are submitted to us electronically and we rely upon the lender&#8217;s representations and warranties that the data submitted is true and correct when making our insurance decision. If the loan data submitted meets the underwriting 

requirements, a commitment to insure the loan is immediately issued. If the requirements are not met, the loan is reviewed by one of our underwriters. Non-delegated applications are submitted with documents from the lender&#8217;s loan origination file. During loan set-up, data is entered from those application documents and electronically evaluated against our underwriting requirements. An internally generated feedback report guides the mortgage insurance review as a full review of the mortgage documents is performed by one of our underwriters. If the loan meets the underwriting requirements, a commitment to insure the loan is issued. Our underwriters are authorized to approve loans that do not meet all of our underwriting requirements provided appropriate offsetting factors can be identified. The number of loans for which underwriting exceptions were made accounted for fewer than 2% of the loans we insured in each of 2014 and 2015.

Exposure to Catastrophic Loss. &#32;&#32;The private mortgage insurance industry has from time to time experienced catastrophic losses similar to the losses we have experienced in recent years. For background information about the current cycle of such losses, refer to &#8220;General &#8211; Overview of Private Mortgage Insurance Industry and its Operating Environment&#8221; above. To the extent our premium yield materially declines without either a corresponding decrease in our risk written or achieving other benefits, we become less likely to be able to withstand the occurrence of a catastrophic loss scenario. Prior to the most recent cycle of such losses, the last time that private mortgage insurers experienced substantial losses was in the mid-to-late 1980s. From the 1970s until 1981, rising home prices in the United States generally led to profitable insurance underwriting results for the industry and caused private mortgage insurers to emphasize market share. To maximize market share, until the mid-1980s, private mortgage insurers employed liberal underwriting practices, and charged premium rates which, in retrospect, generally did not adequately reflect the risk assumed, particularly on pool insurance. These industry practices compounded the losses which resulted from changing economic and market conditions which occurred during the early and mid-1980s, including (1) severe regional recessions and attendant declines in property values in the nation&#8217;s energy producing states; (2) the lenders&#8217; development of new mortgage products to defer the impact on homebuyers of double digit mortgage interest rates; and (3) changes in federal income tax incentives which initially encouraged the growth of investment in non-owner occupied properties. 

Defaults . The claim cycle on private mortgage insurance generally begins with the insurer&#8217;s receipt of notification of a default on an insured loan from the loan servicer. We consider a loan to be in default when it is two or more payments past due. Most servicers report delinquent loans to us within this two month period. The incidence of default is affected by a variety of factors, including the level of borrower income growth, unemployment, health issues, family status, the level of interest rates, rates of housing price appreciation or depreciation and general borrower creditworthiness. Defaults that are not cured result in a claim to us. See &#8220;&#8211; Claims.&#8221; Defaults may be cured by the borrower bringing current the delinquent loan payments or by a sale of the property and the satisfaction of all amounts due under the mortgage. In addition, when a policy is rescinded or a claim is denied we remove the default from our default inventory. 

The following table shows the number of primary and pool loans insured in the MGIC Book, including A- and subprime loans, the related number of loans in default and the percentage of loans in default, or default rate, as of December 31, 2011-2015.

At December 31, 2015, 2014, 2013, 2011 and 2011, 2,769, 4,746, 6,948, 11,731 and 12,610 loans in default, respectively, were in our claims received inventory. 

(2) 

We define prime loans as those having FICO scores of 620 or greater, A-minus loans as those having FICO scores of 575-619, and subprime credit loans as those having FICO scores of less than 575, all as reported to MGIC at the time a commitment to insure is issued. In this annual report we classify loans without complete documentation as &#8220;reduced documentation&#8221; loans regardless of FICO score rather than as prime, &#8220;A-&#8221; or &#8220;subprime&#8221; loans; in the table above, such loans appear only in the reduced documentation category and they do not appear in any of the other categories. 

(3) 

In accordance with industry practice, loans approved by GSE and other automated underwriting (AU) systems under &#8220;doc waiver&#8221; programs that do not require verification of borrower income are classified by us as &#8220;full documentation.&#8221; Based in part on information provided by the GSEs, we estimate full documentation loans of this type were approximately 4% of 2007 new insurance written. Information for other periods is not available. We understand these AU systems granted such doc waivers for loans they judged to have higher credit quality. We also understand that the GSEs terminated their &#8220;doc waiver&#8221; programs in the second half of 2008. 

(4) 

The number of loans insured under pool policies declined significantly from 2011 to 2012, partly due to the cancellation of certain pool policies due to the exhaustion of their aggregate loss limits. 

Different geographical areas may experience different default rates due to varying localized economic conditions from year to year. The following table shows the percentage of primary loans we insured that were in default as of December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 for the 15 jurisdictions for which we paid the most claims during 2015.

The primary default inventory in those same jurisdictions as of December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 appears in a table found in &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8211; Results of Consolidated Operations &#8211; Losses &#8211; Losses Incurred,&#8221; in Item 7. 

Claims. &#32;Claims result from defaults that are not cured or a short sale that we approve. Whether a claim results from an uncured default depends, in large part, on the borrower&#8217;s equity in the home at the time of default, the borrower&#8217;s or the lender&#8217;s ability to sell the home for an amount sufficient to satisfy all amounts due under the mortgage and the willingness and ability of the borrower and lender to enter into a loan modification that provides for a cure of the default. Various factors affect the frequency and amount of claims, including local housing prices and employment levels, and interest rates. If a default goes to claim, any premium collected from the time of default to time of the claim payment is returned to the servicer along with the claim payment. 

Under the terms of our master policy, the lender is required to file a claim for primary insurance with us within 60 days after it has acquired title to the underlying property (typically through foreclosure). Until a few years ago, it took, on average, approximately twelve months for a default that is not cured to develop into a paid claim. Over the past several years, the average time it takes to receive a claim associated with a default has increased. This is, in part, due to new loss mitigation protocols established by servicers and to changes in some state foreclosure laws that may include, for example, a requirement for additional review and/or mediation processes. It is difficult to estimate how long it may take for current and future defaults that do not cure to develop into paid claims. 

Within 60 days after a claim has been filed and all documents required to be submitted to us have been delivered, we have the option of either (1) paying the coverage percentage specified for that loan, with the insured retaining title to the underlying property and receiving all proceeds from the eventual sale of the property (we have elected this option for the vast majority of claim payments in the recent past), or (2) paying 100% of the claim amount in exchange for the lender&#8217;s conveyance of good and marketable title to the property to us. After we receive title to properties, we sell them for our own account. If we fail to pay a claim timely, we would be subject to additional interest expense. 

Claim activity is not evenly spread throughout the coverage period of a book of primary business. Relatively few claims are typically received during the first two years following issuance of coverage on a loan. This is typically followed by a period of rising claims which, based on industry experience, has historically reached its highest level in the third and fourth years after the year of loan origination. Thereafter, the number of claims typically received has historically declined at a gradual rate, although the rate of decline can be affected by conditions in the economy, including slowing home price appreciation or housing price depreciation. Moreover, when a loan is refinanced, because the new loan replaces, and is a continuation of, an earlier loan, the pattern of claims frequency for that new loan may be different from the historical pattern for other loans. Persistency, the condition of the economy, including unemployment, and other factors can affect the pattern of claim activity. For example, a weak economy 

can lead to claims from older books increasing, continuing at stable levels or experiencing a lower rate of decline. As of December 31, 2015, 50% of our primary risk in force was written subsequent to December 31, 2012, 57% was written subsequent to December 31, 2011, and 59% was written subsequent to December 31, 2010. See &#8220;Our Products and Services &#8211; Mortgage Insurance &#8211; Primary Insurance In Force and Risk In Force by Policy Year&#8221; above. 

Another important factor affecting MGIC Book losses is the amount of the average claim size, which is generally referred to as claim severity. The primary average claim paid on the MGIC Book was $48,248 in 2015, compared to $45,596 in 2014, $46,375 in 2013, $48,722 in 2012 and $49,887 in 2011.The main determinants of claim severity are the amount of the mortgage loan, the coverage percentage on the loan, loss mitigation efforts and local market conditions.

Each of 2015, 2014 and 2013 includes $42 million paid under the terms of the settlement with Freddie Mac as discussed under Note 9 &#8211; &#8220;Loss Reserves&#8221; to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8.

Primary claims paid for the top 15 jurisdictions (based on 2015 paid claims, excluding payments associated with the Countrywide settlement) and all other jurisdictions for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 appear in a table found in &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8211; Results of Consolidated Operations &#8211; Losses &#8211; Losses Incurred,&#8221; in Item 7. 

From time to time, proposals to give bankruptcy judges the authority to reduce mortgage balances in bankruptcy cases have been made. Such reductions are sometimes referred to as bankruptcy cramdowns. A bankruptcy cramdown is not an event that entitles an insured party to make a claim under our insurance policy. If a borrower ultimately satisfies his or her mortgage after a bankruptcy cramdown, then our insurance policies provide that we would not be required to pay any claim. Under our insurance policies, however, if a borrower re-defaults on a mortgage after a bankruptcy cramdown, the claim we would be required to pay would be based upon the original, unreduced loan balance. We are not aware of any bankruptcy cramdown proposals that would change these provisions of our insurance policies. Unless a lender has obtained our prior approval, if a borrower&#8217;s mortgage loan balance is reduced outside the bankruptcy context, including in association with a loan modification, and if the borrower re-defaults after such a reduction, then under the terms of our policy the amount we would be responsible to cover would be calculated net of the reduction. 

Loss Mitigation. &#32; 

Before paying a claim, we review the loan and servicing files to determine the appropriateness of the claim amount. All of our insurance policies provide that we can reduce or deny a claim if the servicer did not comply with its obligations under our insurance policy, including the requirement to mitigate our loss by performing reasonable loss mitigation efforts or, for example, diligently pursuing a foreclosure or bankruptcy relief in a timely manner. We call such reduction of claims submitted to us &#8220;curtailments.&#8221; In each of 2015 and 2014, curtailments reduced our average claim paid by approximately 6.7%. After we pay a claim, servicers and insureds sometimes object to our curtailments and other adjustments. We review these objections if they are sent to us within 90 days after the claim was paid. 

When reviewing the loan file associated with a claim, we may determine that we have the right to rescind coverage on the loan. In our SEC reports, we refer to insurance rescissions and denials of claims as &#8220;rescissions&#8221; and variations of this term. The circumstances in which we are entitled to rescind coverage have narrowed for insurance we have written in recent years. During the second quarter of 2012, we began writing a portion of our new insurance under the Gold Cert Endorsement, which limited our ability to rescind coverage compared to our master policy in effect at that time. Our rescission rights under our new master policy introduced in 2014 are comparable to those under our previous master policy, as modified by the Gold Cert Endorsement, but may be further narrowed if the GSEs permit modifications to them. 

In recent quarters, approximately 5% of claims received in a quarter have been resolved by rescisisons, down from the peak of approximately 28% in the first half of 2009. Our rescissions involve inaccurate information or fraud committed regarding a borrower&#8217;s income, debts or intention to occupy the property; a faulty appraisal; negligence in the origination of the loan; or a failure to provide us with documentation we request under our policy (we use this documentation to investigate whether a claim must be paid). We do not expect future rescissions will be a significant portion of the claims we resolve over the next few years. 

Our loss reserving methodology incorporates our estimates of future rescissions, reversals of rescissions and curtailments. When we rescind coverage, we return all premiums previously paid to us under the policy and are relieved of our obligation to pay a claim under the policy. A variance between ultimate actual rescission, reversal or curtailment rates and our estimates, as a result of the outcome of litigation, settlements or other factors, could materially affect our losses. 

If the insured disputes our right to rescind coverage, we generally engage in discussions in an attempt to settle the dispute. As part of those discussions, we may voluntarily suspend rescissions we believe may be part of a settlement. Certain settlements require GSE approval. The GSEs consented to settlement agreements we entered into with Countrywide Home Loans, Inc. (&#8220;CHL&#8221;) and its affiliate, Bank of America, N.A., as successor to Countrywide Home Loans Servicing LP, but there is no guarantee they will approve others. We have reached and implemented settlement agreements that do not require GSE approval, but they have not been material in the aggregate. 

If we are unable to reach a settlement, the outcome of a dispute ultimately would be determined by legal proceedings. Under our policies in effect prior to October 1, 2014, legal proceedings disputing our right to rescind coverage may be brought up to three years after the lender has obtained title to the property (typically through a foreclosure) or the property was sold in a sale that we approved, whichever is applicable, and under our master policy effective October 1, 2014, such proceedings may be brought up two years from the date of the notice of rescission. In a few jurisdictions there is a longer time to bring such proceedings. 

Until a liability associated with a settlement agreement or litigation becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated, we consider our claim payment or rescission resolved for financial reporting purposes even though discussions and legal proceedings may have been initiated and are ongoing. Under ASC 450-20, an estimated loss from such discussions and proceedings is accrued for only if we determine that the loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. The estimated impact that we have recorded is our best estimate of our loss from these matters. If we are not able to implement settlements we consider probable, we intend to defend MGIC vigorously against any related legal proceedings. 

In addition to the probable settlements for which we have recorded a loss, we are involved in other discussions and/or proceedings with insureds with respect to our claims paying practices. Although it is reasonably possible that when these matters are resolved we will not prevail in all cases, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate or range of estimates of the potential liability. We estimate the maximum exposure associated with matters where a loss is reasonably possible to be approximately $317 million, although we believe we will ultimately resolve these matters for significantly less than this amount. This estimate includes the maximum exposure for losses that we have determined are probable in excess of the provision we have recorded for such losses. 

The estimates of our maximum exposure referred to above do not include interest or consequential or exemplary damages. 

Although loan modification programs continued to mitigate our losses in 2015, the impact of modifications has been decreasing. &#160; During 2014 and 2015, we were notified of modifications that cured delinquencies that had they become paid claims would have resulted in approximately $0.8 billion and $0.6 billion, respectively, of estimated claim payments. These levels are down from a high of $3.2 billion in 2010. For more information, see the risk factor titled &#8220;Loan modification and other similar programs may not continue to provide substantial benefits to us &#8221; in Item 1A. 

Another loss mitigation technique available to us is obtaining a deficiency judgment against the borrower and attempting to recover some or all of the paid claim from the borrower. Various factors, including state laws that limit or eliminate our ability to pursue deficiency judgments and borrowers&#8217; financial conditions, have limited our recoveries in recent years to less than one-half of 1% of our paid claims. 

Loss Reserves and Premium Deficiency Reserve 

A significant period of time typically elapses between the time when a borrower defaults on a mortgage payment, which is the event triggering a potential future claim payment by us, the reporting of the default to us, the acquisition of the property by the lender (typically through foreclosure) or the sale of the property with our approval, and the eventual payment of the claim related to the uncured default or a rescission. To recognize the estimated liability for losses related to outstanding reported defaults, or default inventory, we establish loss reserves. Loss reserves are established by estimating the number of loans in our default inventory that will result in a claim payment, which is referred to as the claim rate, and further estimating the amount of the claim payment, which is referred to as claim severity. Our loss reserve estimates are established based upon historical experience, including rescission activity. In accordance with GAAP for the mortgage insurance industry, we generally do not establish loss reserves for future claims on insured loans that are not currently in default. 

We also establish reserves to provide for the estimated costs of settling claims, general expenses of administering the claims settlement process, legal fees and other fees (&#8220;loss adjustment expenses&#8221;), and for losses and loss adjustment expenses from defaults that have occurred, but which have not yet been reported to us. 

Our reserving process bases our estimates of future events on our past experience. However, estimation of loss reserves is inherently judgmental and conditions that have affected the development of the loss reserves in the past may not necessarily affect development patterns in the future, in either a similar manner or degree. For further information, see our risk factors in Item 1A, including the ones titled &#8220;Because we establish loss reserves only upon a loan default rather than based on estimates of our ultimate losses on risk in force, losses may have a disproportionate adverse effect on our earnings in certain periods,&#8221; and &#8220;Because loss reserve estimates are subject to uncertainties, paid claims may be substantially different than our loss reserves.&#8221; 

Our losses incurred from our risk in force have declined in recent years in part due to the improving economy and the run-off of the insurance policies we wrote before the financial crisis, both of which resulted in fewer defaulted loans, as well as an improved cure rate on defaulted loans. Our losses incurred were $343.5 million in 2015, compared to $496.1 million in 2014 and $838.7 million in 2013. Rescissions had no significant impact on our losses incurred in 2013 through 2015. 

After our reserves are initially established, we perform premium deficiency tests using best estimate assumptions as of the testing date. We establish a premium deficiency reserve, if necessary, when the present value of expected future losses and expenses exceeds the present value of expected future premiums and already established reserves. In the fourth quarter of 2007, we recorded a premium deficiency reserve of $1.2 billion relating to Wall Street bulk transactions remaining in our insurance in force. That premium deficiency reserve was eliminated in the second quarter of 2015. 

C. Investment Portfolio 

Policy and Strategy 

At December 31, 2015, the fair value of our investment portfolio was approximately $4.7 billion. In addition, at December 31, 2015, our total assets included approximately $181 million of cash and cash equivalents. At December 31, 2015, of our portfolio plus cash and cash equivalents, approximately $402 million was held by our parent company and the remainder was held by our subsidiaries, primarily MGIC. 

As of December 31, 2015, approximately 71% of our investment portfolio (excluding cash and cash equivalents) was managed by Wellington Management Company, LLP, although we maintain overall control of investment policy and strategy. We maintain direct management of the remainder of our investment portfolio. Unless otherwise indicated, the remainder of the discussion regarding our investment portfolio refers to our investment portfolio only and not to cash and cash equivalents. 

Our current investment policy emphasizes preservation of capital. Therefore, our investment portfolio consists almost entirely of high-quality, investment grade, fixed maturity securities. Our investment portfolio strategy encompasses tax efficiency. The mix of tax-exempt municipal securities in our investment portfolio will increase with sustained profitability of the company. The goal is maintain or grow net investment income through a combination of investment income and tax advantages. Also, our investment policies and strategies are subject to change depending upon regulatory, economic and market conditions and our existing or anticipated financial condition and operating requirements. 

Our investment policies in effect at December 31, 2015 limit investments in the securities of a single issuer, other than the U.S. government, and generally limit the purchase of fixed maturity securities to those that are rated investment grade by at least one rating agency. They also limit the amount of investment in foreign governments and foreign domiciled securities and in any individual foreign country. The aggregate market value of the holdings of a single obligor, or type of investment, as applicable, is limited to:

D. Regulation 

Direct Regulation 

We are subject to comprehensive, detailed regulation by state insurance departments. These regulations are principally designed for the protection of our insured policyholders, rather than for the benefit of investors. Although their scope varies, state insurance laws generally grant broad supervisory powers to agencies or officials to examine insurance companies and enforce rules or exercise discretion affecting almost every significant aspect of the insurance business. Given the recent significant losses incurred by many insurers in the mortgage and financial guaranty industries, our insurance subsidiaries have been subject to heightened scrutiny by insurance regulators. 

In general, regulation of our subsidiaries&#8217; business relates to: 

&#8226; licenses to transact business; 

&#8226; policy forms; 

&#8226; premium rates; 

&#8226; insurable loans; 

&#8226; annual and other reports on financial condition; 

&#8226; the basis upon which assets and liabilities must be stated; 

&#8226; requirements regarding contingency reserves equal to 50% of premiums earned; 

&#8226; minimum capital levels and adequacy ratios; 

&#8226; reinsurance requirements; 

&#8226; limitations on the types of investment instruments which may be held in an investment portfolio; 

&#8226; the size of risks and limits on coverage of individual risks which may be insured; 

&#8226; deposits of securities; 

&#8226; transactions among affiliates; 

&#8226; limits on dividends payable; and 

&#8226; claims handling. 

The insurance laws of 16 jurisdictions, including Wisconsin, our domiciliary state, require a mortgage insurer to maintain a minimum amount of statutory capital relative to the risk in force (or a similar measure) in order for the mortgage insurer to continue to write new business. We refer to these requirements as the &#8220;State Capital Requirements.&#8221; While they vary among jurisdictions, currently the most common State Capital Requirements allow for a maximum risk-to-capital ratio of 25 to 1. Wisconsin does not regulate capital by using a risk-to-capital measure but instead requires a minimum policyholder position (&#8220;MPP&#8221;). The 

&#8220;policyholder position&#8221; of a mortgage insurer is its net worth or surplus, contingency reserve and a portion of the reserves for unearned premiums. 

During part of 2012 and 2013, MGIC&#8217;s risk-to-capital ratio exceeded 25 to 1. We funded MIC, a direct subsidiary of MGIC, to write new business in jurisdictions where MGIC no longer met, and was not able to obtain a waiver of, the State Capital Requirements. In the third quarter of 2012, we began writing new mortgage insurance in MIC in those jurisdictions. In 2013, our holding company issued additional equity and convertible debt securities and transferred $800 million to increase MGIC&#8217;s capital. As a result, later in 2013, MGIC was again able to write new business in all jurisdictions and MIC suspended writing new business. In 2015, much of MIC's capital was repatriated to MGIC. At December 31, 2015, MGIC&#8217;s risk-to-capital ratio was 12.1 to 1, below the maximum allowed by the jurisdictions with State Capital Requirements, and its policyholder position was $1.2 billion above the required MPP of $1.1 billion. 

The NAIC previously announced that it plans to revise the minimum capital and surplus requirements for mortgage insurers that are provided for in its Mortgage Guaranty Insurance Model Act. A working group of state regulators is drafting the revisions, although no date has been established by which the NAIC must propose revisions to such requirements. Depending on the scope of revisions made by the NAIC, MGIC may be prevented from writing new business in the jurisdictions adopting such revisions. 

See our risk factors &#8220;We may not continue to meet the GSEs&#8217; mortgage insurer eligibility requirements and our returns may decrease as we are required to maintain significantly more capital in order to maintain our eligibility&#8221; and &#8220;State Capital requirements may prevent us from continuing to write new insurance on an uninterrupted basis&#8221; in Item 1A, for information about regulations governing our capital adequacy and our expectations regarding our future capital position. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis &#8211; Liquidity and Capital Resources &#8211; Capital" in Item 7 for information about our current capital position. 

Most states also regulate transactions between insurance companies and their parents or affiliates and have restrictions on transactions that have the effect of inducing lenders to place business with the insurer. For a description of limits on dividends payable to us from MGIC, see &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis &#8211; Liquidity and Capital Resources&#8221; in Item 7 and Note 16 &#8211; &#8220;Dividend restrictions,&#8221; to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8. 

Mortgage insurance premium rates are also subject to state regulation to protect policyholders against the adverse effects of excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory rates and to encourage competition in the insurance marketplace. Any increase in premium rates must be justified, generally on the basis of the insurer&#8217;s loss experience, expenses and future trend analysis. The general mortgage default experience may also be considered. Premium rates are subject to review and challenge by state regulators. 

We are required to establish statutory accounting contingency loss reserves in an amount equal to 50% of net earned premiums. These amounts cannot be withdrawn for a period of 10 years, except as permitted by insurance regulations. With regulatory approval a mortgage guaranty insurance company may make early withdrawals from the contingency reserve when incurred losses exceed 35% of net premiums earned in a calendar year. For further information, see Note 17 &#8211; &#8220;Capital Requirements,&#8221; to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8. 

Mortgage insurers are generally single-line companies, restricted to writing residential mortgage insurance business only. Although we, as an insurance holding company, are prohibited from engaging in certain transactions with MGIC, MIC or our other insurance subsidiaries without submission to and, in some instances, prior approval by applicable insurance departments, we are not subject to insurance company regulation on our non-insurance businesses. 

Wisconsin&#8217;s insurance regulations generally provide that no person may acquire control of us unless the transaction in which control is acquired has been approved by the Office of the Commissioner of the State of Wisconsin (the &#8220;OCI&#8221;). The regulations provide for a rebuttable presumption of control when a person owns or has the right to vote more than 10% of the voting securities. In addition, the insurance regulations of other states in which MGIC is licensed require notification to the state&#8217;s insurance department a specified time before a person acquires control of us. If regulators in these states disapprove the change of control, our licenses to conduct business in the disapproving states could be terminated. For further information about regulatory proceedings applicable to us and our industry, see &#8220;We are involved in legal proceedings and are &#160; subject to the risk of additional legal proceedings in the future&#8221; in Item 1A. 

The CFPB was established by the Dodd-Frank Act to regulate the offering and provision of consumer financial products or services under federal law. The CFPB&#8217;s 2014 rules implementing laws that require mortgage lenders to make ability-to-pay determinations prior to extending credit affected the characteristics of loans being originated and the volume of loans available to be insured. We are uncertain whether the CFPB will issue any other rules or regulations that affect our business apart from any action it may take as a result of its investigation of captive mortgage reinsurance. Such rules and regulations could have a material adverse effect on us. 

As the most significant purchasers and sellers of conventional mortgage loans and beneficiaries of private mortgage insurance, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae impose financial and other requirements on private mortgage insurers in order for them to be eligible to insure loans sold to the GSEs (these requirements are referred to as the "PMIERs", as discussed above). These requirements are subject to change from time to time. Based on our interpretation of the financial requirements of the PMIERs, as of December 31, 2015, MGIC&#8217;s preliminary Available Assets are $5.0 billion and its preliminary Minimum Required Assets are $4.5 billion; and MGIC is in compliance with the financial requirements of the PMIERs and eligible to insure loans purchased by the GSEs. For information about the possible reduction in Available Assets in connection with the first quarter 2016 purchase by MGIC of a portion of our outstanding 9% Convertible Junior Subordinated Debentures, see "Management's Discussion and Analysis &#8211; Debt at Our Holding Company and Holding Company Capital Resources" in Item 7. If MGIC ceases to be eligible to insure loans purchased by one or both of the GSEs, it would significantly reduce the volume of our new business writings. For information about matters that could be negatively affect our compliance with the PMIERs, see our risk factor titled &#8220;We may not continue to meet the GSEs&#8217; mortgage insurer eligibility requirements and our returns may decrease as we are required to maintain significantly more capital in order to maintain our eligibility&#8221; in Item 1A. 

The FHFA is the conservator of the GSEs and has the authority to control and direct their operations. The increased role that the federal government has assumed in the residential mortgage market through the GSE conservatorship may increase the likelihood that the business practices of the GSEs change in ways that have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, these factors may increase the likelihood that the charters of the GSEs are changed by new federal legislation. The Dodd-Frank Act required the U.S. Department of the Treasury to report its recommendations regarding options for ending the conservatorship of the GSEs. This report was released in February 2011 and while it does not provide any definitive timeline for GSE reform, it does recommend using a combination of federal housing policy changes to wind down the GSEs, shrink the government&#8217;s footprint in housing finance (including FHA insurance), and help bring private capital back to the mortgage market. Since then members of Congress introduced several bills intended to scale back the GSEs; however, no legislation has been enacted. As a result of the matters referred to above, it is uncertain what role the GSEs, FHA and private capital, including private mortgage insurance, will play in the domestic residential housing finance system in the future or the impact of any such changes on our business. In addition, the timing of the impact of any resulting changes on our business is uncertain. Most meaningful changes would require Congressional action to implement and it is difficult to estimate when Congressional action would be final and how long any associated phase-in period may last. For additional information about the potential impact that any such changes in the GSE&#8217;s roles may have on us, see the risk factor titled &#8220;Changes in the business practices of the GSEs, federal legislation that changes their charters or a restructuring of the GSEs could reduce our revenues or increase our losses&#8221; in Item 1A. 

In December 2013, the U.S. Treasury Department&#8217;s Federal Insurance Office released a report that calls for federal standards and oversight for mortgage insurers to be developed and implemented. It is uncertain what form the standards and oversight will take and when and if they will become effective. 

Indirect Regulation 

We are also indirectly, but significantly, impacted by regulations affecting purchasers of mortgage loans, such as Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, and regulations affecting governmental insurers, such as the FHA and the VA, and lenders. See our risk factor titled &#8220;Changes in the business practices of the GSEs, federal legislation that changes their charters or a restructuring of the GSEs could reduce our revenues or increase our losses&#8221; in Item 1A for a discussion of how potential changes in the GSEs&#8217; business practices could affect us. Private mortgage insurers, including MGIC, are highly dependent upon federal housing legislation and other laws and regulations to the extent they affect the demand for private mortgage insurance and the housing market generally. From time to time, those laws and regulations have been amended to affect competition from government agencies. Proposals are discussed from time to time by Congress and certain federal agencies to reform or modify the FHA and the Government National Mortgage Association, which securitizes mortgages insured by the FHA. 

Subject to certain exceptions, in general, RESPA prohibits any person from giving or receiving any &#8220;thing of value&#8221; pursuant to an agreement or understanding to refer settlement services. For additional information, see our risk factor titled &#8220;We are involved in legal proceedings and are &#160; subject to the risk of additional legal proceedings in the future&#8221; in Item 1A. 

The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Reserve Board, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation have uniform guidelines on real estate lending by insured lending institutions under their supervision. The guidelines specify that a residential mortgage loan originated with a loan-to-value ratio of 90% or greater should have appropriate credit enhancement in the form of mortgage insurance or readily marketable collateral, although no depth of coverage percentage is specified in the guidelines. 

Lenders are subject to various laws, including the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Community Reinvestment Act and the Fair Housing Act, and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are subject to various laws, including laws relating to government sponsored enterprises, which may impose obligations or create incentives for increased lending to low and moderate income persons, or in targeted areas. 

There can be no assurance that other federal laws and regulations affecting these institutions and entities will not change, or that new legislation or regulations will not be adopted which will adversely affect the private mortgage insurance industry. In this regard, see the risk factor titled &#8220;Changes in the business practices of the GSEs, federal legislation that changes their charters or a restructuring of the GSEs could reduce our revenues or increase our losses&#8221; in Item 1A. 

E. Employees 

At December 31, 2015, we had approximately 800 full- and part-time employees, of whom approximately 33% were assigned to our field offices. The number of employees given above does not include &#8220;on-call&#8221; employees. The number of &#8220;on-call&#8221; employees can vary substantially, primarily as a result of changes in demand for contract underwriting services. In recent years, the number of &#8220;on-call&#8221; employees has ranged from fewer than 70 to more than 220.
