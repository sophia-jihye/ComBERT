&#160;

Our Services 

&#160; 

Rennova is a healthcare enterprise that delivers products and services including laboratory diagnostics, healthcare technology solutions, and revenue cycle management and intends to provide financial services, to medical providers. 

&#160;

Its principal line of business to date is clinical laboratory blood and urine testing services, with a particular emphasis in the provision of urine drug toxicology testing to physicians, clinics and rehabilitation facilities in the United States. Testing services to rehabilitation facilities represented over 90% of the Company&#8217;s revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. Rennova understands the challenges faced by today&#8217;s healthcare providers to adopt paper free and interoperable systems and in response to market demand for solutions, has responded strategically by expanding our offering of services to include a full suite of clinical laboratory services. The drug and alcohol rehabilitation and pain management sectors provide an existing and sizable target market, where the need for our services already exists and opportunity is being created by a continued secular growth and need for compliance.

&#160;

We have recently added genetic testing, specifically pharmacogenetic testing, to our menu of services. Genetic testing represents the most rapidly expanding segment of the diagnostics market worldwide. Growing incidence of genetic diseases present new opportunities for genetic testing. The global market for genetic testing is forecast to reach $2.2 billion by 2017. Increasing knowledge about the potential benefits of genetic testing is one of the prime reasons for the growth of the market. Advancements in the genetic testing space, an aging population and a subsequent rise in the number of chronic diseases, and increasing incidence of cancer cases are the other factors propelling growth in the genetic testing market. 

&#160; 

Primary revenue generating activity in this market revolves around DNA profiling aimed at better understanding the predisposition for diseases and possible adverse reactions that may occur with available and/or under clinical development, drugs. Rising importance of early infection detection and prevention together with growing demand of DNA tests in pharmacogenomics or cancer genetic testing is a significant factor responsible for the anticipated growth.

&#160;

Competition 

&#160; 

The Company competes in a fragmented industry split between independently-owned and physician-owned laboratories. There are three predominant players in the industry that operate as full-service clinical laboratories (processing blood, urine and other tissue). In addition, the competition ranges from smaller privately-owned laboratories (3-6 employees) to large publicly-traded laboratories with significant market capitalizations.

&#160;

&#160; 5 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Governmental Regulation 

&#160; 

General 

&#160; 

The clinical laboratory industry is subject to significant governmental laws and regulations at the federal, state and local levels. As described below, these laws and regulations concern licensure and operation of clinical laboratories, claim submission and payment for laboratory services, health care fraud and abuse, security, privacy and confidentiality of health information, quality and environmental and occupational safety.

&#160;

Regulation of Clinical Laboratories 

&#160;

The Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (&#8220;CLIA&#8221;) are regulations that include federal standards applicable to all U.S. facilities or sites that test human specimens for health assessment or to diagnose, prevent, or treat disease. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (&#8220;CDC&#8221;), in partnership with the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (&#8220;CMS&#8221;) and the Food and Drug Administration (&#8220;FDA&#8221;) , supports the CLIA program and clinical laboratory quality. CLIA requires that all clinical laboratories meet quality assurance, quality control and personnel standards. Laboratories also must undergo proficiency testing and are subject to inspections.

&#160;

Standards for testing under CLIA are based on the complexity of the tests performed by the laboratory, with tests classified as &#8220;high complexity,&#8221; &#8220;moderate complexity,&#8221; or &#8220;waived.&#8221; Laboratories performing high complexity testing are required to meet more stringent requirements than moderate complexity laboratories. Laboratories performing only waived tests, which are tests determined by the FDA to have a low potential for error and requiring little oversight, may apply for a certificate of waiver exempting them from most of the requirements of CLIA. All Company facilities hold CLIA certificates to perform high complexity testing. The sanctions for failure to comply with CLIA requirements include suspension, revocation or limitation of a laboratory's CLIA certificate, which is necessary to conduct business, cancellation or suspension of the laboratory's approval to receive Medicare and/or Medicaid reimbursement, as well as significant fines and/or criminal penalties. The loss or suspension of a CLIA certification, imposition of a fine or other penalties, or future changes in the CLIA law or regulations (or interpretation of the law or regulations) could have a material adverse effect on the Company.

&#160;

In addition to compliance with the federal regulations, the Company is also subject to state and local laboratory regulation. CLIA provides that a state may adopt laboratory regulations different from or more stringent than those contained in Federal law. There are approximately 23 states with state licensure or permit requirements for an independent lab facility physically located within the state. State laws may require that laboratory personnel meet certain qualifications, specify certain quality controls, or require maintenance of certain records. There are, for example, 16 states (including California and Florida) that have even more stringent requirements with which lab personnel must comply to obtain state licensure or a certificate of qualification.

&#160;

The Company believes that it is in compliance with all applicable laboratory requirements. The Company's laboratories have continuing programs to ensure that their operations meet all such regulatory requirements, but no assurances can be given that the Company's laboratories will pass all future licensure or certification inspections. The Company has implemented the position of Chief Compliance Officer with supporting staff, including staff specifically for licensing, credentialing and certification inspection purposes. We embrace compliance as an integral part of our culture and we consistently promote that culture of ethics and integrity.

&#160;

The FDA has regulatory responsibility over instruments, test kits, reagents and other devices used by clinical laboratories. The FDA has issued draft guidance regarding FDA regulation of laboratory-developed tests. There are many pending regulatory and legislative proposals that would increase general FDA oversight of clinical laboratories and laboratory-developed tests. The outcome and ultimate impact of such proposals on the business is difficult to predict at this time. Our point of collection testing devices are regulated by the FDA. The FDA has authority to take various administrative and legal actions for non-compliance, such as fines, product suspension, warning letters, injunctions and other civil and criminal sanctions. We make every good faith effort to exercise proactive monitoring and review of pending legislation and regulatory action.

&#160;

Payment for Clinical Laboratory Services 

&#160;

In each of 2015 and 2014, the Company derived less than 10% of its net sales directly from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. In addition, the Company's other business depends significantly on continued participation in these programs and in other government healthcare programs, in part because clients often want a single laboratory to perform all of their testing services. In recent years, both governmental and private sector payers have made efforts to contain or reduce health care costs, including reducing reimbursement for clinical laboratory services.

&#160;

Reimbursement under the Medicare program for clinical diagnostic laboratory services is subject to a clinical laboratory fee schedule that sets the maximum amount payable in each Medicare carrier's jurisdiction. This clinical laboratory fee schedule is updated annually. Laboratories bill the program directly for covered tests performed on behalf of Medicare beneficiaries. State Medicaid programs are prohibited from paying more than the Medicare fee schedule limit for clinical laboratory services furnished to Medicaid recipients.

&#160;

&#160; 6 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Payment under the Medicare fee schedule has been limited from year to year by Congressional action, including imposition of national limitation amounts and freezes on the otherwise applicable annual Consumer Price Index (&#8220;CPI&#8221;) updates. For most diagnostic lab tests, the national limitation is now 74.0% of the national median of all local fee schedules established for each test. Under a provision of the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Benefits Improvement and Protection Act of 2000 (&#8220;BIPA&#8221;), for tests performed after January 1, 2001 that the Secretary of Health and Human Services determines are new tests for which no limitation amount has previously been established, the cap is set at 100% of the median.

&#160;

Medicare, Medicaid and other government program payment reductions will not currently have a direct adverse effect on the Company's net earnings and cash flows, due to insignificant revenue earned, however, it is not currently possible to project what impact will be had in future years.

&#160;

In addition to reimbursement rates, the Company is also impacted by changes in coverage policies for laboratory tests. Congressional action in 1997 required the Department of Health and Human Services (&#8220;HHS&#8221;) to adopt uniform coverage, administration and payment policies for many of the most commonly performed lab tests using a negotiated rulemaking process. The negotiated rulemaking committee established uniform policies limiting Medicare coverage for certain tests to patients with specified medical conditions or diagnoses, replacing local Medicare coverage policies which varied around the country. The final rules generally became effective in 2002, and the use of uniform policies improves the Company's ability to obtain necessary billing information in some cases, but Medicare, Medicaid and private payer diagnosis code requirements continue to negatively impact the Company's ability to be paid for some of the tests it performs. Due to the range of payers and policies, the extent of this impact continues to be difficult to quantify.

&#160;

Future changes in federal, state and local laws and regulations (or in the interpretation of current regulations) affecting government payment for clinical laboratory testing could have a material adverse effect on the Company. In March 2010, comprehensive healthcare legislation, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (&#8220;ACA&#8221;), was enacted. Based on currently available information, the Company is unable to predict what type of changes in legislation or regulations, if any, will occur.

&#160;

Standard Electronic Transactions, Security and Confidentiality of Health Information and Other Personal Information 

&#160;

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (&#8220;HIPAA&#8221;) was designed to address issues related to the security and confidentiality of health insurance information. In an effort to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the health care system by facilitating the electronic exchange of information in certain financial and administrative transactions, HIPAA regulations were promulgated. These regulations apply to health plans, health care providers that conduct standard transactions electronically and health care clearinghouses (&#8220;covered entities&#8221;). Five such regulations have been finalized: (i) the Transactions and Code Sets Rule; (ii) the Privacy Rule; (iii) the Security Rule; (iv) the Standard Unique Employer Identifier Rule, which requires the use of a unique employer identifier in connection with certain electronic transactions; and (v) the National Provider Identifier Rule, which requires the use of a unique health care provider identifier in connection with certain electronic transactions.

&#160;

The Privacy Rule regulates the use and disclosure of protected health information (&#8220;PHI&#8221;) by covered entities. It also sets forth certain rights that an individual has with respect to his or her PHI maintained by a covered entity, such as the right to access or amend certain records containing PHI or to request restrictions on the use or disclosure of PHI. The Privacy Rule requires covered entities to contractually bind third parties, known as business associates, in the event that they perform an activity or service for or on behalf of the covered entity that involves access to PHI. The Security Rule establishes requirements for safeguarding patient information that is electronically transmitted or electronically stored. The Company believes that it is in compliance in all material respects with the requirements of the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules.

&#160;

The Federal Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (&#8220;HITECH&#8221;), which was enacted in February 2009, strengthens and expands the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules and their restrictions on use and disclosure of PHI. HITECH includes, but is not limited to, prohibitions on exchanging patient identifiable health information for remuneration, and additional restrictions on the use of PHI for marketing. HITECH also fundamentally changes a business associate's obligations by imposing a number of Privacy Rule requirements and a majority of Security Rule provisions directly on business associates that were previously only directly applicable to covered entities. Moreover, HITECH requires covered entities to provide notice to individuals, HHS, and, as applicable, the media when unsecured protected health information is breached, as that term is defined by HITECH. Business associates are similarly required to notify covered entities of a breach.

&#160;

The omnibus HIPAA regulation implementing most of the HITECH provisions was issued in January 2013 and made significant changes to the HIPAA Privacy, Security, Enforcement, and Breach Notification Rules. Compliance with most of the changes became required on September 23, 2013. The Company believes its policies and procedures are fully compliant with the HITECH requirements.

&#160;

On February 6, 2014, the CMS and HHS published final regulations that amended the HIPAA Privacy Rule to provide individuals (or their personal representatives) with the right to receive copies of their test reports from laboratories subject to HIPAA, or to request that copies of their test reports be transmitted to designated third parties. Previously, laboratories that were CLIA-certified or CLIA-exempt were not subject to the provision in the Privacy Rule that provides individuals with the right of access to PHI. The HIPAA Privacy Rule amendment resulted in the preemption of a number of state laws that prohibit a laboratory from releasing a test report directly to the individual. The Company revised its policies and procedures to comply with these new access requirements and has updated its privacy notice to reflect individuals' new access rights under this final rule.

&#160;

&#160; 7 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

The standard unique employer identifier regulations require that employers have standard national numbers that identify them on standard transactions. The Employer Identification Number, also known as a Federal Tax Identification Number, issued by the Internal Revenue Service, was selected as the identifier for employers and was adopted effective July 30, 2002. The Company believes it is in compliance with these requirements.

&#160;

The administrative simplification provisions of HIPAA mandate the adoption of standard unique identifiers for health care providers. The intent of these provisions is to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the electronic transmission of health information. The National Provider Identification Rule requires that all HIPAA-covered health care providers, whether they are individuals or organizations, must obtain a National Provider Identifier (&#8220;NPI&#8221;) to identify themselves in standard HIPAA transactions. NPI replaces the unique provider identification number - as well as other provider numbers previously assigned by payers and other entities - for the purpose of identifying providers in standard electronic transactions. The Company believes that it is in compliance with the HIPAA National Provider Identification Rule in all material respects.

&#160;

The total cost associated with the requirements of HIPAA and HITECH is not expected to be material to the Company's operations or cash flows. However, future regulations and interpretations of HIPAA and HITECH could impose significant costs on the Company.

&#160;

In addition to the HIPAA regulations described above, there are a number of other Federal and state laws regarding the confidentiality and security of medical information, some of which apply to clinical laboratories. These laws vary widely, but they most commonly restrict the collection, use and disclosure of medical and financial information and other personal information. In some cases, state laws are more restrictive than and therefore not preempted by HIPAA. Penalties for violation of these laws may include sanctions against a laboratory's licensure, as well as civil and/or criminal penalties. Violations of the HIPAA provisions could result in civil and/or criminal penalties, including significant fines and up to 10 years in prison. HITECH also significantly strengthened HIPAA enforcement. It increased the civil penalty amounts that may be imposed, required HHS to conduct periodic audits to confirm compliance and also authorized state attorneys general to bring civil actions seeking either injunctions or damages in response to violations of the HIPAA privacy and security regulations that affect the privacy of state residents. Additionally, numerous other countries have or are developing similar laws governing the collection, use, disclosure and transmission of personal and/or patient information.

&#160;

The Company believes that it is in compliance in all material respects with the current Transactions and Code Sets Rule. The Company implemented Version 5010 of the HIPAA Transaction Standards and believes it has fully adopted the ICD-10-CM code set. The compliance date for ICD-10-CM was October 1, 2015. The costs associated with ICD-10-CM Code Set were substantial, and failure of the Company, third party payers or physicians to apply the new code set could have an adverse impact on reimbursement, day&#8217;s sales outstanding and cash collections. As a result of inconsistent application of transaction standards by payers or the Company's inability to obtain certain billing information not usually provided to the Company by physicians, the Company could face increased costs and complexity, a temporary disruption in receipts and ongoing reductions in reimbursements and net revenues.

&#160;

The Company believes it is in compliance in all material respects with the Operating Rules for electronic funds transfers and remittance advice transactions, for which the compliance date was January 1, 2014.

Fraud and Abuse Laws and Regulations 

&#160;

Existing federal laws governing federal health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, as well as similar state laws, impose a variety of broadly described fraud and abuse prohibitions on health care providers, including clinical laboratories. These laws are interpreted liberally and enforced aggressively by multiple government agencies, including the U.S. Department of Justice, HHS' Office of Inspector General (&#8220;OIG&#8221;), and various state agencies. Historically, the clinical laboratory industry has been the focus of major governmental enforcement initiatives. The federal government's enforcement efforts have been increasing over the past decade, in part as a result of the enactment of HIPAA, which included several provisions related to fraud and abuse enforcement, including the establishment of a program to coordinate and fund federal, state and local law enforcement efforts. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 also included new requirements directed at Medicaid fraud, including increased spending on enforcement and financial incentives for states to adopt false claims act provisions similar to the federal False Claims Act. Recent amendments to the False Claims Act, as well as other enhancements to the federal fraud and abuse laws enacted as part of the ACA, are widely expected to further increase fraud and abuse enforcement efforts. For example, the ACA established an obligation to report and refund overpayments from Medicare within 60 days of identification; failure to comply with this new requirement can give rise to additional liability under the False Claims Act and Civil Monetary Penalties statute. On February 16, 2012, CMS issued a proposed rule to establish regulations addressing the reporting and returning of overpayments. On February 11, 2016, CMS issued the final rule defining when an overpayment is identified and adopted a six year look-back period. The rule is effective 30 days from the publication date.

The federal health care programs&#8217; anti-kickback law (the &#8220;Anti-Kickback Law&#8221;) prohibits knowingly providing anything of value in return for, or to induce the referral of Medicare, Medicaid or other federal health care program business. Violations can result in imprisonment, fines, penalties, and/or exclusion from participation in federal health care programs. The OIG has published &#8220;safe harbor&#8221; regulations which specify certain arrangements that are protected from prosecution under the Anti-Kickback Law if all conditions of the relevant safe harbor are met. Failure to fit within a safe harbor does not necessarily constitute a violation of the Anti-Kickback Law; rather, the arrangement would be subject to scrutiny by regulators and prosecutors and would be evaluated on a case by case basis. Many states have their own Medicaid anti-kickback laws and several states also have anti-kickback laws that apply to all payers (i.e., not just government health care programs).

&#160;

From time to time, the OIG issues alerts and other guidance on certain practices in the health care industry that implicate the Anti-Kickback Law or other federal fraud and abuse laws. Examples of such guidance documents particularly relevant to the Company and its operations follow.

&#160;

In October 1994, the OIG issued a Special Fraud Alert on arrangements for the provision of clinical laboratory services. The Fraud Alert set forth a number of practices allegedly engaged in by some clinical laboratories and health care providers that raise issues under the federal fraud and abuse laws, including the Anti-Kickback Law. These practices include: (i) providing employees to furnish valuable services for physicians (other than collecting patient specimens for testing) that are typically the responsibility of the physicians' staff; (ii) offering certain laboratory services at prices below fair market value in return for referrals of other tests which are billed to Medicare at higher rates; (iii) providing free testing to physicians' managed care patients in situations where the referring physicians benefit from such reduced laboratory utilization; (iv) providing free pick-up and disposal of bio-hazardous waste for physicians for items unrelated to a laboratory's testing services; (v) providing general-use facsimile machines or computers to physicians that are not exclusively used in connection with the laboratory services; and (vi) providing free testing for health care providers, their families and their employees (i.e., so-called &#8220;professional courtesy&#8221; testing). The OIG emphasized in the Special Fraud Alert that when one purpose of such arrangements is to induce referrals of program-reimbursed laboratory testing, both the clinical laboratory and the health care provider (e.g., physician) may be liable under the Anti-Kickback Law, and may be subject to criminal prosecution and exclusion from participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. More recently, in June 2014, the OIG issued another Special Fraud Alert addressing compensation paid by laboratories to referring physicians for blood specimen processing and for submitting patient data to registries. This Special Fraud Alert reiterates the OIG&#8217;s longstanding concerns about payments from laboratories to physicians in excess of the fair value of the physician&#8217;s services and payments that reflect the volume or value of referrals of federal healthcare program business.

&#160;

Another issue the OIG has expressed concern about involves the provision of discounts on laboratory services billed to customers in return for the referral of federal health care program business. In a 1999 Advisory Opinion, the OIG concluded that a proposed arrangement whereby a laboratory would offer physicians significant discounts on non-federal health care program laboratory tests might violate the Anti-Kickback Law. The OIG reasoned that the laboratory could be viewed as providing such discounts to the physician in exchange for referrals by the physician of business to be billed by the laboratory to Medicare at non-discounted rates. The OIG indicated that the arrangement would not qualify for protection under the discount safe harbor to the Anti-Kickback Law because Medicare and Medicaid would not get the benefit of the discount. Similarly, in a 1999 correspondence, the OIG stated that if any direct or indirect link exists between a discounts that a laboratory offers to a skilled nursing facility (&#8220;SNF&#8221;) for tests covered under Medicare's payments to the SNF and the referral of tests billable by the laboratory under Medicare Part B, then the Anti-Kickback Law would be implicated.

&#160;

The OIG also has issued guidance regarding joint venture arrangements that may be viewed as suspect under the Anti-Kickback Law. These documents have relevance to clinical laboratories that are part of (or are considering establishing) joint ventures with potential sources of federal health care program business. The first guidance document, which focused on investor referrals to such ventures, was issued in 1989 and another concerning contractual joint ventures was issued in April 2003. Some of the elements of joint ventures that the OIG identified as &#8220;suspect&#8221; include: arrangements in which the capital invested by the physicians is disproportionately small and the return on investment is disproportionately large when compared to a typical investment; specific selection of investors who are in a position to make referrals to the venture; and arrangements in which one of the parties to the joint venture expands into a line of business that is dependent on referrals from the other party (sometimes called &#8220;shell&#8221; joint ventures). In a 2004 advisory opinion, the OIG expressed concern about a proposed joint venture in which a laboratory company would assist physician groups in establishing off-site pathology laboratories. The OIG indicated that the physicians' financial and business risk in the venture was minimal and that the physicians would contract out substantially all laboratory operations, committing very little in the way of financial, capital, or human resources. The OIG was unable to exclude the possibility that the arrangement was designed to permit the laboratory to pay the physician groups for their referrals, and therefore was unwilling to find that the arrangement fell within a safe harbor or had sufficient safeguards to protect against fraud or abuse.

&#160;

Violations of other fraud and abuse laws also can result in exclusion from participation in federal health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. One basis for such exclusion is an individual's or entity's submission of claims to Medicare or Medicaid that are substantially in excess of that individual's or entity&#8217;s usual charges for like items or services. In 2003, the OIG issued a notice of proposed rulemaking that would have defined the terms &#8220;usual charges&#8221; and &#8220;substantially in excess&#8221; in ways that might have required providers, including the Company, to either lower their charges to Medicare and Medicaid or increase charges to certain other payers to avoid the risk of exclusion. On June 18, 2007, however, the OIG withdrew the proposed rule, saying it preferred to continue evaluating billing patterns on a case-by-case basis. In its withdrawal notice, the OIG also said it &#8220;remains concerned about disparities in the amounts charged to Medicare and Medicaid when compared to private payers,&#8221; that it continues to believe its exclusion authority for excess charges &#8220;provides useful backstop protection for the public fisc from providers that routinely charge Medicare or Medicaid substantially more than their other customers,&#8221; and that it will continue to use &#8220;all tools available &#8230; to address instances where Medicare or Medicaid are charged substantially more than other payers.&#8221; The enforcement by Medicaid officials of similar state law restrictions also could have a material adverse effect on the Company.

&#160;

Under another federal statute, known as the &#8220;Stark Law&#8221; or &#8220;self-referral&#8221; prohibition, physicians who have a financial or compensation relationship with a clinical laboratory may not, unless an exception applies, refer Medicare patients for testing to the laboratory, regardless of the intent of the parties. Similarly, laboratories may not bill Medicare for services furnished pursuant to a prohibited self-referral. There are several Stark law exceptions that are relevant to arrangements involving clinical laboratories, including: 1) fair market value compensation for the provision of items or services; 2) payments by physicians to a laboratory for clinical laboratory services; 3) an exception for certain ancillary services (including laboratory services) provided within the referring physician's own office, if certain criteria are satisfied; 4) physician investment in a company whose stock is traded on a public exchange and has stockholder equity exceeding $75.0 million; and 5) certain space and equipment rental arrangements that are set at a fair market value rate and satisfy other requirements. All of the requirements of a Stark Law exception must be met to take advantage of the exception. Many states have their own self-referral laws as well, which in some cases apply to all patient referrals, not just Medicare.

&#160;

There are a variety of other types of federal and state fraud and abuse laws, including laws prohibiting submission of false or fraudulent claims. The Company seeks to conduct its business in compliance with all federal and state fraud and abuse laws. The Company is unable to predict how these laws will be applied in the future, and no assurances can be given that its arrangements will not be subject to scrutiny under such laws. Sanctions for violations of these laws may include exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal health care programs, significant criminal and civil fines and penalties, and loss of licensure. Any exclusion from participation in a federal or state health care program, or any loss of licensure, arising from any action by any federal or state regulatory or enforcement authority, would likely have a material adverse effect on the Company's business. In addition, any significant criminal or civil penalty resulting from such proceedings could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business.

&#160;

Environmental, Health and Safety 

&#160;

The Company is subject to licensing and regulation under federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and human health and safety and laws and regulations relating to the handling, transportation and disposal of medical specimens, infectious and hazardous waste and radioactive materials. All Company laboratories are subject to applicable federal and state laws and regulations relating to biohazard disposal of all laboratory specimens and the Company generally utilizes outside vendors for disposal of such specimens. In addition, the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (&#8220;OSHA&#8221;) has established extensive requirements relating to workplace safety for health care employers, including clinical laboratories, whose workers may be exposed to blood-borne pathogens such as HIV and the hepatitis B virus. These regulations, among other things, require work practice controls, protective clothing and equipment, training, medical follow-up, vaccinations and other measures designed to minimize exposure to, and transmission of, blood-borne pathogens.

&#160;

On November 6, 2000, Congress passed the Needle Stick Safety and Prevention Act, which required, among other things, that companies include in their safety programs the evaluation and use of engineering controls such as safety needles if found to be effective at reducing the risk of needle stick injuries in the workplace. The Company has implemented the use of safety needles at all of its service locations, where applicable.

&#160;

Although the Company is not aware of any current material non-compliance with such federal, state and local laws and regulations, failure to comply could subject the Company to denial of the right to conduct business, fines, criminal penalties and/or other enforcement actions.

&#160;

Drug Testing 

&#160;

There is no comprehensive federal law that regulates drug testing in the private sector. The Drug-Free Workplace Act does impose certain employee education requirements on companies that do business with the government, but it does not require testing, nor does it restrict testing in any way. Drug testing is allowed under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) because the ADA does not consider drug abuse a disability -- but the law does not regulate or prohibit testing. Instead of a comprehensive regulatory system, federal law provides for specific agencies to adopt drug testing regulations for employers under their jurisdiction. As a general rule, testing is presumed to be lawful unless there is a specific restriction in state or federal law.

Controlled Substances 

&#160;

The use of controlled substances in testing for drugs of abuse is regulated by the Federal Drug Enforcement Administration.

&#160;

Compliance Program 

&#160;

The Company continuously evaluates and monitors its compliance with all Medicare, Medicaid and other rules and regulations. The objective of the Company's compliance program is to develop, implement, and update compliance safeguards as necessary. Emphasis is placed on developing compliance policies and guidelines, personnel training programs and various monitoring and audit procedures to attempt to achieve implementation of all applicable rules and regulations.

&#160;

The Company seeks to conduct its business in compliance with all statutes, regulations, and other requirements applicable to its clinical laboratory operations. The clinical laboratory testing industry is, however, subject to extensive regulation, and many of these statutes and regulations have not been interpreted by the courts. There can be no assurance that applicable statutes and regulations will not be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that would adversely affect the Company. Potential sanctions for violation of these statutes and regulations include significant fines and the loss of various licenses, certificates, and authorizations, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business.

&#160;
