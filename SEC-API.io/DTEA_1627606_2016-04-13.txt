&#160; 

&#183;

&#160; 

&#183;

&#160; 

Our Company 

&#160; 

DAVIDsTEA is a fast-growing branded retailer of specialty tea, offering a differentiated selection of proprietary loose-leaf teas, pre-packaged teas, tea sachets and tea-related gifts, accessories and food and beverages primarily through 193 company-operated DAVIDsTEA stores as of January 30, 2016, and our website, davidstea.com. We are building a brand that seeks to expand the definition of tea with innovative products that consumers can explore in an open and inviting retail environment. Our mission is to infuse people&#8217;s lives with joy. Our passion for and knowledge of tea permeates our culture and is rooted in an excitement to explore the taste, health and lifestyle elements of tea. 

&#160; 

We strive to make tea a multi &#8209;sensory experience by facilitating interaction with our products through education and sampling so that our customers appreciate the compelling attributes of tea as well as the ease of preparation. We design our stores with a modern and simple aesthetic that, coupled with our teal &#8209;colored logo, create an inviting atmosphere and stand in stark contrast to common perceptions of tea as a more traditional product. Our in &#8209;store &#8220;Tea Guides&#8221; help novice and experienced tea drinkers alike select from the approximately 150 premium teas and tea blends featured on our &#8220;Tea Wall,&#8221; which is the focal point of our stores. We replicate our store experience online by engaging users with rich content that allows them to easily explore their options amongst our many tea and tea &#8209;related offerings. 

&#160; 

We sell a majority of our products primarily through our company-operated retail stores and e-commerce site, giving us control of the presentation of our brand as well as greater interaction with the customer, which increases our pace of innovation. We have a dedicated and highly experienced product development team that is constantly creating new tea blends using high &#8209;quality ingredients from around the world. We bring newness and capitalize on our product development capabilities with approximately 75 new tea blends each year that we rotate into our offering on a continuous basis. We also focus on product innovation in our pre-packaged teas, tea sachets and tea-related gifts, accessories and food and beverages, providing our customers with fun, inventive and more convenient ways to enjoy tea. We believe that our product development platform and level of innovation have helped us earn a strong and loyal customer following that is passionate about DAVIDsTEA. 

&#160; 

The strong performance of our stores across geographies demonstrates the appeal of our brand and underscores our growth opportunity. With our success in Canada and over five years of experience in U.S. markets, we believe we are well positioned to take advantage of the significant growth opportunity across North America. Consistent with our stores, davidstea.com features our innovative products while offering expertise, community and numerous tools to aid the discovery and exploration of tea. During Fiscal 2015, approximately 66% of our revenue was driven by the sale of loose &#8209;leaf teas, pre-packaged teas, tea sachets and tea &#8209;related gifts that consumers enjoy at home, on &#8209;the &#8209;go or at work. The balance of our revenue was driven by tea accessories, 24%, and food and beverages, 10%. See note 23 to our consolidated financial statements for information regarding our revenues by product category for each of the past three fiscal years. 

&#160; 

We believe our business model is based on innovation, quality and the customer experience. These attributes have resulted in strong financial results, as evidenced by the following: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Twenty &#8209;six consecutive quarters of positive comparable sales growth through the end of Fiscal 2015. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Our comparable store sales increased by 6.6% in Fiscal 2015, 11.1% in Fiscal 2014 and 17.8% in Fiscal 2013. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#183; 

The growth of our store base from 70 stores in Fiscal 2011 to 193 stores in Fiscal 2015, representing a 22% compound annual growth rate. As of January 30, 2016, we had a net total of 39 more stores or approximately 25% more than in Fiscal 2014. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

An increase in sales from $41.9 million in Fiscal 2011 to $180.7 million in Fiscal 2015. Sales in Fiscal 2015 were approximately 27.3% higher than in Fiscal 2014. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Growth of our Adjusted EBITDA from $14.2 million in Fiscal 2013 to $24.6 million in Fiscal 2015. 

&#160; 

Our Market and Competition 

&#160; 

We participate in the large and growing global tea market which, combined with the relatively low percentage of tea sales in North America, make our market opportunity highly attractive. 

&#160; 

The Canadian and U.S. tea markets are highly fragmented. We compete with a large number of relatively small independently-owned tea retailers and a number of regional and national tea retailers, as well as retailers of grocery products, including loose &#8209;leaf teas, tea sachets and tea-related beverages. We also compete with other vendors of loose &#8209;leaf teas, tea sachets and ready &#8209;to &#8209;drink teas, such as club stores, wholesalers and Internet suppliers, as well as with houseware retailers and suppliers that offer teawares and related accessories. As we continue to expand geographically, we expect to encounter additional regional and local competitors. 

&#160; 

We believe we differentiate ourselves from our competitors on the basis of our distinct retail experience, the broad demographic appeal of our brand, innovative tea products, the effectiveness of our grassroots marketing strategy, our versatile store economics and our passionate customer-focused culture supported by our experienced management team and dedicated board members. 

&#160; 

We believe that our brand, passion for tea and breadth of offering encourage our customers to view tea as fresh and fun. The clean, modern aesthetic of our retail concept communicates the newness and innovation behind our brand. The DAVIDsTEA retail experience is led by our Tea Guides, who share our knowledge of tea through a highly interactive and immersive customer experience of sampling and educating. They show our customers that tea is easy to prepare, comes in a variety of great flavors and is suitable for multiple occasions. It is this customer interaction combined with the high &#8209;quality teas that has allowed us to develop strong customer loyalty. 

&#160; 

We believe that our fresh approach to tea gives us a broad, multi &#8209;generational appeal and, coupled with several key consumer trends such as health and wellness, will help support our long &#8209;term growth. We focus on constant innovation to improve the taste and presentation of our existing teas and tea blends while creating new offerings that delight our customers. We seek to develop creative tea-related gifts and accessories that are innovative and make steeping tea easy at home or on &#8209;the &#8209;go. We believe that our focus on innovation and design keeps existing customers engaged while also attracting new customers to our brand. 

&#160; 

We believe our field &#8209;based marketing and social media approach build brand awareness and drive customers to our stores and our e-commerce site. One aspect of this effort is our events sponsorship group, which we believe is a differentiated capability that allows us to create excitement for our brand by engaging directly in the communities around our stores and drive store visits by offering product. 

&#160; 

Our stores have been successful in a variety of geographic regions, population densities and real estate venues and we believe the strong results we continue to experience in North America underscore our growth opportunity. The success of our stores with consumers is underscored, in part, by our comparable sales growth, which has been positive for the past 26 consecutive quarters. We have proven our concept across Canada, and we believe our United States experience acquired over the last five years demonstrates the potential of our brand and retail concept. 

&#160; 

We believe there is a highly attractive, long term growth opportunity for our store base in North America with a potential to open up to a total of 230 stores in Canada. This is based on management estimates, having internally identified malls and street locations and to some extent lifestyle centers and outlets, that would be suitable locations in which to open new DAVIDsTEA stores. Our sales are currently substantially derived from sales in Canada, which accounted for 86%, 91% and 92% of net sales in Fiscal 2015, Fiscal 2014 and Fiscal 2013. In the United States, we believe there is also a potential to open up to an additional 325 stores from the 37 locations we had as of the end of Fiscal 2015. We generated 14%, 9% and 8% of our net sales in the United States in Fiscal 

&#160;

2015, Fiscal 2014 and Fiscal 2013. In Fiscal 2016, we expect to open between 23 - 27 stores in Canada and 13 - 17 stores in the United States. 

&#160; 

We will continue to expand our customer base and build our brand visibility and awareness, in part, through further development of our omni-channel strategy in North America, with a focus on the Away From Home channel. We believe that we have substantial room to grow our Away From Home channel, by offering our products to hotels, restaurants and institutions, office and workplace locations and food services, as well as through corporate gifting and other areas. 

&#160; 

Our Stores and Operations 

Our Stores 

&#160; 

As of January 30, 2016, our retail footprint consisted of 156 stores in Canada and 37 stores in the United States. Our retail stores are located primarily within malls, including lifestyle centers and outlets, and on street locations. Each store exterior prominently displays the DAVIDsTEA teal signage. In Fiscal 2015, our average store was approximately 900 square feet. We have rapidly pursued new store growth, having significantly increased our store base from one store in fiscal 2008 to 193 stores as of January 30, 2016. See note 23 to our consolidated financial statements for information regarding our long-lived assets in Canada and the US. 

&#160; 

Distinctive Retail Experience 

&#160; 

The DAVIDsTEA experience starts with our people both in stores, our Tea Guides, and at our service support center. Our people&#8217;s knowledge and passion permeate our culture and are rooted in a deep knowledge of, and desire to share, the compelling attributes of tea. Our modern and simple-aesthetic stores, coupled with our teal &#8209;colored logo, create an inviting atmosphere and stand in stark contrast to common perceptions of tea as a more traditional product. A key element of the retail experience is our &#8220;Tea Wall,&#8221; a focal point of the store, which displays approximately 150 premium teas and tea blends. Our Tea Guides help create a highly interactive and immersive customer experience and we strive to make tea a multi &#8209;sensory experience. Indeed, they facilitate the interaction with our products through education and sampling so that our customers appreciate the compelling attributes of tea as well as the ease of preparation. Every visit to our stores is designed to create a sense of adventure for our customers, from novice and experienced tea drinkers alike, as our knowledgeable, personable and passionate Tea Guides assist our customers in navigating the &#8220;Tea Wall&#8221; by selecting a variety of teas for customers to smell based on their taste preferences. 

&#160; 

Site Selection and New Store Model 

&#160; 

We seek to open stores in strategic locations that support the brand image, targeting high customer traffic locations primarily within malls, including lifestyle centers and outlets, and on street locations. We employ a rigorous analytical process to identify new store locations. For every store location selected, our real estate team prepares a detailed financial plan, which is evaluated by our Chief Financial Office and our real estate committee on which sits our President and Chief Executive Officer. Our real estate team, led by our Head of Global Real Estate and Store Development, spends considerable time evaluating prospective sites. We also actively monitor and manage the performance of our stores and seek to incorporate information learned through the monitoring process into our analytic process and future site selection decisions. 

&#160; 

Our new store model anticipates an average target store size of approximately 850 square feet that achieves annual sales of approximately $550,000 &#8209;$600,000, in local currency, in the first year of operation. Our new store model also assumes an average new store investment of approximately $310,000 &#8209;$330,000, in local currency, which includes our capital to build out the store, and we do not enter into understandings or arrangements until we are ready to introduce new locations into our pipeline. 

&#160; 

Store Management, Culture and Training 

&#160; 

We are guided by a philosophy that recognizes customer service and the importance of delivering optimal performance, allowing us to identify and reward teams that meet our high performance standards. We use store-level scorecards that report key performance indicators. We provide our store managers with a number of analytical tools to support our store operations and assist them in attaining optimum store performance. These tools include key performance indicator reports, coaching logs for one &#8209;on &#8209;one meetings, weekly one &#8209;on &#8209;one meetings between our store managers and district managers and annual evaluations. While our main focus is on the overall performance of the team and our stores, we provide incentives to team members, store managers and district managers. 

&#160; 

&#160;

We have developed a distinctive culture that inspires in our team members a passion for tea. Our culture is also focused on customer service through comprehensive training, career development and individual enrichment. We believe our culture allows us to attract knowledgeable, passionate, fun and motivated team members who are driven to succeed. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Passion for Tea. We believe our passionate and fun Tea Guides are a major element of our retail experience. We seek to recruit, hire, train, retain and promote qualified, knowledgeable and enthusiastic team members who share our passion for tea and strive to deliver an extraordinary retail experience to our customers. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Extensive Training. We have specific training and certification requirements for all new team members, including undergoing food handlers&#8217; certification and fifteen hours of foundational training. This process helps ensure that all team members educate our customers and execute our standards accurately and consistently. As team members progress to the assistant manager and manager levels, they undergo additional weeks of training in sales, operations and management. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Career Development and Individual Enrichment. We track and reward team member performance, which we believe incentivizes excellence and helps us identify top performers and thus maintain a sufficient talent pool to support our growth. Many of our store managers and district managers are promoted from within our organization. We are guided by a philosophy that recognizes performance, allowing us to identify and reward teams who meet our high performance standards. 

&#160; 

Our core values and distinctive corporate culture allow us to attract passionate and friendly employees who share a vision of making tea fun and accessible. We have a strong focus on community engagement, and our culture reflects our belief in doing right by our customers and our communities. We provide our employees with extensive training, career development, individual enrichment, and empowerment, which we believe is a key contributor for our success. In addition, the strength of our management team is supported by our dedicated board of directors that works closely with our executives in initiatives related to developing corporate strategy, building our corporate culture and enhancing our sales and operations infrastructure. Our board of directors and management team&#8217;s experience is balanced between entrepreneurial growth and large-scale operations. 

&#160; 

Our Digital Platform 

&#160; 

Our digital platform is primarily comprised of our website, www.davidstea.com. We launched our website just prior to opening our first store. Our e &#8209;commerce sales represented 9.4% of sales for Fiscal 2015, compared to 7.9% of sales for Fiscal 2014. We are targeting greater than 15% of sales over the long &#8209;term. 

&#160; 

Our website features our full assortment of premium loose &#8209;leaf teas, pre-packaged teas, tea sachets and tea-related gifts, accessories and foods. To drive increased sales through our digital platform, we utilize online &#8209;specific marketing and promotions. In addition, we employ banner advertisements, search engine optimization and pay &#8209;per &#8209;click arrangements to help drive customer traffic to our website. 

&#160; 

Through our e-commerce platform, we can target a broader audience of customers who may not live near one of our retail locations. We believe our digital platform and our stores are complementary, as our digital platform provides our store customers an additional channel through which to purchase our teas and tea &#8209;related products while also helping drive awareness of and customer traffic to our stores. 

&#160; 

Our digital platform also includes our social media platform, with a total following base of over 676,000 that spans Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Google+, Pinterest, LinkedIn, YouTube, Snapchat and Vine. We will continue to leverage our growing social media presence to increase our e &#8209;commerce site sales and drive additional store visits within existing and new markets. 

&#160; 

Our Product Categories 

&#160; 

We offer approximately 150 premium loose &#8209;leaf teas, pre-packaged teas, tea sachets and tea-related gifts, accessories and foods primarily through our retail stores and e-commerce site. Additionally, we offer on &#8209;the &#8209;go tea beverages in our retail stores. 

&#160; 

Teas 

&#160; 

Our loose &#8209;leaf teas, pre-packaged teas, tea sachets and tea-related gifts that consumers can enjoy at home, on &#8209;the &#8209;go or at work, represented 66% of our sales in Fiscal 2015, 68% in Fiscal 2014 and 67% Fiscal 2013. Our different flavors of loose-leaf tea span eight different tea categories: white, green, oolong, black, pu&#8217;erh, mate, rooibos and herbal tea. Furthermore, approximately 85% 

&#160;

of our teas are blended with other ingredients while approximately 15% are straight teas. Our teas and ingredients used in our tea blends are sourced from various regions around the world, including but not limited to, China, South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Vietnam, India, Nepal, Kenya, Sri Lanka and South Africa. In addition to loose &#8209;leaf teas, we sell pre &#8209;packaged teas and tea sachets to make the tea experience more convenient for some customers. Our tea-related gifts include special edition holiday gift packages. 

&#160; 

Tea Accessories 

&#160; 

Our tea accessories, representing 24% of our sales in Fiscal 2015, 22% in Fiscal 2014, and 23% in Fiscal 2013, are created to make the tea preparation process and tea experience more convenient and fun and easy at home or on-the-go for customers. Tea accessories include tea mugs, travel mugs, teacup sets, teapots, tea makers, kettles, infusers, filters, frothers, tins and spoons. Many of our accessories are crafted with unique features to improve tea preparation and consumption. Most of our accessories are crafted with unique colors and designs. 

&#160; 

Food and Beverages 

&#160; 

Our retail stores offer tea beverages for on &#8209;the &#8209;go consumption and our retail stores and e-commerce site offer food products, which together represented 10% of our sales in Fiscal 2015, Fiscal 2014 and Fiscal 2013. Our beverages range from the standard hot or iced tea to our Tea Lattes. 

&#160; 

Product Development and Design 

&#160; 

Our tea and merchandising teams travel throughout the world seeking premium teas and tea-related products. These teams consist of Tea Blend Developers, Product Designers, Category Merchants and Quality Control Personnel, who leverage our extensive experience in selecting and developing our product assortment. We are constantly exploring different ingredients, flavors and trends that are popular in a variety of cultures from which we introduce new teas to our customers. Our research and development team works with our blenders and suppliers to create new and exciting flavors of tea which we rotate into our product offering to attract new customers and keep current customers coming back. Our blending process is very focused on magnifying the senses and bringing smell and taste to the forefront. We introduce new flavors and blends each month as well as around seasonal holidays. We believe our focus on innovation and product development is a key differentiating factor for our brand that helps drive our customer&#8217;s loyalty. 

&#160; 

Our innovation also extends to creating new and exciting merchandise to make the tea consumption and experience more convenient and easy at home or on-the-go. We have a competitive advantage in that our merchandising team designs and develops most of our products in &#8209;house. Therefore, we are better positioned to create unique and proprietary designs to make consuming loose &#8209;leaf tea easier and more fun for our customers. We believe our combination of product selection and product innovation allows us to offer customers a distinctive assortment that differentiates us from other specialty tea retailers and helps drive our continued strong financial results. 

&#160; 

Marketing and Advertising 

&#160; 

We differentiate our business through a unique field &#8209;based marketing approach to build brand awareness and drive customers to our stores and e &#8209;commerce site in both new and existing markets. We customize our marketing mix for each of our markets and purposes through our events sponsorship group. Our events sponsorship group engages directly in the communities around our stores and drives store visits by offering product samplings and beverage coupons, and by participating in both hyper &#8209;local and large &#8209;scale events. In the last year, we participated in approximately 2,000 events where more than 3 million people attended. These events are identified and coordinated by our local store managers and Tea Guides with support from our dedicated corporate events team. 

&#160; 

Sourcing and Manufacturing 

&#160; 

We do not own or operate any tea estates or blending operations; instead, we work with vendors who source ingredients for our teas and tea blends from all over the world. The majority of our tea blenders are in either Germany or the United States. We have a flexible and scalable supply chain system. Most of our pre &#8209;packaged teas are primarily assembled in our Montr&#233;al warehouse and then shipped to our retail stores. Since we founded the Company in 2008, we have developed strong relationships with our vendors. These relationships are very important as we depend on our vendors to provide us with the highest quality teas and ingredients from around the world. We have a process of quality control, which includes in-house testing and vendor testing. In addition to bringing our designs for tea blends to fruition, our vendors are important to the quality control process and ensuring our teas meet applicable regulatory guidelines. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Warehouse and Distribution Facilities 

&#160; 

We distribute our loose-leaf teas, pre-packaged teas, tea sachets and tea-related gifts, accessories and foods to our stores and our e &#8209;commerce customers from distribution centers in Montr&#233;al, Calgary and Champlain, New York. In Canada, our Montr&#233;al warehouse ships to our Canadian e &#8209;commerce customers and Eastern Canada stores, while our third &#8209;party distribution centers in Calgary ships to Western Canada. Our Champlain, New York distribution center ships to all our U.S. stores and began shipping directly to our U.S. ecommerce customers during fiscal 2015. We operate the distribution facility in Montr&#233;al, which is leased. The facilities in Calgary and Champlain, New York are operated by third parties. Our products are typically shipped to our stores and our e &#8209;commerce customers via a third &#8209;party national transportation provider multiple times per week. 

&#160; 

Management Information Systems 

&#160; 

Our management information systems provide a full range of business process supports to our stores, our store operations and service support center teams. Additionally, we operate our e &#8209;commerce site on an independent platform. We believe our information systems provide us with enhanced operational efficiencies, scalability, increased management control and timely reporting that allow us to identify and respond to trends in our business. We utilize a combination of industry &#8209;standard and customized software systems to provide various functions related to: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

point of sales; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

inventory management; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

warehouse management, and; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

accounting and financial reporting. 

&#160; 

Government Regulation 

&#160; 

We are subject to labor and employment laws, import and trade restrictions laws, laws governing advertising, privacy and data security laws, safety regulations and other laws, including consumer protection regulations that apply to retailers and/or the promotion and sale of merchandise and the operation of stores and warehouse facilities. In the United States, we are subject to the regulatory authority of, among other agencies, the Federal Trade Commission (&#8220;FTC&#8221;) and U.S. Food and Drug Administration (&#8220;FDA&#8221;). We are also subject to the laws of Canada, including the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, as well as provincial and local regulations. We monitor changes in these laws and believe that we are in material compliance with applicable laws. 

&#160; 

Insurance 

&#160; 

We maintain third-party insurance for a number of risk management activities including but not limited to a worker&#8217;s compensation, general liability, property, directors and officers, cyber insurance and employee-related health care benefits. We evaluate our insurance requirements on an ongoing basis to ensure we maintain adequate levels of coverage. 

&#160; 

Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

We regard intellectual property and other proprietary rights as important to our success. We own several trademarks and servicemarks that have been registered with the Canadian Intellectual Property Office and the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, including DAVIDsTEA &#174; . We have also registered our stylized logos. We also own domain names, including davidstea.com. In addition, we have registered or made application to register one or more of our marks in a number of foreign countries and expect to continue to do so in the future. There can be no assurance that we can obtain the registration for the marks in every country where registration has been sought. 

&#160; 

We also rely upon trade secrets and know &#8209;how to develop and maintain our competitive position. We protect our intellectual property rights through a variety of methods including trademark and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality agreements with vendors, employees, consultants and others who have access to our proprietary information. 

&#160; 

We must constantly protect against any infringement by competitors. If a competitor infringes on our trademark rights, we may take action to protect our rights, which could result in litigation, in which case, we may incur significant expenses and divert significant attention from our business operations. 

&#160;

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

As of the end of Fiscal 2015, we had 2,625 employees. As of January 30, 2016, we employed a total of 415 full &#8209;time employees and 2,210 part &#8209;time employees, with 329 in the United States and 1,881 in Canada. Of all those employees, 2,399 were employed in our retail channel and 226 were employed in corporate, distribution and direct channel support functions. None of our employees is represented by a labor union. We believe we have a good relationship with our employees. 

&#160; 

Seasonality 

&#160; 

Our business experiences seasonal fluctuations, reflecting increased sales during the year-end holiday season. Our sales and income are generally highest in the fourth quarter, which includes the year-end holiday sales period, and tends to be lowest in the second and third fiscal quarters. Therefore, operating results for any fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for the full fiscal year. To prepare for the year-end holiday season, we must order and keep in inventory more merchandise than we carry during other parts of the year. We expect inventory levels, along with an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses, to reach their highest levels in the third and fourth quarters in anticipation of the increased net sales during the year-end holiday season. As a result of this seasonality, and generally because of variations in consumer spending habits, we experience fluctuations in net sales, net income and working capital requirements during the year.
