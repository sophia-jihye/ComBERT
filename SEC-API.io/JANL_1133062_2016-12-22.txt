 ITEM 1. BUSINESS &#160;

Janel Corporation (&#8220;Janel,&#8221; &#8220;Company,&#8221; or &#8220;Registrant&#8221;) is a holding company with subsidiaries in two business segments: Global Logistics Services and Manufacturing. The Company&#8217;s Global Logistics Services segment comprises several wholly-owned subsidiaries, collectively known as &#8220;Janel Group.&#8221; The Company&#8217;s Manufacturing segment comprises its majority-owned INDCO subsidiary, which manufactures and distributes industrial mixing equipment. Janel is a successor to a business originally formed in 1975. Janel is domiciled in the state of Nevada. Its corporate headquarters is in Lynbrook, New York. Its website is located at http://www.janelcorp.com.

&#160;

Janel&#8217;s management focuses on significant capital allocation decisions, corporate governance and supporting its subsidiaries where appropriate. The Company expects to grow through its subsidiaries&#8217; organic growth and by completing acquisitions. Janel either will acquire businesses within its existing segments, or it will expand its portfolio into new segments. Janel&#8217;s acquisition strategy focuses on reasonably-priced companies with strong and capable management teams, attractive existing business economics and stable and predictable earnings power.

&#160;

In September 2014, the Company purchased the equity of Alpha International / President Container Lines (&#8220;Alpha/PCL&#8221;), a global logistics services company. Approximately one year later, it purchased the equity of Liberty International, Inc. (&#8220;Liberty&#8221;). These companies, along with the legacy Janel Group, comprise Janel Corporation&#8217;s global logistics services segment, which focuses on international transportation and customs clearance. In March 2016, the Company purchased INDCO, Inc. (&#8220;INDCO&#8221;) in order to diversify cash flow streams. INDCO comprises Janel Corporation&#8217;s manufacturing segment.

&#160;

Janel and its consolidated subsidiaries employ 108 full-time and five part-time people in the United States. None of these employees is covered by a collective bargaining agreement. Janel and its subsidiaries have experienced no work stoppages and consider relations with their employees to be good.

&#160;

Global Logistics Services 

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s Global Logistics Services segment comprises several wholly-owned subsidiaries, collectively known as &#8220;Janel Group.&#8221; We acquired Alpha/PCL in September 2014 and Liberty in August 2015 in order to add markets and specialties to Janel Group&#8217;s logistics offerings.

&#160;

Janel Group operates out of eight leased, full-service locations in the United States: Lynbrook (New York), New York (headquarters, operations and accounting); Edison (Newark), New Jersey; Essington (Philadelphia), Pennsylvania; Elk Grove Village (Chicago), Illinois; Forest Park (Atlanta), Georgia; Torrance (Los Angeles), California; Pawtucket (Providence), Rhode Island; and Boston, Massachusetts. Janel Group maintains a network of independent agent relationships in many trading countries, giving it the ability to provide a global service to its clients.

&#160;

Janel Group helps its clients move and manage freight efficiently to reduce inventories and to increase supply chain speed and reliability. Key services include customs entry filing, arrangement of freight forwarding by air, ocean and ground, warehousing, cargo insurance procurement, logistics planning, product repackaging and online shipment tracking. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016, Janel Group handled over 50,000 individual import and export shipments originating or terminating in the United States, Europe and Asia. Approximately 70% of the revenue from this activity related to imports, 12% to exports, and 18% to break-bulk, forwarding and other services. Janel Group has one customer that accounts for approximately 10.4% of Janel Corporation&#8217;s total revenues in fiscal 2016. 

&#160;

Janel Group earns flat fees for certain services, such as customs entry filing. For brokered services, Janel Group earns the difference between the rate charged by a service provider and the rate Janel Group charges the customer for the provider&#8217;s service. Janel Group&#8217;s freight consolidation activities, in addition to on-going volume-based relationships with providers, allows Janel Group to command preferred service rates that can be passed on profitably to the customer.

&#160;

The logistics industry is highly fragmented, with low barriers to entry and intense competition. Janel Group competes against providers ranging in size from &#8220;mom-and-pop&#8221; businesses to multi-billion dollar, multi-national firms with hundreds of offices worldwide. Many Janel Group customers utilize more than one logistics provider.

&#160;

The global forwarding industry requires dealings in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. As a result, Janel Group is exposed to the inherent risks of international currency markets and governmental interference. Some countries in which Janel Group maintains agent relationships have currency control regulations that influence Janel Group&#8217;s ability to hedge foreign currency exposure. Janel Group tries to compensate for these exposures by accelerating international currency settlements among those agents. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Historically, Janel Group&#8217;s quarterly operating results have been subject to seasonal trends. The fiscal second quarter has traditionally been the weakest and the fiscal third and fourth quarters have traditionally been the strongest. This pattern has been the result of, or influenced by, numerous factors including climate, national holidays, consumer demand, economic conditions and other similar and subtle forces. This historical seasonality has also been influenced by the growth and diversification of Janel Group&#8217;s international network and service offerings.

&#160;

A significant portion of Janel Group&#8217;s revenues are derived from customers in industries with shipping patterns tied to consumer demand and/or just-in-time production schedules. Many of Janel Group&#8217;s customers may ship a significant portion of their goods at or near the end of a quarter. Therefore, the timing of Janel Group revenues is, to a large degree, affected by factors beyond its control, such as shifting consumer demand for retail goods and manufacturing production delays. Janel Group cannot accurately forecast many of these factors, nor can it estimate the relative impact of any given factor. Therefore, there is no assurance that historical patterns will continue in the future.

&#160;

Interstate and international transportation of freight is highly regulated. Failure to comply with applicable state and federal regulations, or to maintain required permits or licenses, can result in substantial fines or revocation of operating permits or authorities imposed on both transportation intermediaries and their shipper customers. We cannot give assurance as to the degree or cost of future regulations on our business. Some of the regulations affecting our current and prospective operations are described below.

&#160;

Janel Group&#8217;s activities in the air transportation industry in the United States are subject to regulation by the Department of Transportation as an indirect air carrier. Janel Group&#8217;s overseas offices and agents are licensed as freight forwarders in their respective countries of operation, and each of Janel Group&#8217;s offices is licensed as a freight forwarder by the International Air Transport Association (&#8220;IATA&#8221;). IATA is a voluntary association of airlines which prescribes certain operating procedures for freight forwarders acting as agents of its members. Most of Janel Group&#8217;s freight forwarding business is conducted with airlines that are IATA members.

&#160;

Each Janel Group company that engages in customs brokerage is licensed as a customs broker by the Department of Homeland Security Customs and Border Service. All U.S. Customs brokers are required to maintain prescribed records and are subject to periodic audits by the Customs Service. In other jurisdictions in which Janel Group companies perform clearance services, the relevant company is licensed by the appropriate governmental authority.

&#160;

Each Janel Group company that engages in ocean freight is registered as an Ocean Transportation Intermediary and licensed as a non-vessel operating common carrier (&#8220;NVOCC&#8221;) by the Federal Maritime Commission. The FMC has established certain qualifications for shipping agents, including certain surety bonding requirements.

&#160;

When acting as an airfreight consolidator, Janel Group assumes a carrier&#8217;s liability for lost or damaged shipments. This legal liability is typically limited by contract to the lower of the transaction value or the released value ($9.07 per pound unless the customer declares a higher value and pays a surcharge), excepted for loss or damages caused by willful misconduct in the absence of an appropriate airway bill. The airline that Janel Group utilizes to make the actual shipment is generally liable to Janel Group in the same manner and to the same extent. When acting solely as the agent of an airline or shipper, Janel Group does not assume any contractual liability for loss or damage to shipments tendered to the airline.

&#160;

When acting as an ocean freight consolidator, Janel Group assumes a carrier&#8217;s liability for lost or damaged shipments. This liability is strictly limited by contract to the lower of a transaction value or the released value ($500 for package or customary freight unit unless the customer declares a higher value and pays a surcharge). The steamship line which Janel Group utilizes to make the actual shipment is generally liable to Janel Group in the same manner and to the same extent. In its ocean freight forwarding and customs clearance operations, Janel Group does not assume cargo liability.

&#160;

When providing warehouse and distribution services, Janel Group limits its legal liability by contract to an amount generally equal to the lower of fair value or $.50 per pound with a maximum of $50 per &#8220;lot,&#8221; defined as the smallest unit that the warehouse is required to track. Upon payment of a surcharge for warehouse and distribution services, Janel Group would assume additional liability.

&#160;

Janel Group maintains marine cargo insurance covering claims for losses attributable to missing or damaged shipments for which it is legally liable. Janel Group also maintains insurance coverage for the property of others stored in company warehouse facilities.

&#160;

&#160; &#160;- 3 - &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Janel Group is subject to U.S. federal, state and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise for the protection of the environment. Similar laws apply in many foreign jurisdictions in which Janel Group operates. Although current operations have not been significantly affected by compliance with these environmental laws, the Company cannot predict what impact future environmental regulations may have on Janel Group. Janel Group does not anticipate making any material capital expenditures for environmental control purposes during the remainder of the current or succeeding fiscal years.

&#160;

Manufacturing 

&#160;

Purchased in March 2016, the Company&#8217;s Manufacturing segment comprises its majority-owned INDCO subsidiary, which manufactures and distributes industrial mixing equipment. INDCO&#8217;s headquarters and manufacturing operations are located in a single leased facility in New Albany, Indiana.

&#160;

INDCO provides solutions for the mixing needs of customers operating in diverse industries, including chemicals, inks, paints, construction, plastics, adhesives, cosmetics, food and pharmaceuticals. Solutions include over 2,500 standard product configurations, both manufactured and distributed, available for order from INDCO&#8217;s website and its print catalog, mailed quarterly. In addition, INDCO manufactures custom-designed mixing solutions that INDCO helps specify, design, machine, assemble and distribute. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016, INDCO made approximately 6,000 individual shipments to customers. INDCO generated gross revenue of approximately $7.6 million in fiscal 2016 and $7.3 million in fiscal 2015. In fiscal 2016, approximately 81% of INDCO&#8217;s revenue came from manufacturing activity. The remainder came from distribution activity.

&#160;

The industrial mixer manufacturing industry is highly fragmented with low barriers to entry. INDCO competes with companies of all sizes based on a combination of pricing, lead-times, service, quality and ability to reach customers through internet presence and catalog circulation.

&#160;

Government regulation directly governing INDCO&#8217;s industrial mixer product line is minimal. Changing energy efficiency standards, however, as mandated by the Department of Energy, can, over time, affect electric motor manufacturers whose products are used by INDCO. Historically, these changes have resulted in only minor changes to the product line.

&#160;

INDCO is subject to U.S. federal, state and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise for the protection of the environment. Although current operations have not been significantly affected by compliance with these environmental laws, the Company cannot predict what impact future environmental regulations may have on INDCO. INDCO does not anticipate making any material capital expenditures for environmental control purposes during the remainder of the current or succeeding fiscal years.
