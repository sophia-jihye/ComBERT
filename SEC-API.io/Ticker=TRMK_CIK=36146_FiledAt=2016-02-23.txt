The Corporation

Description of Business

Trustmark Corporation (Trustmark), a Mississippi business corporation incorporated in 1968, is a bank holding company headquartered in Jackson, Mississippi. Trustmark’s principal subsidiary is Trustmark National Bank (TNB), initially chartered by the State of Mississippi in 1889. At December 31, 2015, TNB had total assets of $12.677 billion, which represented approximately 99.99% of the consolidated assets of Trustmark.

Through TNB and its subsidiaries, Trustmark operates as a financial services organization providing banking and other financial solutions through 200 offices and 2,941 full-time equivalent associates (measured at December 31, 2015) located in the states of Alabama (primarily in the central and southern regions of that state, which are collectively referred to herein as Trustmark’s Alabama market), Florida (primarily in the northwest or "Panhandle" region of that state, which is referred to herein as Trustmark’s Florida market), Mississippi, Tennessee (in Memphis and the Northern Mississippi regions, which are collectively referred to herein as Trustmark’s Tennessee market), and Texas (primarily in Houston, which is referred to herein as Trustmark’s Texas market). The principal products produced and services rendered by TNB and Trustmark’s other subsidiaries are as follows:

Trustmark National Bank

Commercial Banking — TNB provides a full range of commercial banking services to corporations and other business customers. Loans are provided for a variety of general corporate purposes, including financing for commercial and 

industrial projects, income producing commercial real estate, owner-occupied real estate and construction and land development. TNB also provides deposit services, including checking, savings and money market accounts and certificates of deposit as we ll as treasury management services. 

Consumer Banking — TNB provides banking services to consumers, including checking, savings, and money market accounts as well as certificates of deposit and individual retirement accounts. In addition, TNB provides consumer customers with installment and real estate loans and lines of credit.

TNB’s wealth management division is also assisted by Trustmark Investment Advisors, Inc. (TIA), a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)-registered investment adviser and a wholly-owned subsidiary of TNB. TIA provides customized investment management services to TNB’s Wealth Management Division, which in turns relies upon that advice to provide investment management services to TNB’s wealth management customers. During 2014, TNB moved the administration of Private Banking, previously reported in the Wealth Management Division, to the General Banking Division, which encompasses TNB’s commercial, consumer and mortgage banking products and services.

New Market Tax Credits (NMTC) — TNB provides an intermediary vehicle for the provision of loans or investments in Low-Income Communities (LICs) through its subsidiary Southern Community Capital, LLC (SCC). SCC is a Mississippi single member limited liability company, a certified Community Development Entity (CDE) and a wholly-owned subsidiary of TNB. The primary mission of SCC is to provide investment capital for LICs, as defined by Section 45D of the Internal Revenue Code, or for Low-Income Persons (LIPs). As a certified CDE, SCC is able to apply to the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund (CDFI Fund) to receive NMTC allocations to offer investors in exchange for equity investments in qualified projects.

Capital Trust

Trustmark Preferred Capital Trust I (the Trust) is a Delaware trust affiliate and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Trustmark formed in 2006 to facilitate a private placement of $60.0 million in trust preferred securities. As defined in applicable accounting standards, the Trust is considered a variable interest entity for which Trustmark is not the primary beneficiary. Accordingly, the accounts of the Trust are not included in Trustmark’s consolidated financial statements.

Overview of Lending Business

Trustmark categorizes loans on its balance sheet into four categories. These categories are described in more detail in Note 1 — Significant Accounting Policies included in Part II. Item 8. - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — of this report.

- 

Loans Held for Investment (LHFI) — Loans originally underwritten by Trustmark that do not constitute loans held for sale, acquired loans or covered loans. 

- 

Loans Held for Sale (LHFS) — Mortgage loans purchased from wholesale customers or originated in Trustmark’s General Banking Division, other than mortgage loans that are retained in the LHFI portfolio based on banking relationships or certain investment strategies. 

- 

Acquired Loans — Loans acquired by Trustmark, either pursuant to the acquisition of another bank or pursuant to an acquisition of some or all of another bank’s loan portfolio. 

- 

Covered Loans — Acquired loans that Trustmark acquired in a Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)-assisted transaction and that are covered under a loss-share agreement with the FDIC. 

The following discussion briefly summarizes Trustmark’s lending business by focusing on LHFI and LHFS, and includes a discussion of the risks inherent in these loans, Trustmark’s underwriting policies for its loans and the characteristics of the real estate loan component of these loans. Acquired loans and covered loans are excluded from this summary, as Trustmark did not underwrite those loans at inception. Discussion of Trustmark’s acquired loans, including covered loans, is contained elsewhere in this report.

As a general matter, extending credit to businesses and consumers exposes Trustmark to credit risk, which is the risk that the principal balance and any related interest may not be collected according to the original terms due to the inability or unwillingness of the borrower to repay the loan. Trustmark mitigates credit risk through a set of internal controls, which includes adherence to conservative lending practices and underwriting guidelines, collateral monitoring, and oversight of its borrower’s financial performance and collateral. The risks inherent in specific subsets of lending are discussed below.

LHFI Secured by Construction, Land Development, and Other Land — Construction and land development loans include loans for both commercial and residential properties to builders/developers and to consumers. This category also includes loans secured by vacant land, except land known to be used or usable for agricultural purposes, such as crop and livestock production. Repayment is normally derived from the sale of the underlying property or from permanent financing, which refinances Trustmark’s initial loan. Trustmark’s engagement in this type of lending i s restricted to projects within its geographic markets and is generally extended to those builders and developers exhibiting the highest credit quality with significant equity invested in the project. The underwriting process for these loans includes anal ysis of the financial position and strength of both the borrower and guarantor, experience with similar projects in the past, market demand and prospects for successful completion of the proposed project within the established budget and schedule, values o f underlying collateral and availability of permanent financing. Risk within this portfolio is mitigated through adherence to policies and lending limits, periodic target credit reviews of the different segments of this portfolio, inspection of projects t hroughout the life of the loan and routine monitoring of financial information and collateral values as they are updated. 

Inherent in real estate construction lending is the risk that the full value of the collateral does not exist at the time the loan is granted. Construction lending also inherently includes the risk associated with a borrower’s ability to successfully complete a proposed project on time and within budget. Further, adverse changes in the market occurring between the start of construction and completion of the projects can result in slower sales rates and lower sales prices than originally anticipated which could impact the underlying real estate collateral values and timely and full repayment of these loans. Rising interest rates can adversely affect the cost of construction and the financial viability of real estate projects. Higher interest rates may also result in higher capitalization rates, thereby reducing a property’s value. As a result of this risk profile, LHFI secured by construction, land development and other land are considered to be higher risks than other real estate loans.

LHFI and LHFS Secured by Residential Properties — Residential real estate loans consist of first and junior liens on residential properties that are extended in the geographic markets in which Trustmark operates as well as mortgage products, originated and purchased, that are underwritten to secondary market standards. Credit underwriting standards include verification of income, valuation of collateral and evaluation of the borrower’s credit history and repayment capacity. Portfolio performance is continuously evaluated through updated credit bureau scores and monitoring of repayment performance. 

Credit performance of consumer residential real estate loans is highly dependent on housing values and household income which, in turn are highly dependent on national, regional and local economic factors. Rising interest rates, rising unemployment rates and other adverse changes in these economies may have a negative effect on the ability of Trustmark’s borrowers to repay these loans and negatively affect value of the underlying residential real estate collateral.

LHFI Secured by Nonfarm, Nonresidential Properties — Trustmark provides financing for both owner-occupied commercial real estate as well as income-producing commercial real estate. Trustmark seeks to maintain a balance of owner-occupied and income-producing real estate loans that moderates its risk to the specific risks of each type of loan. Commercial real estate term loans are typically collateralized by liens on real property. Both types of commercial real estate loans are underwritten to lending policies that include maximum loan-to-value ratios, minimum equity requirements, acceptable amortization periods and minimum debt service coverage requirements, based on property type. Income-producing commercial real estate loans also generally require cash equity and are subject to exposure limits for a single project. All exceptions to established guidelines are subject to stringent internal review and require specific approval. As with commercial loans, the borrower’s financial strength and capacity to repay their obligations remain the primary focus of underwriting. Financial strength is evaluated based upon analytical tools that consider historical and projected cash flows and performance in addition to analysis of the proposed project for income-producing properties. Additional support offered by guarantors is also considered. 

Risk for owner-occupied commercial real estate is driven by the creditworthiness of the underlying borrowers, particularly cash flow from the borrowers’ business operations as well as the risk of a shortfall in collateral. Credit performance of loans secured by commercial income-producing real estate can be negatively affected by national, regional and local economic conditions, which may result in deteriorating tenant credit profiles, tenant losses, reduced rental/lease rates and higher than anticipated vacancy rates, all contributing to declines in value or liquidity of the underlying real estate collateral. Other factors, such as increasing interest rates, may result in higher capitalization rates, thereby reducing a property’s value.

Commercial and Industrial LHFI — Commercial loans (other than commercial loans related to real estate assets, which are summarized above) are made to many types of businesses for various purposes, such as short-term working capital loans that are usually secured by accounts receivable and inventory, equipment and fixed asset purchases that are secured by those assets and term financing for those within Trustmark’s geographic markets. Trustmark’s credit underwriting process for commercial loans includes analysis of historical and projected cash flows and performance, evaluation of financial strength of both borrowers and guarantors as reflected in current and detailed financial information and evaluation of underlying collateral to support the credit. Credit risk within the commercial loan portfolio is managed through adherence to specific commercial lending policies and internally established lending authorities, diversification within the portfolio and monitoring of the portfolio on a continuing basis. 

Credit risk in commercial and industria l loans can arise due to fluctuations in borrowers’ financial condition, deterioration in collateral values and changes in market conditions. The credit risk inherent in these loans depends on, to a significant degree, the general economic conditions of t hese areas. Further, credit risk can increase if Trustmark’s loans are concentrated to borrowers engaged in the same or similar activities, or to groups of borrowers who may be uniquely or disproportionately affected by market or economic conditions. 

Consumer LHFI — Consumer credit includes loans to individuals for household and personal items, automobile purchases, unsecured loans, personal lines of credit and credit cards. All consumer loans are subject to a standardized underwriting process through Trustmark’s consumer loan center, which uses a custom credit scoring model with emphasis placed upon the borrower’s credit evaluation and historical performance, income evaluation and valuation of collateral (where applicable). Updated credit bureau scores are obtained on all existing consumer loans/lines on a periodic basis in order to monitor portfolio credit quality changes and mitigate risk. 

Similar to residential real estate loan portfolios, an inherent risk factor in consumer loans is that they are dependent on national, regional and local economic factors that affect employment in the markets where these loans are originated. Generally, consumer loan portfolios consist of a large number of relatively small-balance loans, some of which are originated as unsecured credit (credit cards and some personal lines of credit), and as such, do not have collateral as a secondary source of repayment. Consumer loans generally pose heightened risks of collectability and loss when compared to other loan types.

Other LHFI — Other loans primarily consist of loans to non-depository financial institutions, such as mortgage companies, finance companies and other financial intermediaries, loans to state and political subdivisions, and loans to non-profit and charitable organizations. These loans are underwritten based on the specific nature or purpose of the loan and underlying collateral with special consideration given to the specific source of repayment for the loan. 

Similar to commercial and industrial loans, inherent risk in other loans can arise due to fluctuations in borrowers’ financial condition, deterioration in collateral values and changes in market and economic conditions. Loans to state and political subdivisions have the added inherent risk of being somewhat dependent on the ability and capacity of those entities to generate tax and other revenues to repay the loans. Loans to non-profit and charitable organizations are dependent on those organizations’ ability to generate revenues through their fundraising efforts and other forms of financial support, which can be susceptible to economic downturns.

Recent Economic and Industry Developments

The economy showed moderate signs of improvement in 2015, particularly in the second half of the year; however, economic concerns remain as a result of the cumulative weight of continued soft labor markets in the United States, volatility in crude oil prices, slowing growth in markets in Western Europe, Japan, China, Russia and other emerging markets, combined with uncertainty regarding anticipated further tightening of the monetary policy by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB). Doubts surrounding the near-term direction of global markets, and the potential impact of these trends on the United States economy, are expected to persist for some time. While Trustmark’s customer base is wholly domestic, international economic conditions affect domestic conditions, and thus may have an impact upon Trustmark’s financial condition or results of operations.

In the January 2016 "Summary of Commentary on Current Economic Conditions by Federal Reserve Districts," the twelve Federal Reserve Districts’ reports suggested national economic activity continued to expand at a modest pace during the reporting period, and noted growth in lending activity and improvement in loan quality, as well as improvements in both the residential and commercial real estate markets and modest growth in consumer spending. Reports by the three Federal Reserve Districts covering the southeast United States, which include Trustmark’s five key market regions, suggested that economic activity increased at a modest pace, with most businesses reporting improved sales and positive outlooks for the near term, with the exception of the energy sector. The Federal Reserve’s Sixth District, Atlanta (which includes Trustmark’s Alabama, Florida and Mississippi market regions) and the Eighth District, St. Louis (which includes Trustmark’s Tennessee market region), also reported increased loan demand, improvements in residential and commercial real estate activity and increased commercial construction. However, the Federal Reserve’s Sixth District also reported inconsistency in commercial real estate growth noting that the rate of improvement varied by metropolitan area, submarket, and property type. The Federal Reserve’s Eleventh District, Dallas (which includes Trustmark’s Texas market region), reported a decline in housing demand and continued weakness in Houston, increased delinquencies in loans to oil and gas companies as a result of weakness in the energy sector, depressed demand for oilfield services as drilling activity declined, and continued deterioration in the financial positions of many oil-related firms. The Federal Reserve’s Eleventh District also reported a slight decline in economic outlooks for 2016 due to the negative outlook for the energy sector as oil prices are anticipated to remain low for the foreseeable future as well as broader uncertainty surrounding regulation and global economic developments.

In December 2015, the FRB increased the target range for the federal funds rate for the first time in over seven years. The FRB also indicated that it may further increase rates on a gradual basis through 2016, depending on economic conditions. It is not possible to predict the timing or amount of any such additional increases. Low interest rates will continue to place pressure on net interest 

margins for Trustmark (as well as its competitors), as older, higher-yielding assets that matur e or default and can only be replaced with lower-yielding instruments. 

For additional discussion of the impact of the current economic environment on the financial condition and results of operations of Trustmark and its subsidiaries, see Part II. Item 7. — Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — of this report.

Competition

There is significant competition within the banking and financial services industry in the markets in which Trustmark operates. Changes in regulation, technology and product delivery systems have resulted in an increasingly competitive environment. Trustmark expects to continue to face increasing competition from online and traditional financial institutions seeking to attract customers by providing access to similar services and products.

Trustmark and its subsidiaries compete with national and state chartered banking institutions of comparable or larger size and resources and with smaller community banking organizations. Trustmark has numerous local, regional and national nonbank competitors, including savings and loan associations, credit unions, mortgage companies, insurance companies, finance companies, financial service operations of major retailers, investment brokerage and financial advisory firms and mutual fund companies. Because nonbank financial institutions are not subject to the same regulatory restrictions as banks and bank holding companies, they can often operate with greater flexibility and lower cost structures. Currently, Trustmark does not face meaningful competition from international banks in its markets, although that could change in the future.

At June 30, 2015, Trustmark’s deposit market share ranked within the top three positions in 62% of the 52 counties served and within the top five positions in 75% of the counties served. The table below presents FDIC deposit data regarding TNB’s deposit market share by state as of June 30, 2015. The FDIC deposit market share data presented below does not align with Trustmark’s reported geographic market regions, which in some instances cross state lines, and Trustmark’s geographic coverage within certain states presented below is not statewide (see the sections captioned "Description of Business" and "Geographic Information" above).

Services provided by the Wealth Management Division face competition from many national, regional and local financial institutions. Companies that offer broad services similar to those provided by Trustmark, such as other banks, trust companies and full service brokerage firms, as well as companies that specialize in particular services offered by Trustmark, such as investment advisors and mutual fund providers, all compete with Trustmark’s Wealth Management Division.

Trustmark’s insurance subsidiary faces competition from local, regional and national insurance companies, independent insurance agencies as well as from other financial institutions offering insurance products.

Trustmark’s ability to compete effectively is a result of providing customers with desired products and services in a convenient and cost effective manner. Customers for commercial, consumer and mortgage banking as well as wealth management and insurance services are influenced by convenience, quality of service, personal contacts, availability of products and services and competitive pricing. Trustmark continually reviews its products, locations, alternative delivery channels, and pricing strategies to maintain and enhance its competitive position. While Trustmark’s position varies by market, Management believes it can compete effectively as a result of the quality of Trustmark’s products and services, local market knowledge and awareness of customer needs.

Supervision and Regulation

The following discussion sets forth material elements of the regulatory framework applicable to bank holding companies and their subsidiaries and provides specific information relevant to Trustmark. The discussion is a summary of detailed statutes, regulations and policies. The descriptions are not intended to be complete summaries of the statutes, regulations and policies referenced therein. Such statutes, regulations and policies are continually under the review of the United States Congress and state legislatures as well as federal and state regulatory agencies. A change in statutes, regulations or policies could have a material impact on the business of Trustmark and its subsidiaries.

Regulation of Trustmark 

Trustmark is a registered bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (BHC Act). Trustmark and its nonbank subsidiaries are therefore subject to the supervision, examination and reporting requirements of the BHC Act, the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDI Act), the regulations of the FRB and certain of the requirements imposed by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act).

Federal Oversight Over Mergers and Acquisitions, Investments and Branching

The BHC Act requires every bank holding company to obtain the prior approval of the FRB before: (i) it may acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting shares of any bank if, after such acquisition, the bank holding company will directly or indirectly own or control 5.0% or more of the voting shares of the bank; (ii) it or any of its subsidiaries, other than a bank, may acquire all or substantially all of the assets of any bank; or (iii) it may merge or consolidate with any other bank holding company. The BHC Act further provides that the FRB may not approve any transaction that would result in a monopoly or would be in furtherance of any combination or conspiracy to monopolize or attempt to monopolize the business of banking in any section of the United States, or the effect of which may be substantially to lessen competition or to tend to create a monopoly in any section of the country, or that in any other manner would be in restraint of trade, unless the anticompetitive effects of the proposed transaction are clearly outweighed by the public interest in meeting the convenience and needs of the community to be served. The FRB is also required to consider the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the bank holding companies and banks concerned and the convenience and needs of the community to be served. Consideration of financial resources generally focuses on capital adequacy, and consideration of convenience and needs issues includes the parties’ performance under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977.

The BHC Act also requires FRB approval for a bank holding company’s acquisition of a company that is not an insured depository institution. Bank holding companies generally may engage, directly or indirectly, only in banking and such other activities as are determined by the FRB to be closely related to banking. The FRB must generally consider whether performance of the activity by a bank holding company can reasonably be expected to produce benefits to the public, such as greater convenience, increased competition, or gains in efficiency, that outweigh possible adverse effects, such as undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interest, or unsound banking practices. The FRB has express statutory authority to also consider the "risk to the stability of the United States banking or financial system" when reviewing the acquisition of such a company by a bank holding company.

The BHC Act, as amended by the interstate banking provisions of the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 (Riegle-Neal Act) permits Trustmark to acquire a bank located in any other state, regardless of state law to the contrary, subject to certain deposit-percentage, aging requirements, and other restrictions. The Riegle-Neal Act also generally permits national and state-chartered banks to branch interstate through acquisitions of banks in other states. Bank holding companies must be well-capitalized and well-managed to obtain federal bank regulatory approval of an interstate acquisition without regard to state law prohibiting the transaction.

Under provisions of the BHC Act referred to as the "Volcker Rule," limitations are placed on the ability of insured depository institutions, insured depository institution holding companies and their affiliates ("Banking Entities") to acquire or retain ownership interests in, or act as sponsor to, certain investment funds, including hedge funds and private equity funds. The Volcker Rule also places restrictions on proprietary trading by a Banking Entity.

The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) has the authority to approve applications by national banks to establish de novo branches in states other than the bank’s home state if the law of the State in which the branch is located, or is to be located, would permit establishment of the branch if the bank were a State bank chartered by such State.

Source of Strength

Under the FDI Act, Trustmark is expected to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to TNB. Under this policy, a bank holding company is expected to commit resources to support its bank subsidiary, including at times when the holding company may not be in a financial position to provide it.

Capital Adequacy

Bank holding companies and banks are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by state and federal bank regulatory agencies. Capital adequacy regulations and, additionally for banks, prompt corrective action regulations, involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items calculated under regulatory accounting practices. Capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about components, risk weighting and other factors. United States capital regulations were substantially revised in 2013 as a result of changes in the Dodd-Frank Act and the 

Basel Committee on Banking Supervision’s December 2010 final capital framework, referred to as "Basel III." The FRB and the OCC, the primary regulators of Trustmark and TNB, respectively, have substantially similar risk-based capital rat io and leverage ratio requirements. 

Under capital requirements applicable to Trustmark and TNB as of January 1, 2015, Trustmark and TNB are required to meet a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 7.0% (a minimum of 4.5% plus a capital conservation buffer of 2.5%, which will be fully phased in by January 1, 2019), a Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 8.5% (a minimum of 6.0% plus a phased-in capital conservation buffer of 2.5%), a total capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 10.5% (a minimum of 8% plus a phased-in capital conservation buffer of 2.5%), and a leverage ratio of Tier 1 capital to total consolidated assets of 4.0%. In addition, for an insured depository institution to be "well-capitalized" under the banking agencies’ prompt corrective action framework, it must have a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.5%, Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.0%, a total capital ratio of 10.0%, and a leverage ratio of 5.0%, and must not be subject to any written agreement, order or capital directive, or prompt corrective action directive issued by the OCC to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure.

For purposes of calculating the denominator of the risk-based capital ratios, a banking institution’s assets and some of its specified off-balance sheet commitments and obligations are assigned to various risk categories. For purposes of calculating the numerator of the capital ratios, capital, at both the holding company and bank level, is classified in one of three tiers depending on the "quality" and loss-absorbing features of the capital instrument. Common equity Tier 1 capital is predominantly comprised of common stock instruments (including related surplus) and retained earnings, net of treasury stock, and after making necessary capital deductions and adjustments. Tier 1 capital is comprised of common equity Tier 1 capital and additional Tier 1 capital, which includes non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock and similar instruments meeting specified eligibility criteria (including related surplus) and "TARP" preferred stock and other instruments issued under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. Newly issued trust preferred securities and cumulative perpetual preferred stock may not be included in Tier 1 capital. However, smaller depository institution holding companies (those with assets less than $15 billion as of year-end 2009) and most mutual holding companies are allowed to continue to count as Tier 1 capital most outstanding trust preferred securities and other non-qualifying securities that were issued prior to May 19, 2010 (up to a limit of 25% of Tier 1 capital, excluding non-qualifying capital instruments) rather than phasing such securities out of regulatory capital. Trustmark currently has outstanding trust preferred securities that is permitted to continue to count as Tier 1 capital up to the regulatory limit. Total capital is comprised of Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital, which includes certain subordinated debt with a minimum original maturity of five years (including related surplus) and a limited amount of allowance for loan losses. Newly issued trust preferred securities and cumulative perpetual preferred stock generally may be included in Tier 2 capital, provided they do not include features that are disallowed by the capital rules, such as the acceleration of principal other than in the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency, or receivership of the issuer.

Failure to meet minimum capital requirements could subject a bank to a variety of enforcement remedies. The FDI Act identifies five capital categories for insured depository institutions. These include well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. An insured depository institution is subject to differential regulation corresponding to the capital category within which the institution falls. The FDI Act requires banking regulators to take prompt corrective action whenever financial institutions do not meet minimum capital requirements. Failure to meet the capital guidelines could also subject an insured depository institution to capital raising requirements. In addition, an insured depository institution is generally prohibited from making capital distributions, including paying dividends, or paying management fees to a holding company, if the institution would thereafter be undercapitalized. In addition, the FDI Act requires the various regulatory agencies to prescribe certain noncapital standards for safety and soundness relating generally to operations and management, asset quality and executive compensation, and permits regulatory action against an insured depository institution that does not meet such standards. 

An institution’s failure to exceed the capital conservation buffer with common equity Tier 1 capital would result in limitations on an institution’s ability to make capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments. The capital conservation buffer is being phased in until January 1, 2019.

At December 31, 2015, Trustmark exceeded its minimum capital requirements with common equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 capital and total capital equal to 12.57%, 13.21% and 14.07% of its total risk-weighted assets, respectively. At December 31, 2015, TNB also exceeded these requirements with common equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 capital and total capital equal to 13.00%, 13.00% and 13.86% of its total risk-weighted assets, respectively. At December 31, 2015, the leverage ratios for Trustmark and TNB were 10.03% and 9.89%, respectively. As of December 31, 2015, the most recent notification from the OCC categorized TNB as well-capitalized based on the ratios and guidelines described above. Management will continue to evaluate the impact of the capital rules on Trustmark and TNB as they are phased in.

Stress Testing

Bank holding companies and national banks with average total consolidated assets between $10 billion and $50 billion must conduct annual company-run stress tests using data as of September 30 of each year under one base and at least two stress scenarios as 

provided by the FRB. Stress test results must be provided to the FRB and OCC by March 31 of the following year. Trustmark has been subject to these stress test requirements since Septembe r 2014, and was required to make its first filing with regulators during March 2015. On June 15, 2015, Trustmark and TNB released the results of their annual company-run stress tests conducted in accordance with FRB and OCC regulations. 

Beginning with the January 1, 2016 annual stress test cycle, institutions with total consolidated assets between $10 billion and $50 billion (which will include Trustmark and TNB) must conduct their stress tests using data as of December 31 of the preceding year, provide results to the FRB by July 31 of each year and publicly disclose results in October of each year. 

Trustmark anticipates that the capital ratios, as reflected in the stress test calculations under the required stress test scenarios, will be an important factor considered by the agencies in evaluating the capital adequacy of Trustmark and TNB and whether proposed payments of dividends or stock repurchases are consistent with prudential expectations.

Anti-Money Laundering Initiatives and Sanctions Compliance

Trustmark and TNB are subject to extensive regulations aimed at combatting money laundering and terrorist financing. The USA Patriot Act of 2001 (USA Patriot Act) substantially broadened the scope of United States anti-money laundering laws and regulations by imposing significant compliance and due diligence obligations, creating new crimes and penalties and expanding the extra-territorial jurisdiction of the United States. United States Department of the Treasury regulations implementing the USA Patriot Act impose obligations on financial institutions to maintain appropriate policies, procedures and controls to detect, prevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing and to verify the identity of their customers. Failure of a financial institution to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, or to comply with all of the relevant laws or regulations, could have serious legal and financial consequences for the institution.

The U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) is responsible for helping to insure that U.S. entities do not engage in transactions with certain prohibited parties, as defined by various Executive Orders and Acts of Congress. OFAC publishes lists of persons, organizations, and countries suspected of aiding, harboring or engaging in terrorist acts, known as Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons. OFAC administers and enforces applicable economic and trade sanctions programs. These sanctions are usually targeted against foreign countries, terrorists, international narcotics traffickers and those believed to be involved in the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. These regulations generally require either the blocking of accounts or other property of specified entities or individuals, but they may also require the rejection of certain transactions involving specified entities or individuals. Trustmark maintains policies, procedures and other internal controls designed to comply with these sanctions programs.

Other Federal Regulation of Trustmark

In addition to being regulated as a bank holding company, Trustmark is subject to regulation by the State of Mississippi under its general business corporation laws. Trustmark is also subject to the disclosure and other regulatory requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as administered by the SEC.

Regulation of TNB

TNB is a national bank and, as such, is subject to extensive regulation by the OCC and, to a lesser extent, by the FDIC. In addition, as a large provider of consumer financial services, TNB is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). Almost every area of the operations and financial condition of TNB is subject to extensive regulation and supervision and to various requirements and restrictions under federal and state law including loans, reserves, investments, issuance of securities, establishment of branches, capital adequacy, liquidity, earnings, dividends, management practices and the provision of services. TNB is subject to supervision, examination and reporting requirements under the National Bank Act, the Federal Reserve Act, the FDI Act, regulations of the OCC and certain of the requirements imposed by the Dodd-Frank Act. Trustmark and TNB are also subject to a wide range of consumer protection laws and regulations.

Restrictions on Lending, Insider Transactions and Affiliate Transactions

National banks are limited in the amounts they may lend to one borrower and the amount they may lend to insiders. These single counterparty and insider lending limits extend to loans, derivative transactions, repurchase agreements, reverse repurchase agreements and securities lending or borrowing transactions. In addition, the FDI Act imposes restrictions on insured depository institutions’ purchases of assets from insiders.

Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act establish parameters for an insured bank to conduct "covered transactions" with its affiliates, generally (i) limiting the extent to which the bank or its subsidiaries may engage in "covered transactions" with any one 

affiliate to an amo unt equal to 10 percent of the bank’s capital stock and surplus, and limit ing the aggregate of all such transactions with all affiliates to an amount equal to 20 percent of the bank’s capital stock and surplus, and (ii) requiring that all such transactions be on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable, to the bank or subsidiary as those that would be provided to a non-affiliate. In addition, an insured bank’s loans to affiliates must be fully collateralized. The term "covered transaction" i ncludes the making of loans to the affiliate, purchase of assets from the affiliate, issuance of a guarantee on behalf of the affiliate and several other types of transactions. 

Payment of Dividends

The principal source of Trustmark’s cash revenues is dividends from TNB. There are various legal and regulatory provisions that limit the amount of dividends TNB can pay to Trustmark without regulatory approval. Under the National Bank Act, approval of the OCC is required if the total of all dividends declared in any calendar year exceeds the total of TNB’s net income for that year combined with its retained net income from the preceding two years. TNB will have available in 2016 approximately $114.3 million plus its net income for that year to pay to Trustmark as dividends. Also under the National Bank Act, TNB may not pay any dividends in excess of undivided profits (retained earnings). In addition, subsidiary banks of a bank holding company are subject to certain restrictions imposed by the Federal Reserve Act on extensions of credit to the bank holding company or any of its subsidiaries. Further, subsidiary banks of a bank holding company are prohibited from engaging in certain tie-in arrangements in connection with any extension of credit, lease or sale of property or furnishing of any services to the bank holding company. Moreover, an institution’s failure to exceed the capital conservation buffer set forth in the capital rules with common equity Tier 1 capital would result in limitations on an institution’s ability to make capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments.

CFPB

The Dodd-Frank Act established the CFPB within the Federal Reserve System as an independent bureau with responsibility for consumer financial protection. The CFPB is responsible for issuing rules, orders and guidance implementing federal consumer financial laws. The CFPB has primary enforcement authority over "very large" insured depository institutions or insured credit unions and their affiliates. An insured depository institution is deemed "very large" if it reports assets of more than $10 billion in its quarterly Call Report for four consecutive quarters. The CFPB has near exclusive supervision authority, including examination authority, over these "very large" institutions and their affiliates to assess compliance with federal consumer financial laws, to obtain information about the institutions’ activities and compliance systems and procedures, and to detect and assess risks to consumers and markets. The CFPB has broad authority to prevent "unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices" and ensure consistent enforcement of laws so that all consumers have access to markets for consumer financial products and services that are fair, transparent and competitive. The CFPB has rulemaking and interpretive authority under the Dodd-Frank Act and other federal consumer financial services laws, as well as broad supervisory, examination and enforcement authority over large providers of consumer financial products and services, such as us. TNB’s total assets were $12.677 billion at December 31, 2015, and $12.249 billion at December 31, 2014, and therefore, TNB is subject to CFPB supervision.

State Laws and Other Federal Oversight

Banking organizations are subject to numerous laws and regulations intended to protect consumers in addition to those discussed above. These laws include, among others:, the Truth in Lending Act (TILA); Truth in Savings Act; Electronic Funds Transfer Act (EFTA); Expedited Funds Availability Act; Equal Credit Opportunity Act; Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act; Fair Housing Act; Fair Credit Reporting Act; Fair Debt Collection Act; Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act; Home Mortgage Disclosure Act; Right to Financial Privacy Act; Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act; laws regarding unfair and deceptive acts and practices; and usury laws.

Many states and local jurisdictions have consumer protection laws analogous, and in addition to, those listed above. While TNB’s activities are governed primarily by federal law, the Dodd-Frank Act potentially narrowed National Bank Act preemption of state consumer financial laws, thereby making TNB and other national banks potentially subject to increased state regulation. The Dodd-Frank Act also codified the Supreme Court’s decision in Cuomo v. Clearing House Association. As a result, State Attorneys General may enforce in a court action "an applicable law" against federally-chartered depository institutions like TNB. In addition, under the Dodd-Frank Act, State Attorneys General are authorized to bring civil actions against federally-chartered institutions, like TNB, to enforce regulations prescribed by the CFPB or to secure other remedies.

Finally, the Dodd-Frank Act potentially expanded state regulation over banks by eliminating National Bank Act preemption for national bank operating subsidiaries, including operating subsidiaries of TNB.

Mortgage Regulation

The Dodd-Frank Act imposed new standards for mortgage loan originations on lenders. The statute amended TILA to restrict the payment of fees to real-estate mortgage originators. Furthermore, the statute amended TILA to impose minimum underwriting 

standards on real-estate mortgage creditors (including nonbanks as well as bank creditors) and verifications to check b orrowers’ income and their ability to pay. 

Financial Privacy Laws

The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999 (GLB Act) imposed requirements related to the privacy of customer financial information. In accordance with the GLB Act, federal bank regulators adopted rules that limit the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose nonpublic information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties. These limitations require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and, in some circumstances, allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to a nonaffiliated third party. The privacy provisions of the GLB Act affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial companies and conveyed to outside vendors. Trustmark recognizes the need for its customers’ privacy.

Debit Interchange Regulation

The FRB has issued rules under the EFTA, as amended by the Dodd-Frank Act, to limit interchange fees that an issuer may receive or charge for an electronic debit card transaction. Under the FRB’s rules, the maximum permissible interchange fee that an issuer may receive for an electronic debit transaction is the sum of 21 cents per transaction and five basis points multiplied by the value of the transaction. In addition, the FRB’s rules allow for an upward adjustment of no more than one cent to an issuer’s debit card interchange fee if the issuer develops and implements policies and procedures reasonably designed to achieve the fraud-prevention standards set out in the rule. 

Issuers that, together with their affiliates, have assets of less than $10.0 billion on the annual measurement date (December 31) are exempt from the debit card interchange fee standards. At the December 31, 2013 annual measurement date, Trustmark had assets greater than $10.0 billion; and, therefore, was required to comply with the debit card interchange fee standards by July 1, 2014.

FDIC Deposit Insurance Assessments

The deposits of TNB are insured by the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF), as administered by the FDIC, and, accordingly, are subject to deposit insurance assessments to maintain the DIF. The FDIC uses a risk based assessment system that imposes insurance premiums based upon a risk matrix that takes into account a bank’s capital level and supervisory rating (the CAMELS component rating). The CAMELS rating system is a supervisory rating system developed to classify a bank’s overall condition by taking into account capital adequacy, assets, management capability, earnings, liquidity and sensitivity to market and interest rate risk. For Risk Category I institutions, including TNB, assessment rates are determined from a combination of financial ratios and CAMELS component ratings. The minimum annualized assessment rate for Risk Category I institutions during 2015 was 2.5 basis points with the maximum rate being 9.0 basis points. Assessment rates for institutions in Risk Category I may vary within this range depending upon changes in CAMELS component ratings and financial ratios.

The Dodd-Frank Act imposes a new deposit insurance assessment base for an insured depository institution equal to the institution’s total assets minus the sum of (1) its average tangible equity during the assessment period, and (2) any additional amount the FDIC determines is warranted for custodial and banker’s banks. The minimum reserve ratio increased to 1.35 percent of estimated annual insured deposits or assessment base. On October 22, 2015, the FDIC issued a proposed rule that would increase the DIF to the required reserve ratio level of 1.35 percent by imposing on banks with at least $10 billion in assets, such as TNB, a surcharge of 4.5 cents per $100 of their assessment base, after making certain adjustments. As proposed, the deposit insurance surcharge combined with the adjusted assessment base will be less than that which is currently levied upon TNB. It is, of course, possible that the final rule could adopt a higher surcharge.

The Dodd-Frank Act permanently increased the deposit insurance level to $250,000 per depositor for each insured depository institution.

In 2015, TNB’s expenses related to deposit insurance premiums totaled $10.1 million. In addition, TNB also paid approximately $653 thousand in Financing Corporation (FICO) assessments related to outstanding FICO bonds for which the FDIC serves as collection agent. The bonds issued by FICO are due to mature from 2017 through 2019. For the quarter ended December 31, 2015, the FICO assessment rate was equal to 0.58 basis points.

TNB Subsidiaries

TNB’s nonbanking subsidiaries are subject to a variety of state and federal laws and regulations. TIA, a registered investment adviser, is subject to regulation by the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and by the State of Mississippi. FBBI is subject to the 

insurance laws and regulations of the states in which its divisions are active. SCC is subject to the supervision and regulation of the CDFI Fund and the State of Mississippi. 

The GLB Act authorizes national banks to own or control a "financial subsidiary" that engages in activities that are not permissible for national banks to engage in directly. The GLB Act contains a number of provisions dealing with insurance activities by bank subsidiaries. Generally, the GLB Act affirms the role of the states in regulating insurance activities, including the insurance activities of financial subsidiaries of banks, but the GLB Act also preempts certain state laws. As a result of the GLB Act, TNB elected for predecessor subsidiaries that now constitute FBBI to become financial subsidiaries. This enables FBBI to engage in insurance agency activities at any location.
