 ITEM 1. BUSINESS &#160; 

General Description of Business 

&#160;

We are a start-up company actively pursuing a business plan focusing on management consulting services. We are actively pursuing consulting contracts and have begun offering services to customers in Hong Kong and Taiwan in 2014. We intend to utilize a combination of various marketing channels, including, without limitation, telephone sales, in and out of Hong Kong and Taiwan, third-party sales agents, ecommerce, and corporate strategic partnerships and alliances. Our goal is to establish an international brand on death care management consulting services with high quality and name recognition.

&#160;

Currently, the Company is actively pursuing entering consultancy contracts with small death care service providers in Hong Kong and Taiwan. In 2016, the Company plans to expand its scope of customers to include medium-size and large enterprises.

&#160;

In March 2014, we entered into two death care consulting agreements which provided monthly revenues of approximately $8,000. The obligations under these agreements concluded in March 2015.

&#160;

In July 2015, the Company added two new offices in Kaohsiung city and Changhua city and expanded its office by taking more space in Taichung office. The Company also added a total of 3 employees (including managers and staff) during the month of July. The Company has started to sell supplies for funerals and plans to add additional funeral services for the Taiwanese market in 2015.

&#160;

We will be marketing death care management consulting services in one package to our customers. We believe that the innovation and timely introduction of our new service is essential to attract customers. As we are still at our early start-up stage, we are still developing our information systems.

&#160;

Industry and Market Overview 

&#160; 

China is the only country in the world with more than 200 million elderly people and consequently is the biggest old age market. The government estimates that the rate of population aging in cities and towns of China would reach 60% in 2020, which indicates the demands for funeral industry services is likely to increase.

&#160;

We estimate that current China death care market size is around $10.3 billion and the average spending per death is around $1,100. The better the economy, the more spending in death care. China death care sector mainly included three subsectors: 1) manufacturing and marketing of funeral merchandise, 2) funeral services, 3) marketing and management of cemeteries.

&#160;

Funeral merchandise is a fully opened market and is subject to fierce competition. Crematorium is mainly run by government held entity. Approximately 50% of cemeteries are for-profit businesses and 50% are non-profit businesses.

&#160;

The leading death care companies in Hong Kong include Sino-Life Group Limited, Anxian Yuan China Holdings Limited, and SAGE International group limited.

&#160;

Competitive Strengths 

&#160;

We believe that we are well-positioned to capitalize on the death care industry as a result of the following competitive strengths:

&#160;

High-quality services 

&#160;

To ensure the high quality of our death care management consulting services, we have trained our staff to provide professional and personalized services. Utilizing our experience and expertise we will strive to help families and friends of the deceased get through the hardest time of their lives.

&#160;

&#160; 3 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

We are planning to approach candidates who have experience in death care industry to join our team. Once these people are formally recruited, we are going to have systematic training over our associates. We are aiming to have our associates well-trained and capable of offering professional and personalized services to our customers. We will invest considerable capital and human resources in providing comprehensive associate training.

&#160;

Multiple marketing channels 

&#160;

We expect to derive revenues in multiple channels, including, without limitation, telephone sales, in and out of Hong Kong, third-party sales agents, ecommerce, and corporate strategic partnerships and alliances.

&#160; 

We are currently also approaching candidates who are specialized in marketing of death care industry and we will invest related capital and human resources in building our marketing team.

&#160;

We expect that with our commitment to high-quality services, combined with our multiple marketing channels, Longbau will gradually grow into a well-known brand in death care industry in the future and eventually tap its way to mainland China and other Asian countries.

&#160;

Our Growth Strategy 

&#160;

In 2014, our plan was to seek consultancy contracts with small death care service providers in Hong Kong and Taiwan. In 2015, our plan was on expanding our client base to midsize and large death care service providers in Hong Kong. We expect to provide consulting services to some companies in the death care industry to improve their operation performance. Additionally, we would like to cooperate with funeral services companies. In the future, it is expected that Longbau could promote the death care services to mainland China. Given mainland China is the biggest old age market, we intend to cooperate with large companies and provide consulting services to small companies in death care industry.

&#160;

Services 

&#160;

Management Consulting Services 

&#160; 

Traditionally, funeral owners selling death care services overlook the quality of corporate management. Our executive officers have extensive professional management experience and can solve our clients&#8217; corporate management issues and provide the customer better a better experience using our experience in financial management, sales management, administration, and quality management. The Company&#8217;s services will be sold to independent death care service providers through in person contact, telephone calls, and through the internet. There are no current plans to sell services through brick and mortar storefronts. The Company will enter into consultant contracts with these service providers for negotiated fees.

&#160; 

Research and Development Expenditures 

&#160;

We currently do not have any full-time research and development team.
