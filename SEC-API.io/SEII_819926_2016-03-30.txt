 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

&#160; 

We are engaged in three business segments - (1) the dyeing and finishing equipment segment, in which we manufacture and sell textile dyeing and finishing machines, (2) the forged rolled rings and related components segment, in which we manufacture and sell precision forged rolled rings, shafts, flanges, and other forged components for the energy industry including wind power and other industries, and (3) the petroleum and chemical equipment segment, in which we manufacture and sell petroleum and chemical equipment. 

&#160; 

Dyeing and finishing equipment segment 

&#160; 

Through our dyeing and finishing equipment segment, we design, manufacture and distribute a line of proprietary high and low temperature dyeing and finishing machinery to the textile industry. Our products feature a high degree of both automation and mechanical-electrical integration. Our products are used in dyeing yarns such as pure cotton, cotton-polyester, terylene, polyester wool, poly-acrylic fiber, nylon, cotton ramie, and wool yarn. We are continuing to seek to utilize our expertise in manufacturing precision products to meet demand in new and existing end markets. 

&#160; 

We design and produce airflow dyeing machines, which use air instead of water. Water is used in the traditional dyeing process. We believe that our air-flow technology, which is designed to enable users to meet the stricter environmental standards, results in reduced input costs, fewer wrinkles, less damage to the textile, and reduced emissions. With the China government&#8217;s mandate to phase out older machinery in China&#8217;s textile industry that does not meet the new environmental standards, although our revenue from this segment declined in 2015 from 2014, in the long-term we expect to increase our revenue from this segment. Our new after-treatment drying and compacting machine is used in the final finishing of knitted material, such as cotton, and is designed to improve the softness, reduce shrinkage and ensure better dimensional stability. We developed a new garment washing machine for denim. Made of stainless steel and customized for use by Chinese jeans manufacturers, the machine is capable of stone wash, enzyme wash and other water washing techniques. 

&#160; 

Forged rolled rings and related components segment 

&#160; 

Through our forged rolled rings and other related products segment, we produce precision forged rolled rings and other forged components to the energy industry including wind power and other industries. Our forged rolled rings and other related products are sold for use by manufacturers of industrial equipment for the various industries. Forged rolled rings and other forged components for the wind industry are used in wind turbines, which are used to generate wind power. 

&#160; 

The demand for products used in manufacturing in general, and the wind power industries, in particular, is uncertain. Our revenues from this segment declined from approximately $34,000,000 in 2014 to approximately $12,000,000 in 2015. Additionally, as discussed elsewhere, in 2015, we recorded an impairment charge of approximately $5,100,000 relating to a write down of the carrying value of certain manufacturing equipment used in this segment to its estimated fair value. Although we believe that over the long term, the forged rolled rings and related components segment will expand, and the government of the PRC has announced its desire to increase the use of wind power and other alternative energy such as solar as an energy source, in the short term, other factors such as economic factors and the fluctuations in the price of oil and coal, may affect the requirements by our customers and potential customers for our products. To the extent that the demand for our forged rolled rings and related components declines, our revenue and net income will be affected. 

&#160; 

Petroleum and chemical equipment segment 

&#160; 

Through our petroleum and chemical equipment segment, we produce and sell coal chemical equipment, formaldehyde plant and downstream products, a variety of heat exchangers, separators, tanks, towers, cryogenic equipment, reaction kettles and other products to petroleum and chemical industries. In December 2015, we received a notice of contract termination in writing from our largest customer in this segment alleging breach of contract for late delivery of product and for delivery of product with quality defects. Pursuant to the sales contract, this customer, which was our largest customer, accounting for approximately 13% or our consolidated revenues for 2015, demanded payment of a penalty of 20% of the contract price plus penalties for late delivery and damages in the amounts of 36,103,640 RMB, and, in connection with this contingent liability, we recorded a loss from sales contract dispute of approximately $5,807,000 which is reflected in operating expenses on the statement of operations and comprehensive loss, and the amount of the claim is reflected in accrued expenses at December 31, 2015. Additionally, in December 2015, we increased our allowance for doubtful accounts by approximately $1,759,000 which represents this customer&#8217;s full amount of outstanding accounts receivable, we increased our reserve for obsolete inventory in the amount of $836,000, representing the remaining inventory manufactured to the specifications of this customer, and we recorded an impairment charge of approximately $1,900,000 to property and equipment which was used to manufacture products for this customer and is not otherwise used by us. We are currently discussing this issue with the customer and we are unable to determine if the accounts receivable balance will be collected. We expect that our revenues from petroleum and chemical equipment segment will significantly decrease in 2016 and beyond due to the loss of this customer, and, it may be necessary for us to discontinue this segment.

&#160; 

The Dyeing and Finishing Equipment Segment 

&#160; 

In recent years, China has been one of the world&#8217;s leading textile producers, and the textile industry has been a pillar in the Chinese national economy, experiencing generally steady growth over the last few decades. We believe that the textile business has continued to improve due to the tax reimbursement for export incentive given by the PRC government, and we believe that the market for dyeing and finishing equipment is improving, in large part because of the environmental policies of the Chinese government which are resulting in an increased market for equipment designed to enable dyeing companies to comply with the environmental standards. 

&#160; 

In our dyeing and finishing equipment segment, we design, manufacture and distribute a line of proprietary high and low temperature dyeing and finishing machinery. We believe that we are one of the leading domestic Chinese manufacturers of textile dyeing machines, and our Huayang brand is nationally recognized. We currently have the capacity to manufacture and assemble approximately 600 textile-dyeing machines annually. Our state-of-the-art and automated production line enables us to manufacture our products efficiently, with lower labor and energy costs compared to traditional manufacturing methods. As part of our manufacturing process, we make corrosion-resistant stainless steel pumps and pressure vessels, which are not only critical components for our dyeing and finishing products but have other industrial applications as well. 

&#160; 

We have received the &#8220;Advanced Enterprise for Progress in Science and Technology Award&#8221; from Wuxi City in 1999, and the &#8220;Star of Brilliance Medal&#8221; from the Wuxi City Bureau of Industrial and Commercial Administration in the same year. In 2002, we were recognized as an &#8220;Advanced Enterprise for Technical Reform Input&#8221; by Qianzhou, a municipality within Wuxi City for our dyeing products. 

&#160; 

We hold 33 Chinese patents, of which eight are described under &#8220;Intellectual Property Rights.&#8221; These patents cover an innovative production technique enabling more-effective cloth washing in dyeing machines under high temperature and pressure, the dyeing liquid mixing device, dyeing liquid atomizing device, horizontal manipulated devices, mechanical seal and atomizer of its airflow dyeing machine and cover components of the hot air circulation system of low emission air flow dyeing machines. 

&#160; 

Our dyeing and finishing products are generally compact in design compared with alternatives on the market and feature a high degree of both automation and mechanical-electrical integration. Our products are used in dyeing a wide variety of yarns such as pure cotton, cotton-polyester, terylene, polyester wool, poly-acrylic fiber, nylon, cotton ramie, and wool yarn. In 2010, we introduced an advanced dyeing technology enabling a quick, economic and environment-friendly operation designed for optimal performance. The liquid pressure and quantity are adjusted to the respective type and quantity of fabric. The special layout of the pressure pump circuit is designed to provide constant and safe operations of the machine reducing resources wastage and enhancing performance. 

&#160; 

We developed a high (low) temperature airflow dyeing machine. We believe that this new model of dyeing machine is efficient and cost effective and meets the requisite Chinese environmental standards. In September 2014, we received two patents which cover components of the hot air circulation system of our low emission air flow dyeing machines. We believe that the hot air circulation system helps to enhance the machines&#8217; ability to produce higher quality textiles with a better look and feel. 

&#160; 

We have developed a new air-fluid, dual-use dyeing machine which uses both air flow and fluid flow in the dyeing process. It allows users to customize the dyeing process according to the specific type of textile. It is equipped with a series of specialized and patented components, including nozzles, cloth wheels and cloth spreaders, which are designed to permit greater color evenness and reduce defects. It can be used on a wider range of textiles and uses 60% to 70% less water, about 30% less power and 40% to 50% less steam than traditional models of high-temperature, high-pressure dyeing machines and reduces the use of additives by about 50% while shortening dyeing time by 1 to 2 hours. 

&#160; 

Marketing and Distribution 

&#160; 

All of our revenue from the textile dyeing machine segment is derived from sales in China. We presently sell our products in Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provinces, both regions with significant textile production, as well as in many of the coastal regions of China such as Shandong and Guangdong provinces. 

&#160; 

&#160; 4 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

We market and sell our products through our internal sales force, which is based in our facilities in Wuxi. Our marketing programs include industrial conferences, trade fairs, sales training and advertising. Our sales and marketing groups work closely with our manufacturing groups to coordinate our product development activities, product launches and ongoing demand and supply planning. We sell our products directly to many of China&#8217;s largest textile producers. 

&#160; 

Growth Strategies 

&#160; 

According to China&#8217;s National Development and Reform Commission, the main focus of the country&#8217;s textile industry has shifted from gaining competitive advantages based on labor costs toward the objectives of developing scientific and technological innovation as well as brand creation. Under the auspices of China&#8217;s Twelfth Five Year Plan, which was implemented in 2011, the next stage for the textile and dyeing industries in China is to strengthen pollution control, according to the Bureau of Economic Operation under the National Development and Reform Commission. 

&#160; 

In support of this objective, we are continuing our efforts to develop and implement next-generation low energy consumption and high heating efficiency features to our machines. The current emphasis of our efforts continues to be on increasing automation features in our existing products and implementing power line communication technology throughout our production facilities to enable our customers to reduce their use of electricity and water. However, we experienced softer demand for our low-emission airflow dyeing machines as many of our customers already upgraded to newer models and much of our remaining customer base does not have the ability to make significant capital expenditures at this time. As a result, our sales in this segment declined from approximately $42,000,000 in 2014 to approximately $29,000,000 in 2015. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

Because of the importance of the Chinese textile industry in the world market, we face competition from both domestic and foreign suppliers. However, we believe that, due to the high quality of our products, our principal competition is from suppliers based in foreign countries, including Japan, Germany, Italy and France. Domestically, our chief competitor is Fong&#8217;s National Engineering (Shenzhen) Co., Ltd., a subsidiary of Fong&#8217;s Industries Company Ltd., a Hong-Kong based conglomerate. 

&#160; 

We believe that we can effectively compete with these companies on the basis of the quality and performance of our products, our after-sales service, and cost. We provide one year of maintenance and repair services for all of our products and based on historical we experience, maintenance and repair service calls have been minimal. Moreover, we provide customers in the Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provinces, our top markets, with on-site support which is generally provided within 24 hours of receiving a request. However, many of our competitors have longer operating histories and significantly greater financial or technological resources than we do and presently enjoy greater brand recognition. 

&#160; 

The Forged Rolled Rings and Related Components Segment 

&#160; 

We manufacture rolled rings and other related components designed to be used for issue in the wind power industry as well as other uses. We employ axial close-die forging technology in producing precision forgings, a technology for producing rotary precision forgings. We made the forging machine, which we believe provides us with an advantage in machine maintenance and cost compared with other companies using foreign equipment. Our rolled rings are essentially hollow cylindrical sections forged from a stainless steel stock of varying thickness and height. The rings are called rolled rings because of the nature of the forging process. Forging is a manufacturing process where metal is pressed, pounded or squeezed under great pressure to create high strength parts. Rolled ring forging turns a hollow round piece of metal under extreme pressure against a rotating roller, thereby squeezing out a single-piece ring without any welding required. 

&#160; 

Rings can also be manufactured through machining or casting. We believe that forging provides increased strength and flexibility for the finished product. A ring&#8217;s strength affects its fatigue resistance, and is determined by the orientation of the grain flow of the ring&#8217;s metal material. Unlike the machining process, which creates a unidirectional grain flow, or the casting process, which creates no grain flow, the forging process is designed to cause alignment and orientation of the grain flow in a direction creating maximum strength, thereby providing maximum fatigue resistance. This high strength property also reduces sectional thickness and overall weight of the ring without compromising the overall integrity of the finished product. 

&#160; 

High tangential strength and ductility make forged rings well-suited for torque- and pressure-resistant components, such as gears, engine bearings for aircraft, wheel bearings, couplings, rotor spacers, sealed discs and cases, flanges, pressure vessels and valve bodies. As such, rolled rings have a wide variety of applications. Presently, the majority of Chinese rolled ring producers rely on technologies such as the steam hammer and friction press, which consume large amounts of energy and cause pollution, and which, we believe, result in a less desirable product than our products. 

&#160; 

&#160; 5 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Yaw bearings, which are found in every wind turbine, are made from rolled rings. Essentially, a yaw bearing is a large ring with teeth, all of which are either pointing outward or inward. The teeth allow the yaw bearing to engage with a smaller wheel attached to the yaw motor. The yaw motor turns the wind turbine so that the rotor (to which blades are attached) faces the wind in order to optimize electricity generation. The yaw bearing is used by the yaw motor to turn the wind turbine. 

&#160; 

Manufacturing 

&#160; 

In 2009, we opened our state-of-the-art forging facility. Our operations feature a 4,500-ton press and a ring-rolling mill, employing our advanced axial close-die forging technology, to manufacture rolled rings measuring up to 6.3 meters in diameter and a cross section up to 700mm and shafts used in wind turbine units that are designed to generate wind power in the range of 1MW-3MW. We also have a series of workshops dedicated for fabrication, welding, machining and assembly of high strength materials. 

&#160; 

We believe that our forging facility, which is able to meet the quality requirements of our most demanding customers, has an annual capacity of 50,000 tons. 

&#160; 

The melting, forging, heat-treating and machining capability at our facility allows for the manufacturing of a wide range of custom-forged products. Multi-diameter shafts, gear blanks, mandrel-forged rings and specialized shapes, are available in a wide range of sizes and weights ranging from a few hundred pounds to over 25,000 pounds. Most popular carbon and alloy AISI/SAE grades such as 1026, 1045, 4140, 4150F, 4340, and 8620 are readily available. We also have experience with the melting and forming of specialized alloys. We believe that we are capable of producing components that meet various industry specifications as well as product-specific specifications. 

&#160; 

Our manufacturing site covers over 1.1 million square feet. In addition to our forging operation we have established state-of-the-art fabrication, machining, assembly and finishing workshops to meet the manufacturing needs of our clean technology focused customer base. 

&#160; 

We believe that we are a major Chinese manufacturer of: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Large forged rolled rings, yaw bearings, tower flanges and shafts used in large-scale windmills; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Stainless steel pressure vessel/chambers used in the manufacturing of multi-crystalline solar wafers; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Specialty, high tolerance, fabricated components and assemblies used in various clean technology industries; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Other fabricated and machined components, assemblies and equipment requiring high precision manufacturing. &#160;

During the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, we generated revenue from one customer for products which required the use of our electro-slag remelted (&#8220;ESR&#8221;) equipment. We had purchased the equipment in anticipation of a demand for ESR products which did not materialize. On March 3, 2014, we entered into an equipment operating lease with Shanghai Liangting Metallurgy Roll Manufacture Co., Ltd. pursuant to which we leased the ESR equipment to for a quarterly rate of RMB 1,450,000, which, at the present exchange rate is approximately $236,000. The lease has an eight-year term commencing April 1, 2014. The equipment remains on our premises, and the lease gave the lessee a right of access to our premises for the purpose of using the equipment. The equipment is shown on our consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2015 and 2014 as equipment held for sale. In early 2015, the lessee stopped using the equipment and stopped paying rent to us on the equipment. As a result, we incurred an impairment loss on the ESR equipment in the amount of approximately $0.4 million and $3.8 million during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Additionally, as discussed elsewhere, in 2015, we recorded an impairment charge of approximately $4,700,000 relating to a write down of the carrying value of certain manufacturing equipment used in this segment to its estimated fair value.

&#160; 

Marketing and Distribution 

&#160; 

Our marketing efforts include participation at industrial conferences and trade fairs, sales training, and advertising. Our sales team works closely with our product development and manufacturing teams to coordinate our product development activities, product launches and ongoing demand and supply planning. Our products are currently sold to companies in cities and provinces throughout China including Luoyang, Shenyang, Zhenjiang province, Jiangsu province, Qingdao, Jinan, Shanghai, Chongqing, Beijing, Xinjiang, and Zhengzhou. We are an ISO9001:2000 certified supplier. 

&#160; 

&#160; 6 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

The markets for products in our forged rolled rings and related products are intensely competitive. Many of our competitors have established more prominent market positions, and if we fail to attract and retain customers and establish successful distribution networks in our target markets for our products, we will be unable to increase our sales. Many of our existing and potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, manufacturing and other resources than we do. Our competitors&#8217; greater size in some cases provides them with a competitive advantage with respect to manufacturing costs because of their economies of scale and their ability to purchase raw materials at lower prices, as well as securing supplies at times of shortages. Many of our competitors also have greater brand name recognition, more established distribution networks and larger customer bases. In addition, many of our competitors have well-established relationships with our current and potential distributors and have extensive knowledge of our target markets. As a result, they may be able to devote greater resources to the research, development, promotion and sale of their products or respond more quickly to evolving industry standards and changes in market conditions than we can. Our failure to adapt to changing market conditions and to compete successfully with existing or new competitors may materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 

&#160; 

We believe there has been an increase in overall competition in the forged product market as industry capacity has increased and the market for the product has slowed, which is reflected in our decline in sales from this segment from approximately $34,000,000 in 2014 to approximately $12,000,000 in 2015. Additionally, we believe some turbine manufacturers that use forged products and are not our customers or potential customers, have built their own forging capacity to save costs by vertical integration and to have better leverage when negotiating with the component suppliers. This resulted in downward pressure on our pricing and may indirectly affect our sales as a result of increased competition for a smaller number of potential customers. Our products are sold for use by manufacturers of industrial equipment. The demand for products such as ours which are used both for manufacturing in general and for wind power specifically is uncertain. Although we believe that over the long term, our forged rolled rings and related components segment will expand and the government of the PRC has announced its desire to increase the use of wind power as an energy source, in the short term other factors have affected the requirements of our wind power customers and potential customers for our products which has had an effect of lessening the demand for wind power products such as ours. To the extent that the demand for our forged rolled rings and related components for both wind power and other industries declines, our revenue and net income will continue to be affected. 

&#160; 

We believe that we are well positioned to capitalize on the opportunities provided by the demand for products by the wind power industry and other industries in China by supplying superior quality, high performance forged products. We believe that we offer: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; High quality manufacturing facilities and production quality; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; A prime location in Jiangsu province near major transportation routes which can provide shipping cost savings and a good response time; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Strong management, engineering and technical capabilities; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; ISO9001 certification, which covers machining and related service of shaft-shaped forging, ring forging, tubular forging and component assembly. &#160; 

However, the demand for products used in manufacturing in general, including wind power industry and other industries, is uncertain. Although we believe that over the long term, the forged rolled rings and related components segment will expand, and the government of the PRC has announced its desire to increase the use of wind power as an energy source, in the short term, other factors, such as economic factors and the availability of credit, may affect the requirements of our customers and potential customers for our products. To the extent that the demand for our forged rolled rings and related components declines, our revenue and net income will be affected. We also believe that there is a degree of market saturation for forged rolled rings and related components for wind power and other industries and this market saturation, combined with the effects of lower oil and gas prices has reduced the demand for construction of wind power facilities, and we expect that our revenues from forged rolled rings and related components will continue to decrease in the near future. 

&#160; 

The Petroleum and Chemical Equipment Segment 

&#160; 

In our petroleum and chemical equipment segment, we produce and sell coal chemical equipment, formaldehyde plant and downstream products, a variety of heat exchangers, separators, tanks, towers, cryogenic equipment, reaction kettles and other product to petroleum and chemical industries. 

&#160; 

&#160; 7 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Marketing and Distribution 

&#160; 

All of our revenue from the petroleum and chemical equipment segment is derived from sales in China. We presently sell our products in Zhejiang Province, Guangdong Province, Shanxi Province and Xinjiang. We started to sell our petroleum and chemical equipment in February 2015. 

&#160; 

We market and sell our products through our internal sales force, which is based in our facilities in Wuxi. Our marketing programs include industrial conferences, trade fairs, sales training and advertising. Our sales and marketing groups work closely with our manufacturing groups to coordinate our product development activities, product launches and ongoing demand and supply planning. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

The markets for products in our petroleum and chemical equipment segment are intensely competitive. Many of our competitors have established more prominent market positions, and if we fail to attract and retain customers and establish successful distribution networks in our target markets for our products, we will be unable to increase our sales. Many of our existing and potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, manufacturing and other resources than we do. Our competitors&#8217; greater size in some cases provides them with a competitive advantage with respect to manufacturing costs because of their economies of scale and their ability to purchase raw materials at lower prices, as well as securing supplies at times of shortages. Many of our competitors also have greater brand name recognition, more established distribution networks and larger customer bases. In addition, many of our competitors have well-established relationships with our current and potential distributors and have extensive knowledge of our target markets. As a result, they may be able to devote greater resources to the research, development, promotion and sale of their products or respond more quickly to evolving industry standards and changes in market conditions than we can. Our failure to adapt to changing market conditions and to compete successfully with existing or new competitors may materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 

&#160; 

We believe that we can effectively compete with our competitors on the basis of the quality and performance of our products, and our cost. However, many of our competitors have longer operating histories and significantly greater financial or technological resources than we do and presently enjoy greater brand recognition. 

&#160; 

During 2015, 13% from our consolidated revenues was derived from one customer in the petroleum and chemical equipment segment. In December 2015, we received a letter from this customer, pursuant to which the customer claimed that we were delinquent in the delivery of the products and those products that were delivered did not meet the required quality standards. The customer claimed that it is entitled to damages of RMB 36,103,640, or approximately $5,562,365 at December 31, 2015. As a result of the dispute with this customer, the Company, in 2015:

&#160;

&#160; &#9679; Incurred a loss from sales contract dispute of approximately $5,800,000, reflecting the potential liability to this customer based on the customer&#8217;s claim; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Increased our accounts receivable reserve to fully reserve the approximately $1,800,000 due from this customer; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Increased our reserve for obsolete inventory by approximately $800,000, representing the remaining inventory manufactured to the specifications of this customer; and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Recorded an impairment charge of approximately $1,900,000 relating to the manufacturing equipment which was used to manufacture products for this petroleum and chemical equipment customer and is not otherwise used by us. &#160;

We are engaged in discussions with this customer, but cannot predict the results of these discussions. We are also evaluating our ability to continue in the petroleum and chemical equipment segment, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to operate in this segment. 

&#160; 

Source of Supply 

&#160; 

Stainless steel and other metals are the principal raw material for the manufacture of all of our products. We purchase stainless steel tubes from Wuxi City Zhongtian Stainless Steel Co., Ltd. and stainless steel plates from Wuxi City Fanshun Materials Co., Ltd. While we do not have long-term contracts with these suppliers, we have long-term business relationship with them, and these companies have generally met our supply requirements. For the textile machinery business, the price of steel can have more significant impact. Any significant rise in the price of or demand for stainless steel could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Inflation has recently affected raw materials generally, and inflationary pressures could have a significant effect on our business, particularly on our dyeing and finishing equipment segment. To the extent that we are not able to pass along price increases for stainless steel to our forging and petroleum and chemical customers, these factors will affect these two segments as well. 

&#160; 

&#160; 8 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Other raw materials, such as stainless steel planks and transducers, are readily available from a number of suppliers on commercially reasonable terms. 

&#160; 

Research and Development 

&#160; 

We incurred research and development expense in the amount of approximately $99,000 and $116,000 related to the development and improvement of our new dyeing machinery in 2015 and 2014, respectively. We are continuing product development with respect to the new dyeing machinery. 

&#160; 

Government Regulations 

&#160; 

Environmental Regulations 

&#160; 

Our manufacturing processes generate noise, waste water, gaseous and other industrial wastes, and we use, generate and discharge toxic, volatile and otherwise hazardous chemicals and wastes in our operations. As a result, we are required to comply with all national and local regulations regarding protection of the environment. Our operations are subject to regulations promulgated by China&#8217;s Environmental Protection Administration, Jiangsu Province Environmental Protection Administration and the Wuxi City Environmental Administration. We are also subject to periodic monitoring by local environmental protection authorities in Wuxi. We have installed various types of anti-pollution equipment in our facilities to reduce, treat, and, where feasible, recycle the wastes generated in our manufacturing processes. We believe that our manufacturing facilities and equipment are in substantial compliance with all applicable environmental regulations. Based on the requirement of present law, we do not expect that any additional measures that may be required to maintain compliance will materially affect our capital expenditures, competitive position, financial position or results of operations. 

&#160; 

The Chinese government has expressed a concern about pollution and other environmental hazards. Although we believe that we comply with current national and local government regulations, if it is determined that we are in violation of these regulations, we can be subject to financial penalties as well as the loss of our business license, in which event we would be unable to continue in business. Further, if the national or local government adopts more stringent regulations, we may incur significant costs in complying with such regulations. If we fail to comply with present or future environmental regulations, we may be required to pay substantial fines, suspend production or cease operations. Any failure by us to control the use of or to restrict adequately the discharge of, hazardous substances could subject us to potentially significant monetary damages and fines or suspensions in our business operations. 

&#160; 

Our products must also comply with applicable environmental regulations, and we believe we are in material compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations applicable to our products. 

&#160; 

Business License 

&#160; 

Green Power, Fulland Wind Energy and both of the Huayang Companies have been issued business licenses with the appropriate municipal and provincial governments which specifically authorize the companies to operate their respective businesses. All of these business licenses, which are subject to annual review by the issuing agencies, are current as of the date of this annual report. No additional approval or license is required for the manufacturing and sale of the textile dyeing and finishing machines or the rolled rings or petroleum and chemical equipment. 

&#160; 

ISO Certification 

&#160; 

We received the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) certificate for our new facility in Wuxi City on July 15, 2009. The certificate accredits our quality management system as compliant with ISO9001:2008 and covers machining and related service of shaft-shaped forging, ring forging, tubular forging and component assembly. The certification was renewed on December 17, 2015 and expires on December 16, 2018. 

&#160; 

We also received the certificate of Level A Pressure Vessel from the General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine of the People&#8217;s Republic China on August 18, 2009 and covers the manufacturing of pressure vessel pipelines. This certificate was renewed on June 19, 2014 and expires on June 18, 2018. 

&#160;

This certificate expires on December 27, 2018. 

&#160; 

Circular 106 Compliance and Approval 

&#160; 

On May 31, 2007, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, or SAFE, issued an official notice known as &#8220;Circular 106,&#8221; which requires the owners of any Chinese companies to obtain SAFE&#8217;s approval before establishing any offshore holding company structure for foreign financing as well as subsequent acquisition matters in China. Accordingly, in early September 2007, the owners of 100% of the equity in the Huayang Companies, namely Jianhua Wu and Lihua Tang, submitted their application to SAFE. On October 11, 2007, SAFE approved their application, permitting them to establish an offshore company, Fulland, as a &#8220;special purpose vehicle&#8221; for any foreign ownership and capital raising activities by the Huayang Companies. After SAFE&#8217;s approval, Mr. Wu and Ms. Tang became the majority owners of Fulland on October 11, 2007. Fulland was acquired by us in November 2007. 

&#160; 

Draft Foreign Investment Law 

&#160; 

On January 19, 2015, the Ministry of Commerce of China (&#8220;MOFCOM&#8221;) published a draft version of a proposed Foreign Investment Law with an explanatory note. The draft Foreign Investment Law, if and when promulgated, will replace and integrate the three existing laws over foreign investment, the Law of the PRC on Chinese-Foreign Equity Joint Ventures, the Wholly Foreign-owned Enterprise Law and the Law of the PRC on Sino-foreign Cooperative Enterprises. The draft Foreign Investment Law was formulated with a view to opening wider to the outside, promoting and regulating foreign investment, protecting the legitimate rights and interests of foreign investors, safeguarding national security and public interests, and facilitating the healthy development of the socialist market economy. MOFCOM has requested comments from the public on the draft Law by February 17, 2015. 

&#160; 

Some of the more significant concepts in the draft Foreign Investment Law include the following: 

&#160; 

Effective Control 

&#160; 

The proposed law has adopted the concept of effective control in the foreign investment area. The draft Foreign Investment Law notes that a company established in China but controlled by foreign investors shall be deemed a foreign investor and foreign entities controlled by Chinese investors can, in some circumstances, be deemed Chinese domestic investors. According to the draft Foreign Investment Law, &#8220;control&#8221; refers to several circumstances including the contractual control by imposing decisive influences on the operation, finance, personnel or technology of the enterprise by contract, trust or other means. 

&#160; 

Negative List Management 

&#160; 

Most foreign investments will not need pre-approval as was previously required. It means that the Chinese market could be more open and efficient in some sectors to set up foreign invested companies. However, the draft Foreign Investment Law sets out a negative list, or catalogue of prohibitions. Foreign investors are not allowed to invest in any sector set out in the catalogue of prohibitions. Further, a catalogue of restrictions will note those sectors with restrictions imposed on foreign investors. The use of negative lists represents a method of management or administration of foreign investments. 

&#160; 

How domestic VIEs, potentially deemed to be foreign enterprises under the draft Foreign Investment Law and currently operating in Negative List sectors, will be treated is unclear. 

&#160; 

National Security Reviews 

&#160; 

The draft Foreign Investment Law also establishes a united foreign investment national security review system which will conduct examinations on the foreign investments that endangers or may endanger the national security. 

&#160; 

&#160; 10 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Information Reporting System 

&#160; 

The draft Foreign Investment Law establishes a foreign investment information reporting system. The new rules include submission of a foreign investment report (such as when setting up a company), a report of any changes of foreign investment (any adjustments of investment) and an annual report. Generally, reporting obligations arise when a foreign investor purchases not less than 10% of the stock of a domestic entity, or less than 10% but the purchase results in a change of control of the domestic entity. 

&#160; 

Supervision and Inspection 

&#160; 

The draft Foreign Investment Law establishes a mechanism for the supervision and inspection of foreign investors and foreign invested enterprises from industrial and commercial, taxation, foreign exchange, auditing and other administrative departments. The government&#8217;s eye on foreign investments and foreign investment management has shifted from the approval prior to a foreign invested company being established to the supervision and inspection after it is set up. 

&#160; 

PRC laws and regulations governing the validity of these contractual arrangements are uncertain and the relevant government authorities have broad discretion in interpreting these laws and regulations. If the PRC government determines that our contractual arrangements do not comply with applicable laws and regulations, it could revoke our business and operating licenses, require us to discontinue or restrict our operations, restrict our right to collect revenues, block our website, require us to restructure our operations, impose additional conditions or requirements with which we may not be able to comply, or take other regulatory or enforcement actions against us that could be harmful to our business. The imposition of any of these penalties would result in a material and adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business. 

&#160; 

Intellectual Property Rights 

&#160; 

We rely on a combination of trademark, copyright and trade secret protection laws in China and other jurisdictions, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property and our brand. In addition to 24 other patents held by us, the eight Chinese patents, all of which relate to our dyeing products, are our principal patents. The patents were issued by the State Intellectual Property Office of the People&#8217;s Republic of China in November 2012, as to the first patent, and June 2013 as to the other five and September 2014 as to the last two. 

&#160;

The following table sets forth information concerning our eight principal patents.

&#160; 

Patent No. &#160; Description &#160; &#160; Expiration &#160; ZL 2012 2 0165878.7 &#160; a process to enable more-effective cloth washing in dyeing machines under high temperature and pressure &#160; &#160; November 2022 &#160; ZL 2012 2 0752919.2 &#160; atomizer of airflow dyeing machine &#160; &#160; June 2023 &#160; ZL 2012 2 0752924.3 &#160; mechanical seal for dyeing machine &#160; &#160; June 2023 &#160; ZL 2012 2 0752922.4 &#160; horizontal manipulated devices for dyeing machine &#160; &#160; June 2023 &#160; ZL 2012 2 0752921.X &#160; dyeing liquid atomizing device for dyeing machine &#160; &#160; June 2023 &#160; ZL 2012 2 0752917.3 &#160; dyeing liquid mixing device for dyeing machine &#160; &#160; June 2023 &#160; ZL 2013 1 0004772.8 &#160; hot air circulation system of air flow dyeing machines &#160; &#160; September 2034 &#160; ZL 2013 1 0004736.1 &#160; hot air circulation system of air flow dyeing machines &#160; &#160; September 2034 &#160; &#160; 

We intend to apply for more patents to protect our core technologies. We also have confidentiality and non-competition policies in place as part of our company employment guideline which is given to each employee, and we enter into nondisclosure agreements with third parties. However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

As of March 15, 2016, we had 151 full time employees. Of these, 117 employees are in the dyeing and finishing equipment segment (ten executives, managers and administrative staff, four accounting staff, four quality control staff, five engineers and technicians, four marketing and salespeople, one purchasing staff and 89 manufacturing staff), 27 employees are in our forged rolled rings and related products segment (three executive, managers and administrative staff, one accounting staff, two engineers, and 21 manufacturing staff), and 7 employees are with our petroleum and chemical equipment segment (7 manufacturing staff). 

&#160; 

&#160; 11 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Our manufacturing employees usually work in two shifts, based upon our manufacturing requirements. We may also send our engineers and technicians to our customers&#8217; work sites to provide after-sale customer service for them. 

&#160; 

All of these employees are members of a union, organized by the Union for Huishan District, Wuxi City, as mandated by the PRC Union Law. We have not experienced a work strike. We believe that our relations with our employees are good. 

&#160;
