 Item 1. BUSINESS &#160;

Technical Communications Corporation was organized in 1961 as a Massachusetts corporation to engage primarily in consulting activities. Since the late 1960s, the business has consisted entirely of the design, development, manufacture, distribution, marketing and sale of communications security devices, systems and services. The secure communications solutions provided by TCC protect vital information transmitted over a wide range of data, video, fax and voice networks. TCC&#8217;s products have been sold into over 115 countries to governments, military agencies, telecommunications carriers, financial institutions and multinational corporations. The Company&#8217;s business consists of one industry segment, which is the design, development, manufacture, distribution, marketing and sale of communications security devices, systems and services.

&#160;

Overview 

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s products consist of sophisticated electronic devices that enable users to transmit information in an encrypted format and permit recipients to reconstitute the information in a deciphered format if the recipient possesses the right decryption &#8220;key&#8221;. The Company&#8217;s products can be used to protect confidentiality in communications between radios, telephones, mobile phones, facsimile machines and data network equipment over wires, fiber optic cables, radio waves, and microwave and satellite links. The principal markets for the Company&#8217;s products are foreign and domestic governmental agencies, law enforcement and military agencies, financial institutions, and multinational companies requiring protection of mission-critical information.

&#160;

TCC historically and presently designs and develops its own equipment and software to meet the requirements of general secure communications applications, as well as the custom-tailored requirements of specific users. A customer may order equipment that is specially programmed to encrypt transmissions in accordance with a code to which only the customer has access. Management believes the coordinated development of cryptographic software and associated hardware allows TCC to provide high-strength encryption security products with efficient processing and transmission. Both criteria, the Company believes, are essential to customer satisfaction.

&#160;

TCC manufactures most of its products using third-party vendors for the supply of components and selected processing. Final assembly, software loading, testing and quality assurance are performed by TCC at its factory. This manufacturing approach allows TCC to competitively procure the components from multiple suppliers while maintaining control of the manufacture and performance of the final product.

&#160;

TCC&#8217;s products are sold worldwide through a variety of channels depending on the country and the customer. Generally, TCC does not use stocking distributors because the Company&#8217;s products are required to be sold under an applicable U.S. government license, which generally requires end-user information. Rather, the Company sells directly to customers, original equipment manufacturers (&#8220;OEMs&#8221;) and value-added resellers using its in-house sales force as well as domestic and international representatives, consultants and distributors. The marketing and selling approach varies with each country and often involves extensive test and demonstration activity prior to the consummation of a sale. TCC has a network of in-country representatives and consultants who conduct performance demonstrations, market the products and close the sale, and who handle on behalf of TCC many of the ancillary requirements pertaining to importation duties, taxes, registration fees, and product receipt and acceptance. After-sale, in-country support by the representatives maintains customer satisfaction and provides a liaison for the Company&#8217;s customer support services.

&#160;

&#160; 1 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Providing secure communications systems and services for government and military markets worldwide remains a principal focus for TCC, as the Company believes continued concerns over security will sustain demand for increased protection of both voice and data networks. Our focus in the government market also now includes law enforcement special operations customers. Additionally, we see increased interest for secure communications in the corporate industrial sector. The Company is pursuing selected, evolutionary upgrades and product derivatives of our government/military products both to provide entry into these new markets and meet new requirements of our existing customers. We believe the ability of TCC to custom-tailor cryptographic functions and control systems to satisfy unique customer requirements will meet a growing demand as customers become more sophisticated in defining their communications security needs.

&#160;

2016 Highlights and Recent Events 

&#160;

In fiscal 2016, TCC completed delivery of several foreign and domestic contracts for its DSP 9000 radio encryption product family and services received in fiscal 2015, and provided engineering services under contracts received in fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2016. The Company also sold its 10.8% ownership stake in PulsedLight, Inc., an early-stage start-up company, which resulted in a gain on the sale of $462,000. Additionally, in early fiscal 2017, the Company received an order valued at approximately $2,373,000 from Datron World Communications, Inc. for our military-grade DSP 9000 radio encryption equipment. Follow-on orders are expected as part of Datron&#8217;s five-year, $495 million Foreign Military Sales Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity contract from the US Army Communications Electronic Command.

&#160;

Revenue in fiscal 2016 was $2,523,000 with a net loss of $(2,472,000) or $(1.34) per share. Major domestic and international contracts did not materialize during the fiscal year as expected due to long government procurement cycles. TCC&#8217;s backlog at the end of fiscal 2016 was $313,000, as compared to $717,000 at the end of fiscal 2015. However with the order from Datron indicated above, TCC began fiscal 2017 with a backlog of $2.7 million.

&#160;

Offering high-end custom cryptographic services and solutions is an established market niche for the Company and we believe an important competitive differentiator. In fiscal 2016, custom TCC equipment and services continued to provide recurring revenue opportunities within the Company&#8217;s established government systems product line, primarily the DSP 9000 radio encryption product family and engineering services. The Company also has several significant opportunities it is pursuing for foreign government custom network security systems.

&#160;

The market for high-end communications security systems is competitive and subject to long government procurement cycles, unpredictable order fulfillment lead times and fluctuating market conditions. While TCC has a pipeline of potential contracts and initiatives in development, the timing and outcome of these potential contracts is unknown. As such, in fiscal 2016, TCC continued to closely monitor and reduce operating expenses as appropriate, while strategically investing in business development efforts.

&#160;

Technical work continued to focus on three principal areas: development of solutions that meet the needs of OEMs; product enhancements that include expanded features, planned capability and applications growth; and custom solutions that tailor our products and services to meet the unique needs of our customers. Going forward, the Company expects to continue technical efforts in these areas while also increasing our systems design and integration capabilities and services offering portfolio. The following are highlights of our product development efforts in fiscal 2016:

&#160;

&#183; Development to enhance the ability of the DSD 72B-SP fiber optic network encryption family to integrate national algorithms. TCC believes custom algorithm integration is a competitive differentiator for the Company in foreign markets. &#183; Custom development and feature expansion of our HSE 6000 radio encryption product. &#183; Custom engineering services for government applications. &#183; Production readiness of TCC products. &#160;

Escalating turmoil around the world presents both significant opportunities and challenges for TCC. The threat of terrorism and other political unrest increases the demand for security products that provide both strategic and tactical benefits, and are readily available. At the same time, political disruptions can cause unpredictable and erratic delays in the processing of procurements, delivery of products and receipt of payments. The combined effects present a situation that challenges both our sales capture teams and our production capabilities. The Company believes these market conditions will provide opportunities to build a successful future through its efforts to enlarge and enhance its product line and expand its customer base by both identifying new customers for existing and new products and offering such products to current customers.

Products and Services 

&#160;

Described below is TCC&#8217;s portfolio of communications security solutions for mission-critical voice, data and video networks for military, government and corporate/industrial applications.

&#160;

The Government Systems product line has traditionally been the Company&#8217;s core product base and typically generates more than 80% of the Company&#8217;s revenue. During fiscal 2016 there was a shift in business whereby 60% of the Company&#8217;s revenue was generated by our engineering services. Although we expect engineering services to remain strong we also expect that sales of our Government Systems products will constitute the majority of our revenue in the future. These products, such as the DSD 72A-SP military bulk encryptor, CSD 3324 SE telephone/fax encryptor, and DSP 9000 radio encryptor, have proven to be highly durable, which has led to significant repeat business from our government customers. The Company believes that these products and their derivatives will continue to be the Company&#8217;s most significant source of near term future revenues.

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s Secure Office Systems product line had primarily consisted of products that were originally acquired through an asset and rights purchase from a subsidiary of AT&#38;T in 1995. These products are no longer being marketed. While one of these products, the CSD4100 secure executive telephone, is still available and remains profitable, demand for it has diminished in recent years. We will continue to offer this product from existing inventory, which we anticipate will be sufficient for several more years.

&#160;

Offering CipherTalk &#174; secure mobile phone communications since 2005, the Company in fiscal 2016 introduced its next-generation CipherTalk secure mobile IP-based phone. The market for high-end secure wireless mobile phones is competitive and product demand continues to develop modestly. 

&#160;

With the availability of our next-generation IP and SONET/SDH encryptors and ability to integrate customer-specific national algorithms, the Company believes that its Network Security Systems are competitive for a growing niche of mission-critical government and industrial/corporate network applications worldwide. TCC is hopeful that future derivatives of its IP encryptor and KEYNET IP Manager system will expand the market opportunity for these products.

&#160;

The Company also provides customized tools, products and training upon a customer&#8217;s request, as well as design solutions for OEM requirements. In addition, the Company actively sells its engineering services in support of funded research and development. These services are typically billed to a customer on a time and materials basis and can run for several months to several years depending on the scope of the project.

&#160; 

Government Systems 

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s DSD 72A-SP Military Bulk Ciphering System is a rugged military system that provides a high level of cryptographic security for data networks operating at up to 34 million bits per second. The product supports a wide variety of interfaces and is designed to integrate into existing networks. Reliable secure communication is achieved with communication synchronization methods built to maintain connections in error and jamming environments such as radio relay networks, missile systems and microwave systems.

&#160;

TCC&#8217;s DSD 72A-SP (STM) SONET/SDH network encryptor meets the environmental and operational requirements for military environments and operates at 155 Mb/s and 622 Mb/s performance. It is designed to support customers with TCC&#8217;s DSD 72A-SP system that are transitioning to higher speed SONET/SDH networks.

&#160;

&#160; 3 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s DSP 9000 Radio Security family of products offers strategic-level security for voice and data communications sent over HF, VHF and UHF channels. Designed for military environments, the Company believes these products provide high voice quality over poor line connections, making them an attractive security solution for military aircraft, naval, base station and manpack radio applications. These products provide automated key distribution for security and ease of use. They are also radio independent because software programmable interfaces allow radio interface levels to be changed without configuring the hardware. Base station, handset and implant board configurations are available options. All versions interoperate with TCC&#8217;s HSE 6000 Squad Radio Headset and Telephone Encryptor for cross-network secure voice conferencing. The DSP 9000 base station model also interoperates with the Company&#8217;s CSD 3324 SE secure telephone system to enable &#8220;office-to-field&#8221; communications.

&#160;

TCC&#8217;s HSE 6000 Squad Radio Headset and Telephone Encryptor is designed for public safety special operations land mobile radio applications, as well as military applications. With the optional Telephone Interconnect Kit, the HSE 6000 connects to corded handset telephones for secure voice communications and radio-to-telephone conferencing over Voice over IP, digital, and analog telephone networks. It is also interoperable with the DSP 9000 radio security product family, enabling secure voice communications and cross-network conferencing across and between air, land, sea and office.

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s CSD 3324 SE Secure Telephone, Fax and Data system provides strategic-level communications security for voice, fax and data encryption in a telephone package designed for government applications needing high reliability. The product has a fallback mode, which was originally developed for poor HF channels. As a result, secure communications are possible even over poor line conditions. TCC's high-level encryption and automated key distribution system protect sensitive information, and internal storage of 800 keys provides hands-off security.

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s CSD 3324 SP telephone and fax system provides integrated secure voice and fax security in a telephone package designed for government and corporate applications. The CSD 3324 SPV secure telephone secures voice communications over the public switched telephone network and interoperates with the CSD 3324 SP system. TCC&#8217;s CSD 3324 SPF fax encryptor attaches to fax machines to secure fax transmissions and is also compatible with the CSD 3324 SP.

&#160; 

Network Security Systems 

&#160;

TCC offers network encryption systems with KEYNET centralized key and device management for IP, SONET/SDH and frame relay networks to secure data in transit from local area network to local area network and across wide area networks. During 2014 the Company introduced KEYNET Lite, a version of KEYNET for small networks. The Company supports the industry standard Advanced Encryption Standard (&#8220;AES&#8221;) 256-bit cryptographic algorithm and can integrate customer-specific national algorithms to meet customer-specific needs. All of TCC&#8217;s encryption systems are designed to seamlessly overlay onto existing networks without requiring infrastructure changes. Network performance impact is negligible and we believe the systems are easy to deploy, monitor and manage. Additionally, the Cipher X family offers scalable performance to higher speeds without changing hardware. This minimizes the entry cost of deploying a security solution and provides a cost-effective path to meet evolving business needs. Upgrades are licensed and made available on-demand via the KEYNET management system. All performance levels interoperate and are designed to have identical functionality.

&#160;

Cipher X 7211 IP Encryption with KEYNET IP Manager provides strategic-level secure communications for large IP networks for point-to-point and multicast applications such as video conferencing. It offers a unique combination of flexibility, scalable 1 gigabit per second performance and KEYNET IP Manager for ease of use. The Cipher X 7211 is a hardware-based, FIPS 140-2 Level 3 designed encryption device.

&#160;

The DSD 72B-SP and DSD 72A-SP (STM) encryption family with KEYNET Optical Manager provides strategic-level path encryption of voice, data and video transmitted over SONET/SDH networks at wirespeed 155 Mb/s and 622 Mb/s performance. It comes in rugged industrial and industrial versions to meet various environmental and operating requirements. Protocol agnostic, the DSD 72B-SP family interoperates with any standard SDH or SONET network element. Automated KEYNET key and device management provides ease of use. The DSD 72B-SP family is interoperable with the DSD 72A-SP (STM) SONET/SDH encryptor for military environments.

&#160;

Our Cipher X 7100 Frame Relay Encryption with KEYNET key and device management secures data transmitted over frame relay networks at up to 2 megabits per second. Encryption based on both the older Triple DES standard and AES 256-bit algorithm are available and the same KEYNET system manages both system types. This product was designed to enable customers with Triple DES systems to evolve their network to the latest AES 256-bit standard.

&#160; 

&#160; 4 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Secure Office Systems 

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s CSD 4100 Executive Secure Telephone offers strategic-level voice and data security in an executive telephone package. Exceptional voice quality can be achieved with three different voice-coding algorithms. The product provides ease-of-use security features such as automated key management, authentication, certification and access control.

&#160;

The CipherTalk 8500 secure mobile phone is designed to provide military-grade encrypted voice and text communications anywhere in the world over GSM and Wi-Fi networks. Introduced in fiscal 2016, the CipherTalk 8500 IP-based secure wireless phone is built on a hardened Android TM smartphone platform for security and ease of use.

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

The market for communications security devices and systems is highly competitive and characterized by rapid technological change. The Company has several competitors, including foreign-based companies, in the communications security device field. The Company believes its principal competitors include Crypto AG, Thales Group, Motorola Solutions, Inc., General Dynamics Corporation, Omnisec AG, Cisco Systems, Inc., Certes Networks, Inc., Gemalto N.V., Harris Corporation and Silent Circle, Inc.

&#160;

The Company competes based on its service, the operational and technical features of its products, its customization abilities, its sales expertise, and pricing. Many of TCC&#8217;s competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, sales and marketing, distribution and other resources, greater name recognition and longer standing relationships with customers. Competitors with greater financial resources can be more aggressive in marketing campaigns, can survive sustained price reductions in order to gain market share and can devote greater resources to support existing products and develop new competing products.

&#160;

Our competitive position also depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, obtain and maintain intellectual property protection or otherwise develop proprietary products or processes, and secure sufficient capital resources for product, research and development efforts.

&#160;

Sales and Backlog 

&#160;

In fiscal 2016, the Company had three customers representing 90% of total net sales. These sales consisted primarily of our engineering services representing 60% of sales and shipments of our narrowband radio encryptors to a domestic customer for deployment into Afghanistan representing 18% of sales and additional sales of our narrowband radio encryptors to a domestic customer for deployment into North Africa representing 10% of sales. In fiscal 2015, the Company had three customers representing 81% of total net sales. These sales consisted primarily of shipments of our DSD 72A-SP military bulk encryption system to a customer in Egypt representing 55% of sales and shipments of our narrowband radio encryptors to a domestic customer for deployment into Afghanistan representing 13% of sales. We also had sales of our engineering services representing 8% of sales.

&#160;

The Company sells directly to customers, original equipment manufacturers and value-added resellers using its in-house sales force as well as domestic and international representatives, consultants and distributors. International sales are made primarily through our main office. We seldom have long-term contractual relationships with our customers and, therefore, generally have no assurance of a continuing relationship within a given market.

&#160;

Orders for our products are usually placed by customers on an as-needed basis and we typically ship products within 30 to 180 days of receipt of a customer's firm purchase order. Our backlog consists of all orders received where the anticipated shipping date is within 12 months of the order date. Because of the possibility of customer changes in delivery schedules or the cancellation of orders, our backlog as of any particular date may not be indicative of sales in any future period. Our backlog as of October 1, 2016 and October 3, 2015 was approximately $313,000 and $717,000, respectively.

&#160;

&#160; 5 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

The Company expects that sales to a relatively small number of customers will continue to account for a high percentage of the Company&#8217;s revenues for the foreseeable future. A reduction in orders from any such customer, or the cancellation of any significant order and failure to replace such order with orders from other customers, would have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s financial condition and results of operations.

&#160;

Regulatory Matters 

&#160;

As a party to a number of contracts with the U.S. government and its agencies, the Company must comply with extensive regulations with respect to bid proposals and billing practices. Should the U.S. government or its agencies conclude that the Company has not adhered to federal regulations, any contracts to which the Company is a party could be canceled and the Company could be prohibited from bidding on or participating in future contracts. Such a prohibition would have a material adverse effect on the Company.

&#160;

All payments to the Company for work performed on contracts with agencies of the U.S. government are subject to adjustment upon audit by the U.S. Defense Contract Audit Agency, the U.S. Government Accountability Office, and other agencies. The Company could be required to return any payments received from U.S. government agencies if it is found to have violated federal regulations. There have been no government audits in recent years and the Company believes the result of such audits, should they occur, would not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations. In addition, U.S. government contracts may be canceled at any time by the government with limited or no notice or penalty. Contract awards are also subject to funding approval from the U.S. government, which involves political, budgetary and other considerations over which the Company has no control.

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s security products are subject to export restrictions administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce and Department of State, which license the export of encryption products, subject to certain technical restrictions. In addition, U.S. export laws prohibit the export of encryption products to a number of hostile countries. Although to date the Company has been able to secure necessary U.S. government export licenses, there can be no assurance that the Company will continue to be able to secure such licenses in a timely manner in the future, or at all.

&#160;

The U.S. government controls, through a licensing process, the distribution of encryption technology and the sale of encryption products. The procedure for obtaining the applicable license from either the Department of Commerce or the Department of State (depending on the U.S. government&#8217;s determination of jurisdiction) is well documented. The Company submits a license request application, which contains information pertaining to: the type of equipment being sold; detailed technical description (if required); the buyer; the end-user and use; quantity; and destination location. The appropriate departments of the U.S. government review the application and a licensing decision is provided to the Company. Pursuant to the receipt of the license, the Company may ship the product.

&#160;

Many of TCC&#8217;s products can be sold under existing &#8220;blanket&#8221; licenses which have been obtained through a variant of the licensing process that approves products for sale to certain classes of customers (e.g. financial institutions, civilian government entities and commercial users). The Company has obtained &#8220;blanket&#8221; licenses for its secure telephone and office system products and its family of network encryptors. Licenses for sales of certain other products and/or to certain end users must be submitted for specific approval as described above. Although the U.S. government retains the right and ability to restrict product exports, the Company does not believe that U.S. government licensing will become more restrictive or an impediment to its business. The trend has been for the U.S. government to reduce the restrictions on the foreign sale of cryptographic equipment. TCC believes this trend is driven by the government&#8217;s recognition of the technology available from foreign sources and the need to allow domestic corporations to compete in foreign markets. However, should the regulations become more restrictive, it would have a negative impact on the Company&#8217;s international business, the impact of which could be material.

&#160;

The costs and effects of compliance by the Company with applicable environmental laws during fiscal 2016 were, and historically have been, immaterial. In 2003 the European Union adopted the &#8220;Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive 2002/95/EC&#8221;. In the event the Company&#8217;s sales to Europe increase, the Company may have to incur additional costs to provide for the disposal of its products in compliance with that directive.

&#160;

&#160; 6 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Manufacturing 

&#160;

TCC has several manufacturing subcontractors and suppliers that provide outside processing of electronic circuit boards, fabrication of metal components, and supply of electronic components. For the majority of purchased materials and services, TCC has multiple suppliers that are able to deliver materials and services under short-term delivery purchase orders. Payment is typically made after delivery, based upon standard credit arrangements. For a small minority of parts, there are limited sources of supply. In such cases, TCC monitors source availability and usually stocks for anticipated long-term requirements to assure manufacturing continuity. Notwithstanding the Company&#8217;s efforts to maintain material supplies, shortages can and do develop, resulting in delays in production, significant engineering development effort to find alternative solutions and, if production cannot be maintained, the discontinuation of the affected product design.

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s internal manufacturing process consists primarily of adding critical components, final assembly, quality control, testing and system burn-in. Delivery times vary depending on the products and options ordered.

&#160;

Technological Expertise 

&#160;

TCC&#8217;s technological expertise and experience, including certain proprietary rights which it has developed and maintains as trade secrets, are crucial to the conduct of the Company&#8217;s business. Management is of the opinion that, while patent protection is desirable with respect to certain of its products, none of the Company's patents are material to the conduct of its business. Eight patents have been issued to the Company. The Company also has a number of registered and unregistered trademarks for various products, none of which are material to the conduct of TCC&#8217;s business.

&#160;

TCC has an on-going technology license for communications protocol software used in the CipherONE family of Network Security System products. The license is royalty-based and runs without a specified termination date. The cost of this license is immaterial.

&#160;

TCC has been designing and producing secure, cryptography-based communications systems for over 50 years, during which time the Company has developed many technological techniques and practices. This expertise and experience is in the areas of cryptographic algorithm design and implementation, key distribution and management systems, cryptographic processors, voice and fax encryption, and electronic hardware design. TCC relies on its internal technical expertise and experience, which TCC considers to be proprietary. These proprietary technologies are owned by TCC, are under TCC&#8217;s control, and have been documented consistent with standard engineering practices. It is estimated that the majority of sales during the past two years and during the next two years will be of products that are based upon TCC-proprietary designs. 

&#160;

Such technological experience and expertise are important as they enable an efficient design and development process. Loss of this experience and expertise would have an adverse impact on the Company. However, TCC&#8217;s practices governing the internal documentation of design data mitigate some of the risk associated with the loss of personnel who are skilled in the core competencies described above.

&#160;

With the exception of the technology license referred to above, TCC has no material third party rights upon which the Company relies. Sales of the products associated with this license have not been and are not anticipated to be significant to the Company&#8217;s revenues.

&#160;

Research and Development 

&#160;

Research and development efforts are undertaken by the Company primarily on its own initiative. In order to compete successfully, the Company must attract and retain qualified personnel, improve existing products and develop new products. No assurances can be given that the Company will be able to hire and train such technical management and sales personnel or successfully improve and develop its products.

&#160;

During the fiscal years ended October 1, 2016 and October 3, 2015, the Company spent $828,000 and $2,300,000, respectively, on internal product development. The Company also spent $1,178,000 and $223,000, on billable development efforts during fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively. In fiscal 2016, the Company&#8217;s total product development costs were 20% lower than fiscal 2015 but in line with its planned commitment to research and development, and reflected the costs of custom development, product capability enhancements and production readiness. It is expected that product development expenses in fiscal 2017 will be in line with fiscal 2016 levels.

&#160;

&#160; 7 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Technical work continued to focus on three principal areas: development of solutions that meet the needs of OEMs; product enhancements that include expanded features, planned capability and applications growth; and custom solutions that tailor our products and services to meet the unique needs of our customers. Going forward, the Company expects to continue technical efforts in these areas while also increasing our systems design and integration capabilities and services offering portfolio. The following are highlights of our product development efforts in fiscal 2016:

&#160;

&#183; Development to enhance the ability of the DSD 72B-SP fiber optic network encryption family to integrate national algorithms. &#183; Custom development and feature expansion of our HSE 6000 radio encryption product. &#183; Custom engineering services for government applications. &#183; Production readiness of TCC products. &#160;

Foreign Operations 

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s results of operations are dependent upon its foreign sales, including domestic sales shipped to foreign end-users. Although foreign sales were more profitable than domestic sales during fiscal years 2016 and 2015 because the mix of products sold abroad included a greater number of products with higher profit margins, this does not represent a predictable trend. Sales to foreign markets have been and will continue to be affected by, among other things, the stability of foreign governments, foreign and domestic economic conditions, export and other governmental regulations, and changes in technology. The Company attempts to minimize the financial risks normally associated with foreign sales by utilizing letters of credit confirmed by U.S. and foreign banks and by using foreign credit insurance. Foreign sales contracts are usually denominated in U.S. dollars.

&#160;

The Company utilizes the services of sales representatives, consultants and distributors in connection with foreign sales. Typically, representatives are paid commissions and consultants are paid fixed amounts on a stipulated schedule in return for services rendered. Distributors are granted discounted pricing.

&#160;

The export from the United States of many of the Company&#8217;s products may require the issuance of a license by the Department of State under the Arms Export Control Act of 1976, as amended, or by the Department of Commerce under the Export Administration Act as kept in force by the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977, as amended. The licensing process is discussed in more detail under the &#8220;Regulatory Matters&#8221; section above.

&#160;

In fiscal years 2016 and 2015, sales directly to international customers accounted for approximately 8.4% and 63.1%, respectively, of our net sales. During those periods a significant portion of domestic sales (20% and 34%, respectively) were made to a domestic radio manufacturer that shipped our radio encryption products overseas for use in Afghanistan. Based on our historical results we expect that international sales, including sales to domestic customers that ship to foreign end-users, will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future. As a result, we are subject to the risks of doing business internationally, including:

&#160;

&#183; changes in regulatory requirements, &#183; domestic and foreign government policies, including requirements to expend a portion of program funds locally and governmental industrial cooperation requirements, &#183; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, &#183; delays in placing orders, &#183; the complexity and necessity of using foreign representatives, consultants and distributors, &#183; the uncertainty of the ability of foreign customers to finance purchases, &#183; uncertainties and restrictions concerning the availability of funding credit or guarantees, &#183; imposition of tariffs or embargoes, export controls and other trade restrictions, &#183; the difficulty of managing and operating an enterprise spanning several countries, &#183; compliance with a variety of foreign laws, as well as U.S. laws affecting the activities of U.S. companies abroad, and &#160;

&#160; 8 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; economic and geopolitical developments and conditions, including international hostilities, acts of terrorism and governmental reactions, inflation, trade relationships and military and political alliances. &#160;

While these factors and their impact are difficult to predict, any one or more of these factors could adversely affect our operations in the future.

&#160;

We also may not be successful in obtaining the necessary licenses to conduct operations abroad, and the U.S. government may prevent proposed sales to foreign governments or other end-users.
