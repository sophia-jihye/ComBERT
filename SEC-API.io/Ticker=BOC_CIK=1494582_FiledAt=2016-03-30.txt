 Item 1. Business.

Introduction

Since June 2015, Boston Omaha Corporation has been in the business of outdoor billboard advertising, acquiring existing billboard locations in Florida, Alabama, Georgia and Wisconsin. In September 2015, we organized a new subsidiary, General Indemnity Group, LLC, which intends to commence business operations in the near future in acquiring and underwriting specialty property and casualty commercial lines, characterized by high policy count and low limits. We also have acquired a minority interest in a full service commercial real estate brokerage, property management and real estate services company located in Las Vegas, Nevada and minority interests in several other commercial and residential real estate ventures. Our objective is to grow intrinsic value per share at an attractive rate by retaining capital to reinvest in the productive capabilities of our current subsidiaries, make opportunistic investments, and/or invest in new, anticipated durable earnings streams. Each of these options for capital will be compared to one another on a regular basis, and capital deployed according to our management's judgment as to where allocated capital has the potential to achieve the best return. 

Our History

&#160;

Boston Omaha Corporation was originally incorporated as REO Plus, Inc. on August 10, 2009 under the laws of the State of Texas. On March 18, 2015, we reincorporated as a Delaware corporation and changed our name to Boston Omaha Corporation. Our principal address is 292 Newbury Street, Suite 333, Boston, Massachusetts 02115 and our telephone number is 857-256-0079.

&#160;

We were formed by a Delaware corporation then known as "Akashic Ventures, Inc." for purposes of acquiring financially attractive real estate properties. Richard J. Church acquired control of Akashic on May 18, 2008. Until early 2010, Richard Church was a 40% owner of Ananda Investments, LLC ("Ananda"), a Texas member-managed limited liability company that owns a particular real estate property near and west of downtown Houston, Texas. In early 2010, Mr. Church transferred his 40% ownership in Ananda to us. In exchange, we issued to Mr. Church shares of our common stock as part of the purchase price for the Ananda interest. As a result of the Ananda transfer, we became the largest owner of Ananda by a significant margin. 

On February 13, 2015, Mr. Church entered into an agreement with each of Boulderado Partners, LLC ("Boulderado") and Magnolia Capital Fund, LP ("Magnolia") whereby Mr. Church sold to each of Boulderado and Magnolia 126,825 shares of our common stock owned by Mr. Church at a purchase price of $.007 per share (these share and per share prices reflect a subsequent 1:7 reverse stock split). These constituted all of the shares of common stock owned by Mr. Church, representing approximately 95% of our issued and outstanding shares. Mr. Church also sold to each of Boulderado and Magnolia a 50% interest in a promissory note issued by us to Mr. Church in the principal amount of $298,224. Mr. Church also conveyed to each of Boulderado and Magnolia a 50% interest in another promissory note issued by us to Mr. Church in the principal amount of $100,000. Finally, Mr. Church retained a non-recourse promissory note issued by Ananda Holding, LLC ("Holding"), our wholly-owned subsidiary, in the principal amount of $135,494 (the "Holding Note"). These debt instruments, which in their principal amounts total $533,718, replaced all prior debt instruments issued by us to Mr. Church.

As part of the overall transaction, we transferred to Holding all of our equity interests in Ananda Investments, LLC. Holding pledged to Mr. Church our interest in Ananda Investments as security for repayment of the sums due under the Holding Note. Under the terms of the Holding Note, Holding could transfer our entire interest in Ananda Investments to Mr. Church in exchange for the Holding Note and Mr. Church could exchange the Holding Note for our entire interest in Ananda Investments. In December 2015, Mr. Church received the interest in Ananda Investments in exchange for cancellation of the Holding Note. 

On February 19, 2015, Mr. Church appointed Alex B. Rozek, a principal of Boulderado Group, LLC, as our sole Director and President. On March 18, 2015, Mr. Rozek elected Adam K. Peterson, a principal of Magnolia Capital Fund, L.P. as an additional Director and as our Executive Vice President. Mr. Rozek and Mr. Peterson serve as Co-Chief Executive Officers and Co-Chairmen of the Board of the Company. Mr. Brendan J. Keating was subsequently elected to our Board of Directors in February 2016. 

O n March 18, 2015, we converted from a Texas corporation to a Delaware corporation. This action was taken by means of an action by consent of stockholders owning approximately 95% of our issued and outstanding common stock. Notice of the conversion, and of the rights of existing stockholders to certain appraisal rights, were mailed by our transfer agent to all stockholders of record of our common stock as required by the laws of the State of Texas. No stockholder sought to exercise any appraisal rights. As part of the reincorporation, our name was changed to "Boston Omaha Corporation." Our Certificate of Incorporation reduced the number of authorized shares of common stock from 500,000,000 to 30,000,000 shares and reduced the number of "blank check" preferred shares available for future designation from 10,000,000 to 3,000,000 shares. As part of our conversion to a Delaware corporation, we also adopted new bylaws. 

On June 17, 2015, we amended and restated our Certificate of Incorporation. This action was taken by means of an action by consent of stockholders owning approximately 95% of our issued and outstanding common stock. As part of the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, we:

* Effected a 1:7 reverse stock split effective as of June 17, 2015. This reverse stock split does not impact the number of shares of Class A common stock subsequently issued on June 19, 2015.

* Created 12,000,000 shares of Class A common stock. Each share of Class A common stock is identical to the common stock in liquidation, dividend and similar rights. The only difference is that each Class A common stock has 10 votes for each share held, while the common stock has a single vote per share and certain actions cannot be taken without the approval of the holders of the Class A common stock. 

&#160;

On June 19, 2015, and in connection with the acquisition of 35 billboard structures with 70 faces from Bell Media, LLC for a purchase price of $6,684,604, we entered into subscription agreements with each of Boulderado and Magnolia, whereby each of Boulderado and Magnolia purchased 500,000 shares of our newly established Class A common stock at a purchase price of $10.00 per share, resulting in gross proceeds to us of $10,000,000. Each of Boulderado and Magnolia also extinguished all principal and interest due under two promissory notes, each in the principal amount of $149,112, assigned to Boulderado and Magnolia on February 13, 2015 from Richard Church, the original holder of the notes. As a result of this note extinguishment, each of Boulderado and Magnolia received 15,164 additional shares of Class A common stock. At the same time, Boulderado and Magnolia also converted all sums due under the $100,000 convertible promissory notes we issued to each of them on April 10, 2015, such that each of Boulderado and Magnolia received 12,616 shares of Class A common stock at a conversion price of $8.00 per share. In addition, each of Boulderado and Magnolia received warrants to purchase one share of Class A common stock at a price of $10.00 per share for each 10 shares of Class A common stock purchased, resulting in each of Boulderado and Magnolia receiving warrants to purchase 52,778 shares of Class A common stock. These warrants are exercisable at any time on or before June 18, 2025. Each of the two holders of these warrants are entitled to purchase 51,516 shares of Class A common stock at an exercise price of $10.00 per share and 1,262 shares of Class A common stock at an exercise price of $8.00 per share.

On July 22, 2015, we entered into subscription agreements with each of Boulderado and Magnolia whereby Boulderado purchased 250,000 shares of our common stock and Magnolia purchased 1,200,000 shares of our common stock, each at a purchase price of $10.00 per share, resulting in gross proceeds to us of $14,500,000.

&#160;

On July 23, 2015, Link Media Florida, LLC, which is owned by Link Media Holdings, LLC, our subsidiary, entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Fair Outdoor, LLC and the equityholders of Fair Outdoor, LLC by which Link Media Florida, LLC acquired one digital billboard structure with two faces, rights to develop a second billboard, an option to purchase a third billboard and related assets from Fair Outdoor, LLC. The billboards and related assets are located in Tampa, Florida on property owned by the Florida State Fairground Authority. The purchase price for the acquired assets was $1,945,061. 

&#160;

On August 31, 2015, Link Media Alabama, LLC, which is owned by Link Media Holdings, LLC, entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with I-85 Advertising, LLC, the members of I-85 Advertising, LLC and Canton Partners (an affiliate of I-85 Advertising, LLC), by which Link Media Alabama, LLC acquired five billboard structures with 10 faces, rights to certain easements, and related assets from I-85 Advertising, LLC. The billboards and related assets are located along Interstate 85 in Georgia. The purchase price for the acquired assets was $1,294,900.

On September 11, 2015, we formed General Indemnity Group, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary, which we intend to use to acquire and underwrite potential future insurance operations. 

On October 14, 2015, we purchased an 8.33% interest in DFH Leyden, LLC, a Florida limited liability company ("DFH"), whose principal business is to manage the acquisition, holding, operation, management, financing and sale of residential real estate in Colorado. The purchase price of the investment was $377,732. This is an opportunistic investment which we expect will conclude with the return of principal and profit interests once the building and sale of a specific number of housing units is completed. In December 2015, we acquired a 30% ownership position in Logic Real Estate Companies, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("Logic"), which manages commercial real estate. Brendan J. Keating, a member of our Board of Directors, holds a controlling interest in Logic. We paid $195,000 for our ownership position in Logic. In contrast to our DFH investment, which we expect to be finite in duration, we intend our minority ownership in Logic to be perpetual with our share of any recurring earnings over time to accrue indefinitely as long as Logic is in business. These are both examples of opportunistic investments made as a result of management's flexibility to deploy capital in minority investments in certain circumstances and when majority ownership is not possible.

&#160;

On October 19, 2015, we amended our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to reduce the authorized number of shares of our Class A common stock from 12,000,000 to 1,300,000, which in turn increased the authorized number of shares of our common stock not designated as Class A common stock from 18,000,000 to 28,700,000. 

On December 31, 2015, we transferred to Richard Church our 40% stake in Ananda Holdings in exchange for the extinguishment of the Holding Note. Following the extinguishment of the Holding Note, our guaranty to a commercial bank of the mortgage securing the Ananda real estate was released. 

In January 2016, we commenced an offering of shares of our common stock to accredited investors (the "2016 Financing"). This Offering may raise up to $50,000,000 through the issuance of a maximum of 4,926,108 shares of common stock at a price of $10.15 per share, and it is expected to remain open until the earlier of June 30, 2016 or the date in which all of the shares available for sale have been sold. The shares will be issued pursuant to Rule 506 of Regulation D. No commissions are payable in connection with the financing. As of March 24, 2016, we have received investments totaling approximately $25,122,033 from 12 investors. This sum includes cash investments of approximately $18,000,000 from Magnolia, approximately $2,500,000 from Boulderado and approximately $253,750 from a trust in which Brendan J. Keating, one of our directors, has a beneficial interest. This sum also includes the conversion by each of Magnolia and Boulderado of approximately $53,000 in notes we issued to them to shares of common stock.

&#160;

Prior to the commencement of the 2016 Financing, we had issued and outstanding 1,716,954 shares of common stock, 1,055,560 shares of Class A common stock and warrants to purchase 105,556 shares of Class A common stock. The 2,475,077 shares of common stock sold in the 2016 Financing to date constitute approximately 47.23% of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock and Class A common stock as of March 30, 2016, excluding shares of Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants. Including the shares issued in the 2016 Financing to date, and assuming all currently exercisable warrants are exercised, Magnolia and Boulderado collectively own approximately 91.91% of our current outstanding shares of common stock on a combined basis. As each share of Class A common stock has 10 votes for each share of common stock, Magnolia and Boulderado combined control the voting of 97.26% of all votes held by the holders of Class A common stock and common stock on a combined basis.

Each holder of our common stock on January 15, 2016 who is an accredited investor will be eligible to participate in a rights offering of common stock, which we anticipate will commence later this year when the 2016 Financing is completed. Under the terms of the rights offering, each of our stockholders may participate based on his, her or its proportionate ownership of common stock prior to the commencement of the 2016 Financing and will have at least 35 days from the commencement date of the rights offering to elect to subscribe to purchase common stock at a price of $10.15 per share of common stock. Boulderado and Magnolia will not participate further in the rights offering. 

On February 16, 2016, Link Media Wisconsin, LLC, which is owned by Link Holdings, LLC, our subsidiary, entered into an asset purchase agreement with Jag, Inc. and the sole voting shareholder of Jag, Inc., by which Link Media Wisconsin, LLC acquired billboards with 422 faces, 50 directional signs and other related assets from Jag, Inc. The billboards, directional signs and related assets are located in Wisconsin. The purchase price for the acquired assets was $6,954,246, of which $687,500 was placed in escrow and the remainder was paid at closing. The purchase price is subject to certain post-closing working capital adjustments. We also purchased a digital display structure with two faces located in Florida from Rose City Outdoor, LLC. The purchase price for these assets was $287,320.

On March 11, 2016, we amended our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to reduce the authorized number of shares of our common stock from 18,000,000 to 11,000,000 shares, designated 1,161,116 shares of our common stock as Class A common stock and decreased our authorized shares of preferred stock from 3,000,000 to 1,000,000 shares.

We became a publicly held corporation in November 2012 when Akashic distributed to certain of its shareholders a total of 930,493 shares of Company common stock held by it. We have not yet registered as a reporting company under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, but intend to do so in the near future.

Industry Background

We currently operate outdoor billboard advertising and intend to sell certain insurance products in the future. 

Outdoor Billboard Advertising : Several very large companies involved in outdoor advertising, such as Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings, OUTFRONT Media Inc. and Lamar Advertising Company are estimated to jointly own more than 50% of the outdoor billboard market. Ownership of the remainder of the market is highly fragmented, with ownership by numerous smaller and local companies operating a limited number of billboards in a single market or a few local markets. We also compete with other advertising media in our respective markets, including broadcast and cable television, radio, print media, direct mail, online and other forms of advertisement. Outdoor advertising companies compete primarily based on ability to reach consumers, which is driven by location of the billboards . 

&#160;

Insurance Services : &#160; General Indemnity Group LLC ("GIG") was incorporated as a Delaware limited liability corporation in September 2015, and started operations on October 4, 2015, with the hiring of Michael Scholl, ACAS, MAAA as President. During 2015, GIG did not write any insurance business, or generate any other income. In December 2015, GIG submitted its captive insurance application to the District of Columbia Department of Insurance, Securities and Banking ("DISB"). In February 2016, DISB approved the formation of General Indemnity Group Insurance Company PCC, LLC. GIG intends to use this captive entity to bear underwriting risk in specialized property casualty insurance programs. Targeted lines of business generally have high policy count, low limits, low claim frequency and smaller average premium size in their niche classes of business. GIG will actively look to purchase books of business in these specialized areas, by either acquiring the distribution or the risk bearing entity. GIG intends to employ a hybrid distribution model, working both on a direct basis as well as through the traditional agency model. 

Strategy 

Since present management took over in February 2015, the Company has been recapitalized with $44,500,000 of additional capital provided by Boulderado and Magnolia, including approximately $20,500,000 in the current ongoing 2016 Financing in which the Company seeks to raise up to $50,000,000, and has also converted debt principal and accrued interest in the amount of $505,154 held by Boulderado and Magnolia into Class A common stock and warrants. In addition, we have sold to date an additional $4,516,773 of common stock to ten additional investors in the 2016 Financing. We have used a portion of these proceeds from these financings to acquire outdoor billboard assets in Alabama, Florida, Georgia and Wisconsin. At the end of February 2016, we had $29,296,891 available in unrestricted cash. We expect to continue to seek additional acquisitions in billboard advertising. We believe the billboard business offers the potential to provide a durable and growing cash flow stream over time. In addition, we believe multiple opportunities could exist in time for the industry at large including but not limited to: supply limitations, demand growth, opportunity to convert static billboard faces to digital applications when the economics are favorable, and a growing use of billboard advertising by customers who previously ignored or underutilized the medium due to the general inflexibility of static board contracts. We have also used the proceeds of these financings to organize General Indemnity Group, LLC a wholly-owned subsidiary, which we intend to use to acquire and underwrite potential future insurance operations. Finally, we spent $377,732 to acquire a minority interest in a residential real estate development group in Colorado, $195,000 to acquire a 30% stake in a commercial real estate brokerage, and property management company based in Nevada, $97,500 to acquire a minority stake in a business in retail centers in Nevada, and $ 159,167 to acquire a minority stake in another real estate development company.

&#160;

We source acquisitions both internally via phone calls, research or mailings and also by receipt of target acquisition opportunities from a number of brokers and other professionals. In addition to acquiring outdoor billboards, we are also seeking opportunities to acquire other businesses or a significant interest in existing businesses. We look to acquire businesses in their entirety that have consistently demonstrated earnings power over time, with attractive pretax historical returns on tangible equity capital, while utilizing minimal to no debt, and that are available at a reasonable price. However, we may consider minority positions and stock issuance when the economics are favorable. In certain circumstances, we may enter lines of business directly when the opportunities and economics of doing so are favorable in comparison to acquisitions.

&#160; &#160; 

We will continue to identify and evaluate prospective acquisitions and intend to use our current cash position to effect additional acquisitions as well as provide working capital for our anticipated insurance operations, including funding any minimum capital requirements imposed by regulatory agencies. We do not presently intend to invest in bonds, preferred stocks or common stocks. However, our Board of Directors may elect to make these investments in the future without a vote of shareholders. 

Billboard Advertising . We seek to capitalize on our growing network and diversified geographical and product mix to grow revenues. We currently own billboard structures containing over 500 faces and 50 directional advertising signs in Wisconsin, Alabama, Florida and Georgia. These include 17 digital displays and 17 tri-vision static displays. Each of our billboard structure may have one to four faces. We believe the outdoor advertising business offers attractive industry fundamentals which we hope to utilize and leverage as we plan to continue to grow our presence in the United States. We hope that our growing presence will be an attractive tool in identifying and attracting both local and national advertisers. We work with our customers to enable them to better understand how our billboards can successfully reach their target audiences and promote their advertising campaigns. Our long-term strategy for our outdoor advertising businesses includes pursuing digital display opportunities where appropriate while simultaneously utilizing traditional methods of displaying outdoor advertisements.

&#160;

&#160; Digital displays offer the opportunity to link electronic displays through centralized computer systems to instantaneously and simultaneously change advertising copy on a large number of displays. The ability to change copy by time of day and quickly change messaging based on advertisers' needs creates additional flexibility for our customers. However, digital displays require more capital to construct compared to traditional bulletins and may not be sited in many locations due to concerns over their light disrupting communities. Currently, our largest presence is in Wisconsin and Alabama, with additional locations in Georgia and Florida. We currently deploy 17 billboard structures utilizing digital displays and we also have options to establish two additional structures with four digital displays in Florida in the area adjacent to the Florida State Fairgrounds in Tampa.

&#160;

Our local production staffs provide to many of our customers a range of services required to create and install advertising copy. Production work includes creating the advertising copy design and layout, coordinating its printing with outside printing firms and installing the copy on the billboard face. We provide creative services to smaller advertisers and to advertisers not represented by advertising agencies. National advertisers often use preprinted designs that require only installation. Our creative and production personnel typically develop new designs or adapt copy from other media for use on our inventory. Our creative staff also can assist in the development of marketing presentations, demonstrations and strategies to attract new clients.

&#160;

We typically own the physical structures on which our clients' advertising copy is displayed. We acquire new structures from third parties and erect them on sites we either lease or own or for which we have acquired permanent easements. The site lease terms generally range from one to 20 years and often come with renewal options, or exist in areas where we believe that regulations make it probable a new lease will be signed prior to expiration on similar economic terms to existing leases. In addition to the site lease, we must obtain a permit to build the sign. Permits are typically issued in perpetuity by the state or local government and typically are transferable or renewable for a minimal, or no, fee. Traditional bulletin and poster advertising copy is either printed with computer generated graphics on a single sheet of vinyl or placed on lithographed or silk-screened paper sheets supplied by the advertiser. These advertisements are then transported to the site and in the case of vinyl, wrapped around the face of the site, and in the case of paper, pasted and applied like wallpaper to the site. The operational process also includes conducting visual inspections of the inventory for display defects and taking the necessary corrective action within a reasonable period of time.

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

The outdoor advertising industry in the United States and Canada consists of several large companies involved in outdoor advertising which own a majority of all outdoor billboards, such as Clear Channel Outdoor Communications, OUTFRONT Media Inc. and Lamar Advertising Company. In addition, there are numerous smaller and local companies operating a limited number of billboards in a single market or a few local markets. Part of our strategy is to acquire smaller and medium sized competitors in markets we deem desirable to advertisers. We also compete with other advertising media in our respective markets, including broadcast and cable television, radio, print media, direct mail, online and other forms of advertisement. Outdoor advertising companies compete primarily based on ability to reach consumers, which is driven by location of the display.

Our insurance business intends to operate in an environment that is highly competitive and very fragmented. We will likely compete with other global insurance and reinsurance providers, including but not limited to Travelers, Liberty Mutual, Zurich Insurance Group, Lloyds, and CNA Insurance Group, as well as numerous specialist, regional and local firms in almost every area of our business. These companies may market and service their insurance products through intermediaries, or directly without the assistance of brokers or agents. We also expect to compete with other businesses that do not fall into the categories above that provide risk-related services and products.

&#160;

Employees

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015, we had eight employees, of which five were in direct operations and three were in administrative or corporate related activities. Only one employee was employed in our insurance group. None of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements. We believe that our relationship with our employees is good.

&#160;

Regulation of our Advertising Business

&#160;

The outdoor advertising industry in the United States is subject to governmental regulation at the federal, state and local levels. These regulations may include, among others, restrictions on the construction, repair, maintenance, lighting, upgrading, height, size, spacing and location and permitting of and, in some instances, content of advertising copy being displayed on outdoor advertising structures. 

&#160;

From time to time, legislation has been introduced attempting to impose taxes on revenue from outdoor advertising or for the right to use outdoor advertising assets. Several jurisdictions have imposed such taxes as a percentage of our outdoor advertising revenue generated in that jurisdiction. In addition, some jurisdictions have taxed our personal property and leasehold interests in advertising locations using various valuation methodologies. In certain circumstances, such as our current Tampa operations, when we lease space from a governmental authority, we may enter into revenue sharing agreements with the authority. We expect jurisdictions to continue to try to impose such taxes and other fees as a way of increasing revenue. In recent years, outdoor advertising also has become the subject of targeted taxes and fees. These laws may affect prevailing competitive conditions in our markets in a variety of ways. Such laws may reduce our expansion opportunities or may increase or reduce competitive pressure from other members of the outdoor advertising industry. No assurance can be given that existing or future laws or regulations, and the enforcement thereof, will not materially and adversely affect the outdoor advertising industry. 

&#160;

In the United States, federal law, principally the Highway Beautification Act ("HBA"), regulates outdoor advertising on Federal-Aid Primary, Interstate and National Highway Systems roads within the United States ("controlled roads"). The HBA regulates the size and placement of billboards, requires the development of state standards, mandates a state's compliance program, promotes the expeditious removal of illegal signs and requires just compensation for takings.

&#160;

To satisfy the HBA's requirements, all states have passed billboard control statutes and regulations that regulate, among other things, construction, repair, maintenance, lighting, height, size, spacing and the placement and permitting of outdoor advertising structures. We are not aware of any state that has passed control statutes and regulations less restrictive than the prevailing federal requirements on the federal highway system, including the requirement that an owner remove any non-grandfathered, non-compliant signs along the controlled roads, at the owner's expense and without compensation. Local governments generally also include billboard control as part of their zoning laws and building codes regulating those items described above and include similar provisions regarding the removal of non-grandfathered structures that do not comply with certain of the local requirements. 

&#160;

As part of their billboard control laws, state and local governments regulate the construction of new signs. Some jurisdictions prohibit new construction, some jurisdictions allow new construction only to replace or relocate existing structures and some jurisdictions allow new construction subject to the various restrictions discussed above. In certain jurisdictions, restrictive regulations also limit our ability to relocate, rebuild, repair, maintain, upgrade, modify or replace existing legal non-conforming billboards.

&#160;

U.S. federal law neither requires nor prohibits the removal of existing lawful billboards, but it does mandate the payment of compensation if a state or political subdivision compels the removal of a lawful billboard along the controlled roads. In the past, state governments have purchased and removed existing lawful billboards for beautification purposes using federal funding for transportation enhancement programs, and these jurisdictions may continue to do so in the future. From time to time, state and local government authorities use the power of eminent domain and amortization to remove billboards. Amortization is the required removal of legal non-conforming billboards (billboards which conformed with applicable laws and regulations when built, but which do not conform to current laws and regulations) or the commercial advertising placed on such billboards after a period of years. Pursuant to this concept, the governmental body asserts that just compensation is earned by continued operation of the billboard over that period of time. Although amortization is prohibited along all controlled roads, amortization has been upheld along non-controlled roads in limited instances where permitted by state and local law. In the first nine months of our operations, we have not been asked or forced to remove or relocate a billboard, although there is no assurance that this will continue to be the case in the future.

We may expand the deployment of digital billboards in markets and in specific locations we deem appropriate and where the placement of these digital displays is permitted by government agencies regulating their locations. We are aware of some existing regulations in the U.S. that restrict or prohibit these types of digital displays. However, since digital technology for changing static copy has only recently been developed and introduced into the market on a large scale, and is in the process of being introduced more broadly, existing regulations that currently do not apply to digital technology by their terms could be revised to impose greater restrictions. These regulations, or actions by third parties, may impose greater restrictions on digital billboards due to alleged concerns over aesthetics or driver safety.

Regulation of Our Anticipated Insurance Business

GIG and its subsidiaries intend to transact their insurance business in many U.S. states and will be subject to regulation in the various states and jurisdictions in which they intend to operate. The extent of regulation varies, but generally derives from statutes that delegate regulatory, supervisory and administrative authority to a department of insurance in each state and jurisdiction. The regulation, supervision and administration relate, among other things, to standards of solvency that must be met and maintained, the licensing of insurers and their agents, the nature of and limitations on investments, premium rates, restrictions on the size of risks that may be insured under a single policy, reserves and provisions for unearned premiums, losses and other obligations, deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders, approval of policy forms and the regulation of market conduct, including the use of credit information in underwriting as well as other underwriting and claims practices. State insurance departments also conduct periodic examinations of the financial condition and market conduct of insurance companies and require the filing of financial and other reports on a quarterly and annual basis. The states in which GIG and its subsidiaries intend to operate may limit the payment of dividends from GIG to us and, as a result, to our stockholders if and when we ever declare a dividend from the operations of GIG and its subsidiaries. Currently, we do not anticipate issuing dividends for the foreseeable future.

&#160;

&#160;

Rate and Rule Approvals. GIG's domestic insurance subsidiaries will be subject to each state's laws and regulations regarding rate and rule approvals. The applicable laws and regulations generally establish standards to ensure that rates are not excessive, inadequate, unfairly discriminatory or used to engage in unfair price competition. An insurer's ability to adjust rates and the relative timing of the process are dependent upon each state's requirements. Many states have enacted variations of competitive ratemaking laws, which allow insurers to set certain premium rates for certain classes of insurance without having to obtain the prior approval of the state insurance department. 

&#160;

Requirements for Exiting Geographic Markets and/or Canceling or Nonrenewing Policies. &#160; Several states have laws and regulations which may impact the timing and/or the ability of an insurer to either discontinue or substantially reduce its writings in that state. These laws and regulations typically require prior notice, and in some instances insurance department approval, prior to discontinuing a line of business or withdrawing from that state, and they allow insurers to cancel or non-renew certain policies only for certain specified reasons. 

Insurance Regulatory Information System. &#160; The National Association of Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC") developed the Insurance Regulatory Information System ("IRIS") to help state regulators identify companies that may require regulatory attention. Financial examiners review annual financial statements and the results of key financial ratios based on year-end data with the goal of identifying insurers that appear to require immediate regulatory attention. Each ratio has an established "usual range" of results. A ratio result falling outside the usual range, however, is not necessarily considered adverse; rather, unusual values are used as part of the regulatory early monitoring system. Furthermore, in some years, it may not be unusual for financially sound companies to have several ratios with results outside the usual ranges. Generally, an insurance company may become subject to regulatory scrutiny or, depending on the company's financial condition, regulatory action if certain of its key IRIS ratios fall outside the usual ranges and the insurer's financial condition is trending downward. 

Risk-Based Capital (RBC) Requirements. &#160; The NAIC has an RBC requirement for most property and casualty insurance companies, which determines minimum capital requirements and is intended to raise the level of protection for policyholder obligations. Our future U.S. insurance subsidiaries may be subject to these NAIC RBC requirements based on laws that have been adopted by individual states. These requirements subject insurers having policyholders' surplus less than that required by the RBC calculation to varying degrees of regulatory action, depending on the level of capital inadequacy. 

Investment Regulation. Insurance company investments must comply with applicable laws and regulations which prescribe the kind, quality and concentration of investments. In general, these laws and regulations permit investments in federal, state and municipal obligations, corporate bonds, preferred and common equity securities, mortgage loans, real estate and certain other investments, subject to specified limits and certain other qualifications. 

&#160; Other Factors in Our Business Strategy 

Acquisition Selection

As stated above, our management will have broad discretion in identifying and selecting prospective target acquisitions, and acquisitions are not likely to be submitted to shareholders for their consideration, and approval or rejection. In evaluating a prospective target acquisition, our management will consider, among other factors, the following: 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

* Management's understanding of conditions of the particular market;

&#160;

* Management's assessment of the financial attractiveness of a particular target relative to other available targets, and its potential for upside appreciation and return on investment; and

&#160;

* Capital requirements and management's assessment of the ability to finance a particular target.

&#160;

&#160; Issuance of senior and additional securities 

To the extent that our Board of Directors determines to obtain additional capital, it may issue debt or equity securities, including senior securities. Existing shareholders will have no preemptive rights to common or preferred stock issued in any securities offering by us, and any such offering might cause a dilution of a stockholder's investment in our company. Additional possible effects of such an offering are described in the risk factor captioned " We may need a significant amount of additional capital, which could substantially dilute your investment ." 

&#160;

Borrowing of money 

We may use a number of different sources to finance the Company's acquisitions and operations, including cash flows from operations, seller financing, private financings (such as bank credit facilities, which may or may not be secured by our assets), common or preferred equity issuances or any combination of these sources, to the extent available to us, or other sources that may become available from time to time, which could include asset sales and issuance of debt securities. Any debt that we incur may be recourse or non-recourse and may be secured or unsecured. We also may take advantage of joint venture or other partnering opportunities as such opportunities arise in order to acquire properties that would otherwise be unavailable to us. We may use the proceeds of any future borrowings to acquire assets or for general corporate purposes. We expect to use leverage conservatively, assessing the appropriateness of new equity or debt capital based on market conditions, including assumptions regarding future cash flow, the creditworthiness of customers and future rental rates. Our certificate of formation and bylaws do not limit the amount of debt that we may incur. Our Board of Directors has not adopted a policy limiting the total amount of debt that we may incur. Our Board of Directors will consider a number of factors in evaluating the amount of debt that we may incur. If we adopt a debt policy, our Board of Directors may from time to time modify such policy in light of then-current economic conditions, relative costs of debt and equity capital, market values of our properties, general conditions in the market for debt and equity securities, fluctuations in the market price of our common stock if then trading on any exchange, growth and acquisition opportunities and other factors. Our decision to use leverage in the future to finance our assets will be at our discretion and will not be subject to the approval of our stockholders, and we are not restricted by our governing documents or otherwise in the amount of leverage that we may use.

Purchase and sale (or turnover) of acquired businesses

We do not currently intend to dispose of any of our properties in the near future as our strategy is to acquire assets which have the potential to generate significant cash flow over an extended period of time. However, we reserve the right to do so if, based upon management's periodic review of our portfolio, our Board of Directors determines that such action would be in our best interest.

&#160;

Offering of securities in exchange for property

&#160;

Although we have no current plans to do so, we may in the future issue shares of common stock or units in connection with acquisitions of businesses. For issuances of shares in connection with acquisitions, our Board of Directors will determine the timing and size of the issuances. Our Board of Directors intends to use its reasonable business judgment to fulfill its fiduciary obligations to our then existing shareholders in connection with any such issuance. Nonetheless, future issuances of additional shares could cause immediate and substantial dilution to the net tangible book value of shares of our common stock issued and outstanding immediately before such transaction.

Any future decrease in the net tangible book value of such issued and outstanding shares could materially and adversely affect the market value of the shares. 

Shareholder reports

We do not intend to mail annual or other reports to security holders except as required by the proxy rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission"). The annual reports required by these rules will contain financial statements certified by independent public accountants. 

Activities in which we do not expect to participate

We do not intend to invest in the securities of other issuers for the purpose of exercising control, underwrite securities of other issuers, and repurchase or otherwise reacquire our shares or other securities. Moreover, we have not engaged in any of the preceding activities since our inception

&#160;

Policies applicable to directors and officers &#160; 

Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws do not restrict any of our directors, officers, stockholders or affiliates from having a pecuniary interest in an investment to be acquired or disposed of or transaction in which we have an interest, or from conducting, for their own account, business activities of the type we conduct. Since February 2015, we have not acquired any property interest from any of our current officers or directors. We do not presently intend to engage in a similar transaction in the future, although this intention could change. In the case of future transactions involving a related party, our Board of Directors will review the relevant facts and circumstances (including whether the transaction is on terms comparable to those that could be obtained in arm's length dealings with an unrelated third party) before approving such transaction. However, we cannot provide any assurance that this policy will always be successful in protecting fully the interests of all shareholders. 

&#160;

Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act

The Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, or the JOBS Act, was signed into law on April 5, 2012. Under this law, we are an "emerging growth company." This status entails significant advantages, which are discussed below. To be an "emerging growth company," a company must have: 

&#160;

&#160; &#160; * &#160; Less than $1 billion in annual revenue 

&#160; &#160; * &#160; Gone public after December 8, 2011 

&#160; &#160; * &#160; Issued no more than $1 billion in debt 

&#160; &#160; * &#160; Floated no more than $700 million in stock 

&#160;

Companies meeting these requirements have the following significant advantages:

&#160;

&#160; &#160; * &#160; They must report only two years of audited financial statements when they file to go public 

&#160; &#160; * &#160; They can submit a draft registration statement to the SEC for confidential review, which will not be publicly filed until at least 21 days before the road show for the offering 

&#160; &#160; * &#160; They can "test the waters" by communicating with qualified investors to determine whether such investors might have an interest in a contemplated securities offering 

&#160; &#160; * &#160; Underwriters of their initial public offering may be able to issue research reports on the stocks ahead of the offerings 

&#160; &#160; * &#160; They need not comply with any new or revised financial accounting standards until such date such standards are also applicable to private companies 

&#160; &#160; * &#160; For up to five years, they will be exempt from certain disclosures dealing with executive compensation 

&#160; &#160; * &#160; They will not be required to have an auditor attest to their internal financial controls over financial reporting 

&#160; &#160; * &#160; They are exempt from future rules of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (which oversee the audits of public companies) mandating auditor rotation or making modifications to the auditor's report 

&#160; &#160; * &#160; They do not have to give shareholders a vote on executive compensation, or a so-called "Say-on-Pay Vote." 

An emerging growth company will lose its status as such on the earliest of the following:

&#160; &#160; * &#160; The last day of the fiscal year in which the company had $1 billion or more in annual gross revenues 

&#160; &#160; * &#160; The last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the company's initial public offering 

&#160; &#160; * &#160; The date on which the company has, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt 

&#160; &#160; * &#160; The date on which the company is deemed a "large accelerated filer." 

Certain Federal Income Tax Consequences of Share Ownership

The following is a general discussion of certain of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of holding and disposing of our common stock by U.S. Holders and Non-U.S. Holders (each as defined below). This discussion is based on the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, applicable Treasury regulations, administrative interpretations and court decisions all as in effect as of the date hereof, and all of which may change, possibly with retroactive effect. No ruling has been or will be sought from the Internal Revenue Service, or the IRS, as to the matters addressed herein, and the following summary is not binding on the IRS or the courts. As a result, the IRS could adopt a contrary position, and a court could sustain such a contrary position.

For purposes of this discussion, a "U.S. Holder" is a beneficial owner of the Company's common stock that is:

&#160;

&#160; &#160; * &#160; A citizen or individual resident of the United States;

&#160; &#160; * &#160; A corporation, or other entity taxable as a corporation, created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia;

&#160; &#160; * &#160; An estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source; or

&#160; &#160; * &#160; A trust if either (i) the trust is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and one or more U.S. persons as described in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (ii) the trust has a valid election in effect under applicable U.S. Treasury regulations to be treated as a U.S. person.

&#160;

A "Non-U.S. Holder" is a beneficial owner of our common stock that is not a U.S. Holder.

This discussion does not address all of the tax consequences that may be relevant to specific Holders in light of their particular circumstances or the U.S. federal income tax considerations applicable to Holders subject to special treatment under U.S. federal income tax law, including, for example, brokers or dealers in securities, financial institutions, mutual funds, insurance companies, tax-exempt entities, Holders who hold our common stock as part of a hedge, appreciated financial position, straddle, or other risk reduction strategy, Holders who acquired their common stock other than for cash, Holders which are treated as partnerships or other pass-through entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes or investors in such entities and Holders liable for the alternative minimum tax. Furthermore, this discussion only addresses Holders who purchase our common stock in this distribution and hold such common stock as capital assets within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code. No information is provided herein with respect to the tax consequences of the holding or disposing of our common stock under applicable state, local or foreign laws or any estate or gift tax consequences. Prospective Holders are urged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal tax consequences of owning and disposing of our common stock, as well as the applicability and effect of any state, local or foreign tax laws.

If an entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds our common stock, the tax treatment of a partner or member in such entity will generally depend upon the status of the partner or member and the activities of the entity. If you are a partner or member of such an entity that holds our common stock, you should consult your own tax advisor.

&#160;

U.S. Holders 

Distributions

Generally, a distribution by us with respect to our common stock will be treated as a taxable dividend to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits (as determined under U.S. federal income tax principles). To the extent that the amount of a distribution exceeds our current and accumulated earnings and profits, the excess will constitute a tax-free return of capital to the extent of a Holder's tax basis in the common stock, and thereafter as gain from the sale or exchange of such common stock, the taxation of which is described under the heading "Sales, Exchanges or Other Taxable Dispositions." Certain Holders (including individuals) may qualify for preferential U.S. federal income tax rates in respect of dividend income. Holders that are corporations may be eligible for a dividend-received deduction in respect of a dividend distribution.

Sales, Exchanges or Other Taxable Dispositions

Upon the sale, exchange or other taxable disposition of our common stock, a Holder generally will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between (i) the amount of cash and the fair market value of any property received upon the sale, exchange or other taxable disposition, and (ii) such Holder's adjusted tax basis in the common stock. Such gain or loss generally will be capital gain or loss, and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the Holder's holding period is more than one year at the time of sale or disposition. Certain Holders (including individuals) can qualify for preferential U.S. federal income tax rates in respect of long-term capital gains. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to certain limitations.

Non-U.S. Holders 

Distributions

Dividends paid by us to a Non-U.S. Holder will be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax at a 30% rate, unless (i) an applicable income tax treaty reduces or eliminates such tax, and a Non-U.S. Holder provides us with an IRS Form W-8BEN (or successor form) certifying its entitlement to the benefit of such treaty, or (ii) the dividends are effectively connected with a Non-U.S. Holder's conduct of a trade or business in the United States and the Non-U.S. Holder provides us with an IRS Form W-8ECI (or successor form). In the latter case, a Non-U.S. Holder generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax with respect to such dividends in the same manner as a U.S. person, unless otherwise provided in an applicable income tax treaty. Additionally, a Non-U.S. Holder that is a corporation may be subject to a branch profits tax on its after-tax effectively connected dividend income at a rate of 30% (or at a reduced rate under an applicable income tax treaty). If a Non-U.S. Holder is eligible for a reduced rate of U.S. federal withholding tax pursuant to an income tax treaty, such Non-U.S. Holder may obtain a refund of any excess amount withheld by filing an appropriate claim for refund with the IRS.

To the extent that the amount of a distribution exceeds our current and accumulated earnings and profits, the excess will constitute a tax-free return of capital to the extent of a Holder's tax basis in the common stock, and thereafter as gain from the sale or exchange of such common stock, the taxation of which is described under the heading "Sales, Exchanges or Other Taxable Dispositions."

Sales, Exchange or Other Taxable Dispositions

Generally, a Non-U.S. holder will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a gain realized upon the sale, exchange or other disposition of our common stock unless (i) such Non-U.S. Holder is an individual present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of the sale, exchange or other disposition and certain other conditions are met, (ii) the gain is effectively connected with such Non-U.S. Holder's conduct of a trade or business in the United States and, where a tax treaty so provides, the gain is attributable to a U.S. permanent establishment of such Non-U.S. Holder, or (iii) we are or have been a "U.S. real property holding corporation" for U.S. federal income tax purposes at any time during the shorter of the five-year period ending on the date of disposition or the period that the Non-U.S. Holder held our common stock and either (a) our common stock has ceased to be traded on an "established securities market" prior to the beginning of the calendar year in which the sale, exchange or other disposition occurs, or (b) the Non-U.S. Holder owns (actually or constructively) more than five percent of our common stock (the "Five Percent Exception"). While not anticipated, it is possible that we could become a "U.S. real property holding corporation", in which case gains from a disposition of our common stock (including from a distribution in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits and in excess of a Non-U.S. Holder's tax basis in its common stock) will be subject to tax under the Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act, or FIRPTA, unless the Non-U.S. Holder met the Five Percent Exception. If the gain on the disposition of common stock were to be subject to tax under FIRPTA, such Non-U.S. Holder would be required to file a U.S. federal income tax return and would be subject to U.S. federal income tax in the same manner as a U.S person with respect to the gain (subject to applicable alternative minimum tax and a special alternative minimum tax in the case of nonresident alien individuals). In that case, withholding tax at a rate of 10.0% of the proceeds of the sale could apply, which withholding tax would be creditable against such Non-U.S. Holder's U.S. federal income tax liability.

&#160;

Legislation has been enacted that will materially change the requirements for obtaining an exemption from U.S. withholding tax and impose withholding taxes on certain types of payments made to "foreign financial institutions" and certain other non-U.S. entities after December 31, 2013. In general, and depending on the specific facts and circumstances, the failure to comply with certain certification, information reporting and other specified requirements will result in a 30% withholding tax being imposed on "withholdable payments" to such institutions and entities, including payments of dividends and proceeds from the sale of our common stock. Prospective investors should consult their tax advisors regarding this legislation and the potential implications of this legislation on their investment in our common stock.

&#160;

Certain U.S. Holders that are individuals, estates or trusts may be required to pay an additional 3.8% tax on dividends received on, and on capital gains realized on a sale or other disposition of, our common stock. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the effect, if any, of this legislation on them. 

Backup Withholding and Information Reporting 

Information returns will be filed with the IRS in connection with dividend payments on our common stock and the proceeds from a sale or other disposition of the common stock. A Holder will be subject to U.S. backup withholding tax on these payments if the Holder fails to provide its taxpayer identification number to the paying agent and to comply with certain certification procedures or otherwise to establish an exemption from backup withholding. The amount of any backup withholding from a payment to a Holder will be allowed as a credit against the Holder's U.S. federal income tax liability and may entitle the Holder to a refund, provided that the required information is timely furnished to the IRS, and other applicable requirements are satisfied.
