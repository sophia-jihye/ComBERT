 Item 1. Business 

As used herein, references to &#8220;NetScout,&#8221; the &#8220;Company,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us&#8221; and &#8220;our&#8221; are to NetScout Systems, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries or, as the context may require, NetScout Systems, Inc. only. 

Overview 

We are an industry leader for real-time operational intelligence and performance analytics for service assurance and cyber security solutions that are used in many of the most demanding service provider, enterprise and government networks. Our solutions, based on proprietary Adaptive Service Intelligence&#8482; (ASI) technology, help customers continuously monitor the service delivery environment to identify performance issues and to provide insight into network-based security threats. As a result, customers can quickly resolve issues that cause business disruptions or that adversely impact the user experience. We manufacture and market these products for integrated hardware and software solutions and are also well positioned to help customers deploy our software in commercial-off-the-shelf hardware and in virtualized form factors. Regardless of the platform, customers use our solutions to help drive ROI on their network and broader IT initiatives while reducing the tangible risks associated with downtime, poor service quality and compromised security. We report revenues and income under five operating segments that aggregate under a single reportable segment. 

We have been a technology innovator for three-plus decades since our founding in 1984. Our market-leading solutions change how organizations manage and optimize the delivery of business applications and services, assure user experience across global IP networks and help protect networks from unwanted security threats. Through both internal development and acquisitions, we have continually enhanced and expanded our product portfolio to meet the evolving needs of customers worldwide. Our software analytics capture and transform terabytes of network traffic data in real time into high value, actionable information that enables customers to optimize network performance, manage applications, enhance security and gain insight into the end-user experience. 

Our operating results are influenced by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the mix and quantity of products and services sold, pricing, costs of materials used in our products, growth in employee related costs, including commissions, and the expansion of our operations. Factors that affect our ability to maximize our operating results include, but are not limited to, our ability to introduce and enhance existing products, the marketplace acceptance of those new or enhanced products, continued expansion into international markets, development of strategic partnerships, competition, successful acquisition integration efforts, our ability to achieve expense reductions and make structural improvements and current economic conditions. 

On July 14, 2015, which we also refer to as the Closing Date, we completed the acquisition of Danaher Corporation&#8217;s (Danaher) Communications Business (Communications Business), which included certain assets, liabilities, technology and employees within Tektronix Communications, VSS Monitoring, Arbor Networks and certain portions of the Fluke Networks Enterprise business, which excluded Danaher&#8217;s data communications cable installation business and its communication service provider business (the Transaction). The Transaction was structured as a Reverse Morris Trust transaction whereby Danaher contributed the Communications Business to a new subsidiary, Potomac Holding, LLC (Newco). The total equity consideration was approximately $2.3 billion based on issuing approximately 62.5 million new shares of NetScout common stock to the holders of common units of Newco, based on the July 13, 2015 NetScout common stock closing share price of $36.89 per share. The Transaction is expected to more than double NetScout's total addressable market to over $8 billion by extending its reach into growth-oriented adjacent markets, including cyber security, with a broader range of market-leading products and capabilities, strengthen its go-to-market resources to better support a larger, more diverse and more global customer base, and increase NetScout's scale and elevate its strategic position within key accounts. For additional information regarding the Transaction, see Note 7 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

We provide a range of network security solutions that enable enterprises to protect their networks from high-volume and application-specific attacks, and identify unauthorized intrusions into the network that can pose significant threats to the integrity of sensitive information and key business operations. We also provide incident response activities with deep-dive network forensics and offer contextual information surrounding a specific alert or incident to enhance investigative capabilities and avoid false positives. 

Government Markets 

Similar to our enterprise markets, government agencies are focused on streamlining and transforming IT into more efficient and more easily managed environments. To accomplish this, agencies are turning to IT solutions that will help simplify managing and assuring their IT environments as well as reduce costs. However, governmental markets differ from enterprise markets primarily due to their purchasing cycles being influenced by potential changes in government administrators, budgetary priorities and allocated funding for key projects. 

Telecommunication Service Provider Markets 

Today&#8217;s service providers are focused on delivering a compelling set of services and ensuring a high-quality user experience, while also striving to minimize operational complexity and costs. This, coupled with the challenge of Internet 

Protocol (IP) transformation activities and emerging new technologies such as LTE, virtualization, Internet Protocol Television (IP-TV), wireless network (WiFi) and cloud services drives the need for a more automated and unified approach to managing service delivery and the subscriber experience. Service providers must reduce the cost of service delivery, address increasing complexity, scale their networks cost-effectively and adapt to emerging technologies such as cloud services, virtualization and 5G while assuring high-quality user experiences to retain their revenue base. Additionally, service providers must protect their networks from high-volume, increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks that consume bandwidth and potentially create outages that impact their business customers. 

&#8226; 

For Mobile Operators &#32;&#8211; The fundamental transformation of the mobile network to all-IP enables mobile operators to build highly-scalable service delivery environments to offer new services to meet the growing subscriber demand for data, voice and video-centric services and to consolidate and simplify network operations. However, to capitalize fully on the value of IP and the significant market opportunities, mobile operators need detailed IP packet-level insight and core-to-access visibility. The addition of the Tektronix Communications assets provides a broader range of capabilities that monitor radio access networks as well as powerful analytics that provide insight into subscriber trends and their customer experience. 

&#8226; 

For Fixed-line and Cable Operators &#32;&#8211; The growing demand for high-bandwidth triple-play services, broadband connectivity, content anywhere, IP-TV, on-demand video traffic, new extended WiFi initiatives and carrier Ethernet services presents service providers with significant revenue opportunities. IP has become the de facto &#32;convergence mechanism for access, distribution and core networks, enabling new service offerings and simplifying network operations while reducing total cost of operations. For example, we are also starting to see cable operators use our solutions to monitor and manage their local area WiFi connectivity services. To realize these benefits, operators need comprehensive insight into IP services, service usage, service availability, application awareness, traffic load, network availability and network performance. 

&#8226; 

For Internet Service Providers &#8211; Over the past decade, Internet Service Providers (ISPs), including leading telecommunications providers, cable multi service operators and cloud providers, have seen significant increases in the sophistication, scale and frequency of high-volume and application-specific attacks, known as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, on their networks. DDoS attacks are aimed at disrupting the online services of an ISP&#8217;s business customer by overwhelming it with traffic from multiple sources. Arbor Networks provides a wide range of ISPs around the world with solutions that help them protect their networks against DDoS attacks. 

Products &#38; Technology Overview 

NetScout continuously develops its solutions to meet the increasing demands and ever changing technology landscape of IP networks, service and applications.

To have greater operational impact on assuring performance of applications and service delivery, NetScout has integrated its technology with third-party management consoles and business service management systems. This integration allows organizations to receive alarms on impending performance problems and to link into the nGenius Service Assurance solution in order to perform detailed problem analysis and troubleshooting. Moving forward, NetScout plans to make its ASI-level data accessible to third party platforms. In addition, Arbor has embedded its DDoS mitigation capabilities on a blade within Cisco's market-leading ASR9000 router and will continue to evaluate partnership opportunities to integrate its DDOS capabilities within other network equipment platforms. By providing seamless integration into management platforms, NetScout fills a significant gap in the third-party product functionality and visibility into the interaction of applications, services and infrastructure resources from a packet-based network vantage point. NetScout collaborates with technology partners to provide integrated solutions and extend the value of the nGenius Service Assurance Solution for application and network performance management across the organization. Using packet-flow data, key performance indicators and other sources of performance information derived from the nGenius Service Assurance Solution, an organization&#8217;s ability to optimize, simplify and protect the service delivery environment is enhanced. Among the third-party solutions providers that NetScout has integrated its solutions with are Cisco Systems, Cisco Sourcefire, Citrix Systems, EMC Corporation, Hewlett-Packard Company, IBM Tivoli and VMWare. 

Growth Strategy 

Our key objectives have been to continue to gain market share in the service provider market and to accelerate our enterprise growth by extending into the application performance management sector. In addition, given the nature of the customers in our government sector, we believe future cybersecurity products would be effective in this market. We believe that the Transaction (see Note 7 of our Consolidated Financial Statements) will further accelerate key elements of our strategy, which include: 

&#8226; 

Driving technology innovation &#32;&#8211; NetScout will continue to invest in research and development, and leverage the strong technical and domain expertise across its organization. As a result of the acquisition of the Transaction, NetScout has a broader base of research and development talent, exceeding 1,200 professionals as of March 31, 2016. The Company&#8217;s engineering teams will be focused on advancing technical innovation across its broad product portfolio. By capitalizing on NetScout&#8217;s extensive experience with global enterprise, service provider and government organizations with IP-based networks, NetScout will be well positioned to cross-leverage its technology development across all major platforms and relevant technologies to address the evolving demands of current and prospective customers. 

&#8226; 

Continued portfolio enhancements and product integration &#8211; We plan to continue to enhance our products and solutions to address the management challenges associated with virtualization, cloud computing, service-oriented architectures, VoIP, video, telepresence technologies, and network security. In addition, we will continue to drive our solutions to help IT organizations address the challenges of complex service delivery, datacenter consolidation, branch office consolidation and optimization, increasing mobility and the move to a more process-oriented operating environment. During fiscal year 2017, additional investment will be focused on integrating key capabilities from the acquired assets to further elevate NetScout&#8217;s value proposition to both service provider and enterprise customers. For example, we plan to bring an integrated probing solution to market for service providers that will support both the high-value subscriber troubleshooting capabilities from Tektronix Communications and NetScout&#8217;s traditional proactive, continuous IP monitoring capabilities. Other examples of product integration will focus on leveraging NetScout&#8217;s ASI technology to consolidate certain troubleshooting, monitoring and security capabilities from Fluke Networks Enterprise and Arbor within the broader nGeniusONE offerings. 

&#8226; 

Future extension into adjacent markets &#8211; &#32; By enhancing and expanding NetScout&#8217;s product portfolio and driving product integration, NetScout will be positioned to further build its presence in complementary adjacent markets that can drive higher spending from existing customers, help attract new customers, and increase its total addressable market. Certain product initiatives are intended to help us make progress on this element of our strategy during fiscal year 2017. 

&#8226; 

Enable pervasive visibility &#32;&#8211; We intend to continue to expand our intelligent data source family to enable our customers to achieve greater visibility into more places across their end-to-end network environment. By driving product integration and innovation, we plan to integrate various capabilities, including our Adaptive Service Intelligence software, across the combined company's product portfolio to enable wider deployment of our technology within virtual computing environments, network devices and computing platforms and to support a broader range of network and application performance management, security and business intelligence requirements. 

&#8226; 

Expand our customer base in both enterprise and service provider markets &#32;&#8211; As a result of the Transaction, NetScout has a larger direct sales force with specialized expertise in targeting the enterprise, service provider and government markets, along with a more extensive global network of value-added resellers and systems integrators. It is our intention to substantially grow our presence in both the enterprise and service provider markets. In the enterprise market, we plan to further expand our relationships with existing large and mid-sized customers, further fortify third-party distribution channels for the enterprise tools products, and help accelerate enterprise adoption of Arbor&#8217;s cybersecurity products. We will also continue to drive further penetration into our global service provider customer base. 

&#8226; 

Increase market relevance and awareness &#8211; The Transaction has substantially expanded our customer base around the world. NetScout will continue to implement marketing campaigns aimed at generating high-quality sales opportunities with both current and prospective enterprise and service provider customers, promoting thought leadership and building the NetScout brand. 

&#8226; 

Extend our technology partner alliance ecosystem &#32;&#8211; We will continue to develop and fortify alliances with complementary solutions providers that can help us support a larger, more global and more diverse customer base. We plan to continue to enhance our technology value, product capabilities and customer relevance through the continued integration of our products into technology partner products. This includes both interoperability integration efforts, as 

well as embedding our technology into alliance partner products to gain a more extensive footprint across both enterprise and service provider networks. 

&#8226; 

Pursue strategic acquisitions &#8211; We have completed many acquisitions since the Company&#8217;s inception, including the fiscal year 2016 Transaction, that have helped broaden our capabilities, enhance our products and technologies, and better position the Company to meet the needs of a larger base of customers and prospects. We plan to be opportunistic in pursuing strategic acquisitions in order to achieve key business and technology objectives. 

&#8226; 

Improve cost structure and drive efficiencies &#32;&#8211; We will continue to focus on directing prudent investment into the key technology, product development, sales and marketing, and other initiatives that will enable us to drive long-term profitable growth. We believe that the Transaction creates a range of opportunities to further improve the Company&#8217;s profitability. NetScout plans to generate gross margin synergies by driving product integration and extending its proven manufacturing techniques, and optimizing certain product lines. In addition, NetScout plans to integrate certain operations that have previously been managed separately across various business and product lines, winding down transitional support agreements, consolidating back-office systems, and by continuing to eliminate or reduce redundancies associated with pre-existing resources, programs and capabilities. 

Support Services 

Customer satisfaction is a key driver of NetScout&#8217;s success. NetScout&#8217;s support programs offer customers various levels of high quality support services to assist in the deployment and use of our solutions. We have support personnel strategically deployed across the globe to deliver 24/7 telephone support to our premium customers. Certain support services, such as on-site support activities, are provided by qualified third party support partners. In addition, many of our certified resellers provide Partner Enabled Support to NetScout end-users. This is especially prevalent in international locations where time zones and language, among other factors, make it more efficient for end-users to have the reseller provide initial support functions. Our support also includes updates to our software and firmware at no additional charge, if and when such updates are developed and made generally available to our commercial customer base. If ordered, support commences upon expiration of the standard warranty for software. For software, which also includes firmware, the standard warranty commences upon shipment and expires 90 days thereafter. With regard to hardware, the standard warranty commences upon shipment and expires 12 months thereafter. We believe our warranties are consistent with commonly accepted industry standards. NetScout will continue to provide support services for the acquired platforms under existing agreements and will explore opportunities to further simplify and standardize its support obligations over the coming years. 

Manufacturing 

Our manufacturing operations consist primarily of final product assembly, configuration and testing. We purchase components and subassemblies from suppliers and construct our hardware products in accordance with NetScout standard specifications. We inspect, test and use process control to ensure the quality and reliability of our products. We maintain an ISO 9001 quality systems registration, a certification showing that our corporate procedures and manufacturing facilities comply with standards for quality assurance and process control. We also maintain an ISO 9001:2000 quality systems registration, a certification showing that our corporate procedures comply with standards for continuous improvement and customer satisfaction. Additionally, we have outsourced the manufacturing of certain acquired products to high-quality third-party contract manufacturers. 

Although we generally use standard parts and components for our products, which are available from various suppliers, each of the computer network interface cards used in our devices is currently available only from separate single source suppliers. We have generally been able to obtain adequate supplies of components in a timely manner from current suppliers. While currently we purchase from specific suppliers, we believe that, in most cases, alternate suppliers could be identified if current suppliers are unable to fulfill our needs. Our reliance on single source suppliers is further described in Item 1A &#8220;Risk Factors.&#8221; 

We manufacture our products based upon near-term demand estimates resulting from sales forecasts and historical fulfillment information. Due to the fact that these forecasts have a high degree of variability because of such factors as time of year, overall economic conditions and employee incentives, we maintain inventory levels in advance of receipt of firm orders to ensure that we have sufficient stock to satisfy incoming orders. 

Sales and Marketing 

Sales 

We sell our products, support and services through a direct sales force and an indirect reseller and distribution channel. 

&#32;Our direct sales force uses a &#8220;high-touch&#8221; sales model that consists of face-to-face meetings with customers to understand and identify their unique business challenges and requirements. Our sales teams then translate those requirements 

into tailored business solutions that allow the customer to maximize the performance of its infrastructure and service delivery environment. Due to the complexity of the systems and the capital expenditure involved, our sales cycle typically takes three to twelve months. We build strategic relationships with our customers by continually enhancing our solution to help them address their evolving service delivery management challenges. In addition to providing a comprehensive solution to meet these needs, we continually provide software enhancements to our customers as part of their maintenance contracts with us. These enhancements are designed to provide additional and ongoing value to our existing customers to promote loyalty and the expansion of their deployment of our products. Existing customer growth is also driven by the expansion and changes in their networks as they add new infrastructure elements, new users, new locations, new applications and experience increasing service traffic volumes. 

We also maintain an indirect reseller and distribution channel. Sales to customers outside the United States are primarily export sales through channel partners. Our channel partners assist us by improving our reach to customers, extending our presence in new markets, and marketing and selling our products to a broad array of organizations globally. We sell through a range of channel partners including value added resellers, value added distributors, resellers, and system integrators, to our enterprise, service provider and government customers. Historically and currently, we have used indirect distribution channels principally as intermediaries on contractual terms for customers with whom we have no contract. Our sales force meets with end user customers to present NetScout products and solutions, conduct demonstrations, provide evaluation equipment, recommend detailed product solutions, develop product deployment designs and timelines, and assist in establishing financial and other justification for the proposed solution. During this selling process, a channel partner, who has contracts with both the end customer and NetScout, may be brought in to facilitate the transaction and to provide fulfillment services. In the case of international channel partners, those services usually also include currency translation and support. In the U.S., fulfillment services are usually limited to invoicing and cash collection. Under this approach, we have limited dependence upon channel partners for the major elements of the selling process. In many cases, there are multiple channel partners with the required contractual relationships, so dependence on any single channel partner is not significant. 

During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 , one &#32;direct customer accounted for more than 10% of total revenue, while no &#32;indirect channel partner accounted for more than 10% of total revenue. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015 , two &#32;direct customers accounted for more than 10% of total revenue, while no &#32;indirect channel partner accounted for more than 10% of total revenue. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2014 , one &#32;direct customer accounted for more than 10% of total revenue, while no indirect channel partner accounted for more than 10% of total revenue. 

Our sales force is organized into four main geographic teams covering sales around the globe: United States, Europe, Asia and the rest of the world. Revenue from sales outside the United States represented 29% , 23% &#32;and 24% &#32;of our total revenue in the fiscal years ended March 31, 2016 , 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively. For additional information regarding our sales by geographic location, see Note 17 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Marketing 

Our marketing organization drives our market research, strategy, product positioning and messaging and produces and manages a variety of programs such as advertising, trade shows, industry events, public and analyst relations, social media, direct mail, seminars, sales promotions, and web marketing to promote the sale and acceptance of our solutions and to build the NetScout, ASI&#174;, nGenius&#174; and other applicable product brand names in the marketplace. We also host an annual worldwide user conference as a way to engage with existing customers, to provide education and awareness, and to promote expanded use of our software with these customers. 

Key elements of our marketing strategy focus on thought leadership, market positioning, market education, go to market strategies, reputation management, demand generation, and the acceleration of our strategic selling relationships with local and global resellers, systems integrators, and our technology alliance partners. During fiscal year 2016, NetScout invested in further fortifying and amplifying the NetScout brand, including redesigning the NetScout logo and related brand messaging. These activities are expected to continue into fiscal year 2017 as we wind down the use of certain acquired brand names. 

Research and Development 

Our continued success depends significantly on our ability to anticipate and create solutions that will meet emerging customer requirements. NetScout works closely with its largest enterprise and service provider customers to better understand and address their near-term and longer-term requirements. By better understanding the key, time-sensitive needs of NetScout&#8217;s global customer base, NetScout&#8217;s development programs will continue to result in enhanced products that are able to meet the increasing challenges of an increasingly complex and dynamic global network environment. 

We have invested significant financial resources and personnel into the development of our products and technology. Our continued investment in research and development is crucial to our business and our continued success in the market. We have assembled a team of highly skilled engineers with expertise in various technologies associated with our business and the technologies being deployed by our customers. We plan to continue to enhance and expand our product offerings and capabilities in the near future while integrating key capabilities from the acquired product lines as appropriate. As a result, we plan to continue to invest and dedicate significant resources to our research and development activities for both our enterprise and service provider customers. 

We predominantly develop our products internally, with some limited third-party contracting. We have also acquired developed technology through business acquisitions. To promote industry standards and manifest technology leadership, we participate in and support the activities and recommendations of industry standards bodies, such as the Internet Engineering Task Force and the 3 rd &#32;Generation Partnership Project and we also engage in close and regular dialogue with our key customers and alliance partners. These activities provide early insight into the direction of network and application performance requirements for current and emerging technologies. 

Seasonality 

We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, quarterly variations in our order bookings as a result of a number of factors, including the length of the sales cycle, complexity of customer environments, new product introductions and their market acceptance and seasonal factors affected by customer projects and typical IT buying cycles. Due to these factors, we historically have experienced stronger bookings during our fiscal third and fourth quarters than in the first and second quarters. 

Customers 

We sell our products to enterprises, service providers and governmental agencies with large- and medium-sized high-speed IP computer networks. Our enterprise customers cover a wide variety of industries, such as financial services, technology, manufacturing, healthcare, utilities, education, transportation and retail. In the telecommunications service provider customer group we address mobile operators, wireline operators and cable operators. A significant number of our service provider customers are mobile operators. 

Backlog 

We produce our products on the basis of our forecast of near-term demand and maintain inventory in advance of receipt of firm orders from customers. We configure our products to customer specifications and generally deliver products shortly after receipt of the purchase order. Service engagements are also included in certain orders. Customers generally may reschedule or cancel orders with little or no penalty. We believe that our backlog at any particular time is not meaningful because it is not necessarily indicative of future sales levels. Our combined product backlog at March 31, 2016 &#32;was $125.7 million compared to an immaterial amount at March 31, 2015 . A majority of the backlog relates to customization and integration projects from our recently acquired business units. In some cases, we have begun these projects but have not yet hit billable milestones. A majority of revenue for these projects is expected to be recognized into revenue throughout fiscal year 2017. 

Competition 

We compete with many companies in the markets we serve. The service assurance and performance management market is highly competitive, rapidly evolving, and fragmented with overlapping technologies and a wide range of competitors, both large and small, who may deliver certain elements of our solution. Consequently, there are a number of companies who have greater name recognition and substantially greater financial, management, marketing, service, support, technical, distribution and other resources than we do. Additionally, certain competitors, either due to their size and resources or due to their technological strengths, may be able to respond more effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards and customer requirements. 

Principal competitive factors in our service assurance market include scalability; ability to address a large number of applications, locations and users; product performance; the ability to easily deploy into existing network environments; the ability to offer virtualized solutions; and the ability to administer and manage the solution. 

While NetScout faces multiple competitors within the service assurance industry, we believe that we compete favorably on the basis of these factors. We provide a comprehensive service delivery management solution that is capable of addressing the needs of both enterprise and service provider customers and can be scaled to meet the challenges of today&#8217;s dynamic service 

delivery environments. We believe that our solutions provide superior data and compete favorably on a broad range of metrics including the ability to recognize and track a large number of applications, scalability to support high and increasing levels of data and network traffic, the ability to look at both data and control plane traffic across an entire network, and the ability to provide real-time information about service performance and real-time alerts to emerging service problems. 

In the enterprise market, our competitors include companies such as Avaya, AppDynamics, CA Technologies, Compuware, ExtraHop, InfoVista, Ixia, JDSU (through its Network Instruments business that was acquired in 2014), Gigamon, Lancope, New Relic, Riverbed Technology and SolarWinds. In addition, we both compete with and partner with large enterprise management vendors, such as HP and IBM, who offer performance management solutions. 

In the service provider market, we compete with probe vendors, network equipment manufacturers, big data and analytics vendors, and virtualization vendors. These vendors include Alcatel-Lucent, Astellia, Anritsu, Cisco, Empirix, Ericsson, EMC, EXFO, Guavas, Huawei, IBM, JDSU, Niksun, Polystar, Radcom, SevOne, Splunk, and Zettics. We face additional competitive threats from startups and new entrants that seek to offer innovative solutions in an industry characterized by rapid technological change. 

In the cybersecurity market, we face a range of competitors, including those that may have greater name recognition and substantially greater financial, management, marketing, service, support, technical, distribution and other resources than we do. We believe that our scalability of our solutions, flexible deployment, and price-performance of our cybersecurity solutions positions us well to compete against both larger network equipment and security companies and smaller niche security solutions vendors. 

In the DDoS solutions market, we compete with a broad range of vendors including Radware, Akamai, F5 Networks, A10 Networks, Fortinet and Corero Network Security. In the market for traffic management and detection solutions used to identify advanced network threats, we compete with a range of vendors including Cisco, Blue Coat Systems, the RSA Security division of EMC, Damballa, Fidelis, Securlert and Savvius. 

Our ability to sustain a competitive advantage depends on our ability to deliver continued technology innovation and adapt to meet the evolving needs of our customers. Competitive factors in our industry are further described in Item 1A &#8220;Risk Factors.&#8221;
