 Item 1. Business 

&#160; 

Since its formation in 1987, the Company has engaged in the discovery, development and commercialization of innovative pharmaceuticals for the treatment of neurological and psychiatric disorders. In 2011, however, we conducted a re-evaluation of our strategic focus and determined that clinical development in the area of respiratory disorders, particularly respiratory depression and sleep apnea, provided the most cost-effective opportunities for potential rapid development and commercialization of our compounds. As a result of our scientific discoveries and the acquisition of strategic, exclusive license agreements, we believe we are now a leader in the discovery and development of innovative pharmaceuticals for the treatment of respiratory disorders. 

&#160; 

Saying that there exists an unmet need for new drug treatments for breathing disorders is an understatement. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the rate of respiratory disorders is reaching epidemic proportions, with estimates that 1 in 4 men and 1 in 10 women in this country have sleep apnea. Sleep apnea places a considerable burden on society and the health care system because of its association with adverse events ranging from loss of productivity to increased risk of cardiopulmonary illness and related death. No drugs currently are approved for the treatment of sleep apnea. 

&#160; 

Even in patients without sleep apneas, the use of drugs such as propofol, used as an anesthetic during surgery, and opioid analgesics such as morphine and oxycodone, used during anesthesia and for the treatment of post-surgical and chronic pain, are well known for producing respiratory depression. In fact, while respiratory depression is the leading cause of death from the overdose of most classes of abused drugs, it also arises during normal, physician-supervised procedures such as surgical anesthesia, post-operative analgesia and as a result of normal outpatient management of pain. 

&#160; 

Although naloxone (Narcan) and nalmefene (Revex) can reverse respiratory depression associated with opioids, they have several major shortcomings. First and foremost, these opioid antagonists do not reverse the respiratory depression produced by other classes of drugs often given/taken either alone or in combination with narcotics. Second, while these drugs reverse the serious side effects of the opioids, they also dramatically reduce their analgesic effectiveness. Third, the side effects of opioid antagonists are themselves serious and include seizures, agitation, convulsions, tachycardia, hypotension, nausea, and vomiting. 

&#160; 

Furthermore, respiratory depression can arise as a result of a number of other illnesses that involve neural and muscular disorders. For example, certain spinal injuries can interfere with normal neural communication between the brain and the lungs resulting in reduced respiratory capacity. Pompe Disease is an autosomal, recessive, metabolic disorder that damages muscle and nerve cells throughout the body. One of the first symptoms is a progressive decrease in the strength of muscles such as the diaphragm and other muscles required for breathing. Respiratory failure is the most common cause of death. In both of these orphan indications, symptomatic treatment for the respiratory depression is severely lacking. 

&#160; 

Clearly, considerable need exists for pharmacotherapeutic agents to (i) treat sleep apnea, (ii) prevent and reverse the respiratory depression produced by different classes of drugs, and (iii) relieve the respiratory depression produced in a number of orphan indications, such as Pompe and spinal injury. The Company currently has two drug platforms, each with a clinical stage compound directed at these needs. 

&#160; 

Sleep Apnea 

&#160; 

Sleep apnea is a serious disorder in which breathing repeatedly stops long enough to disrupt sleep, and temporarily decreases the amount of oxygen and increases the amount of carbon dioxide in the blood. Apnea is defined by more than five periods per hour of ten seconds or longer without breathing. The repetitive cessation of breathing during sleep has substantial impact on the affected individuals. The disorder is associated with major co-morbidities including excessive daytime sleepiness and increased risk of cardiovascular disease (such as hypertension, stroke and heart failure), diabetes and weight gain. Sleep apnea is often made worse by central nervous system depressants such as opioids, benzodiazepines, barbiturates and alcohol. It is therefore important for these patients to seek therapy. 

&#160; 

&#160; 4 &#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

The most common type of sleep apnea is obstructive sleep apnea (&#8220;OSA&#8221;), which occurs by repetitive narrowing or collapse of the pharyngeal airway during sleep. There is currently no approved pharmacotherapy, and the most common treatment is to use continuous positive airway pressure (&#8220;CPAP&#8221;) delivered via a nasal or full-face mask, as long as patients are able to tolerate the treatment. We believe that long term patient compliance with CPAP devices is extremely low. Given the large patient population and a lack of suitable treatment options, there is a very large opportunity for pharmacotherapy to treat this disorder. 

&#160; 

Central sleep apnea (&#8220;CSA&#8221;), a less frequently diagnosed type of sleep apnea, is caused by alterations in the brain mechanisms responsible for maintaining normal respiratory drive. CSA is most frequently observed in heart failure patients and in patients taking chronic opioids. CSA is a predictor of mortality in heart failure patients. There are no therapeutic options for patients with CSA; CPAP is contra-indicated for the treatment of CSA and no drugs are currently approved for this indication. 

&#160; 

In addition, many patients present with a pattern of sleep apnea that has both obstructive and central components. 

&#160; 

Drug-induced Respiratory Depression 

&#160; 

Drug-induced respiratory depression (&#8220;RD&#8221;) is a life-threatening condition caused by a variety of depressant drugs, including analgesic, hypnotic, and anesthesia medications. We believe that RD is a leading cause of death from the overdose of some classes of abused drugs, yet it also arises during normal, physician-supervised procedures such as surgical anesthesia and post-operative pain management. For example, in the hospital setting, anesthetics, such as propofol, are well known for their propensity to produce RD, particularly when combined with opioids. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention has published that there are approximately 51.4 million inpatient surgical procedures performed annually. It is notable that according to the HealthGrades Inc. Patient Safety in American Hospitals Study, post-operative respiratory failure produces the highest mortality rate, the second highest attributable number of deaths and the second largest overall excess cost to the Medicare system, when compared to other patient safety indicators. 

&#160; 

In the hospital setting, one of the most serious complications of patient-controlled analgesia is RD and, despite nurses&#8217; vigilance, adverse events associated with opioids continue to increase. Drug-induced RD is associated with a high mortality rate relative to other adverse drug events. If high-risk patients are receiving combination therapies, they are at even higher risk. 

&#160; 

Outside the hospital, the primary risk factor for RD is the use of a single opioid in large doses or concomitant use of opioids and sedative agents. Whether as a result of normal outpatient management of pain or as a result of substance abuse, RD has been reported to be the leading cause of death from drug overdose, with the drug overdose death rate tripling since 1991. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, approximately 15,000 people die every year as a result of overdoses involving prescription painkillers. Oxycodone and fentanyl have been reported to be the two most frequently reported drugs associated with death and serious nonfatal outcomes from 1998 to 2005, exceeding the number of deaths from heroin and cocaine combined. Opioid use has increased significantly along with a dramatic increase in unintentional poisoning deaths from opioids. Unintentional deaths from opioids are not only related to diversion for nonmedical use and misuse by patients, but by prescriber&#8217;s error as well. 

&#160; 

Drug Abuse 

&#160; 

On January 19, 2016, the Company announced that that it has reached an agreement with the Medications Development Program of the National Institute of Drug Abuse (&#8220;NIDA&#8221;) to conduct research on the Company&#8217;s ampakine compounds CX717 and CX1739. The agreement was entered into as of October 19, 2015, and on January 14, 2016, the Company and NIDA approved the proposed protocols, allowing research activities to commence. NIDA will evaluate the compounds using pharmacologic, pharmacokinetic and toxicological protocols to determine the potential effectiveness of the ampakines for the treatment of drug abuse and addiction. Initial studies will focus on cocaine and methamphetamine addiction and abuse, and will be contracted to outside testing facilities and/or government laboratories, with all costs to be paid by NIDA. The Company will provide NIDA with supplies of CX717 and CX1739 and will work with the NIDA staff to refine the protocols and dosing parameters. The Company will retain all intellectual property, as well as proprietary and commercialization rights to these compounds.

&#160; 

&#160; 

Cannabinoids 

&#160; 

In order to expand the Company&#8217;s respiratory disorders program, on August 10, 2012, pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger by and among Pier Pharmaceuticals Inc., a privately-held corporation, (&#8220;Pier&#8221;) Pier Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation (&#8220;Merger Sub&#8221;) and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and the Company, Merger Sub merged with and into Pier (the &#8220;Merger&#8221;) and Pier became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. Pier had been formed in June 2007 (under the name SteadySleep Rx Co.) as a clinical stage pharmaceutical company to develop a pharmacologic treatment for obstructive sleep apnea and had been engaged in research and clinical development activities since formation. 

&#160; 

Through the Merger, the Company gained access to an Exclusive License Agreement, as amended (the &#8220;License Agreement&#8221;), that Pier had entered into with the University of Illinois on October 10, 2007. The License Agreement covered certain patents and patent applications in the United States and other countries claiming the use of certain compounds referred to as cannabinoids for the treatment of sleep related breathing disorders (including sleep apnea), of which dronabinol is a specific example of one type of cannabinoid. Dronabinol is a synthetic derivative of the naturally occurring substance in the cannabis plant, otherwise known as undefined9-THC (undefined9-tetrahydrocannabinol). Dronabinol is currently approved by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration (&#8220;FDA&#8221;) and is sold generically for use in refractory chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, as well as for anorexia in patients with AIDS. The License Agreement was terminated effective March 21, 2013 due to the Company&#8217;s failure to make a required payment. 

&#160; 

However, on June 27, 2014, the Company entered into a new license agreement with the Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois (the &#8220;2014 License Agreement&#8221;). In exchange for certain milestone and royalty payments, the 2014 License Agreement grants the Company (i) exclusive rights to several issued and pending patents in numerous jurisdictions and (ii) the non-exclusive right to certain technical information that is generated by the University of Illinois in connection with certain clinical trials as specified in the 2014 License Agreement, all of which relate to the use of cannabinoids for the treatment of sleep related breathing disorders. The Company is developing dronabinol for the treatment of OSA, the most common form of sleep apnea. 

&#160; 

The Company previously conducted a 21 day, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose escalation Phase 2 clinical study in 22 patients with OSA, in which dronabinol produced a statistically significant reduction in the Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI), the primary therapeutic end-point, and was observed to be safe and well tolerated. Dronabinol is currently under investigation, at the University of Illinois and other centers, in a potentially pivotal Phase 2 OSA clinical trial, fully funded by the National Institutes of Health. 

&#160; 

Dronabinol is a Schedule III, controlled generic drug with a relatively low abuse potential that is approved by the FDA for the treatment of AIDS related anorexia and chemotherapy induced emesis. The use of dronabinol for the treatment of OSA is a novel indication for an already approved drug and, as such, the Company expects that only FDA approval of a supplemental new drug application will be required. 

&#160; 

Ampakines 

&#160; 

Since its founding, the Company has been engaged in the research and clinical development of a class of compounds referred to as ampakines. By acting as positive allosteric modulators of AMPA glutamate receptors, ampakines increase the excitatory effects of the neurotransmitter glutamate. Early preclinical and clinical research suggested that these ampakines might have therapeutic potential for the treatment of memory and cognitive disorders, depression, attention deficit disorder and schizophrenia. Given our current focus on respiratory disorders, we may seek to partner, out-license or sell our rights to the use of ampakine compounds for the treatment of neurological and psychiatric indications, as we focus on the development of our compounds for the treatment of breathing disorders. 

&#160; 

The early ampakines discovered by the Company, Eli Lilly and Company, and others were ultimately abandoned due to the presence of undesirable side effects, particularly convulsive activity. Subsequently, Company scientists discovered a new, chemically distinct series of molecules termed &#8220;low impact&#8221; as opposed to the &#8220;high impact&#8221; designation given to the earlier compounds. While these low impact compounds share many pharmacological properties with the high impact compounds, they did not produce convulsive effects in animals. These low impact compounds do not bind to the same molecular site as the high impact compounds and, as a result, do not produce the undesirable electrophysiological and biochemical effects that lead to convulsive activity. 

&#160; 

&#160; 6 &#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

The Company owns patents and patent applications for certain families of chemical compounds that claim the chemical structures and their use in the treatment of various disorders. These patents cover, among other compounds, the Company&#8217;s lead ampakines CX1739 and CX1942 and extend through at least 2028. 

&#160; 

In order to broaden the use of the Company&#8217;s ampakine technology into the area of respiratory disorders, on May 8, 2007, the Company entered into a license agreement, as subsequently amended, with the University of Alberta granting the Company exclusive rights to practice patents held by the University of Alberta claiming the use of ampakines for the treatment of various respiratory disorders. These patents, along with the Company&#8217;s own patents claiming chemical structures, comprise the Company&#8217;s principal intellectual property supporting the Company&#8217;s research and clinical development program in the use of ampakines for the treatment of respiratory disorders. 

&#160; 

The Company has obtained preclinical results indicating that several of its low impact ampakines, including CX717, CX1739 and CX1942, were able to antagonize the respiratory depression caused by opioids, barbiturates and anesthetics without offsetting the analgesic effects of the opioid or the sedative effects of the anesthetics. Dr. John Greer, faculty member of the Department of Physiology, Perinatal Research Centre, and Women &#38; Children&#8217;s Health Research Institute and Alberta Innovates Health Sciences Senior Scientist with the Neuroscience and Mental Health Institute at the University of Alberta, has shown that these ampakine effects are due to a direct action on neurons in pre-Botzinger&#8217;s complex, a brain stem region responsible for regulating respiratory drive. 

&#160; 

After several Phase 1 and 2 studies to demonstrate safety and tolerability, the first of these low impact compounds, CX717, was tested in two Phase 2A clinical studies to determine its ability to antagonize the respiratory depressant effects of fentanyl, a potent opioid analgesic. In both of these studies, one of which was published in a peer-reviewed journal, CX717 antagonized the respiratory depression produced by fentanyl without altering the analgesia produced by this drug. 

&#160; 

Although the development of CX717 has been delayed due to regulatory issues with the FDA, and despite the impending loss of U.S. patents in 2017 and international patents in 2018 claiming composition-of-matter and certain non-respiratory uses, nevertheless, the Company believes that CX717 stills retains considerable value as a potential commercial product, for the following reasons. Patents claiming the use of CX717 for the treatment of various respiratory disorders are in effect in the United States and elsewhere at least through 2027 and additional method of treatment patents are planned and are being prepared. Long term preclinical safety studies have been completed and are sufficient to support chronic dosing of CX717 in humans. CX717 has demonstrated the ability to antagonize the respiratory effects of fentanyl, a potent opioid, in two clinical trials. Promising results have also been observed in clinical trials of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and cognition. Finally, the Company has obtained what it believes to be conclusive data showing that the presumed neurotoxicity observed after administration of very high doses of CX717 (i.e., appearance of vacuoles in certain brain regions) is a post-mortem artifact due to the exposure of a CX717 metabolite to formaldehyde, the chemical agent used to fix the brain tissue. The Company is preparing this data for publication in a peer-reviewed journal and intends to submit a new Investigational New Drug (&#8220;IND&#8221;) application to the FDA in the second half of 2016. 

&#160; 

In several Phase 1 clinical studies, the Company&#8217;s present lead ampakine, CX1739, has demonstrated good safety and tolerability after single doses up to 1200 mg for seven days, as well as two doses per day of 600 mg each for ten days. Pharmacokinetic results to date from the volunteers who have taken CX1739 show that drug absorption over the range of 50mg to 1200mg was linear and predictable, with an approximate half-life of 8 hours. 

&#160; 

The Company has conducted a single dose, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study with CX1739 in 20 subjects with moderate to severe sleep apnea. Analysis of a range of sleep apnea parameters assessed by overnight polysomnography revealed that, while a single dose of CX1739 improved a number of sleep apnea parameters across most of the patients who were given the drug, the primary effects were observed within a sub-group of patients diagnosed with either central or mixed sleep apnea. There were no serious adverse events and no clinically relevant changes in vital signs, cardiovascular or other safety assessments. 

&#160; 

&#160; 7 &#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

The Company filed an IND application with the FDA in September 2015 to conduct a double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ascending Phase 2A clinical trial in approximately 18 subjects to determine the ability of orally administered CX1739, the Company&#8217;s proprietary lead ampakine, to prevent the respiratory depression produced by remifentanil, a potent opioid, without altering remifentanil&#8217;s analgesic properties. The clinical protocol was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of three escalating doses of CX1739 versus placebo when administered prior to remifentanil, with respiration, analgesia and a number of other clinical measures being taken after administration of both drugs. The commencement of this clinical trial was subject to resolution of two deficiencies raised by the FDA in its clinical hold letter issued in November 2015, which were satisfactorily resolved in early 2016, as a result of which the FDA removed the clinical hold on the Company&#8217;s IND for CX1739 on February 25, 2016, thus allowing for the initiation of the clinical trial . During March 2016, upon receiving unconditional approval from the Institutional Review Board (&#8220;IRB&#8221;) of the Duke Clinical Research Unit, this Phase 2A clinical trial at Duke University School of Medicine was initiated. The Company expects to complete the clinical trial in approximately four months. 

&#160; 

In addition to CX1739, the Company is developing CX1942, a soluble ampakine, as an injectable formulation in a hospital or surgical setting to be used in conjunction with opioids and anesthetics either during or after surgery. Animal studies conducted in collaboration with investigators at the University of Florida and funded by an Small Business Innovation Research (&#8220;SBIR&#8221;) contract from the National Institute of Drug Abuse have indicated that CX1942 injected intravenously, intramuscularly or subcutaneously can reverse the respiratory depression produced by fentanyl. Such data will be used to develop an injectable formulation with the flexibility to be administered via different routes. 

&#160; 

As part of its preclinical research program, the Company, through Dr. John Greer, Chairman of the RespireRx Scientific Advisory Board, has engaged in research collaborations with a number of academic institutions. As part of its collaborative program with the University of Florida, studies with RespireRx&#8217;s ampakines have determined that these compounds improve breathing in animal models of Pompe Disease and spinal injury. 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s short term commercial goals are to obtain FDA approval for the use of orally administered CX1739 for the following indications: (i) peri- and post-operative administration in a hospital setting for the prevention of respiratory depression produced by opioids, (ii) central sleep apnea, and (iii) another indication, possibly respiratory distress associated with spinal cord injury or Pompe Disease. The Company believes that these goals can be achieved in a timely and cost-effective manner. Longer term goals include obtaining FDA approval for the oral administration of CX1739 given concomitantly with an opioid analgesic for the safe management of pain in a home setting. The Company believes that successful commercial implementation of these goals will require corporate partnership. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

The pharmaceutical industry is characterized by intensive research efforts, rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary therapeutics. Our competitors include many companies, research institutes and universities that are working in a number of pharmaceutical or biotechnology disciplines to develop therapeutic products similar to those we are currently investigating. Most of these competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, manufacturing, marketing, distribution and/or other resources than we do. In addition, many of our competitors have experience in performing human clinical trials of new or improved therapeutic products and obtaining approvals from the FDA and other regulatory agencies. We have no experience in conducting and managing later-stage clinical testing or in preparing applications necessary to obtain regulatory approvals. We expect that competition in this field will continue to intensify. 

&#160; 

Regulation 

&#160; 

The FDA and other similar agencies in foreign countries have substantial requirements for therapeutic products. Such requirements often involve lengthy and detailed laboratory, clinical and post-clinical testing procedures and are expensive to complete. It often takes companies many years to satisfy these requirements, depending on the complexity and novelty of the product. The review process is also extensive, which may delay the approval process further. Failure to comply with applicable FDA or other requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA&#8217;s refusal to approve pending applications, a clinical hold, warning letters, recall or seizure of products, partial or total suspension of production, withdrawal of the product from the market, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. 

&#160; 

&#160; 8 &#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

FDA approval is required before any new drug or dosage form, including the new use of a previously approved drug, can be marketed in the United States. Other similar agencies in foreign countries also impose substantial requirements. 

&#160; 

The process of developing drug candidates normally begins with a discovery process of potential candidates that are then initially tested in in vitro and in vivo non-human animal (preclinical) studies which include, but are not limited to toxicity and other safety related studies, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion). Once sufficient preclinical data are obtained, a company must submit an IND and receive authorization from the FDA in order to begin clinical trials in the United States. Successful drug candidates then move into human studies that are characterized generally as Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3. Phase 1 studies seeking safety and other data normally utilize healthy volunteers. Phase 2 studies utilize one or more prospective patient populations and are designed to establish safety and preliminary measures of efficacy. Sometimes studies may be referred to as Phase 2A and 2B depending on the size of the patient population. Phase 3 studies are large trials in the targeted patient population, performed in multiple centers, often for longer periods of time and are designed to establish statistically significant efficacy as well as safety in the larger population. Most often the FDA and similar regulatory agencies in other countries require two confirmatory studies. Upon completion of both the preclinical and clinical phases, an NDA (New Drug Application) is filed with the FDA or a similar filing is made to the regulatory authority in other countries. NDA filings are extensive and include the data from all prior studies. These filings are reviewed by the FDA and, only if approved, may the company or its partners commence marketing of the new drug in the United States. 

&#160; 

There also are variations of these procedures. For example, companies seeking approval for new indications for an already approved drug may choose to pursue an abbreviated approval process by filing a Supplementary NDA (SNDA). Another example would be an Abbreviated NDA (ANDA) claiming bio-equivalence to an already approved drug. Other opportunities allow for accelerated review and approval based upon several factors, including potential breakthrough status of the drug or orphan designation (generally, an orphan indication in the United States is one with a patient population of less than 200,000). 

&#160; 

As of yet, we have not obtained any approvals to market our products. Further, we cannot assure you that the FDA or other regulatory agency will grant us approval for any of our products on a timely basis, if at all. Even if regulatory clearances are obtained, a marketed product is subject to continual review, and later discovery of previously unknown problems may result in restrictions on marketing or withdrawal of the product from the market. See &#8220;Risk Factors - Risks related to our business. 

&#160; 

Manufacturing 

&#160; 

We have no experience or capability to either manufacture bulk quantities of the new compounds that we develop, or to produce finished dosage forms of the compounds, such as tablets or capsules. We rely, and presently intend to continue to rely, on the manufacturing and quality control expertise of contract manufacturing organizations or current and prospective corporate partners. There is no assurance that we will be able to enter into manufacturing arrangements to produce bulk quantities of our compounds on favorable financial terms. There is, however, substantial availability of both bulk chemical manufacturing and dosage form manufacturing capability throughout the world that we believe we can readily access. See &#8220;Risk Factors - Risks related to our business - We are at an early stage of development and we may not be able to successfully develop and commercialize our products and technologies&#8221; for a discussion of certain risks related to the development and commercialization of our products. 

&#160; 

Marketing 

&#160; 

We have no experience in the marketing of pharmaceutical products and do not anticipate having the resources to distribute and broadly market any products that we may develop. We will therefore continue to seek commercial development arrangements with other pharmaceutical companies for our proposed products for those indications that require significant sales forces to effectively market. In entering into such arrangements, we may seek to retain the right to promote or co-promote products for certain of the orphan drug indications in North America. We believe that there is a significant expertise base for such marketing and sales functions within the pharmaceutical industry and expect that we could recruit such expertise if we choose to directly market a drug. See &#8220;Risk Factors- Risks related to our business- We are at an early stage of development and we may not be able to successfully develop and commercialize our products and technologies&#8221; for a discussion of certain risks related to the marketing of our products.

Employees 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015 and as of the date of filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company employed five people (all officers), two of whom were full time. The Company also engages certain contractors who provide substantial services to the Company. 

&#160; 

Technology Rights 

&#160; 

University of California, Irvine License Agreements 

&#160; 

The Company entered into a series of license agreements in 1993 and 1998 with the University of California, Irvine (&#8220;UCI&#8221;) that granted the Company proprietary rights to certain chemical compounds that acted as ampakines and their therapeutic uses. These agreements granted the Company, among other provisions, exclusive rights: (i) to practice certain patents and patent applications, as defined in the license agreement, that were then held by UCI; (ii) to identify, develop, make, have made, import, export, lease, sell, have sold or offer for sale any related licensed products; and (iii) to grant sub-licenses of the rights granted in the license agreements, subject to the provisions of the license agreements. The Company was required, among other terms and conditions, to pay UCI a license fee, royalties, patent costs and certain additional payments. 

&#160; 

Under such license agreements, the Company was required to make minimum annual royalty payments of approximately $70,000. The Company was also required to spend a minimum of $250,000 per year to advance the ampakine compounds until the Company began to market an ampakine compound. At December 31, 2012, the Company was not in compliance with its minimum annual payment obligations and believed that this default constituted a termination of the license agreements. On April 15, 2013, the Company received a letter from UCI indicating that the license agreements between UCI and the Company had been terminated due to the Company&#8217;s failure to make certain payments required to maintain the agreements. Since the patents covered in these license agreements had begun to expire and the therapeutic uses described in these patents were no longer germane to the Company&#8217;s new focus on respiratory disorders, the loss of these license agreements is not expected to have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s current drug development programs. In the opinion of management, the Company has made adequate provision for any liability relating to this matter in its financial statements at December 31, 2015 and 2014. 

&#160; 

University of Alberta License Agreement and Research Agreement 

&#160; 

On May 8, 2007, the Company entered into a license agreement, as subsequently amended, with the University of Alberta granting the Company exclusive rights to practice patents held by the University of Alberta claiming the use of ampakines for the treatment of various respiratory disorders. The Company agreed to pay the University of Alberta a licensing fee and a patent issuance fee, which were paid, and prospective payments consisting of a royalty on net sales, sublicense fee payments, maintenance payments and milestone payments. The prospective maintenance payments commence on the enrollment of the first patient into the first Phase 2B clinical trial and increase upon the successful completion of the Phase 2B clinical trial. As the Company does not at this time anticipate scheduling a Phase 2B clinical trial in the near term, no maintenance payments to the University of Alberta are currently due and payable, nor are expected to be due in the near future in connection with the license agreement. 

&#160; 

&#160; 10 &#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

On January 12, 2016, the Company entered into a Research Contract with the University of Alberta in order to test the efficacy of ampakines at a variety of dosage and formulation levels in the potential treatment of Pompe Disease, apnea of prematurity and spinal cord injury, as well as to conduct certain electrophysiological studies to explore the ampakine mechanism of action for central respiratory depression. The Company agreed to pay the University of Alberta total consideration of approximately CAD$146,000 (currently approximately US$110,000), consisting of approximately CAD$85,000 (currently approximately US$64,000) of personnel funding in cash in four installments during 2016, to provide approximately CAD$21,000 (currently approximately US$16,000) in equipment, to pay patent costs of CAD$20,000 (currently approximately US$15,000), and to underwrite additional budgeted costs of CAD$20,000 (currently approximately US$15,000). All but US$64,000 of the total consideration has already been incurred and paid for directly or in-kind. The conversion to US dollars above utilizes an exchange rate of US$0.7548 for every CAD$1.00. 

&#160; 

The University of Alberta will receive matching funds through a grant from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research in support of the research. The Company will retain the rights to research results and any patentable intellectual property generated by the research. Dr. John Greer, Ph.D., Chairman of the Company&#8217;s Scientific Advisory Board and faculty member of the Department of Physiology, Perinatal Research Centre, and Women &#38; Children&#8217;s Health Research Institute and Alberta Innovates Health Sciences Senior Scientist with the Neuroscience and Mental Health Institute at the University of Alberta, will collaborate on this research.

University of Illinois License Agreement 

&#160; 

Through the merger with Pier, the Company gained access to the License Agreement that Pier had entered into with the University of Illinois on October 10, 2007. The License Agreement covered certain patents and patent applications in the United States and other countries claiming the use of certain compounds referred to as cannabinoids for the treatment of sleep related breathing disorders (including sleep apnea), of which dronabinol is a specific example of one type of cannabinoid. The License Agreement was terminated effective March 21, 2013 due to the Company&#8217;s failure to make a required payment. 

&#160; 

On June 27, 2014, the Company entered into the 2014 License Agreement with the Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois that was similar, but not identical, to the License Agreement between the parties that had been terminated on March 21, 2013. In exchange for certain milestone and royalty payments, the 2014 License Agreement grants the Company (i) exclusive rights to several issued and pending patents in numerous jurisdictions and (ii) the non-exclusive right to certain technical information that is generated by the University of Illinois in connection with certain clinical trials as specified in the 2014 License Agreement, all of which relate to the use of cannabinoids for the treatment of sleep related breathing disorders. The Company is developing dronabinol for the treatment of OSA, the most common form of sleep apnea.
