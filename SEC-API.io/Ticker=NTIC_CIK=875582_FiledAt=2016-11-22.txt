Overview

&#160;

Northern Technologies International Corporation (NTIC) develops and markets proprietary environmentally beneficial products and services in over 60 countries either directly or via a network of subsidiaries, joint ventures, independent distributors and agents. NTIC&#8217;s primary business is corrosion prevention marketed mainly under the ZERUST &#174; and EXCOR &#174; brands (collectively &#8220;ZERUST &#174; &#8221;). NTIC has been selling corrosion prevention products and services to the automotive, electronics, electrical, mechanical, military and retail consumer markets for over 40 years, and in recent years, has targeted and expanded into the oil and gas industry. NTIC also markets and sells a portfolio of biobased and certified compostable (fully biodegradable) polymer resin compounds and finished products under the Natur-Tec &#174; brand. These products are intended to reduce the carbon footprint of NTIC&#8217;s customers and provide environmentally sound waste disposal options.

&#160;

NTIC&#8217;s ZERUST &#174; rust and corrosion inhibiting products include plastic and paper packaging, liquids and coatings, rust removers and cleaners, diffusers and engineered solutions designed specifically for the oil and gas industry. NTIC also offers worldwide on-site technical consulting for rust and corrosion prevention issues. NTIC&#8217;s technical service consultants work directly with the end users of NTIC&#8217;s ZERUST &#174; rust and corrosion inhibiting products to analyze their specific needs and develop systems to meet their technical requirements. In North America, NTIC sells its ZERUST &#174; corrosion prevention solutions through a network of independent distributors and agents supported by a direct sales force. Internationally, NTIC sells its ZERUST &#174; corrosion prevention solutions through its wholly-owned subsidiary in China, NTIC (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. (NTIC China), its majority-owned joint venture holding company for NTIC&#8217;s joint venture investments in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) region, its majority-owned subsidiary in Brazil, Zerust Preven&#231;&#227;o de Corros&#227;o S.A. (Zerust Brazil), and its wholly-owned subsidiary in Mexico, ZERUST-EXCOR MEXICO, S. de R.L. de C.V (Zerust Mexico), and joint venture arrangements in North America, Europe and Asia.

&#160;

One of NTIC&#8217;s strategic initiatives is to expand into and penetrate other markets for its corrosion prevention solutions. Consequently, for the past several years, NTIC has focused significant sales and marketing efforts on the oil and gas industry, as the infrastructure that supports that industry is typically constructed using metals that are highly susceptible to corrosion. NTIC believes that its ZERUST &#174; corrosion prevention solutions will minimize maintenance downtime on critical oil and gas industry infrastructure, extend the life of such infrastructure and reduce the risk of environmental pollution due to corrosion leaks.

&#160;

NTIC markets and sells its ZERUST &#174; rust and corrosion prevention solutions to customers in the oil and gas industry across several countries either directly, through its subsidiaries or through its joint venture partners and other strategic partners. The sale of ZERUST &#174; corrosion prevention solutions to customers in the oil and gas industry typically involves a long sales cycle, often including a one- to multi-year trial period with each customer and a slow integration process thereafter.

&#160;

Natur-Tec &#174; biobased and compostable plastic resin compounds are manufactured using NTIC&#8217;s patented and/or proprietary technologies and are intended to replace conventional petroleum-based plastics. The Natur-Tec &#174; biopolymer resin compound portfolio includes formulations that have been optimized for a variety of applications including blown-film extrusion, extrusion coating, injection molding, and engineered plastics. These resins are certified to be fully biodegradable in a composting environment and are currently being used to produce finished products including can liners, shopping and grocery bags, lawn and leaf bags, pet waste collection bags, cutlery and coated paper products. In North America, NTIC markets its Natur-Tec &#174; resins and finished products primarily through a network of regional and national distributors as well as independent agents. NTIC continues to see significant opportunities for finished bioplastic products and, therefore, continues to strengthen and expand its North American distribution network for finished Natur-Tec &#174; bioplastic products. Internationally, NTIC sells its Natur-Tec &#174; resins and finished products both directly and through its majority-owned subsidiary in India, Natur-Tec India Private Limited (Natur-Tec India), and through certain joint ventures, distributors and agents.

&#160;

NTIC&#8217;s receipt of funds from its joint ventures is dependent upon fees NTIC is paid for services that it provides to its joint ventures, based on the net sales of each individual joint venture, as well as NTIC&#8217;s receipt of dividend distributions from the joint ventures. The fees for services provided to joint ventures are determined based on either a flat fee or a percentage of sales depending on local laws and tax regulations. With respect to NTIC&#8217;s joint venture in Germany (EXCOR), NTIC recognizes an agreed upon quarterly fee for services. NTIC recognizes equity income from its joint ventures based on the overall profitability of its joint ventures. Such profitability is subject to variability from quarter to quarter and, consequently, subjects NTIC&#8217;s earnings to variability from quarter to quarter. The profits of NTIC&#8217;s joint ventures are shared in accordance with their respective ownership percentages. NTIC typically, directly or indirectly, owns 50% or less of each of its joint venture entities and thus does not control the decisions of these entities regarding whether to pay dividends and, if paid, how much they should be in a given year. The payment of a dividend by an entity is determined by a joint vote of the owners and is not at the sole discretion of NTIC.

&#160;

NTIC accounts for the investments and financial results of its joint ventures in its consolidated financial statements utilizing the equity method of accounting.

&#160;

Sales by NTIC's joint ventures are not included in the net sales of NTIC. NTIC considers, EXCOR Korrosionsschutz &#8211; Technologien und Produkte GmbH (&#8220;EXCOR&#8221;), its joint venture in Germany, to be individually significant to NTIC&#8217;s consolidated assets and income; and therefore, provides certain additional information regarding EXCOR in the notes to NTIC&#8217;s consolidated financial statements and in certain sections of this report.

&#160;

For more information regarding NTIC&#8217;s joint ventures and their effect on NTIC&#8217;s operating results, see NTIC&#8217;s consolidated financial statements in &#8220; Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data &#8221; and &#8220; Part II. Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8221; of this report.

&#160;

Termination of Chinese Joint Venture 

&#160;

On January 2, 2015, NTIC announced that, effective as of December 31, 2014, it is selling its ZERUST &#174; products and services in China through a wholly-owned subsidiary, NTIC (Shanghai) Co., Ltd., and has terminated its joint venture agreements with Tianjin Zerust Anticorrosion Co., Ltd. (&#8220;Tianjin Zerust&#8221;). NTIC and NTI Asean LLC have filed a lawsuit in China against Mr. Tao Meng, the former joint venture entity&#8217;s other shareholder, and his spouse, seeking, among other things, an orderly liquidation of Tianjin Zerust.

&#160;

NTIC indirectly has a 30% ownership interest in Tianjin Zerust through its 60% owned holding company subsidiary, NTI Asean LLC. Beginning with the second quarter of fiscal 2015, NTIC&#8217;s consolidated financial statements include the financial results of NTIC China,.

&#160;

NTIC anticipates that it will take time to transition Tianjin Zerust customers over to NTIC China and no assurance can be provided that NTIC China will be able to achieve the net sales and income levels previously achieved by Tianjin Zerust. For fiscal 2014, Tianjin Zerust had net sales of $15.9 million and net income of $1.3 million. The operating income of the joint venture before paying royalties in an aggregate amount of $4.2 million to all shareholders was over $5.5 million.

&#160;

&#160;

During fiscal 2016, NTIC realized approximately $3,410,000 in expenses related either directly or indirectly to the establishment and initial business operations of NTIC China, the termination of the Tianjin Zerust joint venture agreements, NTIC&#8217;s ongoing litigation against Mr. Tao Meng and his spouse, NTIC&#8217;s ongoing litigation against Cortec Corporation, the creation of a reserve against the accounts receivable balance from Tianjin Zerust, the write-off of certain inventory and the asset impairment of NTIC&#8217;s interest in the Tianjin Zerust joint venture. These expenses are recorded as selling, general and administrative expenses, expenses incurred in support of joint ventures, and/or impairment on investment at carrying value on NTIC&#8217;s consolidated statements of operations. Specifically, as of August 31, 2016, NTIC believes that, for accounting purposes, its joint venture investment in Tianjin Zerust is fully impaired. The carrying value of Tianjin Zerust, prior to impairment, was $1,883,668, of which the net impact to NTIC was $1,130,201 based on its 60% ownership of NTI Asean. As of August 31, 2016, the carrying value, for accounting purposes, is $0. As of August 31, 2016, NTIC created a reserve against the accounts receivable balance owed from Tianjin Zerust of $114,636 that, for accounting purposes, NTIC determined it to be uncollectible. Despite these accounting positions, NTIC intends to continue to vigorously pursue its litigation against its former joint venture partner for the losses associated with Tianjin Zerust. NTIC also intends to continue to vigorously pursue its litigation against Cortec Corporation for lost profits, unjust enrichment and other damages related to its tortious interference and breach, among other claims.

&#160;

NTIC expects that its operating results may continue to be volatile as a result of the ongoing transition of Chinese operations.

&#160;

Products

&#160;

NTIC derives revenues directly and/or indirectly through its subsidiaries and joint ventures from two reportable business segments based on products sold, customer base and distribution center: ZERUST &#174; corrosion prevention solutions and Natur-Tec &#174; resin compounds and finished products.

&#160;

ZERUST &#174; Corrosion Prevention Solutions . In fiscal 2016, 83.7% of NTIC&#8217;s consolidated net sales were derived from developing, manufacturing and marketing ZERUST &#174; rust and corrosion inhibiting products and services. NTIC&#8217;s consolidated net sales in fiscal 2016 included $27,577,566 in sales of ZERUST &#174; rust and corrosion inhibiting products and services, an increase of 5.9% over such sales in fiscal 2015. Corrosion not only damages the appearance of metal products and components but also negatively impacts their mechanical performance. This applies to the rusting of ferrous metals (iron and steel) and the deterioration by oxidation of nonferrous metals (aluminum, copper, brass, etc.). NTIC&#8217;s ZERUST &#174; corrosion prevention solutions include plastic and paper packaging, powders, liquids, coatings, rust removers, cleaners, diffusers and engineered solutions for the oil and gas industry, as well as technical corrosion management and consulting services.

&#160;

Plastic and Paper Packaging . NTIC&#8217;s ZERUST &#174; packaging products contain proprietary chemical formulations that continuously release an invisible and odorless, corrosion inhibiting vapor that passivates metal surfaces and thereby inhibits rust and corrosion. The corrosion-inhibiting protection is maintained as long as the metal products to be protected remain enclosed within the ZERUST &#174; packaging. Electron scanning shows that once the contents are removed from the ZERUST &#174; package, the ZERUST &#174; protection dissipates from the contents&#8217; surfaces within two hours, leaving a clean, dry and corrosion-free metal component. This mechanism of corrosion protection enables NTIC&#8217;s customers to easily package metal objects for rust-free shipment or long-term storage. Furthermore, by eliminating costly greasing and degreasing processes and/or significantly reducing the use of certain coatings to inhibit corrosion, NTIC&#8217;s ZERUST &#174; corrosion prevention solutions provide customers significant savings in labor, material and capital expenditures for equipment to apply, remove and dispose of oils and greases, as well as the attendant environmental problems, as compared to traditional methods of corrosion prevention.

&#160;

&#160;

NTIC developed the first means of infusing volatile corrosion inhibiting chemical systems (VCIs) into polyethylene and polypropylene resins. Combining ZERUST &#174; chemical systems with polyethylene and polypropylene resins permitted NTIC to introduce a line of plastic packaging products in the form of low and high density polyethylene bags and shroud film, including stretch, shrink, skin and bubble cushioning film, thereby giving packaging engineers an opportunity to ship and store ferrous, nonferrous and mixed-metal products in a clean, dry and corrosion-free condition, with an attendant overall savings in total process costs. In addition to plastic packaging, NTIC has developed additives to imbue kraft paper, corrugated cardboard, solid fiber and chipboard packaging materials with corrosion protection properties. NTIC&#8217;s ZERUST &#174; plastic and paper packaging products come in various thicknesses, strength enhancements, protection types, shapes and sizes. This product line also includes items such as ZERUST &#174; gun cases, car covers and tool-drawer liners, which are targeted at retail consumers.

&#160;

Liquids and Coatings . NTIC&#8217;s corrosion prevention solutions include a line of metal surface treatment liquids and coatings, which are oil, water and bio-solvent based, marketed under brand names including Axxatec &#8482; , Axxanol &#8482; and Z-Maxx &#8482; . These liquids and coatings provide powerful corrosion protection in aggressive environments, such as salt air and humidity at high temperatures. Products are formulated for most metal types and protection levels. Customers use a combination of NTIC&#8217;s liquids and coatings with ZERUST &#174; plastic and paper products to achieve robust corrosion protection during manufacturing, shipping and warehousing stages.

&#160; 

Rust Removers and Cleaners . NTIC also sells rust removal and cleaning products designed to restore rusty parts to a usable condition by replacing labor-intensive, abrasive cleaners that damage surfaces and commonly fail to remove rust from complex metal surfaces like the teeth of small gears under the Axxaclean &#8482; brand name.

&#160;

Diffusers . NTIC&#8217;s corrosion prevention solutions include a line of corrosion inhibiting vapor diffusers, such as ZERUST &#174; ActivPak &#174; , ZERUST &#174; ICT &#174; Vapor Capsules, ZERUST &#174; ICT &#174; Plastabs &#174; and ZERUST &#174; ICT &#174; Cor-Tabs &#174; , ZERUST &#174; ICT &#174; Pipe Strip and ZERUST &#174; ICT &#174; Tube Strip. These diffusers are designed to protect metals within enclosures, like switch gearboxes and electronic cabinets, or can be used as added protection to ZERUST &#174; packaging products. Diffusers work by permeating the interior air of an enclosure with an invisible and odorless corrosion inhibiting vapor that protects nearby metal surfaces that are within a specific &#8220;radius of protection&#8221; for a period of one or two years depending on the model. This invisible and dry protective layer revaporizes upon removal of the capsule from the enclosure, leaving all surfaces clean, dry, residue-free and corrosion-free. 

&#160;

Z-CIS &#174; Technical Services . As an on-going effort to help NTIC&#8217;s customers improve and control their processes in terms of corrosion management, NTIC markets and offers unique corrosion management and consulting services to target customers. This ZERUST &#174; corrosion inhibition system (known as Z-CIS &#174; ) utilizes NTIC&#8217;s global experience in successful corrosion management control. Services and consulting are billed according to work done on the customer&#8217;s behalf to improve the customer&#8217;s internal and external corrosion control systems. Several major automotive companies and their automotive parts suppliers have used NTIC&#8217;s Z-CIS &#174; system.

&#160;

ZERUST &#174; Corrosion Prevention Solutions Designed Specifically for the Oil and Gas Industry . NTIC has developed proprietary engineered corrosion inhibiting solutions specifically for the mitigation of corrosion of the types of capital assets used in the petroleum and chemical process industries and has targeted the sale of these ZERUST &#174; corrosion solutions to potential customers in the oil and gas industry. NTIC&#8217;s consolidated net sales in fiscal 2016 included $1,739,607 in sales made to customers in the oil and gas industry, a decrease of 7.8% over such sales in fiscal 2015. This decrease is set against a backdrop of a 60% drop in crude oil prices in the past 18 months that has negatively affected client budgets. The infrastructure that supports the oil and gas industry is predominantly constructed using metals that are highly susceptible to corrosion. The industrial environment at these facilities usually contains compounds, including sulfides and chlorides, which cause aggressive corrosion. This problem affects pipelines, petroleum storage tanks, spare parts in long-term storage, processing and other critical equipment. In addition to the costs associated with the replacement of parts and structures, maintenance and repairs, and product loss, there are significant economic losses associated with critical infrastructure down for repair and maintenance. Furthermore, there are also considerable health, safety and environmental risks caused by corrosion that can greatly increase economic losses. NTIC believes that its ZERUST &#174; oil and gas corrosion prevention solutions minimize maintenance downtime on critical oil and gas industry infrastructure, extend the life of such infrastructure and reduce the risk of environmental pollution due to leaks caused by corrosion. 

&#160;

&#160;

NTIC&#8217;s rust and corrosion inhibiting products for the oil and gas industry include ZERUST &#174; Flange Savers &#174; ZERUST &#174; ReCAST-R VCI Dispensers, Zerust ReCAST-SSB solutions and ZERUST &#174; chemicals, including Zerion chemicals, in addition to many of the traditional ZERUST &#174; rust and corrosion inhibiting products previously described. 

&#160;

ZERUST &#174; Flange Savers &#174; are specially designed covers that have been impregnated with a proprietary ZERUST &#174; inhibitor formulation to provide corrosion protection for flanges, valves and welded joints. Oil and gas pipeline segments are connected by flanges and welded joints of varying sizes, designs and materials. These connection points often corrode under aggressive industrial environments and harsh operating conditions, thereby causing costly maintenance, operational and safety problems. ZERUST &#174; Flange Savers &#174; are available in various sizes to accommodate different pipe diameters, pressure ratings and international standards for pipeline valves and flanges. 

&#160;

ZERUST &#174; ReCAST-R VCI Dispensers protect the interior surfaces of aboveground storage tank roofs by delivering proprietary inhibitor formulations into the vapor space between the surface of the product and the tank roof. Certain grades of oil contain sulphur and emit corrosive acid gas vapors that destroy the internal surfaces of aboveground storage tank roofs and their support structures above the stored product. Each system is tailored to a customer&#8217;s requirements, depending upon specific environmental conditions, product stored, tank diameter and type of metal and can be applied on both new and existing tank roofs.

&#160;

ZERUST &#174; ReCAST-SSB solutions protect the Soil Side Bottoms (SSB) of aboveground storage tanks through a variety of unique and highly effective delivery systems designed by the Zerust Oil &#38; Gas team to deliver proprietary Zerion FVS corrosion inhibitor to tank bottom spaces that are susceptible to significant corrosion. Tank bottoms are typically made of steel plates which are in direct contact with the foundation surface that could be concrete, sand/soil and asphalt/bitumen. It is typically not possible to protect this underside surface with traditional coatings. Cathodic protection (CP) systems can provide some protection, but these have significant limitations that cause failures well ahead of the expected service life of a tank. The ZERUST &#174; solutions provide effective protection even to areas that cannot be addressed with CP. This is an engineered solution where each system is tailored to a customer&#8217;s requirements depending on the tank foundation design, specific environmental conditions, tank diameter, etc.

&#160;

ZERUST &#174; Zerion line of powder based inhibitor solutions include:

&#160;

&#160; &#8226; Zerion FVS is a unique inhibitor blend that is used in the SSB Solutions. This &#8220;best-in-class&#8221; product has been successfully deployed at multiple client sites in the North and South American geographies. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#8226; AutoFog is a revolutionary product that allows for the quick VCI saturation of large volume spaces without the need for mechanical &#8220;fogging&#8221; equipment. This rapid self-diffusing capability is good for sealed void spaces, protection of large/complex assets like heat exchangers and heater-treaters. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 6 

&#160;

&#183; Sol-V C-Series is designed to provide corrosion prevention in voids and enclosures especially when there is either stagnant water, or the potential for water seepages and/or accumulation of water over time. ZERUST &#174; Sol-V&#8482; C-Series packaging allows VCIs to release while conserving a Sol-V proprietary blend of soluble corrosion inhibitors (SCIs) until water enters the system. Typical applications of ZERUST &#174; Sol-V&#8482; C-Series packaging include offshore platform leg voids, vessels and tanks mothballed in tropical environments, ship blocks being fabricated in areas of high humidity, piping systems and heat exchangers. &#160; 

Natur-Tec &#174; Resin Compounds and Finished Products NTIC manufactures and sells a range of biobased and compostable (fully biodegradable) polymer resin compounds and finished products under the Natur-Tec &#174; brand. NTIC&#8217;s consolidated net sales in fiscal 2016 included $5,355,999 in sales of Natur-Tec &#174; resins and finished products, an increase of 25.1% over such sales in fiscal 2015. Market drivers such as volatile petroleum prices, reduced dependence on foreign oil, reduced carbon footprints, and environmentally responsible end-of-life solutions increased interest in using sustainable, biobased and renewable plant-biomass resources for the manufacture of plastics and industrial products. Plastics that are fully biodegradable in composting or anaerobic digestor systems allow the safe and effective conversion of these plastics to carbon dioxide, water and fertilizer at the end of their service life. Increased environmental and sustainability awareness at the corporate and consumer level, improved technical properties and product functionality, as well as recent foreign, state and local governmental regulations banning the use of traditional, petroleum-based plastics or mandating the use of certain biodegradable or compostable products, have also fueled this interest in biobased and biodegradable-compostable plastics. The term &#8220;bio-plastics&#8221; encompasses a broad category of plastics that are either bio-based, which means derived from renewable resources such as corn or cellulosic/plant material or blends thereof, or are engineered to be fully compostable, or both. 

&#160;

Resin Compounds. &#160; Natur-Tec &#174; resin compounds are produced by blending commercially available base resins, such as Ecoflex &#174; from BASF, Ingeo &#174; PLA from NatureWorks LLC, with organic and inorganic fillers, and proprietary polymer modifiers and compatabilizers, using NTIC&#8217;s proprietary and patented ReX Process. In this process, biodegradable polymers, natural polymers made from renewable, plant-biomass resources, and organic and inorganic materials are reactively blended in the presence of proprietary compatibilizers and polymer modifiers to produce biobased and/or compostable polymer resin formulations that exhibit unique and stable morphology. Natur-Tec &#174; resin compounds are engineered for high performance, ease of processing and reduced cost compared to most other bio-plastic materials, and can be processed by converters using conventional plastic manufacturing processes and equipment. 

&#160;

Natur-Tec &#174; resin compounds are available in several grades tailored for a variety of applications, such as blown-film extrusion, extrusion coating and injection molding. 

&#160;

Natur-Tec &#174; flexible film resin compounds are fully compostable and meet requirements of international standards for compostable plastics such as ASTM (American Society for Testing and Materials) D6400 (U.S.), EN 13432 (European standards for products and services by European Committee for Standardization) and ISO (International Organization for Standardization) 17088, and are certified as 100% compostable by organizations including the BPI (Biodegradable Products Institute) in the United States and Vincotte in Europe. Natur-Tec &#174; film resin compounds can be used to produce film for applications, such as bags, including compost bags, lawn and leaf bags, pet waste bags and carry-out bags, agricultural film and consumer and industrial packaging. 

&#160;

The Natur-Tec &#174; compostable extrusion coating resin compounds are biobased and biodegradable and are designed to replace conventional plastic materials for extrusion coating applications. Natur-Tec &#174; extrusion coating resin compounds are manufactured using sustainable and renewable resources, per the ASTM D6866 standard, which allows industry and consumers the opportunity to reduce or neutralize their carbon footprint, and are designed to meet the requirements of international standards for compostable plastics, such as ASTM D6400. Natur-Tec &#174; extrusion coating resin compounds provide good adhesion to paper, an excellent print surface and good heat seal strength and the coating material is suitable for food contact applications including both hot and cold applications. Natur-Tec &#174; extrusion coating resin compounds can be used for coating paper and paperboards for the manufacture of disposable cups, plates and other food service ware items.

&#160;

&#160;

The Natur-Tec &#174; compostable injection molding resin compounds are biobased and compostable and are designed to replace conventional plastic materials for injection molded plastic applications. Natur-Tec &#174; compostable injection molding resin compounds are manufactured using sustainable and renewable resources, per the ASTM D6866 standard and are designed to meet the requirements of international standards for compostable plastics, such as ASTM D6400 and EN 13432. Natur-Tec &#174; compostable injection molding resin compounds can be used for injection molded plastic applications, such as cutlery, pens, hangers, containers and packaging. Natur-Tec &#174; biobased injection molding resin compounds are made with at least 90% of biobased/renewable resource-based materials per the ASTM D6866 standard and are meant to enhance sustainability by replacing petroleum-based plastics. Natur-Tec &#174; biobased injection molding resin compounds exhibit the same properties as conventional plastic materials and can be used in applications, such as automotive components, consumer goods, electronics, medical products, furniture and packaging.

&#160; 

Finished Products . Natur-Tec &#174; finished products include totally biodegradable and compostable trash bags, agricultural film and other single-use disposable products, such as compostable cutlery and food and consumer goods packaging that are currently marketed under the Natur-Bag &#174; or Natur-Ware &#174; brands. 

&#160;

The Natur-Bag &#174; product line offers 15 different compostable trash bag sizes, from 3-gallon to 96-gallon. The bags are available in various SKU configurations from retail packs that are sold to the consumer either through retail outlets or through online stores, and industrial case packs that are sold to commercial and industrial customers primarily through wholesalers and distributors. The Natur-Bag &#174; products are manufactured from the Natur-Tec &#174; flexible film resin compounds and thus are fully biodegradable and compostable.

&#160;

The Natur-Ware &#174; product line consists of biobased and compostable cutlery made from the Natur-Tec &#174; compostable injection molding resin compounds. Natur-Ware &#174; cutlery can be composted along with food scraps in zero-waste programs. 

&#160;

Both Natur-Bag &#174; and Natur-Ware &#174; products are fully certified compostable, and carry the BPI Compostable logo in the United States and the Vincotte OK Compost in Europe. Furthermore, these products were also independently tested and approved for use in organic waste diversion systems by Cedar Grove, one of the largest compost operators in the United States.

&#160;

Sales, Marketing and Distribution

&#160;

ZERUST &#174; Corrosion Prevention Solutions . In the United States, NTIC markets its ZERUST &#174; rust and corrosion inhibiting products and services, including its products designed for the oil and gas industry, principally to industrial users in the automotive, electronics, electrical, mechanical, military, retail consumer and oil and gas markets by a direct sales force and through a network of independent distributors, manufacturer&#8217;s sales representatives and strategic partners. NTIC&#8217;s technical service consultants work directly with the end users of NTIC&#8217;s ZERUST &#174; products to analyze their specific corrosion prevention needs and develop systems to meet their technical requirements.

&#160;

Internationally, NTIC has entered into a series of joint ventures with foreign partners (either directly or through a holding company). NTIC receives fees for providing technical support, marketing assistance and other services to its joint ventures based primarily on the net sales of the individual joint ventures in accordance with the terms of the joint venture arrangements. Such services include consulting, legal, insurance, technical and marketing services. In China, NTIC sells its products and services through NTIC China, which in turn uses several distributors with dedicated sales personnel. NTIC recently formed a wholly-owned subsidiary in Mexico to conduct its business there.

&#160;

&#160;

With respect to the sales and marketing of ZERUST &#174; rust and corrosion inhibiting products and services to the oil and gas industry, NTIC uses a combination of direct sales personnel, independent sales agents and its joint venture network. In addition, in an attempt to penetrate the oil and gas industry within certain markets more quickly, NTIC has entered into certain sales and marketing agency agreements with specific organizations that have existing long term relationships with key oil and gas industry clients. NTIC also engages in certain direct marketing activities to build its brand within the oil and gas industry, such as traditional advertising and direct mail campaigns and presence and participation at selected key trade shows and technical forums. NTIC continues to believe the sale of its ZERUST &#174; corrosion prevention solutions to customers in the oil and gas industry will involve a long sales cycle, likely including a one- to multi-year trial period with each customer and a slow integration process thereafter. 

&#160; 

Natur-Tec &#174; Resin Compounds and Finished Products . In the United States, NTIC markets its Natur-Tec &#174; resin compounds and finished products through a network of national and regional distributors and independent manufacturer&#8217;s sales representatives and three NTIC direct sales employees as of August 31, 2016. Target customers for Natur-Tec &#174; finished products include individual consumers and commercial and institutional organizations such as corporations and government agencies, and educational organizations such as universities and school districts. NTIC is also targeting key national and regional retailers utilizing independent sales agents. Target customers for Natur-Tec &#174; resin compounds include film extruders and injection molders who would purchase Natur-Tec &#174; resin compounds to manufacture and sell their own finished biobased, and compostable end products, such as film, bags and cutlery.

&#160;

Internationally, NTIC uses Natur-Tec India, and its joint ventures and a network of international distributors to market its Natur-Tec &#174; resin compounds and finished products. In November 2014, NTIC entered into an agreement with NatureWorks LLC for joint marketing and sales of Ingeo &#174; based packaging solutions to customers in India. With recent Indian government mandates banning use of non-biodegradable plastics in certain types of food and consumer packaging, NTIC expects the market in India for bioplastic packaging solutions to grow substantially.

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

ZERUST &#174; Corrosion Prevention Solutions . While NTIC is unaware of any third parties with which NTIC competes on a worldwide basis with respect to its corrosion prevention solutions, NTIC does compete with several third parties on a regional basis. NTIC evaluates competing rust and corrosion inhibiting products on an ongoing basis. Some of NTIC&#8217;s competitors are established companies that may have financial, marketing, distribution networks and other resources substantially greater than those of NTIC. As a result, they may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements, or devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products than NTIC. With respect to its rust and corrosion inhibiting products, NTIC competes on the basis of product innovation, quality and reliability, product support, customer service, reputation, as well as price. Some of NTIC&#8217;s competitors may have achieved significant market acceptance of their competing products and brand recognition. NTIC, however, believes it has an advantage over most of its competitors as a result of NTIC&#8217;s technical innovation and its value added service. NTIC attempts to provide its customers with the highest level of technical service and applications engineering in addition to ZERUST &#174; rust and corrosion inhibiting products. Nonetheless, the commoditization of certain of NTIC&#8217;s ZERUST &#174; rust and corrosion inhibiting products have led and may continue to lead to lower prices and lower margins on such products. In addition, because certain barriers to entry are low, additional competitors, including plastic extrusion companies, may emerge, which likely would lead to the further commoditization of NTIC&#8217;s rust and corrosion inhibiting products.

&#160;

&#160;

With respect to NTIC&#8217;s corrosion prevention solutions for use in the oil and gas industry, NTIC&#8217;s primary barrier to entry is a combination of conservatism, complacency, confidence in old approaches, as well as the complexity of the buying organizations. Some of NTIC&#8217;s competitors with respect to its traditional ZERUST &#174; rust and corrosion inhibiting products also compete in the oil and gas industry. NTIC also faces competition from new suppliers who provide alternative approaches to corrosion prevention, some of which have a significant market presence and more years of experience and credibility in the oil and gas industry. Original equipment manufacturer (OEM) suppliers to the oil and gas industry present a new market vertical for NTIC&#8217;s traditional industrial ZERUST &#174; products.

&#160; 

Natur-Tec &#174; Resin Compounds and Finished Products. With respect to NTIC&#8217;s Natur-Tec &#174; resin compounds and finished products, NTIC competes with several established companies that have been producing and selling similar products for a significantly longer time period, and have significantly more sales, more extensive and effective distribution networks and better brand recognition than NTIC. Most of these companies also have substantially more financial and other resources than NTIC. NTIC competes on the basis of performance, brand awareness, distribution network, product availability, product offering, shelf life, place of manufacture and price. Because of price competition, NTIC&#8217;s margins on its Natur-Tec &#174; resin compounds and finished products are lower than its margins on its ZERUST &#174; corrosion prevention solutions. NTIC also could face supply constraints for the base resins used to manufacture NTIC&#8217;s Natur-Tec &#174; resin compounds and finished products since there are a limited number of suppliers of such base resins and limited capacity for their production. 

&#160;

Research and Development

&#160;

NTIC&#8217;s research and development activities are directed at improving existing products, developing new products, reducing costs and improving quality assurance through improved testing of NTIC&#8217;s products. NTIC&#8217;s internal research and development activities are conducted at its facilities located in Circle Pines, Minnesota; Beachwood, Ohio; and Dresden, Germany under the direction of internationally known scientists and research institutes under exclusive contract to NTIC with respect to the subject of their respective research efforts. EXCOR has established a wholly-owned subsidiary, Excor Korrosionsforschung GmbH, to conduct research into new fields of corrosion inhibiting packaging and the applications engineering of such products in conjunction with NTIC&#8217;s domestic research and development operations. With respect to NTIC&#8217;s Natur-Tec &#174; resin compounds and finished products, Ramani Narayan, Ph.D., a current director of NTIC and Distinguished Professor in the Department of Chemical Engineering &#38; Materials Science at Michigan State University, provides his expertise and technical support to NTIC.

&#160;

NTIC spent $4,724,596 in fiscal 2016 in connection with its research and development activities, compared to $4,047,279 in fiscal 2015. NTIC anticipates that it will spend between $2,000,000 and $3,000,000 in fiscal 2017 on research and development activities. This anticipated significant decrease is due to the transition of expenses that were previously treated as research and development expenses to selling, general and administrative expenses, specifically as they relate to Natur-Tec &#174; and the ZERUST &#174; oil and gas business since most of the expenses related to these business units are no longer in the research and development phase of product development.

&#160;

Intellectual Property Rights

&#160;

NTIC&#8217;s success depends and will continue to depend in part upon its ability to maintain patent and trademark protection for its products and processes, to preserve its proprietary information and trade secrets and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. NTIC&#8217;s policy is to attempt to protect its technology by, among other things, filing patent applications and trademark applications and vigorously preserving the trade secrets covering its technology and other intellectual property rights.

&#160;

&#160;

In 1979, NTIC developed and patented the first polyolefin (plastic) based industrial corrosion inhibiting packing material in the world. The U.S. patent granted under this patent application became the most important intellectual property right in NTIC&#8217;s history. This patent expired in 2000. NTIC has since filed for 12 letters of patents in the United States covering various corrosion inhibiting technologies, systems and applications, and now owns several patents in these areas. These patents as well as patent applications have been extended to the countries of strategic relevance to NTIC including, but not limited to, the Patent Cooperation Treaty. In addition, EXCOR owns several patents in the area covering various corrosion inhibiting technologies and also applied for new patents on proprietary new corrosion inhibiting technologies. NTIC is also seeking additional patent protection covering various host materials into which its corrosion inhibiting additives and other protective features can be incorporated, proprietary new process technologies, and chemical formulations outside the area of corrosion protection. NTIC owns several patents outside the area of corrosion protection both in the United States and in countries of strategic relevance to NTIC including, but not limited to, the Patent Cooperation Treaty.

&#160;

In addition to seeking patent protection, NTIC maintains an extensive portfolio of trademarks in countries where NTIC has a presence directly or through its subsidiaries and joint ventures. NTIC continuously pursues new trademark applications of strategic interest worldwide. NTIC owns the following U.S. registered trademarks: NTI &#174; , NTI &#38; Globe Design, ZERUST &#174; , EXCOR &#174; , ICT &#174; , Z-CIS &#174; , COR TAB &#174; , PLASTABS &#174; , NATUR-TEC &#174; , NATUR-TEC &#38; Design &#174; , NATUR-BAG &#174; and NATUR-WARE &#174; . NTIC also has a registered trademark on the use of the Color Yellow with respect to corrosion inhibiting packaging. Furthermore, NTI &#174; , ZERUST &#174; , The ZERUST People &#174; , EXCOR &#174; , the Color Yellow &#174; , NTI ASEAN &#174; and COR/SCI &#174; , as well as other marks have been registered in the European Union with several new applications pending.

&#160;

NTIC requires its employees, consultants and advisors having access to its confidential information, including trade secrets, to execute confidentiality agreements upon commencement of their employment or consulting relationships with NTIC. These agreements generally provide that all confidential information NTIC develops or makes known to the individual during the course of the individual&#8217;s employment or consulting relationship with NTIC must be kept confidential by the individual and not disclosed to any third parties. NTIC also requires all of its employees and consultants who perform research and development for NTIC to execute agreements that generally provide that all inventions developed by these individuals during their employment by or service arrangement with NTIC will fall under NTIC&#8217;s proprietary intellectual property rights.

&#160;

Manufacturing

&#160;

NTIC&#8217;s ZERUST &#174; rust and corrosion inhibiting products are manufactured according to NTIC&#8217;s specifications primarily by selected independent sub-contractors under trade secrecy agreements and/or license agreements. In addition, during fiscal 2015, NTIC expanded its production capabilities and began to manufacture select ZERUST &#174; rust and corrosion inhibiting products, consisting primarily of liquids and powders, in-house at its corporate headquarters location in Circle Pines, Minnesota. 

&#160;

NTIC&#8217;s Natur-Tec &#174; resin compounds and finished products are produced at facilities in China and Malaysia, and California, USA. NTIC&#8217;s Natur-Tec &#174; resin compounds can be shipped to any manufacturing facility around the world where they then can be converted into finished products, such as a bag or piece of cutlery. NTIC&#8217;s Natur-Tec &#174; finished products are manufactured using NTIC&#8217;s Natur-Tec &#174; resin compounds by selected sub-contractors.

&#160;

NTIC is ISO 9001 certified with respect to the manufacturing of its products. NTIC believes that the process of ISO 9001 certification serves as an excellent total quality management tool, enabling NTIC to ensure consistency in the performance of its products. In addition, because potential customers may prefer or require manufacturers to have achieved ISO certification, such ISO certifications may provide NTIC with certain competitive advantages.

&#160;

&#160;

Availability of Raw Materials

&#160;

NTIC does not typically carry excess quantities of raw materials because of widespread availability for such materials from various suppliers. However, with respect to its Natur-Tec &#174; resin compounds and finished products, there are a limited number of suppliers of the base resins used to manufacture the resin compounds and finished products, and in the past NTIC has experienced some delay in obtaining such base resins. In addition, a few raw materials and purchased parts used in NTIC&#8217;s rust and corrosion inhibiting products and Natur-Tec &#174; finished products are sourced from suppliers who currently serve as NTIC&#8217;s sole source of supply for these materials and parts. Although NTIC believes it can obtain these raw materials and parts from other sources of supply, an unexpected loss of supply over a short period of time may not allow NTIC time to replace these sources in the ordinary course of business.

&#160;

Backlog

&#160;

NTIC had an order backlog of $1,106,000 as of August 31, 2016, compared to $667,000 as of August 31, 2015, which was generally across all business units and which these sales will be realized during first quarter of fiscal 2017. These are orders that are held by NTIC pending release instructions from the customers to be used in just-in-time production. Customers generally place orders on an &#8220;as needed&#8221; basis and expect delivery within a relatively short period of time.

&#160;

Governmental Regulation

&#160;

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has indicated to NTIC that it has no objection to the use of ZERUST &#174; ICT &#174; packaging products in protecting metal food containers and processing equipment. In addition, the manufacture, sale and use of NTIC&#8217;s Natur-Tec &#174; resin compounds and finished products are subject to regulation in the United States by the FDA. The FDA&#8217;s regulations are concerned with substances used in food packaging materials. Thus, food and beverage containers are in compliance with FDA regulations if the components used in the food and beverage containers are approved by the FDA as indirect food additives for their intended uses and comply with the applicable FDA indirect food additive regulations, or are generally recognized as safe for their intended uses and are of suitable purity for those intended uses. NTIC believes that its resin compounds are in compliance with all FDA requirements and do not require further FDA approval prior to the sale of its products.

&#160;

Employees

&#160;

As of August 31, 2016, NTIC had 65 full-time employees located in North America, consisting of 23 in sales and marketing, 23 in research and development and lab, 12 in administration and 7 in production. As of August 31, 2016, NTIC&#8217;s wholly-owned subsidiary in China had 30 full-time employees, its majority-owned subsidiary in Brazil had 20 full-time employees, its majority-owned subsidiary in India had 6 full-time employees and its holding company, NTI Asean, had no full-time employees. There are no unions representing NTIC&#8217;s employees and NTIC believes that its relations with its employees are good.

In addition, NTIC or others on NTIC&#8217;s behalf may make forward-looking statements from time to time in oral presentations, including telephone conferences and/or web casts open to the public, in press releases or reports, on NTIC&#8217;s Internet web site or otherwise. All statements other than statements of historical facts included in this report or expressed by NTIC orally from time to time that address activities, events or developments that NTIC expects, believes or anticipates will or may occur in the future are forward-looking statements including, in particular, the statements about NTIC&#8217;s plans, objectives, strategies and prospects regarding, among other things, NTIC&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations and business, the outcome of contingencies such as legal proceedings and the effect of the liquidation of Tianjin Zerust and the establishment of NTIC China. NTIC has identified some of these forward-looking statements in this report with words like &#8220;believe,&#8221; &#8220;may,&#8221; &#8220;could,&#8221; &#8220;would,&#8221; &#8220;might,&#8221; &#8220;forecast,&#8221; &#8220;possible,&#8221; &#8220;potential,&#8221; &#8220;project,&#8221; &#8220;will,&#8221; &#8220;should,&#8221; &#8220;expect,&#8221; &#8220;intend,&#8221; &#8220;plan,&#8221; &#8220;predict,&#8221; &#8220;anticipate,&#8221; &#8220;estimate,&#8221; &#8220;approximate&#8221; &#8220;outlook&#8221; or &#8220;continue&#8221; or the negative of these words or other words and terms of similar meaning. The use of future dates is also an indication of a forward-looking statement. Forward-looking statements may be contained in the notes to NTIC&#8217;s consolidated financial statements and elsewhere in this report, including under the heading &#8220; Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations .&#8221;

&#160;

Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations about future events affecting NTIC and are subject to uncertainties and factors that affect all businesses operating in a global market as well as matters specific to NTIC. These uncertainties and factors are difficult to predict and many of them are beyond NTIC&#8217;s control. The following are some of the uncertainties and factors known to us that could cause NTIC&#8217;s actual results to differ materially from what NTIC has anticipated in its forward-looking statements:

&#160;

&#160; &#8226; NTIC&#8217;s operations in China, the termination of the joint venture agreements with Tianjin Zerust, the ongoing litigation against Mr. Tao Meng and Cortec Corporation and the anticipated liquidation of Tianjin Zerust and the effect of all these events on NTIC&#8217;s business and future operating results; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#8226; The effect of current worldwide economic conditions and turmoil and disruption in the global credit and financial markets on NTIC&#8217;s business; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#8226; The variability in NTIC&#8217;s sales of ZERUST &#174; products and services into oil and gas industry and Natur-Tec &#174; products and NTIC&#8217;s equity income of joint ventures, which variability in sales and equity in income of joint venture in turn, subject NTIC&#8217;s earnings to quarterly fluctuations; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#8226; Risks associated with NTIC&#8217;s international operations and exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and import duties and taxes; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#8226; The effect of the recent referendum vote of the United Kingdom to exit the European Union on NTIC&#8217;s operating results, including in particular future net sales of NTIC&#8217;s European and other joint ventures; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#8226; The health of the U.S. automotive industry on NTIC&#8217;s business; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#8226; NTIC&#8217;s dependence on the success of its joint ventures and fees and dividend distributions that NTIC receives from them; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#8226; NTIC&#8217;s relationships with its joint ventures and its ability to maintain those relationships, especially in light of anticipated succession planning issues; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#8226; Fluctuations in the cost and availability of raw materials, including resins and other commodities; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#8226; The success of and risks associated with NTIC&#8217;s emerging new businesses and products and services, including in particular NTIC&#8217;s ability and the ability of NTIC&#8217;s joint ventures to sell ZERUST &#174; products and services into oil and gas industry and Natur-Tec &#174; products and the often lengthy and extensive sales process involved in selling such products and services; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#8226; NTIC&#8217;s ability to introduce new products and services that respond to changing market conditions and customer demand; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#8226; Market acceptance of NTIC&#8217;s existing and new products, especially in light of existing and new competitive products; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#8226; Maturation of certain existing markets for NTIC&#8217;s ZERUST &#174; products and services and NTIC&#8217;s ability to grow market share and succeed in penetrating other existing and new markets; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#8226; Increased competition, especially with respect to NTIC&#8217;s ZERUST &#174; products and services, and the effect of such competition on NTIC&#8217;s and its joint ventures&#8217; pricing, net sales and margins; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#8226; NTIC&#8217;s reliance upon and its relationships with its distributors, independent sales representatives and joint ventures; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#8226; NTIC&#8217;s reliance upon suppliers; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#8226; Oil prices, which may affect sales of NTIC&#8217;s ZERUST &#174; products and services into the oil and gas industry; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#8226; The costs and effects of complying with laws and regulations and changes in tax, fiscal, government and other regulatory policies, including rules relating to environmental, health and safety matters; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#8226; Unforeseen product quality or other problems in the development, production and usage of new and existing products; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#8226; Unforeseen production expenses incurred in connection with new customers and new products; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#8226; Loss of or changes in executive management or key employees; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#8226; Ability of management to manage around unplanned events; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 14
