General 

&#160; 

Insignia Systems, Inc. (referred to in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as &#147;Insignia,&#148; &#147;we,&#148; &#147;us,&#148; &#147;our&#148; and the &#147;Company&#148;) is a developer and marketer of innovative in-store products, programs, and services that help consumer goods manufacturers and retail partners drive sales at the point of purchase. The Company was incorporated in 1990. Since 1998, the Company has focused on managing a retail network, made up of over 22,000 store locations, for the primary purpose of providing turn-key at-shelf market access for consumer packaged goods (&#147;CPG&#148;) manufacturers&#146; marketing programs. Insignia provides participating retailers with benefits including incremental revenue, incremental sales opportunities, increased shopper engagement in-store, and custom creative development and other in-kind services. 

&#160; 

Insignia&#146;s primary product is the Point-Of-Purchase Services (POPS&#174;) in-store marketing program. Insignia POPS &#174; program is a national, account-specific, shelf-edge advertising and promotion tactic. Internal testing has indicated the program delivers incremental sales for the featured brand. The program allows manufacturers to deliver vital product information to consumers at the point-of-purchase, and to leverage the local retailer brand and store-specific prices to provide a unique &#147;call to action&#148; that draws attention to the featured brand and triggers a purchase decision. CPG customers benefit from Insignia&#146;s nimble operational capabilities, which include short lead times, in-house graphic design capabilities, post-program analytics, and micro-marketing capabilities such as variable or bilingual messaging.

&#160; 

In October 2014, the Company announced the introduction of a new product, The Like Machine TM , which is an innovative new media that harnesses the power of social media, consumer engagement, and word-of-mouth recommendation at the point of purchase. The Company licenses this product from TLM Holdings, LLC (&#147;TLMH&#148;), a company in which Insignia&#146;s Chief Sales and Marketing Officer, Tim Halfmann, is the majority owner and serves as a principal. In March 2016, the Company and TLMH signed a new distribution agreement for the sale of The Like Machine to Insignia&#146;s customers. This new agreement replaces the Company&#146;s prior license agreement with TLMH. Mr. Halfmann has resigned from Insignia, effective April 30, 2016 in order to focus his efforts more fully on The Like Machine product and its evolution going forward.

&#160; 

Industry and Market Background 

&#160; 

In 2013, Point-Of-Purchase Advertising International (POPAI), an industry non-profit trade association, conducted a Shopper Engagement Study that showed more than 76% of brand purchase decisions are made in-store. As a result, product manufacturers seek access to in-store vehicles that prompt consumers to consider, and remind them to buy, their brand. Insignia is usually engaged as part of an overall, mixed-media, brand marketing campaign. Our programs offer manufacturers the unique benefit of helping to &#147;close the sale&#148; at the point of purchase, within the brick-and-mortar retail environment . 

&#160; 

Company Products 

&#160; 

Insignia&#146;s POPSign Program and Brand-Equity Signage 

&#160; 

Insignia&#146;s POPSign program is an in-store, shelf-edge, point-of-purchase advertising and promotion tactic designed to assist CPG manufacturers in achieving marketing objectives. Depending on the design and format, Insignia POPSigns can deliver information from manufacturers such as product uses and features, nutritional information, advertising taglines, product images, or usage photos. The differentiating feature of Insignia POPSigns is that store-specific prices from the retailer, and each retailer&#146;s unique logo, are combined on the sign. Signs are installed in close proximity to the manufacturer&#146;s product in participating stores, and are maintained in two-week cycle increments. The Company&#146;s POPSign program offers special features and enhancements, such as ShapePOPS &#174; , which is an enhancement to its Color POPSigns that were developed in 2011.

&#160; 

&#160; 

In addition to POPSigns, Insignia offers a brand-equity signage program (without featured price or retailer logo) in a subset of managed retailers. This program offers CPG customers expanded market access for their advertising objectives. 

&#160; 

Manufacturers pay program rates based upon the directed number of cycles and retailer/store count. The Company collects and organizes data from the manufacturer as well as the participating retailers, designs and prints the signage, and delivers signage. Depending on the agreement with the retailer, either a third-party professional installer or store personnel use placement instructions to install the correct signage at the shelf during the correct timeframe . 

&#160; 

Legacy Products 

&#160; 

Insignia offers custom design, printing and store signage programs directly to retailers that seek effective ways to communicate with their shoppers in store . Products include adhesive and non-adhesive supplies in a variety of colors, sizes and weights. Prior to 1996, the Company&#146;s primary product offering was the Impulse Retail System, a system developed by an independent product design and development firm. The Company continues to sell cardstock, maintenance agreements and supplies related to the Impulse Retail System to U.S. and international customers. Cardstock for the Impulse Retail System is sold by the Company in a variety of sizes and colors that can be customized to include pre-printed custom artwork, such as a retailer&#146;s logo. Approximately 7% of 2015 revenues came from the sale of these legacy products. The Company expects this percentage to be comparable in 2016. 

&#160; 

Marketing and Sales 

&#160; 

The Company primarily markets and sells its programs to CPG manufacturers through a direct sales force. Insignia has direct relationships with many of the top 100 CPG manufacturers. Marketing support includes customized sales pitches, selling tools such as rich media presentations, and online marketing efforts. The Company also maintains direct relationships with retailers in its retail distribution network, through a direct field force as well as an in-house support team that helps enable our program at retail. 

&#160; 

The participating retailer network is managed and maintained through direct relationships, and also through contracts with Valassis Sales and Marketing Services, Inc. (Valassis) and News America Marketing In-Store, LLC (News America). 

&#160; 

In February 2014, the Company and Valassis entered into a new Retail Access and Distribution Agreement that replaced all prior agreements. Under this new agreement, Valassis is a non-exclusive reseller of the Company&#146;s POPSigns and the Company has access to all CPG manufacturers for the sale of POPSigns for total consideration of $250,000, which was paid in 2014. 

&#160; 

During 2015 and 2014, foreign sales accounted for less than 1% of total net sales each year. The Company expects sales to foreign distributors will remain less than 1% of total net sales in 2016. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

The Insignia POPSign program provided approximately 93% of the Company&#146;s total net sales for 2015. The POPSign program faces intense competition for the marketing expenditures of branded product manufacturers for at-shelf advertising-related signage. In particular, the Company faces significant competition from News America, which also provides at-shelf advertising and promotional signage. Although settlement of prior litigation with News America resulted in a 10-year agreement through 2021 that provides the Company with additional opportunities to compete by offering signs with price in specific parts of News America&#146;s retail network, the Company will continue to compete for advertising dollars with News America&#146;s other at-shelf advertising and other promotional signage offerings, as well as with other companies that offer digital advertising alternatives. 

&#160; 

The Company believes the main strengths of the Insignia POPSign program in relation to its competitors are: 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Depending on manufacturer&#146;s objectives, benefits to the brand that range from sales lift, awareness building, program ROI, new tier generation, or support of retailer programs

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Managing and providing turn-key access to a national network of retailers in support of objectives listed above; including smaller regional or independent retailers, which tend to be under-served by our competitors and difficult to aggregate at the national level

&#183; &#160; Variable messaging capabilities including bi-lingual targeting

&#183; &#160; Shorter lead times on program execution

&#160;
