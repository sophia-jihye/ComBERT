 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

GENERAL 

We are the largest branded marketer in the U.S. and Canada of apparel exclusively for babies and young children. We own two of the most highly recognized and most trusted brand names in the children's apparel industry, Carter's &#32;and OshKosh B'gosh &#32;(or " OshKosh "). Established in 1865, our Carter's &#32;brand is recognized and trusted by consumers for high-quality apparel for children sizes newborn to eight. Established in 1895, OshKosh &#32;is a well-known brand, trusted by consumers for apparel for children sizes newborn to 12, with a focus on playclothes for toddlers and young children. Given each brand's product category emphasis and brand aesthetic, we believe they provide a complementary product offering. We have extensive experience in the young children's apparel market and focus on delivering products that satisfy our consumers' needs. Our strategy is to market high-quality, essential core products at prices that deliver an attractive value proposition for consumers. 

&#160; 

We believe each of our brands is uniquely positioned in the marketplace. In the $20.5 billion &#32;baby and young children's apparel market ages zero to seven in the U.S., our Carter's &#32;brand has the #1 position with a 14.6% &#32;market share and our OshKosh &#32;brand has a 2.3% &#32;market share. We offer multiple product categories, including baby, sleepwear, playclothes, and related accessories. Our multi-channel business model enables us to reach a broad range of consumers across various socio-economic groups and geographic regions. 

We distribute our products through multiple channels in the U.S. children's apparel market, which, as of January 2, 2016 , included approximately 17,400 &#32;wholesale locations (including department stores, national chain stores, specialty stores and discount retailers), 982 &#32;Company-operated stores, and our websites. As of January 2, 2016 , we operated 594 &#32;Carter's and 241 &#32;OshKosh stores in the U.S., and our products are sold through 147 &#32;Company-operated stores in Canada in addition to our international wholesale, licensing, and online channels.

OUR BRANDS, PRODUCTS, AND DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS 

CARTER'S BRANDS &#8211; &#32;United States 

Under our Carter's &#32;brand, we design, source, and market a broad array of products, primarily for sizes newborn to eight. Our Carter's &#32;brand is sold in department stores, national chains, specialty stores, off-price sales channels, through our Carter's retail stores, and online at www.carters.com. Additionally, we sell our Child of Mine &#32;brand at Walmart and our Just One You &#32;and Precious Firsts brands at Target. In fiscal 2015 , we sold over 342 million &#32;units of Carter's , &#32;Child of Mine , &#32;Just One You , and Precious Firsts &#32;products in the U.S., an increase of approximately 4.4% &#32;from fiscal 2014 . Our strategy is to drive sales growth through our focus on essential, high-volume, core apparel products for babies and young children. Such products include bodysuits, pajamas, blanket sleepers, gowns, bibs, receiving blankets, and playwear. We believe that our core baby and sleepwear products are essential consumer staples and less dependent on changes in fashion trends. 

We have cross-functional product teams focused on the development of our Carter's &#32;baby, sleepwear, and playclothes products. These teams are skilled in identifying and developing high-volume, core products. Each team includes members from merchandising, design, sourcing, product development, forecasting, and supply chain logistics. These teams follow a disciplined approach to fabric usage, color rationalization, and productivity and are supported by a dedicated art department and state-of-the-art design systems. We also license our brand names to other companies to create a broad collection of lifestyle products, including bedding, hosiery, shoes, room d&#233;cor, furniture, and toys. The licensing team directs the use of our designs, art, and selling strategies to all licensees. 

We believe this disciplined approach to core product design results in compelling product offerings to consumers, reduces our exposure to short-term fashion trends, and supports efficient operations. We conduct consumer research as part of our product development process and engage in product testing in our own stores. 

CARTER'S BRAND POSITIONING &#8211; &#32;United States 

Our strategy is to drive our brand image as the leader in baby and young children's apparel and to consistently provide high-quality products at a great value to consumers. We employ a disciplined merchandising strategy that identifies and focuses on core products. We believe that we have strengthened our brand image with the consumer by differentiating our core products through fabric improvements, new artistic applications, and new packaging and presentation strategies. We also attempt to differentiate our products through store-in-store fixturing, branding and signage packages, and advertising. We have invested in display fixtures for our major wholesale customers that more clearly present our core products on their floors to enhance brand and product presentation. We also strive to provide our wholesale customers with a consistent, high-level of service, including delivering and replenishing products on time to fulfill customer needs. Our retail stores and websites focus on the customer experience through store and website design, visual enhancements, clear product presentation, and experienced customer service. 

CARTER'S PRODUCTS &#8211; &#32;United States 

Baby 

Carter's &#32;brand baby products include bodysuits, pants, dresses, three-piece sets, receiving blankets, layette gowns, bibs, caps, and booties both as single units and multi-piece sets. In fiscal 2015 , we generated approximately $1.05 billion &#32;in net sales of these products in the U.S. , representing 34.9% &#32;of our consolidated net sales. 

Our Carter's &#32;brand is the leading brand in the baby category in the U.S. In fiscal 2015 , in department stores, national chains, outlet, specialty stores, and off-price sales channels, our aggregate Carter's &#32;brand market share in the U.S. was approximately 25.2% &#32;for baby ages zero to two, which represents more than five &#32;times the market share of the next largest brand. We sell a complete range of baby products for newborns, primarily made of cotton. We attribute our leading market position to our brand strength, distinctive print designs, artistic applications, reputation for quality, and ability to manage our dedicated floor space for our wholesale customers. We tier our products through marketing programs targeted toward experienced mothers, first-time 

&#32;2 

mothers, and gift-givers. Our Carter's Little Layette product line, the largest component of our baby business, provides parents with essential core products and accessories, including value-focused multi-piece sets. Our Little Collections &#32;product line consists of coordinated baby programs designed for first-time mothers and gift-givers. 

Playclothes 

Carter's &#32;brand playclothes products include knit and woven cotton apparel for everyday use in sizes newborn to eight. In fiscal 2015 , we generated $705.7 million &#32;in net sales of these products in the U.S., representing 23.4% &#32;of our consolidated net sales. We continue to focus on building our Carter's &#32;brand in the &#32; playclothes market by developing a base of essential, high-volume products that utilize original print designs and innovative artistic applications. Our aggregate fiscal 2015 &#32; Carter's &#32;brand playclothes market share in the U.S. was approximately 13.1% &#32;in the $13.8 billion &#32;department store, national chain, outlet, specialty store, and off-price sales channels, which represents two &#32;times the market share of the next largest brand. 

Sleepwear 

Carter's brand sleepwear products include pajamas and blanket sleepers primarily in sizes 12 months to eight. In fiscal 2015 , we generated $331.7 million &#32;in net sales of these products in the U.S., representing 11.0% &#32;of our consolidated net sales. Our Carter's &#32;brand is the leading brand of sleepwear for babies and young children within the department store, national chain, outlet, specialty store, and off-price sales channels in the U.S. In fiscal 2015 , in these channels, our Carter's &#32;brand market share was approximately 30.6% , which represents more than five &#32;times the market share of the next largest brand. As with our baby product line, we differentiate our sleepwear products by offering high-volume, high-quality core products with distinctive print designs and artistic applications. 

Other Products 

Our other product offerings include bedding, outerwear, swimwear, shoes, socks, diaper bags, gift sets, toys, and hair accessories. In fiscal 2015 , we generated $169.2 million &#32;in net sales of these other products in our Carter's &#32; retail stores and online, representing 5.6% &#32;of our consolidated net sales. 

Royalty Income 

We expand the distribution of our Carter's, Child of Mine, Just One You, and &#32;Precious Firsts &#32;product offerings by licensing these brands to 12 licensees in the U.S. as of January 2, 2016 . These licensing partners develop and sell products through our multiple sales channels, while leveraging our brand strength, customer relationships, and designs. Licensed products provide our customers and consumers with a range of lifestyle products that complement and expand upon our baby and young children's apparel offerings. Our license agreements require strict adherence to our quality and compliance standards and provide for a multi-step product approval process. We work in conjunction with our licensing partners in the development of their products to ensure that they fit within our brand vision of high-quality, core products at attractive values to the consumer. In addition, we work closely with our wholesale customers and our licensees to gain dedicated floor space for licensed product categories. In fiscal 2015 , our Carter's &#32;brand generated $26.0 million &#32;in domestic royalty income. 

&#160; 

OSHKOSH BRANDS &#8211; &#32;United States 

Under our OshKosh &#32;brand, we design, source, and market a broad array of young children's apparel, primarily for children in sizes newborn to 12. Our OshKosh &#32;brand is currently sold in our OshKosh retail stores, department stores, national chains, specialty stores, through off-price sales channels, and online at www.oshkoshbgosh.com and www.oshkosh.com. In fiscal 2015 , we sold 49.2 million &#32;units of OshKosh products in the U.S. through our retail stores, to our wholesale customers, and online, an increase of approximately 4.8% &#32;from fiscal 2014 . We also have a licensing agreement with Target Corporation ("Target") through which Target sells products under our Genuine Kids from OshKosh &#32;brand. 

OSHKOSH BRAND POSITIONING &#8211; &#32;United States 

We believe our OshKosh &#32;brand provides for high-quality playclothes in sizes newborn to 12. Our core OshKosh &#32;brand products include denim, overalls, t-shirts, fleece, and other playclothes. Our OshKosh &#32;brand is generally positioned towards an older segment (young children, sizes 2 to 7) and at slightly higher average prices than our Carter's &#32;brand. We believe our OshKosh &#32;brand has significant brand name recognition, which consumers associate with high-quality, durable, and authentic playclothes for young children. 

&#32;3 

OSHKOSH PRODUCTS &#8211; United States 

Playclothes 

Our OshKosh &#32;brand is best known for its playclothes products. OshKosh &#32;brand playclothes products include denim apparel products with multiple wash treatments and coordinating garments, overalls, woven bottoms, knit tops, bodysuits, and playclothes products for everyday use in sizes newborn to 12. In fiscal 2015 , we generated $342.4 million &#32;in net sales of OshKosh &#32;brand playclothes products in the U.S., representing 11.4% &#32;of our consolidated net sales. Our aggregate fiscal 2015 &#32; OshKosh &#32;brand playclothes market share in the U.S. was approximately 2.6% &#32;of the $13.8 billion &#32;young children's playclothes market. 

We believe our OshKosh &#32;brand represents a significant opportunity for us to increase our market share in the playclothes category as the young children's playclothes market in the U.S. is highly fragmented. For fiscal 2015 , this market was nearly four &#32;times the size of the baby and sleepwear markets combined. We plan to grow this business by strengthening our product offerings, improving product value, reducing product complexity, and leveraging our strong customer relationships and global supply chain expertise. 

Other Products 

The remainder of our OshKosh &#32;brand product offerings include baby, sleepwear, outerwear, shoes, hosiery, and accessories. In fiscal 2015 , we generated $86.3 million &#32;in net sales of these other products in our OshKosh retail stores and online, which represented 2.9% &#32;of our consolidated net sales. 

Royalty Income 

We partner with a number of domestic licensees to extend the reach of our OshKosh &#32;brand. We currently have eight domestic licensees selling apparel and accessories. Our largest licensing agreement is with Target. All Genuine Kids from OshKosh &#32;products sold by Target are sold pursuant to this licensing agreement. Our licensed products provide our customers and consumers with a range of OshKosh &#32;products including outerwear, underwear, swimwear, socks, shoes, and accessories. In fiscal 2015 , &#32; we earned approximately $13.2 million &#32;in domestic royalty income from our OshKosh brands. 

INTERNATIONAL 

Our international segment includes Company-operated retail stores, wholesale, and online operations in addition to royalty income from our international licensees. In fiscal 2015 , our international sales were $326.2 million , representing 10.8% &#32;of our consolidated net sales. As of January 2, 2016 , we operated 147 &#32;co-branded Carter's and OshKosh retail stores in Canada. Additionally, we reach consumers in approximately 60 countries through wholesale and licensing relationships and in over 100 countries through our websites. 

As of January 2, 2016 , we partnered with 33 licensees to sell the Carter's &#32;and OshKosh &#32;brands internationally. In fiscal 2015 , our OshKosh &#32;international licensees generated retail sales of $43.1 million , on which we earned approximately $3.0 million &#32;in royalty income. In fiscal 2015 , our international licensees generated Carter's &#32;brand retail sales of $31.6 million , on which we earned $1.8 million &#32;in royalty income. 

SEGMENTS 

Financial and geographical information for our five reportable segments, Carter's Retail, Carter's Wholesale, OshKosh Retail, OshKosh Wholesale, and International, is contained in Item 8 - "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data," under Note 13 - "Segment Information" to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements. 

SALES, MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION 

As described above, we sell our products through the wholesale channel, through our retail stores in the U.S. and Canada, and online. 

&#32;4 

Our Carter's &#32;brand wholesale customers include major retailers, such as, in alphabetical order, Costco, JCPenney, Kohl's, Macy's, Sam's Club, Target, Toys "R" Us, and Walmart. We collaboratively plan store assortments with our wholesale customers. We intend to drive continued growth with our wholesale customers through our focus on managing our key accounts' business through replenishment, product mix, brand presentation, marketing, and frequent meetings with the senior management of our major wholesale customers. 

Our OshKosh &#32;brand wholesale customers include major retailers, such as, in alphabetical order, Baby's "R" Us, Belk, Bon-Ton, Costco, Fred Meyer, JCPenney, Kohl's, Sears, Stage Stores, and Toys "R" Us. We continue to work with our customers to establish seasonal plans. The majority of our OshKosh &#32;brand playclothes products will be planned and ordered seasonally. 

As of January 2, 2016 , we operated 594 &#32;Carter's retail stores in the U.S. These stores carry a complete assortment of baby and young children's apparel, accessories, and gift items. Our stores average approximately 4,400 &#32;square feet per location and are distinguished by an easy, consumer-friendly shopping environment. Our brand stores are generally located in high-traffic strip shopping centers in or near major cities. We believe our brand strength and our assortment of core products have made our stores a destination location within many outlet and strip centers. Our outlet stores are generally located within 20 to 30 minutes of densely-populated areas. 

As of January 2, 2016 , we operated 241 &#32;OshKosh retail stores in the U.S. These stores carry a wide assortment of young children's apparel, accessories, and gift items, and average approximately 4,000 &#32;square feet per location. 

We operate "side-by-side" locations wherein adjacent retail stores for our Carter's &#32;and OshKosh &#32;brands are connected, allowing customers to shop for both brands in a single location. Each "side-by-side" location is counted as one Carter's retail store and one OshKosh retail store. As of January 2, 2016 , the U.S. store count data presented in the two preceding paragraphs for Carter's and OshKosh included 97 &#32;"side-by-side" locations. 

As of January 2, 2016 , we operated 147 &#32;co-branded retail stores in Canada. These stores average approximately 5,100 &#32;square feet per location, slightly larger than our U.S. based stores, and offer a similar product assortment, localized for climate differences. 

Store Expansion 

We use a real estate selection process whereby we assess all new locations based on demographic factors, retail adjacencies, and population density. 

Marketing 

Our marketing is focused on connecting with millennials. As such, we continue to strengthen and evolve our digital programs to put our brands in front of the consumer in new and innovative ways. These digital programs, along with our core direct marketing, are all focused on driving a deeper relationship with the consumer across all touch points. Our goal is for Carter's &#32;and OshKosh &#32;to be the preferred apparel brands in the young children's market, driving loyalty through increased purchase frequency. 

In addition, during fiscal 2015, we implemented our Rewarding Moments&#174; rewards program to drive customer traffic, sales, and brand loyalty. 

Distribution 

Domestically, we operate two distribution centers in Georgia, including our 1,062,000 square feet state-of-the-art distribution center in Braselton, Georgia. We also utilize a distribution center on the west coast. These three U.S. distribution centers supply products to our domestic wholesale customers and to our direct-to-consumer ("DTC") retail operations in the U.S. 

Internationally, we operate and utilize distribution centers in Canada and Asia to support our international wholesale customers and Canadian DTC retail operations. 

GLOBAL SOURCING NETWORK &#160; 

&#32;5 

We source products from an international network of suppliers, primarily from Asia. One sourcing agent currently manages approximately 60% &#32;of our inventory purchases. Our sourcing network consists of over 150 vendors located in 16 countries. 

We believe that our sourcing arrangements are sufficient to meet our current operating requirements and provide capacity for growth. 

&#160; 

We also have direct sourcing operations in Hong Kong and we intend to increase our direct sourcing mix over time in an effort to improve the competitiveness and performance of our supply chain. 

COMPETITION 

The baby and young children's apparel market is highly competitive. Competition is generally based upon product quality, brand name recognition, price, selection, service, and convenience. Both branded and private label manufacturers compete in the baby and young children's apparel market. Our primary competitors in the wholesale channel include private label product offerings, and, in alphabetical order, Disney and Gerber. Our primary competitors in the retail channel include, in alphabetical order, Disney, Gap, Gymboree, Old Navy, and The Children's Place. Most retailers, including our wholesale customers, have significant private label product offerings that compete with our products. Because of the highly-fragmented nature of the industry, we also compete with many small manufacturers and retailers. We believe that the strength of our Carter's , OshKosh , &#32; and related brand names, combined with our breadth of product offerings and operational expertise, position us well against these competitors. 

SEASONALITY 

We experience seasonal fluctuations in our sales and profitability due to the timing of certain holidays and key retail shopping periods, which generally have resulted in lower sales and gross profit in the first half of our fiscal year versus the second half of the year. Accordingly, our results of operations during the first half of the year may not be indicative of the results we expect for the full fiscal year. 

TRADEMARKS AND COPYRIGHTS 

We own many trademarks and copyrights, including &#32;Carter's&#174;, OshKosh&#174;, OshKosh B'gosh&#174;, Genuine Kids&#174;, Child of Mine&#174;, Just One You&#174;, Precious Firsts&#174;, Little Collections&#174;, &#32; Little Layette &#8482;, &#32;Rewarding Moments&#174;, &#32;and Count on Carter&#8217;s &#174;, many of which are registered in the U.S. and in more than 140 countries and territories.
