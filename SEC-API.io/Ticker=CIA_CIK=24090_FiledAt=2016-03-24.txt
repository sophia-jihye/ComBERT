 Item 1 . BUSINESS 

Overview 

Citizens, Inc. (&#8220;Citizens&#8221;) is an insurance holding company incorporated in Colorado serving the life insurance needs of individuals in the United States since 1969 and internationally since 1975. Through our insurance subsidiaries, we pursue a strategy of offering traditional insurance products in niche markets where we believe we are able to achieve competitive advantages. We had approximately $1.5 billion &#32;of assets at December 31, 2015 &#32;and approximately $4.5 billion &#32;of insurance in force. Our core insurance operations include issuing and servicing: 

&#8226; 

U.S. Dollar-denominated ordinary whole life insurance and endowment policies predominantly sold to foreign residents, located principally in Latin America and the Pacific Rim, through independent marketing consultants; 

&#8226; 

ordinary whole life insurance policies to middle income households concentrated in the Midwest, Mountain West and southern United States through independent marketing consultants; and 

&#8226; 

final expense and limited liability property policies to middle and lower income households in Louisiana, Mississippi and Arkansas through employee and independent agents in our home service distribution channel and funeral homes 

We were formed in 1969 by our founder, Harold E. Riley. Prior to our formation, Mr. Riley had many years of experience in the international and domestic life insurance business. Historically, our Company has experienced growth through acquisitions in the domestic market and through organic market expansion in the international market. We strive to generate bottom line return using knowledge of our niche markets and our well-established distribution channels. 

Our business has grown, both internationally and domestically, in recent years, though our profitability has declined. From 2011 through 2015, revenues rose 22% from $194.2 million &#32;in 2011 &#32;to $236.3 million &#32;in 2015 . During that same period, our assets grew 37% from $1,079.5 million &#32;to $1,484.0 million . During this same period, our net income declined 142% from $8.5 million to a net loss of $(3.6) million, primarily as a result of other than temporary impairments ("OTTI"), expense related to additional tax liability contingency and higher consulting costs in 2015. See Item 6. "Selected Financial Data" and Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in this Report. 

Recent Developments 

In June 2015, the Company's Board of Directors appointed Harold E. Riley as Chairman Emeritus and his son Rick D. Riley as Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer. The Board also promoted former Chief Financial Officer Kay E. Osbourn to Chief Corporate Officer and President, promoted Geoffrey M. Kolander to Senior Vice President, Chief Legal Officer and Corporate Strategy and hired David S. Jorgensen as Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. 

In October 2015, Rick Riley, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, assumed leadership of our international business, replacing Randall H. Riley, the international marketing officer of one of our primary insurance subsidiaries, CICA Life Insurance Company of America. 

Strategic Initiatives 

The Company's Board of Directors and executive management team are currently assessing the Company's business model and business strategies with the assistance and support of external consultants and advisors. Specifically, we are evaluating certain elements and assumptions underlying the Company's historical business model to consider potential changes to align with our risk profile, the current economic and regulatory environment and sustainable business objectives. Incorporated in our business model review are analyses of (1) our products and profitability; (2) a potential restructuring of our international business and operations; (3) potential upgrades to our technology systems and operations with a strategic focus on cyber risk and our future business needs; and (4) potential changes in our executive management structure, personnel needs and compensation incentives. 

A prolonged low interest rate period has forced us to revisit the benefits and dividends included under many policies offered internationally. In many cases, policy holders stand to benefit from significantly higher guarantees and dividends than the financial markets might otherwise offer. As such, the Company has responded to cut discretionary dividends on existing policies and revisit the structure of new policies sold internationally to better reflect the prolonged low interest rate environment that we face. 

CITIZENS, INC. AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES 

The Company also is revisiting its investment strategies for premiums received in order to augment its rate of return. By combining more conservative interest rate features in our insurance policies with a more flexible investment strategy to manage our investment portfolio, we intend to grow bottom line returns to shareholders. There is risk that these changes will result in lower demand for new policies, or that the financial markets will make our investment strategy more difficult. Despite the risks, the Company believes that such moves are in the best interest of our shareholders. 

The following pages describe the operations of our three business segments: Life Insurance, Home Service and Other Non-Insurance Enterprises. Revenues derived from any single customer did not exceed 10% of consolidated revenues in any of the last three years. 

Life Insurance 

Our Life Insurance segment issues ordinary whole life insurance in the United States and in U.S. Dollar-denominated amounts to foreign residents. These contracts are designed to provide a fixed amount of insurance coverage over the life of the insured and can utilize rider benefits to provide additional increasing or decreasing coverage and annuity benefits to enhance accumulations. Additionally, endowment contracts are issued by the Company, which are principally accumulation contracts that incorporate an element of life insurance protection. For the majority of our business, we retain the first $100,000 of risk on any one life, reinsuring the remainder of the risk. We operate this segment through our subsidiaries: CICA Life Insurance Company of America ("CICA") and Citizens National Life Insurance Company ("CNLIC"). 

International Sales 

We focus our sales of U.S. Dollar-denominated ordinary whole life insurance and endowment policies to residents in Latin America and the Pacific Rim. As of December 31, 2015, we had insurance policies in force in approximately 30 countries, including Columbia, Venezuela, Taiwan, Ecuador and Argentina as our top producing countries. In 2015, international direct premiums comprised approximately 72% of our total direct premiums, and exceeded 10% or more of our premiums for each of the last three years. We have participated in the foreign marketplace since 1975. We believe positive attributes of our international insurance business include: 

&#8226; 

larger face amount policies typically issued when compared to our U.S. operations, which results in lower underwriting and administrative costs per unit of coverage; 

&#8226; 

premiums typically paid annually rather than monthly or quarterly, which saves us administrative expenses, accelerates cash flow and results in lower policy lapse rates than premiums with more frequently scheduled payments; and 

&#8226; 

persistency experience and mortality rates that are comparable to our U.S. policies. 

&#160; 

We have implemented several policies and procedures to limit the risks of asset and premium loss relating to our international business. Approvals for policy issuance are made in our Austin, Texas office and policies are issued and delivered to the independent consultants, who deliver the policies to the insureds. We have no offices, employees or assets outside of the United States. Insurance policy applications and premium payments are submitted by the independent consultants or customers to us, and we review the applications in our home offices in Austin, Texas. Premiums are paid in U.S. Dollars by check, wire or credit card. The policies we issue contain limitations on benefits for certain causes of death, such as homicide and careless driving. We have also developed disciplined underwriting criteria, which include medical reviews of applicants as well as background and reference checks. In addition, we have a claims policy that requires investigation of substantially all death claims. Furthermore, we perform background reviews and reference checks of prospective independent marketing firms and consultants. 

Independent marketing firms and consultants specialize in marketing life insurance products and generally have several years of insurance marketing experience. We maintain contracts with the independent marketing firms pursuant to which they provide recruitment, training and supervision of their managers and associates in the service and placement of our products; however, all associates of these firms also contract directly with us as independent contractors and receive their compensation directly from us. Accordingly, should an arrangement between any independent marketing firm and us be terminated for any reason, we expect that we would seek to continue with the existing marketing arrangements with the associates of these firms. Our agreements with independent marketing firms and consultants typically provide that they are independent contractors responsible for their own operation expenses and are the representative of the prospective insured. In addition, the marketing firms guarantee any debts of their associates to us. The marketing firms receive commissions on all new and renewal policies serviced or placed by them or their associates. All of these contracts provide that the independent marketing firms and consultants are aware of and responsible for compliance with local laws. 

CITIZENS, INC. AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES 

International Products 

We offer several ordinary whole life insurance and endowment products designed to meet the needs of our non-U.S. policyowners. These policies have been structured to provide: 

&#8226; 

U.S. Dollar-denominated cash values that accumulate, beginning in the first policy year, to a policyholder during his or her lifetime; 

&#8226; 

premium rates that are competitive with or better than most foreign local companies; 

&#8226; 

a hedge against local currency inflation; 

&#8226; 

protection against devaluation of foreign currency; 

&#8226; 

capital investment in a more secure economic environment (i.e., the United States); and 

&#8226; 

lifetime income guarantees for an insured or for surviving beneficiaries. 

Our international products have living benefit features. Every policy contains guaranteed cash values and is participating (i.e., provides for cash dividends as apportioned by the board of directors). Once a policyowner pays the annual premium and the policy is issued, the owner becomes entitled to a cash dividend as well as an annual guaranteed endowment, if elected. The policyowner has several options with regard to the dividend and annual guaranteed endowments, including the right to assign policy values to the Citizens, Inc. Stock Investment Plan, registered under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Securities Act"), and administered in the United States by Computershare, our plan administrator and transfer agent. 

International Competition 

The life insurance business is highly competitive. We compete with a large number of stock and mutual life insurance companies internationally and domestically, as well as with financial institutions that offer insurance products. There are more than 800 life insurance companies in the United States, some of which also provide insurance to foreign residents. 

We face competition primarily from companies formed and operated in the country in which the insureds reside, from companies that operate in the same manner as we do and from companies that are foreign to the countries in which policies are sold, but issue insurance policies denominated in the local currency of those countries. A substantial number of companies may be deemed to have a competitive advantage over us due to their significantly greater financial resources, histories of successful operations and larger marketing forces. 

Because premiums on our international policies are paid in U.S. Dollars, and we pay claims and benefits in U.S. Dollars, we provide a product that is different from the products offered by foreign-domiciled companies. We believe our international policies are usually acquired by individuals in the upper middle class in their countries and those with significant net worth and earnings that place them in the upper income brackets of their respective countries. The policies sold by our foreign competitors are generally offered broadly and are priced using the mortality of the entire population of the geographic region. Our mortality charges are therefore typically lower, which provides a competitive advantage. Additionally, the assets backing the reserves for our foreign competitors' policies must be substantially invested in their respective countries and, therefore, are exposed to the inflationary risks and social or economic crises that have been more common in these foreign countries. 

Domestic Sales 

In 2015, domestic direct premiums comprised approximately 28% of our total direct premiums. The majority of our domestic inforce business results from blocks of business of insurance companies we have acquired over the past 17 years. Our acquisition transition strategy focuses on the introduction of our cash accumulation ordinary whole life products to independent marketing consultants associated with companies we have acquired, while continuing to service the needs of acquired policyholders. 

In the Mountain West, Midwest and the southern United States, we seek to serve middle-income households through the sale of cash accumulation ordinary whole life insurance products. Our distribution strategy is through independent agents. Over the past few years, new product sales have been modest while existing policies have been running off at a greater pace compressing the block of insurance in force. 

CITIZENS, INC. AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES 

Domestic Life Insurance Products 

Our domestic life insurance products focus primarily on living needs and provide benefits focused toward accumulating money for the policyowner. The features of our domestic life insurance products include: 

&#8226; 

cash accumulation/living benefits; 

&#8226; 

tax-deferred interest earnings; 

&#8226; 

guaranteed lifetime income options; 

&#8226; 

monthly income for surviving family members; 

&#8226; 

accidental death benefit coverage options; and 

&#8226; 

an option to waive premium payments in the event of disability. 

Our life insurance products are principally designed to address the insured's concern about outliving his or her monthly income, while at the same time providing death benefits. The primary purpose of our product portfolio is to help the insured create capital for needs such as retirement income, children's higher education funds, business opportunities, emergencies and health care needs. 

Domestic Competition 

The U.S. life insurance industry is a mature industry that, in recent years, has experienced little to no growth. Competition is intense because the life insurance industry is consolidating, with larger, more efficient and more effective organizations emerging from consolidation. 

Many domestic life insurance companies have significantly greater financial, marketing forces and other resources, longer business histories and more diversified lines of insurance products than we do. We also face competition from companies marketing in person as well as with direct mail and Internet sales campaigns. Although we may be at a competitive disadvantage to these entities, we believe our premium rates and policy features are generally competitive with those of other life insurance companies selling similar types of ordinary whole life insurance. 

&#160; 

Domestic Home Service Insurance 

Our domestic Home Service segment operates in this market through our subsidiaries Security Plan Life Insurance Company ("SPLIC"), Magnolia Guaranty Life Insurance Company ("MGLIC") and Security Plan Fire Insurance Company ("SPFIC"), and focuses on the life insurance needs of the middle and lower income markets, primarily in Louisiana, Mississippi and Arkansas. Our policies are sold and serviced through a home service marketing distribution system of approximately 313 employee-agents who work on a route system and through over 307 &#32;funeral homes and independent agents to sell policies, collect premiums and service policyholders. To a lesser extent, our Home Service segment sells limited-liability, named peril property policies covering dwelling and contents. In 2015, our Home Service segment comprised 24%, or $47.6 million of our total direct premiums. 

Home Service Products and Competition 

Our home service insurance products consist primarily of small face amount ordinary whole life and pre-need policies, which are designed to fund final expenses for the insured, primarily consisting of funeral and burial costs. The average life insurance policy face amount issued was approximately $6,700 &#32;in 2015 ; therefore, the underwriting performed on these applications is limited. Our property coverages are limited to $30,000 &#32;maximum coverage on any one dwelling and contents, while content-only coverage and dwelling-only coverage is limited to $20,000 . We face competition in Louisiana, Mississippi and Arkansas from other companies specializing in home service distribution of insurance. We seek to compete based upon our emphasis on personal service to our customers. We intend to continue premium growth within this segment via direct sales and acquisitions. 

Other Non-Insurance Enterprises 

Other Non-insurance Enterprises includes Computing Technology, Inc., which provides data processing services to the Company, and Insurance Investors, Inc., which provides aviation transportation to the Company. This segment also includes the results of Citizens, Inc., the parent Company. 

CITIZENS, INC. AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES 

Operations and Technology 

Our administrative operations principally serve our life insurance segment and are conducted primarily at our executive offices in Austin, Texas through approximately 122 &#32;administrative, operating and underwriting personnel. Our Home Service operations are conducted to a large degree from our district offices in Louisiana, Arkansas and Mississippi, as well as our service center in Donaldsonville, Louisiana. At our executive offices, we also perform policy design, marketing oversight, underwriting, accounting and reporting, actuarial, customer service, claims processing, administration and investing activities. 

We have a single integrated system for our entire Company, which is a centrally-controlled, mainframe-based administrative system. Functions of our policy administrative system include policy set up, administration, billing and collections, commission calculation, valuation, automated data edits, storage backup, image management and other related functions. Each company we acquire is ultimately converted onto our administrative system. This system has been in place for more than 30 years and operated across multiple platforms and operating environments as technological efficiencies evolved. We update our administrative system on an ongoing basis but it does require programmers experienced in our IT environment. 

We are currently reviewing technology options to transition from our legacy administration system to an upgraded, modernized technology platform that will service our needs into the future. 

Enterprise Risk Management 

The Company has recently established an enterprise risk management function (&#8220;ERM&#8221;) that is charged with providing analyses of the Company&#8217;s risks on an individual and aggregated basis and with ensuring that the Company&#8217;s risks remain within its risk appetite and tolerances. The Company's focus on ERM strengthens its risk management culture and discipline. The mission of ERM is to support the Company in achieving its strategic priorities by: 

&#8226; 

Providing a comprehensive view of the risks facing the Company, including risk concentrations and correlations; 

&#8226; 

Helping management define the Company&#8217;s overall capacity and appetite for risk by evaluating the risk return profile of the business relative to the Company&#8217;s strategic intent and financial underpinning; 

&#8226; 

Assisting management in setting specific risk tolerances and limits that are measurable, actionable, and comply with the Company&#8217;s overall risk philosophy; 

&#8226; 

Communicating and monitoring the Company&#8217;s risk exposures relative to set limits and recommending, or implementing as appropriate, mitigating strategies; and 

&#8226; 

Providing insight to assist in growing the businesses and achieving optimal risk-adjusted returns within established guidelines. 

Enterprise Risk Management Structure and Governance 

While it is the job of the CEO and senior management to assess and manage the Company&#8217; risk exposure, the Audit Committee of its Board of Directors is charged with discussing guidelines and policies to govern the process by which ERM is handled. The Audit Committee periodically discusses the Company&#8217;s major financial risk exposure and the steps management has taken to monitor and control such exposures. 

The categories of risk exposures assessed and managed by senior management include, but are not limited to: 

&#8226; 

Market risk, including credit, interest rate, equity market, and foreign exchange; 

&#8226; 

Liquidity and capital requirements of the Company; 

&#8226; 

Insurance risks, including those arising out of catastrophes and acts of terrorism; 

&#8226; 

International business risks; 

&#8226; 

Legal and regulatory compliance risks; 

&#8226; 

Cybersecurity risk; and 

&#8226; 

Any other risk that poses a material threat to the strategic viability of the Company. 

Regulation 

Our U.S. insurance operations are subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations. State insurance laws establish supervisory agencies with broad regulatory authority to regulate most aspects of our U.S. insurance businesses, and our insurance subsidiaries are regulated by the insurance departments of each state in which they are licensed. In addition, U.S. laws, such as the USA Patriot 

CITIZENS, INC. AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES 

Act of 2001, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (&#8220;FCPA&#8221;), the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, the International Money Laundering Abatement and Financial Anti-Terrorism Act of 2001, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act ("the Dodd-Frank Act"), are examples of U.S. regulations that affect our business. We are subject to comprehensive regulations under the USA Patriot Act and the Bank Secrecy Act with respect to money laundering, as well as federal regulations regarding privacy and confidentiality. Our insurance products and thus our businesses also are affected by U.S. federal, state and local tax laws. The Dodd-Frank Act focuses on financial reform and may result in significant changes to the regulation of institutions operating in the financial services industry, including the Company. Legislative or regulatory requirements imposed by or promulgated in connection with this Act may make it more expensive for the Company to conduct its business, may have a material adverse effect on the overall business climate and could materially affect the profitability of the results of operations and financial condition of financial institutions. The Company is uncertain as to all of the impacts this legislation will have and cannot provide assurance it will not adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition. In general, government regulation at the federal level may increase and may result in unpredictable consequences for the Company. In addition, other federal laws and regulations apply to us in areas such as pension regulations, privacy, tort reform and taxation. 

&#160; 

The purpose of the laws and regulations that affect our insurance business is primarily to protect our insureds and not our stockholders. Many of the laws and regulations to which we are subject are regularly re-examined, and existing or future laws and regulations may become more restrictive or otherwise adversely affect our operations. In addition, insurance regulatory authorities (including state law enforcement agencies and attorneys general) periodically make inquiries and regularly conduct examinations regarding compliance by us and our subsidiaries with insurance, and other laws and regulations regarding the conduct of our insurance businesses. We cooperate with such inquiries and examinations and take corrective action when warranted. 

&#160; 

Our insurance subsidiaries are collectively licensed to transact business in 32 &#32;states. We have insurance subsidiaries domiciled in the states of Colorado, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas. Our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are licensed and regulated in all U.S. jurisdictions in which they conduct insurance business. The extent of this regulation varies, but most jurisdictions have laws and regulations based upon the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (&#8220;NAIC&#8221;) model rules governing the financial condition of insurers, including standards of solvency, types and concentration of investments, establishment and maintenance of reserves, credit for reinsurance and requirements of capital adequacy, and the business conduct of insurers, including marketing and sales practices and claims handling. In addition, statutes and regulations usually require the licensing of insurers and their agents, the approval of policy forms and related materials and the approval of rates for certain types of insurance products. 

&#160; 

All U.S. jurisdictions in which our U.S. insurance subsidiaries conduct insurance business have enacted legislation that requires each U.S. insurance company in a holding company system, except captive insurance companies, to register with the insurance regulatory authority of its jurisdiction of domicile and to furnish that regulatory authority financial and other information concerning the operations of, and the interrelationships and transactions among, companies within its holding company system that may materially affect the operations, management or financial condition of the insurers within the system. These laws and regulations also regulate transactions between insurance companies and their parents and affiliates. Generally, these laws and regulations require that all transactions within a holding company system between an insurer and its affiliates be fair and reasonable and that the insurer's statutory capital and surplus following any transaction with an affiliate be both reasonable in relation to its outstanding liabilities and adequate to its financial needs. Statutory surplus is the excess of admitted assets over the sum of statutory liabilities and capital. For certain types of agreements and transactions between an insurer and its affiliates, these laws and regulations require prior notification to, and non-disapproval or approval by, the insurance regulatory authority of the insurer's jurisdiction of domicile. 

We have never qualified to do business in any foreign country and have never submitted our insurance policies issued to residents of foreign countries for approval by any foreign or domestic insurance regulatory agency. We sell our policies to residents of foreign countries using foreign independent marketing firms and independent consultants, and we rely on those persons to comply with laws applicable to them in marketing our insurance products in their respective countries. We recently have undertaken a comprehensive compliance review of risks associated with foreign insurance laws and regulations, with assistance from independent outside advisors. We cannot predict the outcome of this review and cannot assure you that any of these laws, regulations, or application of them by foreign regulatory authorities will not have an adverse effect on the marketing efforts of our independent marketing consultants and, in turn, on our revenues and profitability. 

The payment of dividends or other distributions to us by our insurance subsidiaries is regulated by the insurance laws and regulations of their respective states of domicile. The laws and regulations of some of these jurisdictions also prohibit an insurer from declaring or paying a dividend except out of its earned surplus or require the insurer to obtain regulatory approval before it may do so. In addition, insurance regulators may prohibit the payment of ordinary dividends or other payments by our insurance subsidiaries to 

CITIZENS, INC. AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES 

us (such as a payment under a tax sharing agreement or for employee or other services) if they determine such payment could be adverse to policyholders or insurance contract holders of the subsidiary. 

&#160; 

The laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are domiciled require that a controlling party obtain the approval of the insurance commissioner of the insurance company's jurisdiction of domicile prior to acquiring control of the insurer and may delay, deter or prevent a transaction our shareholders might consider desirable. 

&#160; 

Risk-based capital ("RBC") requirements are imposed on life and property and casualty insurance companies. The NAIC has established minimum capital requirements in the form of RBC. RBC factors the type of business written by an insurance company, the quality of its assets, and various other aspects of an insurance company's business to develop a minimum level of capital called "authorized control level risk-based capital" and compares this level to adjusted statutory capital that includes capital and surplus as reported under statutory accounting principles, plus certain investment reserves. Should the ratio of adjusted statutory capital to control level risk-based capital fall below 200%, a series of actions by the affected company would begin. 

Potential Changes in Regulation 

Government actions in response to the recent financial crisis and market volatility could significantly impact our current regulations. As part of a comprehensive reform of financial services regulation known as the Dodd-Frank Act, Congress established an office within the federal government to collect information about the insurance industry, recommend standards, and represent the United States in dealing with foreign insurance regulators.
