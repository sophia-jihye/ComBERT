 11. Business Acquisition 

On July 1, 2015, the Company completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding equity of Maniago. This acquisition resulted in a major milestone for the Company to bring SIFCO back to being a multi-national A&#38;E company that has locations near its worldwide customer base. Maniago's forging and machining capabilities and European location will help serve the energy market with high quality, cost effective solutions for their growing businesses. The forging business is operated at two &#32;facilities, located in Maniago, Italy. The purchase price for the forging business, net of the assumed debt was approximately $16,719 , after a $ 275 &#32;purchase price adjustment received and recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 for adjustments principally related to the final working capital level and indebtedness adjustment. In addition, the Company has assumed certain current operating liabilities and indebtedness of the forging business. The Company recorded net sales of $6,000 &#32;and net operating income of $ 209 &#32;from the date of acquisition through September 30, 2015. 

The Maniago purchase transaction is accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. The Company completed the purchase accounting related to the Maniago acquisition. The fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, were based upon appraisals, other studies and additional information available at the time of the acquisition of Maniago (level 3 inputs). The Company believes 

SIFCO Industries, Inc. and Subsidiaries 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements &#8211; &#32; (Continued) 

that such information provided a reasonable basis for determining the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. To the extent the purchase price exceeded the estimated fair value of the net identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and assumed, such excess was allocated to goodwill. 

The following table summarizes the Company's purchase price allocation of the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed:

13. Subsequent event 

On November 9, 2016, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated agreement with its lender. The new Amended and Restated Agreement matures on June 25, 2020 and the Credit Facility consists an aggregate principal amount of up to $39,871 . The Credit Facility is comprised of (i) a senior secured revolving credit facility of a maximum borrowing amount of $35,000 , including swing line loans and letters of credit provided by the lender and (ii) senior secured Term Facility in the amount of $ 4,871 &#32;. The new Term Facility is repayable in monthly installments of $81 &#32;beginning December 1, 2016. The terms of Credit Facility contain both a lockbox arrangement and subjective acceleration clause. As a result, the amounts outstanding on the revolving credit facility will be classified as a current maturities of long-term debt. The amounts borrowed under the Amended and Restated Agreement will be used to repay the amounts outstanding under the Company's existing Credit Agreement as of September 30, 2016, for working capital, for general corporate purposes and to pay fees and expenses associated with this transaction. In connection with entering into the Amended and Restated Agreement, the Company terminated its interest rate swap agreement with the lender. 

Amounts borrowed under the Credit Facility are secured by substantially all the assets of the Company and its U.S. subsidiaries and a pledge of 65% &#32;of the stock of its first-tier non-U.S. subsidiaries. Borrowings will bear interest at the LIBOR rate or prime rate, depending on the type of loan requested by the Company, in each case, plus the applicable margin as set forth in the Amended and Restated Agreement. 

The bank loans contain affirmative and negative covenants customary for a transaction of this type which, among other things, require the Company to maintain a minimum consolidated adjusted EBITDA and maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. The Credit Agreement also contains covenants which, among other things, limit the Company's ability to: incur unfunded capital expenditures; incur additional debt; make certain investments; create or permit certain liens; merge, consolidate or sell assets outside of the ordinary course of business; and engage in other activities customarily restricted in such agreements, in each case subject to exceptions permitted by the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement also contains customary representations and warranties and default provisions (with customary grace periods, as applicable) and provides that, upon the occurrence and continuation of an event of default, payment of all amounts payable under the Credit Facility may be accelerated and/or the lenders&#8217; commitments may be terminated. In addition, upon the occurrence of certain insolvency or bankruptcy related events of default, such commitments will automatically terminate and all amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility will automatically become immediately due and payable. 

The cost associated to new agreement is approximately $ 700 .
