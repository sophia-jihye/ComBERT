 ITEM 1. BUSINESS &#160; &#160;

Our Businesses 

&#160;

Overview 

&#160;

First Horizon National Corporation (the &#8220;Corporation,&#8221; &#8220;First Horizon,&#8221; &#8220;FHN,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; or &#8220;us&#8221;) is a Tennessee corporation headquartered in Memphis, Tennessee and incorporated in 1968. We are registered as a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act, and are a financial holding company under the provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. At December 31, 2015, FHN had total consolidated assets of $26.2 billion.

&#160;

We provide diversified financial services primarily through our principal subsidiary, First Tennessee Bank National Association (the &#8220;Bank,&#8221; &#8220;FTB,&#8221; or &#8220;FTBNA&#8221;). Financial results of operations are reported through operational business segments which are not related to the legal structure of our subsidiaries.

Business Segments 

&#160;

At year-end 2015 we operate through four business segments: regional banking, fixed income, corporate, and non-strategic. We sometimes refer to regional banking, fixed income, and corporate as our &#8220;core&#8221; segments. Before 2015, the fixed income segment was known as the capital markets segment.

&#160;

Regional Banking . The regional banking segment offers financial products and services, including traditional lending and deposit taking, to retail and commercial customers in Tennessee and other selected markets. Regional banking provides investments, financial planning, trust services and asset management, credit card, and cash management. Additionally, the regional banking segment includes correspondent banking which provides credit, depository, and other banking-related services to other financial institutions nationally.

&#160;

Fixed Income . The fixed income segment consists of fixed income securities sales, trading, and strategies for institutional clients in the U.S. and abroad, as well as loan sales, portfolio advisory services, and derivative sales.

&#160;

Corporate . The corporate segment consists of unallocated corporate expenses, expense on subordinated debt issuances, bank-owned life insurance, unallocated interest income associated with excess equity, net impact of raising incremental capital, revenue and expense associated with deferred compensation plans, funds management, tax credit investment activities, gains on the extinguishment of debt, acquisition-related costs, and various charges related to restructuring, repositioning, and efficiency initiatives.

&#160;

Non-Strategic . The nonstrategic segment consists of the wind-down national consumer lending activities,

legacy mortgage banking elements including servicing fees (after first quarter 2014 these amounts became significantly lower), and the associated ancillary revenues and expenses related to these businesses. Non-strategic also includes the wind-down trust preferred loan portfolio and exited businesses along with the associated restructuring, repositioning, and efficiency charges.

&#160;

The approximate percentage of consolidated revenues (for this purpose, the sum of net interest income and noninterest income), consolidated expenses, and average assets ascribed to each of our segments for the past three years is set forth below. During that period, the regional banking segment total revenues and average assets have grown as a share of our consolidated total, while non-strategic has shrunk.

Financial and other additional information concerning our segments &#8211; including information concerning assets, revenues, and financial results &#8211; appears in the response to Item 7 of Part II of this report and Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in our 2015 Annual Report to shareholders. During 2015 approximately 44% of our consolidated revenues were provided by fee and other noninterest income and approximately 56% of revenues were provided by net interest income. As a financial holding company, we coordinate the financial resources of the consolidated enterprise and maintain systems of financial, operational, and administrative control intended to coordinate selected policies and activities, including as described in Item 9A of Part II.

&#160;

First Tennessee Bank 

&#160;

The Bank is a national banking association with principal offices in Memphis, Tennessee. It received its charter in 1864. During 2015 through its various business lines, including consolidated subsidiaries, the Bank generated gross revenue (net interest income plus noninterest income) of approximately $1.2 billion and contributed the majority of our consolidated revenue from continuing operations.

At December 31, 2015, the Bank had $26.0 billion in total assets, $20.1 billion in total deposits, and $17.5 billion in total net loans. Among Tennessee headquartered banks, the Bank ranked 1 st in Tennessee deposit market share at June 30, 2015.

&#160;

Business Locations 

&#160;

At December 31, 2015, FHN&#8217;s subsidiaries had over 200 business locations in 22 U.S. states, excluding off-premises ATMs. Almost all of those locations were bank financial centers and FTN Financial offices.

&#160;

At December 31, 2015, the Bank had 185 branch locations in eight states: 166 branches in Tennessee; 2 branches in northwestern Georgia; 6 branches in northwestern Mississippi; 7 branches in North Carolina; and one branch each in Virginia, South Carolina, Florida, and Texas. The Bank has customer-service offices which are not legal bank branches, including private client and commercial loan offices, in Kentucky as well as in states where branches are located. The Bank also has operational and administrative offices in Tennessee.

At December 31, 2015, FTN Financial products and services were offered through 29 offices in 18 states across the U.S.

&#160;

Services We Provide 

&#160;

At December 31, 2015, we provided the following services through our subsidiaries and divisions:

&#160;

&#183; general banking services for consumers, businesses, financial institutions, and governments &#160; &#160; &#183; through FTN Financial &#8211; fixed income sales and trading; underwriting of bank-eligible securities and other fixed-income securities eligible for underwriting by financial subsidiaries; loan sales; advisory services; and derivative sales 

&#183; discount brokerage and full-service brokerage &#160; &#160; &#183; correspondent banking &#160; &#160; &#183; transaction processing &#8211; nationwide check clearing services and remittance processing &#160; &#160; &#183; trust, fiduciary, and agency services &#160; &#160; &#183; credit card products &#160; &#160; &#183; equipment finance &#160; &#160; &#183; investment and financial advisory services &#160; &#160; &#183; mutual fund sales as agent &#160; &#160; &#183; retail insurance sales as agent &#160; &#160; &#183; mortgage banking services 

&#160;

Recent Significant Changes &#160;

&#160;

Since 2007 we have undergone substantial changes. Prior to 2008 our principal businesses were in the areas of regional banking, fixed income, and home mortgage. Our regional banking footprint was in the major Tennessee-based market areas. Our fixed income business, which had primarily institutional customers, was nationwide in scope. We had home mortgage offices across the U.S. and were using those offices to expand our banking business. We had opened over 30 bank branches &#8211; more than 15% of our total branches at that time &#8211; in selected mortgage markets; we made home equity loans through our mortgage offices; and we made commercial loans in many mortgage markets, mostly to homebuilders. We sometimes refer to these legacy mortgage-driven activities outside of our regional banking markets as our &#8220;national&#8221; businesses.

&#160;

In 2007 and 2008 we changed our strategy substantially in response to the mortgage crisis and recession. During this time we focused on enhancing our credit management processes, improving our efficiency, redirecting resources to support and build our regional banking and fixed income businesses, and eliminating through sale or closure those business units which no longer fit our strategy. These actions changed our company in substantial ways.

&#160;

In 2016 we are a smaller company in terms of assets and liabilities than we were in 2008, with a different business mix and strategic focus. Our efficiency and other re-focus efforts are continuing. Also, we continue to manage potential liabilities stemming from the national business activities conducted before 2008.

&#160;

Economic, market, and regulatory conditions also have impacted our business substantially during this period, putting downward pressure on revenues and upward

pressure on compliance expense while limiting organic growth opportunities within our traditional markets. These conditions have created significant incentives to operate more efficiently.

&#160;

Growth in our regional banking segment has been limited due to the recession and weak recovery. However, since 2012 we have been able to grow the segment in several ways.

&#160;

First, we created a &#8220;Mid-Atlantic&#8221; region within the regional banking segment. Through organic and acquisitive growth we now have branches in Raleigh, Winston-Salem, and Greenville, North Carolina; Richmond, Virginia; Charleston, South Carolina; and Jacksonville, Florida. We also have a branch focused on commercial lending in Houston, Texas.

&#160;

Second, prompted significantly by two recent acquisitions involving branches in several smaller Tennessee communities, in 2014 we reorganized our community banking model to better match our products and services to customer demand in smaller markets.

&#160;

In the past several years we have experienced extremely low interest rates, a relatively flat yield curve, and significant uncertainty regarding future interest rate movements. This environment has had substantial impacts on lending margins within our regional banking segment and has also negatively impacted the trading activities of our fixed income segment. In 2015 our lending margins remained at historically low levels, though lending revenues (net interest income) improved due to loan growth in regional banking. Fixed income trading revenues improved in 2015 as uncertainty about future rate movements lessened somewhat.

Supervision and Regulation &#160;

&#160;

The following summary describes certain of the material elements of the regulatory framework applicable to bank and financial holding companies and their subsidiaries, and to companies engaged in securities and insurance activities. It also provides certain specific information about us. The bank regulatory framework is intended primarily for the protection of depositors and the Federal Deposit Insurance Fund and not for the protection of our Bank or our security holders. To the extent that the following information describes statutory and regulatory provisions, it is qualified in its entirety by express reference to each of the particular statutory and regulatory provisions. A change in applicable statutes, regulations or regulatory policy may have a material effect on our business.

&#160;

Overview 

&#160;

FHN is a bank holding company and financial holding company within the meaning of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the &#8220;BHCA&#8221;), and is registered with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the &#8220;Federal Reserve&#8221; or &#8220;Federal Reserve Board&#8221;). We are subject to the regulation and supervision of, and to examination by, the Federal Reserve under the BHCA. We are required to file with the Federal Reserve annual reports and such additional information as the Federal Reserve may require pursuant to the BHCA.

&#160;

Before 2000 bank holding companies generally could not directly or indirectly acquire the ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares or substantially all of the assets of any company, including a bank, without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve. Also, a bank holding company and its subsidiaries generally were limited to engaging in banking and activities found by the Federal Reserve to be closely related to banking. Since 2000 eligible bank holding companies that elect to become financial holding companies may affiliate with securities firms and insurance companies and engage in activities that

are &#8220;financial in nature&#8221; generally without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve. See &#8220;Financial Activities other than Banking&#8221; beginning on page 11 below. In addition, the Federal Reserve may approve an application by a bank holding company to acquire a bank located outside the acquirer&#8217;s principal state of operations without regard to whether the transaction is prohibited under state law, although state law may still impose certain requirements. See &#8220;Interstate Banking and Branching&#8221; beginning on page 10 below.

&#160;

The Tennessee Bank Structure Act of 1974, among other things, prohibits (subject to certain exceptions) a bank holding company from acquiring a bank for which the home state is Tennessee (a &#8220;Tennessee bank&#8221;) if, upon consummation, the company would directly or indirectly control 30% or more of the total deposits in insured depository institutions in Tennessee. As of June 30, 2015, we estimate that we held approximately 14 % of such deposits.

&#160;

Our Bank is a national banking association subject to regulation, examination and supervision by the OCC as its primary federal regulator. The Bank is insured by, and subject to regulation by, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the &#8220;FDIC&#8221;) and is subject to regulation in certain respects by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the &#8220;CFPB&#8221;). The Bank is also subject to various requirements and restrictions under federal and state law, including requirements to maintain reserves against deposits, restrictions on the types and amounts of loans that may be granted and the interest that may be charged thereon and limitations on the types of investments that may be made, activities that may be engaged in, and types of services that may be offered. Various consumer laws and regulations also affect the operations of the Bank. In addition to the impact of regulation, commercial banks are affected significantly by the actions of the Federal Reserve as it attempts to control the money supply and credit availability in order to influence the economy. Also, the Bank and certain of its subsidiaries are prohibited

from engaging in certain tie-in arrangements in connection with extensions of credit, leases or sales of property, or furnishing products or services.

&#160;

Payment of Dividends 

&#160;

FHN is a legal entity separate and distinct from its banking and other subsidiaries. FHN&#8217;s principal source of cash flow, including cash flow to pay dividends on its stock or to pay principal (including premium, if any) and interest on debt securities, is dividends from the Bank. There are statutory and regulatory limitations on the payment of dividends by the Bank to FHN, as well as by FHN to its shareholders.

&#160;

As a national bank, our Bank is required by federal law to obtain the prior approval of the OCC for the payment of cash dividends if the total of all dividends declared by the board of directors of the Bank in any year will exceed the total of (i) its net profits (as defined and interpreted by regulation) for that year plus (ii) the retained net profits (as defined and interpreted by regulation) for the preceding two years, less any required transfers to surplus. A national bank also can pay dividends only to the extent that retained net profits (including the portion transferred to surplus) exceed bad debts (as defined by regulation).

&#160;

If, in the opinion of an applicable federal bank regulatory agency, a depository institution (such as the Bank) or a holding company (such as FHN) is engaged in or is about to engage in an unsafe or unsound practice (which, depending on the financial condition of the depository institution or holding company, could include the payment of dividends), that agency may require the institution or holding company to cease and desist from that practice. The federal banking agencies have indicated that paying dividends that deplete a depository institution&#8217;s or holding company&#8217;s capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice.

&#160;

In addition, under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (&#8220;FDIA&#8221;), an FDIC-insured depository institution may not make any capital distributions, pay any management fees to its holding company, or pay any dividend if it is undercapitalized or if such payment would cause it to become undercapitalized.

&#160;

Applying the dividend restrictions imposed under applicable federal rules as outlined above, the Bank&#8217;s total amount available for dividends was negative $192.8 million as of December 31, 2015 and negative 

$142.0 million as of January 1, 2016. Consequently, the Bank cannot pay common dividends to its sole common stockholder, FHN, or to its preferred shareholders without prior regulatory approval. The application of those restrictions to the Bank is discussed in more detail in the following sections, all of which is incorporated into this Item 1 by reference: under the caption &#8220;Liquidity Management&#8221; in the Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section beginning on page 54 of our 2015 Annual Report to shareholders; and under the caption &#8220;Restrictions on dividends&#8221; in Note 12 &#8211; Regulatory Capital and Restrictions beginning on page 124 which is part of the material from our 2015 Annual Report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 8 of this report.

&#160;

Under Tennessee law, FHN is not permitted to pay cash dividends if, after giving effect to such payment, FHN would not be able to pay its debts as they become due in the usual course of business or its total assets would be less than the sum of its total liabilities plus any amounts needed to satisfy any preferential rights if we were dissolving. In addition, in deciding whether or not to declare a dividend of any particular size, our Board must consider our current and prospective capital, liquidity, and other needs, including the needs of the Bank which FHN is obligated to support.

&#160;

The payment of cash dividends by FHN and the Bank also may be affected or limited by other factors, such as the requirement to maintain adequate capital above regulatory guidelines and debt covenants. For example, as discussed under &#8220;Capital Adequacy&#8221; starting on page 7 below, FHN&#8217;s ability to pay dividends would be restricted if its capital ratios fell below minimum regulatory requirements plus a capital conservation buffer. Furthermore, the Federal Reserve and the OCC have issued policy statements generally requiring insured banks and bank holding companies only to pay dividends out of current operating earnings. The Federal Reserve has released a supervisory letter advising bank holding companies, among other things, that as a general matter a bank holding company should inform the Federal Reserve and should eliminate, defer, or significantly reduce its dividends if (i) the bank holding company&#8217;s net income available to shareholders for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid during that period, is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends; (ii) the bank holding company&#8217;s prospective rate of earnings is not consistent with the bank holding company&#8217;s capital needs and overall current and prospective financial condition; or (iii) the bank holding company will not meet, or is in danger of not meeting, its minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios.

Transactions with Affiliates 

&#160;

There are various legal restrictions on the extent to which FHN and its nonbank subsidiaries (including for purposes of this paragraph, in certain situations, subsidiaries of the Bank) can borrow or otherwise obtain credit from the Bank. There are also legal restrictions on the Bank&#8217;s purchases of or investments in the securities of and purchases of assets from FHN and its nonbank subsidiaries, the Bank&#8217;s loans or extensions of credit to third parties collateralized by the securities or obligations of FHN and its nonbank subsidiaries, the issuance of guaranties, acceptances and letters of credit on behalf of FHN and its nonbank subsidiaries, and certain bank transactions with FHN and its nonbank subsidiaries, or with respect to which FHN and its nonbank subsidiaries act as agent, participate or have a financial interest. The Bank and its subsidiaries generally may not extend credit to FHN or to any other affiliate in an amount which exceeds 10% of the Bank&#8217;s capital stock and surplus and may not extend credit in the aggregate to all such affiliates in an amount which exceeds 20% of its capital stock and surplus. Further, there are legal requirements as to the type, amount, and quality of collateral which must secure such extensions of credit by the Bank to FHN or to such other affiliates. Extensions of credit and other transactions between the Bank and FHN or such other affiliates must be on terms and under circumstances, including credit standards, that are substantially the same or at least as favorable to the Bank as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with non-affiliated companies.

&#160;

Capital Adequacy 

&#160;

U.S. financial industry regulators have long required that minimum capital adequacy standards be maintained by regulated institutions. Following an extended reform effort, enhancements to the capital rules were adopted in 2013. For FHN the new rules became effective in 2015, subject to a phase-in period for certain subjects. The rules that were applicable to FHN in 2014 are discussed in the next section below.

In 2013 regulators adopted enhancements to U.S. capital standards based on international standards known as &#8220;Basel III.&#8221; The standards created a new emphasis on Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, modified eligibility criteria for regulatory capital instruments, and modified the methodology for calculating risk-weighted assets. The revised standards, applicable to us starting in 2015, require the following:

&#160;

&#183; Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio. For all supervised financial institutions, including FHN and the Bank, the ratio of Common Equity Tier 1 Capital to risk-weighted assets (&#8220;Common Equity Tier 1 

&#160; Capital ratio&#8221;) must be at least 4.5%. To be &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; the Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio must be at least 6.5%. Common Equity Tier 1 Capital consists of core components of Tier 1 Capital. The core components of Tier 1 Capital consist of common stock plus retained earnings net of goodwill, other intangible assets, and certain other required deduction items. At December 31, 2015, FHN&#8217;s Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio was 10.45% and the Bank&#8217;s was 10.81%. &#160;

&#183; Tier 1 Capital Ratio. For all supervised financial institutions, including FHN and the Bank, the ratio of Tier 1 Capital to risk-weighted assets must be at least 6%. The current threshold was raised from 4%, and the risk-weighting method was changed as mentioned above. To be &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; the Tier 1 Capital ratio must be at least 8%. Tier 1 Capital consists of the Tier 1 core components discussed in the bulleted paragraph immediately above, plus non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, a limited amount of minority interests in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries, and a limited amount of cumulative perpetual preferred stock and trust preferred securities, net of goodwill, other intangible assets, and certain other required deduction items. Starting in 2016, trust preferred securities no longer are included in FHN&#8217;s Tier 1 Capital. At December 31, 2015, FHN&#8217;s Tier 1 Capital Ratio was 11.79% and the Bank&#8217;s was 11.95%. &#160;

&#183; Total Capital Ratio. For all supervised financial institutions, including FHN and the Bank, the ratio of Total Capital to risk-weighted assets must be at least 8%. Although this threshold was unchanged from 2014 requirements, as mentioned above the method for risk-weighting assets was changed. At December 31, 2015, FHN&#8217;s Total Capital Ratio was 13.01% and the Bank&#8217;s was 13.09%. &#160;

&#183; Capital Conservation Buffer. If a capital conservation buffer of an additional 2.5% above the minimum required Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio, Tier 1 Capital ratio, and Total Capital ratio is not maintained, special restrictions would apply to capital distributions, such as dividends and stock repurchases, and on certain compensatory bonuses. The capital conservation buffer requirement is subject to a four-year phase-in period beginning for us in 2016 at 0.625%, and increasing by that amount each year until 2.5% is reached in 2019. &#160;

&#183; Leverage Ratio &#8211; Base. For all supervised financial institutions, including FHN and the Bank, the Leverage ratio must be at least 4%. To be &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; the Leverage ratio must be at least 5%. The Leverage ratio is Tier 1 Capital divided by quarterly average assets net of goodwill, certain other intangible assets, and certain required deduction items. At December 31, 2015, FHN&#8217;s Leverage ratio was 9.85% and the Bank&#8217;s was 10.06%. 

&#183; Leverage Ratio &#8211; Supplemental. For the largest internationally active supervised financial institutions, not including FHN or the Bank, a minimum supplementary Leverage ratio must be maintained that takes into account certain off-balance sheet exposures. &#160;

The revised standards took effect starting January 1, 2015 for FHN and the Bank. FHN believes that both FHN and the Bank were in compliance with applicable minimum capital requirements as of December 31, 2015.

&#160;

The Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC, and the OCC incorporated market and interest-rate risk components into their risk-based capital standards. Those standards explicitly identify concentration of credit risk and certain risks arising from non-traditional activities, and the management of such risks, as important qualitative factors to consider in assessing an institution&#8217;s overall capital adequacy.

&#160;

U.S. regulators&#8217; market risk rules are applicable to covered institutions &#8212; those with aggregate trading assets and trading liabilities of at least 10% of their total assets or at least $1 billion. FHN and the Bank are covered institutions under the rule. The rules specify the methodology for calculating the amount of risk-weighted assets related to trading assets and include, among other things, the addition of a component for stressed value at risk. The rule eliminates the use of credit ratings in calculating specific risk capital requirements for certain debt and securitization positions. Alternative standards of creditworthiness are used for specific standardized risks, such as exposures to sovereign debt, public sector entities, other banking institutions, corporate debt, and securitizations. In addition, an 8% capital surcharge applies to certain covered institutions, not including FHN or the Bank.

&#160;

Moreover, the Federal Reserve has indicated that it considers a &#8220;Tangible Tier 1 Capital Leverage Ratio&#8221; (deducting all intangibles) and other indicia of capital strength in evaluating proposals for expansion or new activities.

&#160;

Failure to meet capital guidelines could subject a bank to a variety of enforcement remedies, including the termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC, and to certain restrictions on its business and in certain circumstances to the appointment of a conservator or receiver. See &#8220;Prompt Corrective Action (PCA)&#8221; beginning on page 8 of this report for additional information.

&#160;

Capital Stress Tests &#160;

During 2009, following the financial crisis of 2007-08, the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the Federal

Reserve Board, the FDIC, and the OCC initiated a capital assessment program. Under the program, the capital needs of selected major U.S. banking institutions were evaluated for resilience under economic stress. U.S. regulators also adopted enhanced new stress test rules pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Reform Act discussed below. Under these requirements covered institutions must conduct an annual stress test to determine whether capital is likely to be adequate to absorb losses which could stem from certain adverse economic scenarios provided by the regulators and must privately report the results to their primary regulator as well as publicly disclose certain of those results. FHN&#8217;s and the Bank&#8217;s initial stress tests occurred in 2014, in relation to fiscal 2013. The public disclosure requirement first applied to our tests reported in 2015, in relation to fiscal 2014.

&#160;

Capital Standards Applicable to Us before 2015 &#160;

Before 2015 the Federal Reserve Board&#8217;s risk-based capital standards required the following: the ratio of Total Capital to risk-weighted assets (including certain off-balance-sheet items, such as unfunded loan commitments) had to be at least 8%; and the ratio of Tier 1 Capital to risk-weighted assets had to be at least 4%. At least half of Total Capital had to consist of Tier 1 Capital. The remainder could consist of qualifying subordinated debt, certain types of mandatory convertible securities and perpetual debt, other preferred stock, and a limited amount of loan loss reserves.

&#160;

In addition, the Federal Reserve established minimum leverage ratio guidelines for bank holding companies. For bank holding companies that met certain specific criteria, including having the highest regulatory rating, the guidelines provided for a minimum Leverage ratio of 3%. All other bank holding companies generally were required to maintain a Leverage ratio of at least 3%, plus an additional cushion of 100 to 200 basis points. The guidelines also provided that bank holding companies experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions were expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels without significant reliance on intangible assets. The Bank was subject to risk-based and leverage capital requirements similar to those described above adopted by the OCC.

&#160;

Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) 

&#160;

Federal banking regulators must take &#8220;prompt corrective action&#8221; in respect of FDIC-insured depository institutions that do not meet minimum

capital requirements. For this purpose insured depository institutions are divided into five capital categories: &#8220;well capitalized,&#8221; &#8220;adequately capitalized,&#8221; &#8220;undercapitalized,&#8221; &#8220;significantly undercapitalized&#8221; and &#8220;critically undercapitalized.&#8221; The specific requirements applicable to us

currently, starting in 2015, are summarized in the table below. An institution may be deemed to be in a capitalization category that is lower than is indicated by its actual capital position if it receives an unsatisfactory examination rating.

&#160;

Summary of Current Requirements for PCA Capitalization Categories 

&#160;

Well capitalized &#160; &#183; Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio of at least 6.5% &#160; &#160; &#183; Tier 1 Capital ratio of at least 8% &#160; &#160; &#183; Total Capital ratio of at least 10% &#160; &#160; &#183; Leverage ratio of at least 5% &#160; &#160; &#183; Not subject to a directive, order, or written agreement to meet and maintain specific capital levels Adequately capitalized &#160; &#183; Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio of at least 4.5% &#160; &#160; &#183; Tier 1 Capital ratio of at least 6% &#160; &#160; &#183; Total Capital ratio of at least 8% &#160; &#160; &#183; Leverage ratio of at least 4% &#160; &#160; &#183; Not subject to a directive, order, or written agreement to meet and maintain specific capital levels Undercapitalized &#160; Failure to maintain any requirement to be adequately capitalized Significantly Undercapitalized &#160; Failure to maintain Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio of at least 3%, Tier 1 Capital ratio of at least 4%, Total Capital ratio of at least 6%, or a Leverage ratio of at least 3% Critically Undercapitalized &#160; Failure to maintain a level of tangible equity equal to at least 2% of total assets &#160;

At December 31, 2015, the Bank had sufficient capital to qualify as &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; under the regulatory capital requirements discussed above.

&#160;

An FDIC-insured depository institution generally is prohibited from making any capital distribution (including payment of dividends) or paying any management fee to its holding company if the depository institution thereafter would be undercapitalized. Undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to restrictions on borrowing from the Federal Reserve System. In addition, undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to growth limitations and are required to submit capital restoration plans. An insured depository institution&#8217;s holding company must guarantee the capital plan, up to an amount equal to the lesser of 5% of the depository institution&#8217;s assets at the time it becomes undercapitalized or the amount of the capital deficiency when the institution fails to comply with the plan, for the plan to be accepted by the applicable federal regulatory authority. The federal banking agencies may not accept a capital plan without determining, among

other things, that the plan is based on realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring the depository institution&#8217;s capital. If a depository institution fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is significantly undercapitalized.

&#160;

Significantly undercapitalized depository institutions may be subject to a number of requirements and restrictions, including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized, requirements to reduce total assets and cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks. Critically undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to appointment of a receiver or conservator, generally within 90 days of the date on which they become critically undercapitalized.

&#160;

As noted under the caption &#8220;Capital Adequacy&#8221; beginning on page 7 of this report, significant changes to those requirements became effective for us starting in 2015. Many of the capitalization categories discussed above were impacted. The table below summarizes the prompt corrective action categories in effect for us prior to 2015.

Summary of Pre-2015 Requirements for PCA Capitalization Categories 

&#160;

Well capitalized &#160; &#183; Tier 1 Capital ratio of at least 6% &#160; &#160; &#183; Total Capital ratio of at least 10% &#160; &#160; &#183; Leverage ratio of at least 5% &#160; &#160; &#183; Not subject to a directive, order, or written agreement to meet and maintain specific capital levels Adequately capitalized &#160; &#183; Tier 1 Capital ratio of at least 4% &#160; &#160; &#183; Total Capital ratio of at least 8% &#160; &#160; &#183; Leverage ratio of at least 4% &#160; &#160; &#183; Not subject to a directive, order, or written agreement to meet and maintain specific capital levels Undercapitalized &#160; Failure to maintain any requirement to be adequately capitalized Significantly Undercapitalized &#160; Failure to maintain Tier 1 Capital ratio of at least 3%, Total Capital ratio of at least 6%, or a Leverage ratio of at least 3% Critically Undercapitalized &#160; Failure to maintain a level of tangible equity equal to at least 2% of total assets &#160;

Holding Company Structure and Support of Subsidiary Banks 

&#160;

Because FHN is a holding company, its right to participate in the assets of any subsidiary upon the latter&#8217;s liquidation or reorganization will be subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary&#8217;s creditors (including depositors in the case of the Bank) except to the extent that FHN may itself be a creditor with recognized claims against the subsidiary. In addition, depositors of a bank, and the FDIC as their subrogee, would be entitled to priority over the creditors in the event of liquidation of a bank subsidiary.

&#160;

Under Federal Reserve policy FHN is expected to act as a source of financial strength to, and to commit resources to support, the Bank. This support may be required at times even though, absent such Federal Reserve policy, FHN might not wish to provide it. In addition, any capital loans by a bank holding company to any of its subsidiary banks are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary bank. In the event of a bank holding company&#8217;s bankruptcy, any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment.

&#160;

Cross-Guarantee Liability 

&#160;

A depository institution insured by the FDIC can be held liable for any loss incurred by, or reasonably expected to be incurred by, the FDIC in connection with (i) the default of a commonly controlled FDIC-insured depository institution or (ii) any assistance provided by the FDIC to any commonly controlled FDIC-insured depository institution &#8220;in danger of

default.&#8221; &#8220;Default&#8221; is defined generally as the appointment of a conservator or receiver and &#8220;in danger of default&#8221; is defined generally as the existence of certain conditions indicating that a default is likely to occur in the absence of regulatory assistance. The FDIC&#8217;s claim for damages is superior to claims of shareholders of the insured depository institution or its holding company but is subordinate to claims of depositors, secured creditors and holders of subordinated debt (other than affiliates) of the commonly controlled insured depository institution.

&#160;

Currently the Bank is the only depository institution owned by FHN. In the event that FHN operated another depository institution, any loss suffered by the FDIC in respect of one subsidiary bank would likely result in assertion of the cross-guarantee provisions, the assessment of such estimated losses against FHN&#8217;s other subsidiary bank(s), and a potential loss of FHN&#8217;s investment in such subsidiary bank.

&#160;

Interstate Banking and Branching 

&#160;

Federal law allows a national bank to establish and operate a de novo branch in a state other than the bank&#8217;s home state if the law of the state where the branch is to be located would permit establishment of the branch if the bank were chartered by that state, subject to standard regulatory review and approval requirements. Federal law also allows a national bank to acquire an existing branch in a state in which the bank is not headquartered and does not maintain a branch if the OCC approves the branch or acquisition, and if the law of the state in which the branch is located or to be located would permit the establishment of the branch if the bank were chartered by that state.

Additionally, the Dodd-Frank Reform Act created a number of regulatory requirements for interstate merger and acquisition activity, including the following: the acquiring bank must be well-capitalized and well-managed; concentration limits on liabilities and deposits may not be exceeded; and regulators must assess the transaction for incremental systemic risk.

&#160;

Once a bank has established branches in a state through an interstate merger transaction or through de novo branching, the bank may then establish and acquire additional branches within that state to the same extent that a state chartered bank is allowed to establish or acquire branches within the state. 

&#160;

Financial Activities other than Banking 

&#160;

The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (&#8220;GLB Act&#8221;) repealed or modified a number of significant provisions of then-current laws, including the Glass-Steagall Act and the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, which imposed restrictions on banking organizations&#8217; ability to engage in certain types of activities. The GLB Act generally allows bank holding companies such as FHN broad authority to engage in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to a financial activity. These include: insurance underwriting and brokerage; merchant banking; securities underwriting, dealing, and market-making; real estate development; and such additional activities as the Federal Reserve in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury determines to be financial in nature or incidental. A bank holding company may engage in these activities directly or through subsidiaries by qualifying as a &#8220;financial holding company.&#8221; To qualify, a bank holding company must file an initial declaration with the Federal Reserve, certifying that all of its subsidiary depository institutions are well-managed and well-capitalized. The GLB Act also permits national banks such as the Bank to engage in certain of these activities through financial subsidiaries. To control or hold an interest in a financial subsidiary, a national bank must meet the following requirements:

&#160;

(1) The bank must receive approval from the OCC for the financial subsidiary to engage in the activities. &#160; &#160; (2) The bank and its depository institution affiliates must each be well-capitalized and well-managed. &#160; &#160; (3) The aggregate consolidated total assets of all of the bank&#8217;s financial subsidiaries must not exceed the lesser of: 45% of the bank&#8217;s consolidated total assets; or $50 billion (subject to indexing for inflation). &#160; &#160; (4) The bank must have in place adequate policies and procedures to identify and manage financial and operational risks and to preserve the separate identities and limited liability of the bank and the financial subsidiary. 

(5) If the financial subsidiary will engage in principal transactions and the bank is one of the one hundred largest banks, the bank must have outstanding at least one issue of unsecured long-term debt that meets creditworthiness standards adopted by the Federal Reserve and the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury from time to time. If this fifth requirement ceases to be met after a bank controls or holds an interest in a financial subsidiary, the bank cannot invest additional capital in that subsidiary until the requirement again is met. &#160;

No new financial activity may be commenced under the GLB Act unless the national bank and all of its depository institution affiliates have at least &#8220;satisfactory&#8221; Community Reinvestment Act ratings. Certain restrictions apply if the bank holding company or the national bank fails to continue to meet one or more of the requirements listed above.

&#160;

In addition, the GLB Act contains a number of other provisions that may affect the Bank&#8217;s operations, including limitations on the use and disclosure to third parties of customer information. At December 31, 2015, FHN is a financial holding company and the Bank has a number of financial subsidiaries, as discussed in &#8220;Other General Information&#8221; beginning on page 4 of this report.

&#160;

Dodd-Frank Reform Act 

&#160;

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the &#8220;Dodd-Frank Reform Act,&#8221; the &#8220;Reform Act,&#8221; or &#8220;Dodd-Frank&#8221;) made a substantial number of significant changes to how financial services companies are regulated. Implementation of some changes called for by the Dodd-Frank are not yet complete.

&#160;

Many provisions or topics of the Dodd-Frank Reform Act and the regulatory initiatives under it in part are discussed elsewhere in this &#8220;Supervision and Regulation&#8221; section.

&#160;

A key provision for us which is not discussed elsewhere is Dodd-Frank&#8217;s so-called Durbin Amendment. Durbin regulations have severely capped the interchange fees which banks charge merchants for debit card transactions, starting in late 2011.

&#160;

Volcker Rule 

&#160;

In 2013 and 2014 banking regulators adopted a rule under Dodd-Frank&#8217;s so-called Volcker Amendment. The principal purpose of the Volcker rule is to generally prohibit banking entities from engaging in

proprietary trading, which is engaging as principal in any purchase or sale of one or more of certain types of financial instruments. The Volcker rule compels a bank to sell prohibited instruments by 2017. The Volcker rule, as FHN currently understands its terms, is not expected to have a material financial impact on FHN in 2016.

&#160;

Consumer Regulation by the CFPB 

&#160;

The CFPB has adopted significant rules affecting consumer lending and consumer financial services. Key rules for the Bank include detailed regulation of mortgage servicing practices and detailed regulation of mortgage origination and underwriting practices. The latter rules, among other things, establish the definition of a &#8220;qualified mortgage&#8221; using traditional underwriting practices involving down payments, credit history, income levels and verification, and so forth. The rules do not prohibit, but do tend to discourage, lenders from originating non-qualified mortgages. The CFPB also has been active bringing enforcement actions related to consumer financial protection laws, in many cases obtaining significant settlement outcomes. Enforcement theories advanced by the CFPB sometimes have gone beyond the industry&#8217;s interpretation of the applicable regulations; that practice generally increases our compliance risk.

&#160;

FDIC Insurance Assessments; DIFA 

&#160;

U.S. bank deposits generally are insured by the Deposit Insurance Fund (&#8220;DIF&#8221;). The system of FDIC insurance premium rates charged consists of a rate grid structure in which base rates range from 5 to 35 basis points annually, and fully adjusted rates range from 2.5 to 45 basis points annually. Key factors in the grid include: the institution&#8217;s risk category (I to IV); whether the institution is deemed large and highly complex; whether the institution qualifies for an unsecured debt adjustment; and whether the institution is burdened with a brokered deposit adjustment. Other factors can impact the base against which the applicable rate is applied. A basis point is equal to 0.01%.

&#160;

Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order, or condition imposed by a federal bank regulatory agency.

Depositor Preference 

&#160;

Federal law provides that deposits and certain claims for administrative expenses and employee compensation against an insured depository institution would be afforded a priority over other general unsecured claims against such an institution, including federal funds and letters of credit, in the &#8220;liquidation or other resolution&#8221; of such an institution by any receiver.

&#160;

Securities Regulation 

&#160;

Certain of our subsidiaries are subject to various securities laws and regulations and capital adequacy requirements promulgated by the regulatory and exchange authorities of the jurisdictions in which they operate.

&#160;

Our registered broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to the SEC&#8217;s net capital rule, Rule 15c3-1. That rule requires the maintenance of minimum net capital and limits the ability of the broker-dealer to transfer large amounts of capital to a parent company or affiliate. Compliance with the rule could limit operations that require intensive use of capital, such as underwriting and trading.

&#160;

Certain of our subsidiaries are registered investment advisers which are regulated under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. Advisory contracts with clients automatically terminate under these laws upon an assignment of the contract by the investment adviser unless appropriate consents are obtained.

&#160;

Insurance Activities 

&#160;

Certain subsidiaries sell various types of insurance as agent in a number of states. Insurance activities are subject to regulation by the states in which such business is transacted. Although most of such regulation focuses on insurance companies and their insurance products, insurance agents and their activities are also subject to regulation by the states, including, among other things, licensing and marketing and sales practices.

&#160;

Compensation and Risk Management 

&#160;

The Federal Reserve, OCC, and other agencies have issued guidance intended to ensure that incentive compensation arrangements at financial organizations take into account risk and are consistent with safe and sound practices. The guidance is based on three &#8220;key principles&#8221; calling for incentive compensation plans to: appropriately balance risks and rewards; be compatible with effective controls and risk management; and be

backed up by strong corporate governance. In response we operate an enhanced risk management process for assessing risk in incentive compensation plans. Among other things, in recent years we have moved several

key incentive programs away from a revenues approach in favor of a net profit approach, and adopted mandatory deferral features for other key programs.

&#160;

Effect of Governmental Policies 

&#160;

The Bank is affected by the policies of regulatory authorities, including the Federal Reserve, the OCC, and the CFPB. An important function of the Federal Reserve is to regulate the national money supply.

&#160;

Among the instruments of monetary policy used by the Federal Reserve are: purchases and sales of U.S. government and other securities in the marketplace; changes in the discount rate, which is the rate any depository institution must pay to borrow from the Federal Reserve; changes in the reserve requirements of depository institutions; and, indirectly, changes in the federal funds rate, which is the rate at which depository institutions lend balances to each other overnight. These

instruments are intended to influence economic and monetary growth, interest rate levels, and inflation.

&#160;

The monetary policies of the Federal Reserve and other governmental policies have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future. Because of changing conditions in the national and international economy and in the money markets, as well as the result of actions by monetary and fiscal authorities, it is not possible to predict with certainty future changes in interest rates, deposit levels, loan demand, or the business and results of operations of FHN and the Bank, or whether changing economic conditions will have a positive or negative effect on operations and earnings.

&#160;

Other Proposals 

&#160;

Bills occasionally are introduced in the United States Congress and the Tennessee General Assembly and other state legislatures, and regulations occasionally are proposed by our regulatory agencies, any of which could affect our businesses, financial results, and

financial condition. Generally it cannot be predicted whether or in what form any particular proposals will be adopted or the extent to which we may be affected.

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

In all aspects of the businesses in which we engage we face substantial competition from banks doing business in our markets as well as from savings and loan associations, credit unions, other financial institutions, consumer finance companies, trust companies, investment counseling firms, money market and other mutual funds, insurance companies and agencies, securities firms, mortgage banking companies, hedge funds, and other firms offering financial products or services.

&#160;

Our regional banking business primarily competes in several areas within the southeast U.S.: (i) the major metro regions associated with Tennessee (west Tennessee around Memphis; middle Tennessee around Nashville; and east Tennessee around Knoxville, Chattanooga, and the tri-cities area of Johnson City, Bristol, and Kingsport) as well as a number of smaller markets throughout Tennessee; (ii) several selected mid-size markets in Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Florida, along with Houston, Texas; and (iii) several smaller communities in Tennessee.

Our &#8220;Mid-Atlantic&#8221; business mentioned in (ii) has a commercial banking and wealth management focus but in 2015, with the acquisition of TrustAtlantic based in Raleigh, we obtained a significant traditional retail presence as well.

&#160;

Our regional banking business overall serves both retail and commercial customers. Key traditional competitors in our Tennessee-oriented markets include Regions Bank, SunTrust Bank, Wells Fargo Bank N.A., Bank of America N.A., and Pinnacle National Bank, among many others including many community banks and credit unions. An additional key competitor in the Mid-Atlantic markets is Branch Banking and Trust Company (BB&#38;T).

&#160;

Our fixed income business serves institutional customers broadly segregated into depositories (including banks, thrifts and credit unions) and non-depositories (including money managers, insurance companies, public funds, pension funds, and hedge

funds). Both customer segments are widely dispersed geographically, and we have many competitors within both segments including major U.S. and international securities firms as well as numerous regional and local firms.

&#160;

In recent years certain financial companies or their affiliates that traditionally were not banks have been able to compete more directly with the Bank for deposits and other traditional banking services and products. Increased fluidity within the industry is likely to continue. Non-traditional companies competing with us include investment banks, brokerage firms, insurance company affiliates, peer-to-peer lending arrangers, non-bank deposit acceptors, companies offering payment facilitation services (such as PayPal and pre-paid debit card issuers), and extremely short-term consumer loan companies.

&#160;

A number of recent technologies have worked with the existing financial system and traditional banks, such as the evolution of ATM cards into debit/credit cards and the evolution of debit/credit cards into smart phones. These sorts of technologies often have expanded the market for banking services overall while siphoning a portion of the revenues from those 

services away from banks and disrupting prior methods of delivering those services. Companies, including both long-established firms (such as Vanguard) and new ones (such as FutureAdvisor), which offer heuristic or highly-interactive systems and applications are beginning to compete much more directly with traditional financial services companies in areas involving personal advice, including high-margin services such as financial planning and wealth management. The low-cost, high-speed nature of these &#8220;robo-advisor&#8221; services can be especially attractive to younger, less-affluent customers and potential customers.

&#160;

For additional information on the competitive position of FHN and the Bank, refer to the &#8220;General&#8221; subsection above of this Item 1. Also, refer to the subsections entitled &#8220;Supervision and Regulation&#8221; and &#8220;Effect of Governmental Policies,&#8221; both of which are relevant to an analysis of our competitors. Due to the intense competition in the financial services industry we can make no representation that our competitive position has or will remain constant, nor can we predict how it may change in the future.
