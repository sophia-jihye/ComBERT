DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS 

&#160; 

Overview 

&#160; 

Infinity Energy Resources, Inc. is an independent energy company that is pursuing an oil and gas exploration opportunity offshore of Nicaragua in the Caribbean Sea. On March 5, 2009, the Nicaraguan government granted us the Concessions to explore approximately1.4 million acres offshore Nicaragua. Since such point we have focused our efforts solely on these Concessions. Previously we were engaged in the acquisition, exploration and development of natural gas and oil properties in the United States. We ceased all domestic oil and gas exploration and production in the United States by December 2009. 

&#160; 

Nicaragua 

&#160; 

We began pursuing an oil and gas exploration opportunity offshore Nicaragua in the Caribbean Sea in 1999. Since such time, we built relationships with the Instituto Nicaraguense de Energia (&#8220;INE&#8221;) and undertook the geological and geophysical research that helped us to become one of only six companies qualified to bid on offshore blocks in the first international bidding round held by INE in January 2003. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

On March 5, 2009, we signed the contracts granting us the Perlas and Tyra concession blocks offshore Nicaragua (the &#8220;Nicaraguan Concessions&#8221; or &#8220;Concessions&#8221;). Since our acquisition of the Nicaraguan Concessions, we have conducted an environmental study and developed geological information from the reprocessing and additional evaluation of existing 2-D seismic data acquired over our Perlas and Tyra concession blocks. In April 2013 the Nicaraguan government formally approved our Environmental Impact Assessment, at which time we commenced significant activity under the initial work plan involving the acquisition of new seismic data on the two Nicaraguan Concessions. We undertook seismic shoots during late 2013 that resulted in the acquisition of new 2-D and 3-D seismic data and have reviewed it in order to select our initial drilling sites for exploratory wells. 

&#160; 

Business Strategy 

&#160; 

Our principal objective is to create stockholder value through the development of our Nicaraguan Concessions. We have commenced significant activity under the initial work plan and received formal governmental approval of the environmental study in 2013. We have used previously existing reprocessed 2-D seismic data to identify or evaluate the prospects. We had additional 2-D and 3-D seismic mapping done on the Concessions to provide additional data. We are reviewing the data in order to evaluate the potential oil and gas producing structures and select our initial drilling sites for exploratory wells, given sufficient capital and necessary Nicaraguan government approvals. 

&#160; 

We intend to finance our business strategy through external financing, which may include debt and equity capital raised in public and private offerings, joint ventures, sale of working or other interests, employment of working capital and cash flow from operations, if any. To this end we completed the May 2015 Senior Convertible Note Private Placement described below. We plan to seek joint venture or working interest partners prior to the commencement of any exploratory drilling operations on the Nicaraguan Concessions. In this connection, we may seek offers from other industry operators for interests in the acreage in exchange for cash and a carried interest in exploration and development operations or other strategic partnership. 

&#160; 

Recent Developments 

&#160; 

Senior Convertible Note and Warrant Private Placement 

&#160; 

On May 7, 2015 we completed the private placement with an institutional investor of a $12.0 million principal amount Senior Convertible Note (the &#8220;Convertible Note&#8221;) and a Warrant (the &#8220;Warrant&#8221;) exercisable to purchase 1,800,000 shares of our common stock. The Convertible Note ranks senior to our existing and future indebtedness and is secured by all of our assets, excluding the Nicaraguan Concessions. At the closing, such investor acquired the Convertible Note by paying $450,000 in cash and issuing a secured promissory note, secured by cash, with an aggregate initial principal amount of $9,550,000 (the &#8220;Investor Note&#8221;). Assuming all amounts payable to us under the Investor Note are paid without any offset or default, the May 2015 Private Placement will result in gross proceeds of $10.0 million before Placement Agent fees and other expenses associated with the transaction, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. We used the initial proceeds from the closing to retire certain outstanding obligations, including delinquent 2015 area and training fees of approximately $155,000 owed to the Nicaraguan government relating to our Nicaragua Concessions, and to provide additional working capital. We will receive the remaining cash proceeds upon each voluntary or mandatory prepayment of the Investor Note. 

&#160; 

Granada Development 

&#160; 

On October 13, 2014 we entered into a Letter of Intent (&#8220;LOI&#8221;) with Granada Exploration, LLC (&#8220;Granada Exploration&#8221;), which has agreed to join with us to explore for potential hydrocarbons on the Concessions. Under the terms of the LOI, Granada Exploration will provide its services in exchange for a working interest in the Nicaraguan Concessions. The scope of such services will be more specifically described in a mutually acceptable Exploration Services Agreement (&#8220;ESA&#8221;), which we are currently negotiating with Granada. The ESA is anticipated to provide that Granada Exploration will earn an assignment from us of an undivided 30% working interest in the Concessions, based on an 80% net revenue interest. We plan to enter into a Joint Operating Agreement with Granada Exploration under which Granada Exploration may, at its discretion, participate in an initial exploratory well for up to an additional undivided 20% working interest, on a prospect-by-prospect basis, with such additional interest to be based on an 80% net revenue interest. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

The LOI is subject to Granada Exploration&#8217;s due diligence, including the evaluation of our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220;SEC&#8221;), Concession and other documents showing that we are is in good standing with the Nicaraguan government, negotiation and approval of mutually acceptable formal agreements, and final approval by a majority of the partners of Granada Exploration. Progress has been delayed due to the current environment affecting oil and gas exploration projects and uncertainties involving the status of the Nicaraguan concessions. 

&#160; 

Exploration and Development - Nicaraguan Concessions 

&#160; 

Preliminary analyses and interpretation of available 2-D seismic data by independent consultants has revealed that the Nica-Tinkham Ridge, the single most important structure in the basin, traverses both of the blocks (Tyra and Perlas) in the Concessions and controlled the deposition of Eocene and possibly younger reef systems. Such preliminary analyses have identified four prospects covering a total of over 547 square miles. Our consultants, Brazilian-based Consultoria em Geologia Geof&#237;sica e Inform&#225;tica do Petr&#243;leo LTDA (&#8220;CGGIP&#8221;) and its senior geological consultant, Luciano Seixas Chagas, working in concert with Thompson &#38; Knight Global Energy Services LLC, are building a credible model suggesting that the Eocene geologic zone alone has a potential that hydrocarbons could be present, based upon certain assumptions involving porosity, saturation, recovery and other parameters. This model is also subject to the complex geology of the region and the fact that the reef system has never been drilled. The model is based upon preliminary conclusions and is subject to further analysis of our more recent 2-D and 3-D seismic data and interpretation, and various assumptions that cannot be confirmed or disproved until the prospects are drilled. We believe the model supports our long-held belief that the Nicaraguan Concessions have the potential for oil discoveries, although we can offer no assurances in this regard. 

&#160; 

In April 2011, we filed with the Nicaraguan government an Environmental Impact Assessment (&#8220;EIA&#8221;) covering proposed seismic activities on our Nicaraguan Concessions. The filing of the EIA was followed by a comment period during which there was interaction between us the Ministerio del Ambiente y los Recursos Naturales de Nicaragua, an agency of the Nicaraguan government; and the autonomous regions of Nicaragua that are nearest to the Nicaraguan Concessions. In April 2013 the EIA was formally approved by the Nicaraguan government and we were cleared to commence 2-D and 3-D seismic mapping activities in the area. In late 2013 and early 2014 CGG Services (US) Inc. &#8211; NASA, a fully integrated Geoscience company that provides geological, geophysical and reservoir services to the global oil and gas industry, conducted 2-D and 3-D seismic data covering selected areas within the boundaries of the Nicaraguan Concessions. In March 2014 we opened a seismic data room at CGG&#8217;s Houston headquarters in order for potential strategic and/or financial partners to view the fully processed results of the seismic survey activities conducted by CGG. 

&#160; 

The final approval of the EIA by the Nicaraguan government of our environment impact study on April 13, 2013, began Sub-Period 2 for both the Tyra and Perlas Blocks as defined in the Nicaraguan Concessions. The Company believes it has satisfied the acquisition, processing and interpretation of Seismic data required in Sub-Period 2 for both the Perlas and Tyra Blocks. Therefore, it is now in Sub-Period 3 of the exploration phase of the 30-year Concession for both Perlas and Tyra as of June 30, 2015. Sub-Period 3 of the Nicaraguan Concessions requires the drilling of at least one exploratory well on the Perlas Block during 2016 and the shooting of additional seismic on the Tyra Block. The Company is in process of identifying at least one potential drilling site on the Perlas block as required in Sub-Period 3 and will have to perform supplemental EIA work prior to requesting and receiving the permit to drill from the Nicaraguan government. The work plan on the Tyra block for Sub-Period 3 requires the Company to shoot additional seismic which is estimated to cost approximately $2,500,000 prior to the commencement of exploratory drilling. The Company is negotiating with the Nicaraguan government to seek a waiver of the additional seismic mapping on the Tyra Block so that it can proceed with exploratory drilling. There can be no assurance whether it will be able to obtain such waiver of the requirement. 

&#160; 

During late December 2013, we completed the 2-D seismic survey activities in the area as required under both of the Nicaraguan Concessions at that point. We believe that the newly acquired 2-D seismic data, together with the previously acquired reprocessed 2-D seismic, has helped us to further evaluate the structures that were previously identified with 2-D seismic in the Eocene Zone. Our geological consultants have estimated that these Eocene structures may contain recoverable hydrocarbons (principally oil) in place. In addition, the new 2-D seismic acquired in 2013 provided our first geological information regarding the potential for oil resources in the Cretaceous Zone, which we could not evaluate using less precise older 2-D seismic mapping. We have identified multiple promising sites on the Perlas Block for exploratory drilling and is planning the drilling of initial exploratory wells in order to determine the existence of commercial hydrocarbon reserves. We believe that we have performed all work necessary as of June 30, 2015 to proceed to Sub-Period 3 for the Perlas Block as defined in the Nicaraguan Concessions, which requires the drilling of at least one exploratory well on the Perlas concession within the following one-year period. We must first prepare and submit a supplemental EIA to the Nicaraguan government before the drilling permit can be issued on the Perlas Block. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

The Nicaraguan Government has yet to receive the EIA supplement and issue the drilling permit; however, assuming that it does accept the supplemental EIA and grant the drilling permit. We will be required to drill at least one exploratory well on the Perlas Block within one-year (estimated to be prior to May 2016) or risk being in default and losing its rights under the Nicaraguan Concessions. Management intends to seek an extension of this deadline from the Nicaraguan government given the current environment for oil and gas exploration projects, although no assurance can be given in this regard. 

&#160; 

We are is in technical default of the Nicaraguan Concession because we have not provided the required letters of credit to the Nicaraguan Government. In accordance with the Nicaraguan Concession agreements, we had previously provided the Ministry of Energy with the required letters of credit in the amounts of $443,100 for Perlas (expired March 2014) and $408,450 for Tyra (expired September 2014). We had also made all required expenditures related to the Nicaraguan Concessions for training programs and as &#8220;area fees,&#8221; for each respective year for 2010 through 2015. We are currently negotiating the renewal and increase of the required letters of credit which total $1,356,227 for the Perlas block and $278,450 for the Tyra block with the Nicaraguan Government and our lenders; however, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in the regard. We believe that we are in full compliance with the terms of the Nicaraguan Concessions agreements, except for the renewal of the expired letters of credit, however there are other deadlines that are approaching in 2016 involving the drilling of exploratory wells that management believes it will be unable to meet. 

&#160; 

We must raise substantial amounts of debt and equity capital in the immediate future in order to fund: (1) the required letters of credit to the Nicaraguan Government; (2) the drilling of at least one exploratory well on the Perlas Block of the Nicaraguan Concessions during 2016; (3) the shooting of additional seismic on the Tyra Block of the Nicaraguan Concessions if we are unable to negotiate a waiver of such requirement from the Nicaraguan government; (4) the payment of normal day-to-day operations and corporate overhead; and (5) payment of outstanding debt and financial obligations as they become due. These are substantial operational and financial issues that must be successfully mitigated during 2015 or our ability to satisfy the conditions necessary to maintain our Nicaragua Concessions will be in significant doubt. We completed the May 2015 Private Placement in May 2015 in an effort to obtain the required capital. 

&#160; 

We are also seeking offers from industry operators and other third parties for interests in the acreage in the Nicaraguan Concessions in exchange for cash and a carried interest in exploration and development operations or other joint venture arrangement. Accordingly, we intend to finance our business strategy through external financing, which may include debt and equity capital raised in public and private offerings, joint ventures, sale of working or other interests, employment of working capital and cash flow from operations, if any, and net proceeds from the sales of assets. 

&#160; 

Costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2015 in connection with the Company&#8217;s oil and gas acquisition, exploration and development activities are shown below. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#160; Year ended December 31, 2015 &#160; Property acquisition costs: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Proved &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; Unproved &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Total property acquisition costs &#160; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Development costs &#160; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Exploration costs &#160; &#160; 92,568 &#160; Total costs &#160; $ 92,568 &#160; &#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Exploration costs during the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily related to Concession fees paid to the Nicaraguan Government for 2015 and the supplement to the environmental impact study in preparation for the drilling of exploratory wells. 

&#160; 

Aggregate capitalized costs relating to the Company&#8217;s oil and gas producing activities, and related accumulated depreciation, depletion, impairment and amortization are as follows: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#160; December 31, &#160; &#160; &#160; 2015 &#160; &#160; 2014 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Proved oil and gas properties &#160; $ - &#160; &#160; $ - &#160; Unproved oil and gas properties &#160; &#160; 10,685,404 &#160; &#160; &#160; 10,592,836 &#160; Total &#160; &#160; 10,685,404 &#160; &#160; &#160; 10,592,836 &#160; Less amounts allocated to revenue sharing interest granted to note holder for extension of maturity date &#160; &#160; (964,738 ) &#160; &#160; (964,738 ) Less accumulated impairment charge on oil and gas properties &#160; &#160; (9,720,666 ) &#160; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Less accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization &#160; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Net capitalized costs &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; &#160; $ 9,628,098 &#160; &#160; 

Management has performed its impairment tests on its oil and gas properties as of December 31, 2015 and has concluded that a full impairment reserve should be provided on the costs capitalized for its unproved oil and gas properties consisting solely of the Nicaraguan Concessions. Therefore, an impairment charge of $9,720,666 has been recorder, including operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015, which reduces the carrying amount of oil and gas properties to zero as of December 31, 2015. The current environment for oil and gas development projects, especially discoveries in otherwise undeveloped regions of the world, is very challenging given the depressed commodity prices for oil and gas products and the resulting industry-wide reduction in capital expenditure budgets for exploration and development projects. This may provide substantial impediments for us and our ability to obtain adequate financing to fund the exploration and development of our Nicaraguan Concessions and the overall economic viability of such Concessions if we discover hydrocarbons in commercial quantities. 

&#160; 

The following charts set forth the minimum work programs required under for the Perlas and Tyra blocks comprising our Concessions in order for us to retain the Concessions.

Until April 13, 2014 when we received our initial environmental approval from the Nicaraguan government, we were in the environmental phase of Sub-Period 1 for both Perlas and Tyra and the operational phase of Sub-Period 1 was suspended for both Concessions. Upon issuance of the environmental permit, the suspension was lifted and the operational phase for each Concession commenced. Thus, we have until July 11, 2016 and April 11, 2016 to meet the requirements of Sub-Period 3 for the Tyra and Perlas Concessions, respectively. Additionally, we have until July 11, 2018 and April 11, 2018 to comply with the requirements of Sub-Period 4 of the Tyra and Perlas Concessions, respectively. We are attempting to negotiate extensions of the time to meet the requirements of Sub-Period 3 with the Nicaraguan government including the required drilling of exploratory wells. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in negotiating such extensions and if we are unsuccessful, then we would be in default of and risk termination of the Nicaraguan Concessions. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

We compete in virtually all facets of our businesses with numerous other companies in the oil and gas industry, including many that have significantly greater financial and other resources. Such competitors will be able to pay more for desirable oil and gas leases and to evaluate, bid for, and purchase a greater number of properties than our financial or personnel resources permit. 

&#160; 

Our business strategy includes highly competitive oil and natural gas exploration, development and production. We face intense competition from a large number of independent exploration and development companies as well as major oil and gas companies in a number of areas such as obtaining the capital necessary to pursue our Nicaraguan Concessions and seeking to acquire the services, equipment, labor and materials necessary to explore, operate and develop those properties. Most of our competitors have financial and technological resources substantially exceeding those available to us. We cannot be sure that we will be successful in developing and operating profitable the Concessions in the face of this competition. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Government Regulation of the Oil and Gas Industry 

&#160; 

General 

&#160; 

Our business is affected by numerous laws and regulations, including, among others, laws and regulations relating to energy, environment, conservation and tax. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and/or criminal penalties, the imposition of injunctive relief or both. Moreover, changes in any of these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business. In view of the many uncertainties with respect to current and future laws and regulations, including their applicability to Infinity, we cannot predict the overall effect of such laws and regulations on our future operations. 

&#160; 

If we commence operations in Nicaragua we will be subject to legal and regulatory oversight by its energy-related agencies, such as the Nicaraguan Energy Institute, with respect to its energy or hydrocarbons laws. In such case, from time to time, in varying degrees, political developments and federal and state laws and regulations affect our operations in Nicaragua. In particular, price controls, taxes and other laws relating to the crude oil and natural gas industry, changes in these laws and changes in administrative regulations have affected and in the future could affect crude oil and natural gas production, operations and economics. We cannot predict how Nicaraguan agencies or courts will interpret existing laws and regulations or the effect these adoptions and interpretations may have on our business or financial condition at that point. 

&#160; 

Our business will also be subject to laws and regulations promulgated by federal and local authorities, including the Ministry of Energy and Mines, relating to the exploration for, and the development, production and marketing of, crude oil and natural gas, as well as safety matters. Legal requirements may be frequently changed and subject to interpretation and we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance with these requirements or their effect on our future operations in Nicaragua. In such event, we may be required to make significant expenditures to comply with governmental laws and regulations. 

&#160; 

Further, future operations in Nicaragua will be subject to complex federal and local environmental laws and regulations. The discharge of natural gas, crude oil, or other pollutants into the air, soil or water may give rise to significant liabilities on our part to government agencies and third parties and may require us to incur substantial costs of remediation. In addition, in the future we may incur costs and penalties in addressing regulatory agency procedures involving instances of possible non-compliance. 

&#160; 

The following discussion contains summaries of certain laws and regulations and is qualified as mentioned above. 

&#160; 

Environmental and Land Use Regulation 

&#160; 

Various federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment affect our operations and costs. The areas affected include: 

&#160; 

&#9679; unit production expenses primarily related to the control and limitation of air emissions, spill prevention and the disposal of produced water; &#160; &#160; &#9679; capital costs to drill development wells resulting from expenses primarily related to the management and disposal of drilling fluids and other oil and natural gas exploration wastes; &#160; &#160; &#9679; capital costs to construct, maintain and upgrade equipment and facilities; &#160; &#160; &#9679; operational costs associated with ongoing compliance and monitoring activities; and &#160; &#160; &#9679; exit costs for operations that we are responsible for closing, including costs for dismantling and abandoning wells and remediating environmental impacts. &#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

The environmental and land use laws and regulations affecting oil and natural gas operations have been changed frequently in the past, and in general, these changes have imposed more stringent requirements that increase operating costs and/or require capital expenditures in order to remain in compliance. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in civil and/or criminal fines and liability for non-compliance, clean-up costs and other environmental damages. It is also possible that unanticipated developments or changes in law could cause us to make environmental expenditures significantly greater than those we currently expect. 

&#160; 

The following is a summary discussion of the framework of key environmental and land use regulations and requirements affecting oil and natural gas exploration, development, production and transportation operations. 

&#160; 

Operating Hazards and Insurance 

&#160; 

The oil and natural gas business involves a variety of operating risks. We were unable to maintain insurance against such potential risks and losses. 

&#160; 

In addition, pollution and environmental risks are not insured. If a significant accident or other event occurs not covered by insurance, it could adversely affect us. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

We have two employees, our CEO and CFO, whose salaries we have deferred. We also use outside contractors to perform services. 

&#160;
