 ITEM 1. Business 

Merger of Celladon Corporation and Eiger BioPharmaceuticals, Inc. 

On March 22, 2016, Celladon Corporation (&#147;Celladon&#148;) and privately-held Eiger BioPharmaceuticals, Inc. (&#147;Private Eiger&#148;) completed a business combination in accordance with the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization (the &#147;Merger Agreement&#148;), dated as of November 18, 2015, by and among Celladon, Celladon Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Celladon (&#147;Merger Sub&#148;) and Private Eiger, pursuant to which Merger Sub merged with and into Private Eiger, with Private Eiger surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Celladon. This transaction is referred to as &#147;the merger&#148; or &#147;the Merger.&#148; Immediately following the Merger, Celladon changed its name to &#147;Eiger BioPharmaceuticals, Inc.&#148; In connection with the closing of the Merger, our common stock began trading on The NASDAQ Global Market under the ticker symbol &#147;EIGR&#148; on March 23, 2016. 

Overview 

Prior to the Merger, Celladon was a biotechnology company historically focused on the development of cardiovascular gene therapy. As a consequence of the negative results from the Phase 2b clinical trial of its lead product candidate, MYDICAR &#174; (AAV1/SERCA2a), referred to as the CUPID 2 trial, Celladon suspended further research and development of MYDICAR and its pre-clinical programs in 2015. 

Eiger is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on bringing to market novel products for the treatment of orphan diseases. Since its founding in 2008, Eiger has worked with investigators at Leland Stanford Junior University, or Stanford, to identify novel targets across a diverse set of orphan diseases with high unmet medical need. Eiger evaluated a number of potential development candidates in pharmaceutical companies and through creative licensing, built a pipeline of well-characterized products to advance in targeted orphan diseases. Eiger&#146;s pipeline includes three Phase 2 candidates addressing four distinct orphan diseases. The programs have several aspects in common: the disease targets represent conditions of high medical need which are inadequately treated by current standard of care; the therapeutic approaches are supported by an understanding of disease biology and mechanism as elucidated by Eiger&#146;s academic research relationships; prior clinical experience with the product candidates guides an understanding of safety; and the development paths leverage the experience and capabilities of Eiger&#146;s experienced, commercially focused management team. The pipeline includes Sarasar &#174; (lonafarnib) for hepatitis delta virus, or HDV, exendin (9-39) for severe hypoglycemia and Bestatin&#153; (ubenimex) for pulmonary arterial hypertension, or PAH, and lymphedema. Eiger plans to deliver Phase 2 data on all four programs over the course of the next one to three years beginning in 2016. 

Eiger&#146;s current project timelines, planned development and regulatory pathways are illustrated below. As discussed above, prior clinical experience by Eiger&#146;s licensors with the product candidates has supported and guided Eiger&#146;s understanding of safety in advancing these products in its clinical development programs. Specifically, Eiger in-licensed lonafarnib from Merck Sharp &#38; Dohme Corp, or Merck, in 2010, and licensed ubenimex from Nippon Kayaku Co., Ltd., or Nippon Kayaku, in 2015. Eiger has relied upon Merck and Nippon Kayaku&#146;s prior Phase 1 clinical data, manufacturing and experience with these two molecules to file the Eiger INDs and proceed directly into Phase 2 clinical trials following authorization by the FDA.

&#160;

&#160;

Note: All dates represent Eiger&#146;s current expectations. Actual timing may vary. 

Eiger&#146;s product candidate pipeline includes four Phase 2 programs: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Lonafarnib is an orally bioavailable, small molecule in Phase 2 clinical trials for HDV infection and is Eiger&#146;s most advanced program. HDV is the most severe form of viral hepatitis for which there is currently no cure and no approved therapy. Chronic HDV infection can lead to a rapid progression to liver cirrhosis, a greater likelihood of developing liver cancer, and has the highest fatality rate of all the hepatitis infections. Eiger in-licensed lonafarnib from Merck in 2010. Lonafarnib blocks the production of HDV virus particles by inhibiting a key step, called prenylation, in the virus life cycle. To date, over 100 HDV infected patients have been dosed with lonafarnib across international Phase 2 clinical trials. Lonafarnib has demonstrated dose-related activity in reducing HDV viral load both as a monotherapy and in combination with other agents. Lonafarnib boosted with ritonavir has demonstrated a reduction in HDV viral loads by two logs and three logs at four weeks and eight weeks, respectively. Lonafarnib boosted with ritonavir and combined with pegylated interferon alpha, or PEG-IFN-alpha, has demonstrated a reduction in HDV viral loads by 99.9%, or up to three logs, in four weeks. Multiple Phase 2 studies of lonafarnib are ongoing with endpoints of clearance of HDV virus and sustained virologic response, or SVR. The most common adverse events experienced with lonafarnib to date are gastrointestinal-related and include nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. 

Lonafarnib has been granted orphan drug designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, and European Medicines Agency, or EMA. The potential market for HDV therapies in the United States and Western Europe is growing due to increased migration from regions where the disease is endemic, primarily from Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and Asia. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Exendin (9-39) is the second most advanced product candidate in Eiger&#146;s pipeline, and Eiger is developing this candidate as a treatment for hypoglycemia associated with bariatric surgery. Hypoglycemia associated with bariatric surgery is a debilitating and potentially life-threatening condition for which there is currently no approved therapy. This disorder occurs more frequently in a subset of bariatric surgeries called Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), where 5-10% of post-RYGB 

&#160;

Index to Financial Statements &#160; patients experience and leads to frequent symptomatic hypoglycemia, where blood sugar levels are below 50 mg/dL, and results in glucose concentrations low enough to cause seizures, altered mental status, loss of consciousness, and even death. Gastric bypass procedures are widely performed and are increasing for medically complicated obesity, including obesity due to Type 2 diabetes. 

To date, research at Stanford has generated results demonstrating clinical proof of concept in 18 patients suffering from gastric bypass surgery-induced hypoglycemia indicating that exendin (9-39) can potentially prevent post-prandial hypoglycemia in affected patients. Exendin (9-39) is a glucagon-like peptide-1, or GLP-1, receptor antagonist and has the potential to compete with endogenous GLP-1 and prevent excess insulin release. These data were generated using both intravenous and subcutaneous, or SC, formulation delivery developed by Stanford. Pharmacokinetics from this Phase 2 SC study indicate that the SC formulation could enable once or twice a day pre-prandial dosing. Eiger is developing its own SC formulation and plans to initiate a Phase 2 dose-ranging trial in affected patients with its exendin (9-39) SC formulation in the first half of 2016. Eiger intends to seek orphan drug designation for exendin (9-39). 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Eiger&#146;s third product candidate is ubenimex for PAH. PAH a life-threatening disease characterized by increased pulmonary vascular resistance, heart failure and premature death. Ubenimex is a well-characterized, oral, small-molecule inhibitor of leukotriene A 4 hydrolase, or LTA 4 H, the enzyme responsible for converting the inflammatory mediator leukotriene A 4 , or LTA 4 , to leukotriene B 4 , or LTB 4 . Results of a preclinical study published in Science Translational Medicine (Tian, W. et al. &#147;Blocking Macrophage Leukotriene B4 Prevents Endothelial Injury and Reverses Pulmonary Hypertension,&#148; Sci Transl Med, 2013; 5:1) by Stanford researchers have demonstrated that both LTB 4 and LTA 4 H are elevated in animal models of PAH and human PAH disease. In that study, elevated LTB 4 caused inflammation resulting in arteriole occlusion and hypertension in animal models of PAH. Targeted pharmacologic inhibition of LTB 4 , including ubenimex, reversed PAH disease in treated rat animal models; obstructed arterioles opened, cardiac function improved, and the animals survived. Based on the findings in these models that pathological inflammation may be important in the etiology of PAH, Eiger believes that ubenimex is an attractive candidate for clinical development. Ubenimex was granted orphan drug designation by the FDA and EMA for the treatment of PAH in the United States and Europe, respectively. In addition, Eiger was granted U.S. patent allowances for claims in PAH in September 2015. Eiger intends to begin enrollment in a Phase 2 clinical trial of ubenimex in patients with PAH in the first half of 2016. 

Ubenimex was licensed from Nippon Kayaku, and Eiger has exclusive rights in the United States, Europe and certain other countries to develop ubenimex for PAH as well as other inflammatory diseases involving LTB 4 . Ubenimex has been marketed in Japan and other countries outside of Eiger&#146;s licensed territory by Nippon Kayaku for over 25 years for a different indication. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Eiger&#146;s fourth program involves clinical development of ubenimex in lymphedema, which is a state of vascular functional insufficiency in which decreased clearance of interstitial fluid through the lymphatic vasculature leads to edema formation and to progressive, debilitating architectural alterations in skin and supporting tissues. There is no approved pharmacologic therapy. The current standard of therapy involves compression garments. Researchers at Stanford have demonstrated for the first time that LTB 4 is elevated in both animal models of lymphedema as well as human lymphedema and that elevated LTB 4 is associated with tissue inflammation and impaired lymphatic function. In that research, applying inhibitors of LTB 4 promoted physiologic lymphatic repair and reversed lymphedema in treated animals. Eiger is seeking orphan drug designation for ubenimex in lymphedema. Eiger intends to begin enrollment in a Phase 2 clinical trial of ubenimex in patients with lymphedema in the first half of 2016. 

Eiger believes that its approach to clinical development enables achievement of early clinical signals in its Phase 2 programs and potentially reduces clinical risks and costs inherent in the drug discovery and development 

&#160;

Index to Financial Statements process. Eiger has a highly experienced management team whose members have, in the course of their prior employment, participated in the bringing of more than 20 product candidates through regulatory approval and into commercialization. Eiger plans to leverage its management team&#146;s breadth and depth of experience in clinical and regulatory drug development as well as market development and commercialization to identify potentially promising product candidates to address unmet medical needs. 

Eiger&#146;s current product candidate pipeline has been created by in-licensing from pharmaceutical companies as well as Stanford. With its focus on orphan diseases, Eiger&#146;s strategy is to acquire and retain some or all commercialization rights to its products in significant territories to diversify risk, identify a rapid regulatory pathway to approval and minimize the development investment in order to maximize long-term value for its stockholders. Over time, depending upon the data and potential market opportunity, Eiger expects to establish a commercial organization, which Eiger believes can be targeted and cost effective for selected, promising orphan disease designated programs. Eiger plans to balance these interests with opportunities to enhance stockholder value through partnerships and other strategic relationships. 

Business Model and Management Team 

Eiger plans to continue evaluating in-licensing opportunities in order to enhance its pipeline and leverage its business development, clinical development, regulatory and commercial expertise. Eiger believes its management team has the capability and experience to continue to execute this model. Eiger&#146;s management team has worked in other private and public biotechnology companies such as Prestwick Pharmaceuticals, New River Pharmaceuticals, Clinical Data Inc., CoTherix and InterMune, each of which was acquired by a larger pharmaceutical industry company. Eiger&#146;s management also has previous work experience, in some cases working together, at pharmaceutical companies, including The Upjohn Company, Glaxo, Glaxo Wellcome, Glaxo Smith Kline, Arena Pharmaceuticals, Alza (Johnson and Johnson), Halozyme, Clinical Data Inc., New River Pharmaceuticals, Genentech and Gilead Sciences. 

Eiger&#146;s Strategy 

Eiger&#146;s mission is to identify, develop, and, directly or through collaborations, bring to market novel products that receive orphan drug designation for the treatment of rare diseases or conditions. Eiger currently has a diverse portfolio of well-characterized product candidates with the potential to address diseases for which the unmet medical need is high, the biology for treatment is believed to be understood, and for which an effective therapy is not available. Eiger&#146;s goal is to be a leader in the development and commercialization of novel therapeutics for serious unmet medical needs in orphan diseases. Eiger&#146;s focus to achieve this goal will be to utilize its experience and capabilities to: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Advance its existing product candidates through late-stage clinical trials, generating meaningful clinical results; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Work with U.S. and international regulatory authorities for expeditious, efficient development pathways toward registration; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Prepare for commercialization of each program; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Use Eiger&#146;s industry relationships and experience to source, evaluate and in-license well-characterized product candidates to continue pipeline development; and &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Identify potential commercial or distribution partners for Eiger&#146;s products in relevant territories. Eiger&#146;s Product Candidates 

Lonafarnib in HDV 

Lonafarnib, brand named Sarasar &#174; , is a small molecule that Eiger in-licensed from Merck in 2010 that Eiger is advancing for the treatment of HDV infection. Lonafarnib is a well-characterized, orally active inhibitor of 

&#160;

Index to Financial Statements farnesyl transferase, an enzyme involved in modification of proteins through a process called prenylation. HDV uses this prenylation process inside host liver cells to complete a key step in its life cycle. Lonafarnib inhibits the prenylation step of HDV replication inside liver cells and blocks the virus life cycle at the stage of assembly. Since prenylation is carried out by a host enzyme, there is a higher barrier to develop viral resistance mutations to lonafarnib therapy. Eiger has generated clinical results in over 100 patients in Phase 2 trials, across international study sites, demonstrating rapid decreases in HDV viral loads and no resistance. Eiger is actively recruiting patients in additional Phase 2 trials of longer duration using lonafarnib in combination with other antiviral therapies including ritonavir and PEG-IFN-alpha, with a goal of addressing HDV. 

Hepatitis Delta Overview 

About Hepatitis Delta 

Hepatitis delta infection is caused by HDV a small circular ribonucleic acid, or RNA, virus that expresses only one protein, the hepatitis delta antigen, or HDAg. There are two forms of HDAg, small and large. Together, these two forms of HDAg and the single-stranded RNA genome are surrounded by a lipid envelope, which is embedded with Hepatitis B Virus, or HBV, derived surface antigen, or HBsAg, proteins. HDV does not encode its own envelope proteins and must acquire them from HBV during the final steps of replication. Hence natural HDV infections always occur in the presence of a co-existing HBV infection. HBsAg is the only element of HBV relied upon by HDV. HDV replication can occur independently of HBV replication. 

Hepatitis delta is the most severe form of viral hepatitis. Hepatitis delta can be acquired either by co-infection (a simultaneous co-infection with HDV and HBV) or by super-infection (infection of someone already harboring a chronic HBV infection). Both co-infection and superinfection with HDV result in more severe complications compared to infection with HBV alone. These complications include a greater likelihood of experiencing liver failure in acute infections and a rapid progression to liver cirrhosis, with an increased chance of developing liver cancer in chronic infections. HDV has the highest fatality rate of all the hepatitis infections at up to 20%. Although HDV/HBV simultaneous co-infection in adults usually resolves completely, in some cases it can become fulminant, or rapidly severe, hepatitis. In the case of super-infections, the predominant form of HDV, HDV super-infection leads to a more severe form of disease than chronic HBV mono-infection. In a study published in 1987 in the Journal of Infectious Diseases (Fattovich, G. et al. &#147;Influence of Hepatitis delta Virus Infection on Progression to Cirrhosis in Chronic Hepatitis Type B,&#148; J Infect Dis, 1987; 155:931), histological liver deterioration was observed in 77% of HBV patients co-infected with HDV over a 15-year follow-up period, versus 30% of patients infected with HBV alone (p&#60;0.01). In a 2013 study of chronic HBV patients published in the Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology (Gish, R. et al. &#147;Coinfection with hepatitis B and D: epidemiology, prevalence and disease in patients in Northern California,&#148; J Gastroenterol Hepatol, 2013; 28(9):1521), cirrhosis was present in 73% of HBV patients co-infected with HDV, compared to only 22% of those infected with HBV alone. Patients co-infected with HDV are more than twice-as-likely to develop liver-related complications, cirrhosis, or require liver transplants than matched patients infected with HBV alone. 

HDV is generally spread through exchange of body fluids either sexually or through contact with infected blood. Globally, it is estimated that between 4.3% and 5.7% of the 250 million worldwide chronic HBV population, or 15 to 20 million people, are infected with HDV. The prevalence of HDV in patients infected with chronic HBV is even higher in certain regions, including certain parts of Mongolia, China, Russia, Central Asia, Pakistan, Turkey, Africa, and South America, with an HDV prevalence as high as 60% being reported in HBV-infected patients in Mongolia and Pakistan. The prevalence of HDV has recently begun to increase in Western Europe and the United States due to migration from countries with high infection rates. 

The Role of HDV Screening in Identifying Patients Who May Benefit From Lonafarnib 

There are diagnostic tests in use today in clinical laboratories to detect anti-HDV antibodies in serum. These tests are currently able to detect acute HDV infections after four weeks, but they are poor tests for active HDV infections. Active HDV infections are best detected by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, or RT-

&#160;

Index to Financial Statements PCR, assays for genomic RNA. These assays yield a quantitative assessment of the number of viral particles or viral load in serum. A commercial assay for quantitative HDV RNA is currently available in Europe. A commercial assay for quantitative HDV RNA is not yet available in the United States. 

Eiger has developed an HDV RNA quantitative assay that has been calibrated using the World Health Organization HDV standard provided by the Paul Erhlich Institute in Germany. Eiger has used this assay to quantitate HDV RNA in its Phase 2 trials. Eiger is facilitating transfer of its HDV RNA assay into commercial laboratories. By increasing the number of assays performed, Eiger believes it can increase the number of patients who can be identified and who will potentially benefit from an HDV therapy such as lonafarnib. 

In Eiger&#146;s initial discussions with payers, these payers have indicated that they would be willing to reimburse healthcare providers for HDV assays that are carried out sequentially following a positive HBsAg test for HBV. Eiger is in the process of transferring its assay to U.S. commercial labs and anticipates this assay being available on testing menus by the second half of 2016. If, due to Eiger&#146;s efforts and growing awareness of HDV as a health issue for HBV patients, screening for HDV becomes more widespread, this will have the effect of increasing the pool of patients who would be eligible for, and might benefit from, lonafarnib. 

Current Therapy for HDV 

Currently, there is no FDA approved therapy for hepatitis delta infection. The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases, or the AASLD, guidelines suggest treatment of chronic hepatitis delta infections with IFN-alpha, but this therapeutic regime usually requires injections of IFN-alpha over a prolonged period. In clinical trials of IFN-alpha or PEG-IFN-alpha, between 25% and 33% of HDV infected patients were able to clear their infections after a minimum of 48 weeks of therapy, with some requiring two years of therapy. However, long-term therapy with IFN-alpha is known to be associated with numerous adverse events and tolerability is a significant problem for some of these patients. HBV nucleoside analogs that inhibit HBV genome replication are ineffective against HDV since they are ineffective in suppressing the expression HBsAg. Other antiviral therapies have been tested, but none have been shown to be effective against HDV infection. 

HDV Replication and Prenylation 

After HDV enters a target cell hepatocyte, the genome is translocated to the nucleus where genome replication occurs and the two forms of HDAg small delta antigen, or SHDAg, and large delta antigen, or LHDAg, are produced. The newly formed HDV genome and the small and large delta antigen must acquire a lipid envelope from HBV to complete the assembly process. An important interaction between HDV and HBV proteins has been shown to depend on the presence of the last four amino acids of the large delta antigen, comprising a CXXX box motif, where C represents cysteine and X denotes any other amino acid. This amino acid sequence is required for LHDAg to be prenylated by a host enzyme which covalently attaches a 15-carbon prenyl lipid (farnesyl-moiety) to the cysteine of the CXXX box. Prenylation of the large delta antigen renders it more lipophilic, promotes its association with HBsAg and is essential for initiating the HDV particle formation process. Eiger&#146;s approach involves targeting this host process called prenylation, or protein farnesylation, which has been shown to be essential for the last steps in HDV replication, the assembly and release of new virus progeny. 

In the 1980&#146;s farnesyltransferase inhibitors were developed by multiple pharmaceutical companies for oncology indications. Addition of a farnesyl or prenyl lipid group to the Ras protein, or Ras, a well-known and important regulator of cellular proliferation, allows for membrane association. Once membrane bound, Ras may then be activated. The importance of activated Ras in tumor development was demonstrated by sequence analyses of tumors from patients where up to 30% have mutations involving Ras. Several prenylation inhibitors were developed in oncology and taken into the clinic and in some cases through late-stage clinical development. However these programs did not lead to approvals, due to a lack of compelling efficacy. The class-related, dose-limiting toxicity has been gastrointestinal side effects including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. 

&#160;

Index to Financial Statements Published studies conducted by Stanford researchers demonstrated that farnesyltransferase inhibitors block HDV viral production both in cellular experiments and in HDV transgenic mice. Targeting prenylation or farnesyl transferase, a host target, significantly reduces the likelihood of HDV developing resistance to escape effects of antiviral therapy. Viruses mutate quickly and there is a higher rate of mutations in viral replication compared to mammalian cell division. However, no matter how much HDV may mutate, these changes do not alter the host process of prenylation which HDV requires to complete packaging. Thus, targeting a host prenylation process provides what Eiger believes to be a higher barrier to resistance. Identification of clinic-ready farnesylation inhibitors has allowed Eiger to move rapidly into proof-of-concept studies in humans. 

Eiger&#146;s Solution: Lonafarnib for HDV 

Lonafarnib is a well-characterized, orally active inhibitor of farnesyl transferase. Lonafarnib inhibits the prenylation step of HDV replication inside liver cells and blocks the ability of the virus to multiply. Since prenylation is a host process, not under control of HDV, and lonafarnib inhibits prenylation, Eiger believes that there is also a potentially higher barrier to resistance with lonafarnib therapy. Lonafarnib has been granted orphan drug designation in Europe and the United States, and lonafarnib in combination with ritonavir has been granted Fast Track designation from FDA for the treatment of chronic HDV infections. Eiger is currently conducting three Phase 2 clinical trials: LOWR HDV&#151;2 (Ankara, Turkey), LOWR HDV&#151;3 (NIH) and LOWR HDV&#151;4 (Hannover, Germany). Eiger has filed and received approval for a U.S. IND and is conducting LOWR HDV&#151;4 under this IND. Lonafarnib has never been approved or commercialized for any indication. 

An orphan drug designation in the United States refers to a designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, granting seven years of marketing and treatment exclusivity to a product to treat a rare disease or condition (a disease affecting fewer than 200,000 people) that is clinically superior or otherwise makes a major contribution to patient care in a specified indication or rare disease or condition. In the European Union, the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, grants orphan drug designation with ten years of market exclusivity for diseases that are life-threatening or chronically debilitating and have a prevalence in the European Union of not more than 5 in 10,000, or it is otherwise unlikely that marketing would generate returns sufficient to justify the investment. Other countries have similar opportunities for exclusivity with respect to products addressing unmet medical needs. 

Fast Track designation from FDA is a process to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs to treat serious conditions and fill an unmet medical need. A drug that receives Fast Track designation may be eligible to receive more frequent meetings with FDA to discuss the drug&#146;s development, more frequent written communication from FDA about the design of proposed clinical trials and biomarkers, eligibility for Accelerated Approval and Priority Review, if relevant criteria are met, and eligibility to have New Drug Applications, or NDAs, reviewed on a rolling basis. 

Lonafarnib Clinical Data 

Eiger in-licensed lonafarnib from Merck in 2010, and has relied upon Merck&#146;s prior Phase 1 clinical experience with lonafarnib to understand safety and pharmacokinetics. 

Merck conducted four Phase 1 studies in 85 healthy volunteers to study food effect (study P00042), absorption, metabolism and excretion (study P00260), ketoconazole drug interaction (study P00393), and the effect of age and gender (study P02673) of lonafarnib. 

In study P00042, administration of lonafarnib with food decreased the rate and extent of lonafarnib absorption in healthy subjects when administered as a single 100 mg dose of lonafarnib. The relative oral bioavailability of lonafarnib for subjects that ate prior to receiving lonafarnib compared to those that fasted prior to receiving lonarfib was 48% based on measuring the maximum serum concentration, or C max, and 77% based measuring the concentration of the lonafarnib in the blood plasma over time, or AUC. However, administration of lonafarnib with food did not have a significant effect on lonafarnib bioavailability in subjects following 

&#160;

Index to Financial Statements multiple-dose administration. In addition, inter-subject variability was lower (~16%) following multiple-dose administration with food. Given the apparent lower incidence of gastrointestinal side effects and the lower inter-subject variability, results from P00042 study support dosing lonafarnib with food. 

Study P00260 was an absorption, metabolism and excretion study conducted in healthy volunteers following single-dose administration of lonafarnib. Drug-derived radioactivity was primarily excreted via the feces. Mean cumulative excretion of radioactivity was 61% in feces and less than 1% in urine up to 24 hours post-dose. Metabolite profiles in plasma, urine, and feces showed that lonafarnib was metabolized extensively. The common metabolic pathways included oxidation, dehydrogenation, and combinations of these two processes. The results of in vivo metabolic profiling and in vitro metabolism studies indicate that no human-specific lonafarnib metabolites are formed. 

Study P00393 was a two-way crossover study that was conducted in 16 healthy volunteers exploring the interaction of lonafarnib with ketoconazole, an anti-fungal medication and a CYP3A4 inhibitor. Lonafarnib is extenisively metabolized by CYP3A4. Co-administration of single-dose lonafarnib (50 mg) and multiple doses of ketoconazole (200 mg BID for 5 days) resulted in an approximately five-fold increase in lonafarnib exposures, and an increase in the mean elimination half-life from 2.68 hours to 3.99 hours. Administration of lonafarnib with ketoconazole was also associated with lower inter-subject variability than when lonafarnib was administered with a placebo. 

Study P02673 was a single-center, single-dose study conducted in 48 healthy volunteers (24 males and 24 females). Twenty-four of the subjects were between the ages of 18 and 45 and the other 24 subjects were 65 years old or older. Each subject received a single 100 mg dose of lonafarnib in the morning after a standardized meal. PK data suggested that lonafarnib exposures were higher in female subjects (44% higher) as compared to male subjects. Additionally, lonafarnib exposures in subjects 65 years old or older were approximately 59% higher as compared to the younger healthy subject population. Young male subjects had the lowest lonafarnib systemic exposures; AUC values in male subjects between the ages of 18 and 45 were approximately 50% lower than female and elderly subjects. 

Eiger conducted a Phase 1 study with goals including: evaluating the effects of multiple-dosing of an antacid (proton pump inhibitor or H2-receptor antagonist) on the systemic absorption of a single dose of lonafarnib, and evaluating the effects of multiple-dosing of lonafarnib on the inhibition potential of the cytochrome P450 enzyme, CYP2C19. The Phase 1 study results demonstrated a weak effect on systemic absorption of lonafarnib following administration of an antacid, which Eiger believes reduces the risk for the use of an antacid by patients treated with lonafarnib to manage possible dyspepsia during treatment. These Phase 1 study results also demonstrated a weak effect of lonafarnibon on the systemic absorption of a sensitive CYP2C19 substrate, which Eiger further believes reduces the risk for the use of concomitant medications that are metabolized by CYP2C19 by patients treated with lonafarnib. 

In addition to the above Phase 1 studies, under Eiger&#146;s direction, lonafarnib has been tested in three Phase 2 trials in over 100 HDV infected patients. 

NIH Clinical Proof-of-Concept Phase 2a Study in HDV 

The National Institutes of Health, or the NIH, conducted a 14 patient, double blind, placebo-controlled, proof of concept study, which was the first ever to evaluate lonafarnib in patients infected with HDV. Patients either received lonafarnib 100 mg (group 1) or lonafarnib 200 mg (group 2) twice daily, or BID, for 28 days with 6 months of follow-up. Both groups enrolled six treatment participants and two placebo participants. The two placebo patients from group 1 later received open-label lonafarnib as group 2 participants. Doses of 100 mg and 200 mg of lonafarnib administered BID demonstrated a dose dependent decrease in viral loads of 0.73 and 1.54 log decline, respectively, in 28 days. The results were published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases Journal in 2015. 

&#160;

Index to Financial Statements 

&#160;

As shown in the table above, statistically significant decreases in HDV RNA viral load were demonstrated by both the 100 mg of lonafarnib BID (p=0.03) and 200 mg of lonafarnib BID (p&#60;0.0001) active groups versus the placebo. A statistically significant correlation between increasing lonafarnib serum levels and decreasing HDV RNA viral loads was also demonstrated. The 100 mg twice daily dose was well-tolerated while GI intolerability such as nausea and diarrhea was experienced in the 200 mg twice daily dose. No resistant variants were identified from population-based sequencing of HDV infected patients after 28 days of treatment with lonafarnib. 

A p-value is a statistical measure of the probability that the difference in two values could have occurred by chance. The smaller the p-value, the greater the statistical significance and confidence in the result. Typically, results are considered statistically significant if they have a p-value less than 0.05, meaning that there is less than a one-in-20 likelihood that the observed results occurred by chance. The FDA requires that sponsors demonstrate the effectiveness and safety of their product candidates through the conduct of adequate and well-controlled studies in order to obtain marketing approval. Typically, the FDA requires a p-value of less than 0.05 to establish the statistical significance of a clinical trial, although there are no laws or regulations requiring that clinical data be statistically significant, or that require a specific p-value, in order for the FDA to grant approval. 

LOWR HDV&#151;1 (LOnafarnib With and without Ritonavir) Phase 2 Study 

The LOWR HDV&#151;1 trial studied lonafarnib in 15 subjects who were enrolled into one of five groups comprised of three patients in each group, three groups receiving different doses lonafarnib monotherapy, lonafarnib in combination with ritonavir, and a group receiving lonafarnib in combination with PEG-IFN-alpha. 

In lonafarnib monotherapy treatment groups, increasing the dosage of lonafarnib from 100 mg three times a day to 200 mg twice a day to 300 mg twice a day led to greater reductions in viral loads. Viral loads were reduced, after 28 days, from a 1.2 log decline in the patients dosed with 100 mg three times a day to 1.6 log 

&#160;

Index to Financial Statements decline in patients dosed with 200 mg twice a day to a 2.0 log decline in the patients dosed with 300 mg of lonafarnib twice a day. However, doses greater than 100 mg BID led to increasing gastrointestinal, or GI, intolerability and were not considered to be ideal for longer term dosing. 

In the lonafarnib-ritonavir combination arm of LOWR HDV&#151;1, 100 mg of lonafarnib BID was combined with 100 mg of ritonavir once daily. Ritonavir is a pharmacokinetic, or PK, enhancer known to inhibit the metabolism of lonafarnib, allowing lower doses of lonafarnib to be administered, while resulting in higher systemic concentrations of lonafarnib, and presumably higher liver concentrations of lonafarnib. 

The addition of 100 mg of ritonavir once daily to 100 mg lonafarnib BID led to a four- to five-fold increase in the serum concentration of lonafarnib in treated patients compared to lonafarnib alone. This dose combination led to a greater reduction in viral load, compared to monotherapy treatment with 100 mg lonafarnib BID, with a mean decrease of 2.4 logs and 3.2 logs after 28 days and 56 days, respectively. Importantly, when therapy was discontinued the viral loads rebounded, which Eiger believes indicates that lonafarnib treatment was eliciting an antiviral effect. 

The addition of 180 mcg of PEG-IFN-alpha once weekly to 100 mg lonafarnib BID was also more active in reducing HDV RNA versus either agent alone. This dose combination led to a greater reduction in viral load, compared to monotherapy treatment with 100 mg lonafarnib BID, with a mean decrease of 1.8 logs and 3.0 logs after 28 days and 56 days, respectively. Importantly, when therapy was discontinued the viral loads rebounded. The mean change in HDV RNA for the patients receiving eight weeks of treatment of 100 mg lonafarnib BID in combination with ritonavir and 100 mg lonafarnib BID in combination with PEG-IFN-alpha is shown below. LOWR HDV&#151;1 was a dose-finding study conducted on a total of 15 patients, with three patients in each treatment arm. The study did not include a placebo arm and, as such, statistical significance could not be determined.

Index to Financial Statements Liver enzymes are often elevated during infections with viral hepatitis, a sign of damage being done to liver cells. In both lonafarnib combination cohorts, all HDV patients enrolled had elevated alanine aminotransferase, or ALT, liver enzymes prior to receiving any treatment. By the end of eight weeks of combination therapy with lonafarnib and ritonavir or lonafarnib and PEG-IFN-alpha, all patients&#146; ALT liver enzymes normalized or trended toward normal while on therapy. The figures below show the ALT levels, measured in units per liter, or U/L, for each of the patients receiving lonafarnib in combination with ritonavir and lonafarnib in combination with PEG-IFN-alpha.

The results of LOWR HDV&#151;1 study generated the most encouraging results to date in reducing HDV RNA in patients infected with hepatitis delta. In the three patients receiving lonafarnib in combination with ritonavir and the three patients receiving lonafarnib in combination with PEG-IFN-alpha, Eiger observed decreases in HDV RNA viral load of approximately 3.2 logs and 3.0 logs after eight weeks of treatment, respectively. For comparison, and as shown in the figure below, published data from the HIDIT-2 trial of PEG-IFN-alpha in 91 HDV infected patients demonstrated a mean decline in HDV RNA of approximately 1.6 logs and 2.7 logs after 8 weeks and 48 weeks, respectively. The HIDIT-2 (Hep-Net International Delta Hepatitis International Trial-II) was a multicenter randomized trial studying effects of PEG-IFN-alpha plus tenofovir in chronic HDV patients, and is the largest clinical study to date in HDV. The HIDIT-2 trial was conducted on 91 patients, whereas the LOWR HDV&#151;1 study was conducted on an aggregate of 15 patients, with three patients per treatment arm. If the LOWR HDV&#151;1 trial were conducted on a larger group of patients, the mean HDV RNA decline may differ from the 3.2 log and 3.0 log declines after eight weeks of treatment observed in the three patient arms receiving lonafarnib combination treatment in the LOWR HDV&#151;1 trial. However, based on clinical results to date, Eiger expects all patients who are treated with lonafarnib to show a viral load response.

LOWR HDV&#151;2 (LOnafarnib With Ritonavir) Phase 2 Study 

LOWR HDV&#151;2 is an ongoing &#147;dose finding&#148; trial to explore lonafarnib doses in combination with ritonavir and/or PEG-IFN-alpha. The goal of LOWR HDV&#151;2 is to identify the lowest tolerable and effective dose of lonafarnib for longer duration therapy. Eiger believes that dosing durations of at least 24 weeks may be necessary to clear HDV RNA and to achieve SVR for HDV infection. 

Thirty-seven subjects were enrolled into one of nine groups of different lonafarnib with ritonavir and/or PEG-IFN-alpha combinations for 12 to 24 weeks as follows: Group 1: LNF 100 mg bid and RTN 50 mg bid; Group 2: LNF 100 mg bid and RTN 100 mg qd; Group 3: LNF 150 mg qd and RTN 100 mg qd; Group 4: LNF 100 mg qd and RTN 100 mg qd; Group 5: LNF 75 mg bid and RTN 100 mg bid; Group 6: LNF 50 mg bid and RTN 100 mg bid; Group 7: LNF 50 mg bid and RTN 100 mg bid and PEG-IFN-alpha 180 mcg qw; Group 8: LNF 25 mg bid and RTN 100 mg bid; and Group 9: LNF 25 mg bid, RTN 100 mg bid and PEG-IFN-alpha 180 mcg qw. A low dose of lonafarnib 25 mg BID and 50 mg BID in combination with ritonavir 100 mg BID has proven to be tolerable and allowed for the addition of PEG-IFN-alpha. This triple dose combination has achieved the most robust mean HDV RNA viral load declines of greater than 3 logs after 28 days. Tolerability with this regimen was reported by investigators and patients to be acceptable, enabling more patients to remain on therapy for periods sufficient to possibly clear HDV RNA. Eiger plans to carry out dosing durations of up to 6 months. Eiger does not believe it has identified the lowest effective dose of lonafarnib. 

LOWR HDV&#151;2 is an open label study and results will be presented over time as the treatment phase of the study completes in the second half of 2016. 

LOWR HDV&#151;3 (LOnafarnib With Ritonavir) Phase 2 Trial 

LOWR HDV&#151;3 is an ongoing &#147;duration&#148; study to explore lonafarnib doses in combination with ritonavir for six months. Eiger&#146;s Phase 2 placebo-controlled trial will test once daily doses of lonafarnib of 50 mg, 75 mg and 100 mg in combination with ritonavir 100 mg once a day for a duration of six months in 21 HDV patients, 

&#160;

Index to Financial Statements with seven HDV patients in each group. The goals of LOWR HDV&#151;3 include dose ranging and longer duration therapy to determine reduction in HDV RNA, including the potential for clearance of HDV RNA. 

Eiger completed enrollment of 21 patients at the NIH for LOWR HDV&#151;3, and plans to follow patients for an additional six months post-treatment to assess long-term suppression of HDV viral loads. End of treatment (EOT) data is expected in the second half of 2016. 

LOWR HDV&#151;4 (LOnafarnib With Ritonavir) Phase 2 Trial 

LOWR HDV&#151;4 is a &#147;dose titration&#148; study to explore escalating lonafarnib dosed in combination with ritonavir for 6 months. The study is a Phase 2 open label trial in which patients will be given a starting dose of lonafarnib 50 mg BID in combination with ritonavir 100 mg BID. Patients demonstrating good tolerability will be allowed to titrate up to lonafarnib 75 mg BID at the investigator&#146;s discretion. The fifteen HDV patients will be dosed for a duration of six months, followed by an additional six month post-treatment evaluation to assess long-term suppression of HDV viral loads. The goals of LOWR HDV&#151;4 include the exploration of upward dose titration and longer duration therapy to determine reduction in HDV RNA in this time period, including the potential for clearance of HDV RNA. As noted above, Eiger believes that dosing durations of at least 24 weeks may be necessary to clear HDV RNA and to achieve SVR for HDV infection. 

Eiger completed enrollment of 15 patients at the Hannover Medical Center for LOWR HDV&#151;4, and EOT results are planned to be presented in the second half of 2016. 

Potential for Registration in HDV for Lonafarnib 

Eiger&#146;s goal in developing lonafarnib is to reduce viral load in such a manner as to achieve clearance of the virus to SVR, the point where, upon withdrawal of the therapy, the infection does not return. Evidence that academic investigators have gathered suggests that combinations of lonafarnib with other antiviral agents may hold promise for longer duration treatment and sustained, long-term reduction of viral load. 

Eiger also believes that treatment with lonafarnib in combination with other antiviral agents may contribute to long-term benefit for patients, which may represent an alternative path to regulatory approval. In a study published in Plos One in 2014 (Romeo, R. et al. &#147;High Serum Levels of HDV RNA Are Predictors of Cirrhosis and Liver Cancer in Patients with Chronic Hepatitis Delta,&#148; Plos One, 2014; 9:1), high serum levels of HDV were found to be a predictor of cirrhosis and liver cancer development. In a study published in Gastroenterology in 2004 (Farci, P. et al. &#147;Long-Term Benefit of Interferon Therapy of Chronic Hepatitis D: Regression of Advanced Hepatic Fibrosis,&#148; Gastroenterol, 2004; 126:1740), researchers demonstrated that lower frequencies of clinical events, leading to improvements in overall liver health and reductions in the rates of developing hepatic complications, could be achieved in HDV infected patients who were treated with IFN-alpha and who experienced as little as 2 log declines in viral load. A 2014 Hepatology study by Heidrich suggests that transient suppression of HDV replication improves the clinical long-term outcome, as not a single patient in their study with a posttreatment week 24 HDV RNA response experienced a clinical event, including those patients who experienced viral rebound. Eiger believes that these studies suggest that eradication of HDV RNA may not be necessary to achieve a substantial clinical benefit and improve long-term outcomes. Lower doses of lonafarnib, alone and in combination with other antiviral agents, have demonstrated tolerability for longer duration and possibly chronic dosing. 

Exendin (9-39) for Hypoglycemia Associated with Bariatric Surgery 

Exendin (9-39) is the second most advanced product candidate in Eiger&#146;s pipeline. Exendin (9-39) is a glucagon-like peptide-1, or GLP-1, receptor antagonist. GLP-1 is a gastrointestinal hormone released after meals that binds to GLP-1 receptors, releasing insulin and lowering blood glucose levels. Exendin (9-39) blocks GLP-1 from binding to the GLP-1 receptor, preventing the steep fall in glucose levels. Eiger is developing exendin (9-

&#160;

Index to Financial Statements 39) as a treatment for hypoglycemia associated with bariatric surgery, which is low levels of glucose in the bloodstream caused by excess levels of insulin in the blood, associated with bariatric surgery, including gastric bypass surgery. This form of hypoglycemia is a debilitating and potentially life-threatening condition. Gastric bypass procedures are widely performed and are increasing in frequency for medically complicated obesity, including obesity due to Type 2 diabetes. There is no approved therapy for gastric bypass induced hypoglycemia and the unmet medical need is high. 

Stanford researchers have demonstrated clinical proof of concept in 18 patients suffering from gastric bypass surgery induced hypoglycemia that exendin (9-39) can prevent an exaggerated fall in blood sugar following a meal, or post-prandial hypoglycemia, in affected patients. Data has been generated using both intravenous delivery and a novel SC formulation delivery. Pharmacokinetics indicate that the SC formulation could enable once or twice a day pre-prandial dosing. Eiger plans to initiate a Phase 2 multi-day dosing trial in affected patients with Eiger&#146;s exendin (9-39) SC formulation in the second quarter of 2016. 

Hypoglycemia Associated with Bariatric Surgery Overview 

As the use of bariatric surgical procedures has increased worldwide, a new post-surgical complication, hypoglycemia associated with bariatric surgery, has been increasingly diagnosed and reported in the procedures that involve reducing the size of the stomach with a vertical sleeve gastrectomy or by resecting and re-routing the small intestine to a small stomach pouch (Roux-en-Y). This disorder leads to frequent symptomatic hypoglycemia, often resulting in glucose concentrations low enough to cause seizures, altered mental status, loss of consciousness, cognitive dysfunction, disability and death. Quality of life can be severely diminished, and many patients cannot care for themselves or others, work, drive, or be left alone. There is no approved treatment for this condition. Severe cases have historically been surgically managed with near-total to total pancreatectomy, which results in insulin dependent diabetes and is associated with up to a 2-9% surgical mortality risk. 

Research suggests that elevated GLP-1 may play an important role in hypoglycemia in post-bariatric surgery patients. Surgically-altered nutrient transit, such as a Roux-en-Y procedure, causes early nutrient sensing by the intestinal cells, resulting in enhanced secretion of GLP-1 leading to elevated insulin secretion. This effect may play a primary role in the early resolution of Type 2 diabetes after surgery. A number of synthetic agonist analogs of GLP-1, or agonists, have been approved for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes including Byetta&#153; (exenatide), Victoza&#153; (liraglutide), and Trulicity&#153; (dulaglutide). These drugs, all agonists, bind to the GLP-1 receptor and stimulate release of insulin. In patients with hypoglycemia associated with bariatric surgery, an excess secretion of GLP-1 results in excess insulin release and leads to severe debilitating hypoglycemia. GLP-1 receptor antagonists have the potential to compete with endogenous GLP-1 and prevent excess insulin release. 

Approximately 150,000 to 200,000 bariatric surgical procedures are performed each year in the United States, and another 125,000 are performed each year in Europe. Approximately 30% of these bariatric surgeries are Roux-en-Y gastric bypass procedures. 

Eiger&#146;s Solution: Exendin (9-39) 

Exendin (9-39) is a well-characterized, competitive antagonist of GLP-1 at its receptor. Exendin (9-39) is a 31 amino acid fragment of exenatide, a commercially available GLP-1 agonist, brand named Byetta&#153; and used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Exendin (9-39) blocks the GLP-1 receptor and leads to reduced levels of insulin secreted by the pancreas. While exenatide has been approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, exendin (9-39), as a new molecular entity, has never been approved or commercialized for any indication. 

Clinical Data to Date 

Stanford researchers have demonstrated in two placebo-controlled clinical trials with exendin (9-39) that pharmacologic blockade of the GLP-1 receptor prevents hypoglycemia in affected patients, and Eiger believes 

&#160;

Index to Financial Statements that it may represent the first targeted medical treatment for patients with post-bariatric hypoglycemia. In these two single-dose studies, exendin (9-39) was tolerated with no observed side-effects. These Phase 1b studies were conducted under an investigator-initiated IND for the study of exendin (9-39) for bariatric surgery-induced hypoglycemia associated with bariatric surgery at Stanford. 

The first exendin (9-39) study conducted at Stanford was a Phase 1b, double-blinded crossover study of eight patients with hypoglycemia following a Roux-en-Y procedure. Four patients were dosed with exendin (9-39) IV infusion and another four patients received a placebo infusion following an oral glucose tolerance test, or OGTT. The trial assessed patient blood glucose levels and the rate of glucose rise and fall. Hypoglycemia was defined as glucose levels falling below 50 mg/dL. Physicians who treat hypoglycemia associated with bariatric surgery recognize that the steeper the glucose rise and fall, the worsening of all symptoms including cognitive function and dumping syndrome. After dosing was completed, patients were sent home for a 1-7 day washout period and then crossed over to either placebo or exendin (9-39) for a total of 8 patients treated with exendin (9-39). 

Each of the patients treated with exendin (9-39) mirrored glucose levels of healthy patients, with none of their glucose levels falling below 50 mg/dL. In contrast, every patient who received the placebo had a steep glucose fall, became hypoglycemic with glucose levels falling below 50 mg/dL, and had to be rescued with IV dextrose. The chart below shows the mean glucose levels of eight patients in the above trial. Patients receiving exendin (9-39) and the placebo infusion completed severity-grade questionnaires every 30 minutes during the 180 minute OGTT period. The severity-grade questionnaires showed that, on average, severe hypoglycemic associated with bariatric surgery patients who received an IV infusion of exendin (9-39) experienced fewer and less severe hypoglycemic symptoms compared to the group receiving the placebo infusion (p&#60;0.001). While symptoms reported by subjects during the glucose rise (from T=0 to peak glucose) were unchanged by exendin (9-39) infusion, symptoms reported during the glucose fall period (from peak to nadir glucose) were reduced (p&#60;0.001).

Index to Financial Statements were dosed with a novel immediate release SC formulation of exendin (9-39) prior to an OGTT. The study assessed patient blood glucose levels as well as the rate of glucose rise and fall across all doses. The results of this study will be presented at the American Diabetes Association in June 2016. 

Eiger intends to begin a Phase 2 clinical dose-ranging trial in the second half of 2016 using repeat dosing over three days with the immediate release SC injection of exendin (9-39). 

Ubenimex for Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension 

Ubenimex is a well-characterized, oral, small-molecule inhibitor of leukotriene A 4 hydrolase, or LTA 4 H, the enzyme responsible for converting leukotriene A 4 , or LTA 4 , to leukotriene B 4 , or LTB 4 . LTB 4 is a naturally occurring molecule involved in inflammation. Ubenimex has been marketed in Japan by Nippon Kayaku for over 25 years as an adjunct to chemotherapy agents to extend survival and to maintain remission after treatment for acute non-lymphocytic leukemia in adults. 

Results of a preclinical study published in Science Translational Medicine (Tian, W. et al. &#147;Blocking Macrophage Leukotriene B4 Prevents Endothelial Injury and Reverses Pulmonary Hypertension,&#148; Sci Transl Med, 2013; 5:1) by Stanford researchers demonstrated that both LTB 4 and LTA 4 H are elevated in animal models of PAH and human PAH disease. Macrophages, a type of white blood cell that ingests foreign materials, accumulate around small arterioles of the lungs and synthesize excess LTB 4 . This causes programmed cell death, or apoptosis, of cells that line the interior surface of the pulmonary artery, pulmonary artery endothelial cells. Additionally, this causes proliferation and an increase in volume, or hypertrophy, of pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells. Elevated LTB 4 causes inflammation resulting in blockage of the arteries, or arteriole occlusion, and hypertension in animal models of PAH. Targeted pharmacologic inhibition of LTB 4 , including ubenimex, reversed PAH disease in all treated animals; obstructed arterioles opened, cardiac function improved, and the animals survived. Eiger therefore believes that ubenimex is a potential therapeutic candidate for treatment of PAH where pathological inflammation is believed to be important in the etiology of the disease. 

All currently approved agents for PAH were originally developed as vasodilators, drugs that dilate blood vessels. Inflammation is now recognized as a primary component of PAH disease, which can lead to obstructed arterioles, vasoconstriction, and worsening cardiac function. Work published by Stanford researchers in Science Translational Medicine (Tian, W. et al. &#147;Blocking Macrophage Leukotriene B4 Prevents Endothelial Injury and Reverses Pulmonary Hypertension,&#148; Sci Transl Med, 2013; 5:1) discusses a potentially novel therapeutic approach to PAH that may address the inflammatory component of PAH with the potential for disease modification. Eiger plans to conduct a clinical trial to explore if blocking the effects of LTB 4 may be a useful new treatment for PAH. Eiger has received approval for a U.S. IND of ubenimex in PAH and plans to begin enrolling a Phase 2 clinical trial in early 2016. 

Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Disease Overview 

PAH is a type of high blood pressure that affects the arteries in the lungs and the right side of the heart. PAH begins when tiny arteries in the lungs, called pulmonary arterioles, become narrowed, blocked or destroyed. This makes it harder for blood to flow through the lungs, and raises pressure within the arteries in the lungs. As the pressure builds, the heart&#146;s lower right chamber, or right ventricle, must work harder to pump blood through the lungs, causing the heart muscle to weaken and eventually fail. PAH is a progressive, life-threatening illness that meets criteria for orphan drug designation in the United States, European Union, and Japan. 

Current treatments for PAH 

Initial treatments developed and used for PAH focus on reduction of hypertension with agents such as diuretics, calcium channel blockers, increasing cardiac output with agents such as digoxin, and various anticoagulation therapies. These therapies are all generic agents. A number of therapies specifically approved for 

&#160;

Index to Financial Statements PAH, such as prostacyclin agonists, phosphodiesterase 5, or PDE5, inhibitors, guanylate cyclase stimulators, and endothelin receptor antagonists, target mechanisms that induce vasodilation. These therapies together represent approximately a $4 billion annual market in the United States and Europe. Prostanoids such as epoprostenol, treprostinil and iloprost are stable versions of vasodilators that are naturally produced by the body and help compensate for low levels of prostacyclin production in some patients. PDE5 inhibitors such as sildenafil and tadalafil also work as vasodilators by increased signaling through the nitric oxide pathway. Other stimulators of this pathway include guanylate cyclase stimulators such as riociguat. Endothelin is a natural vasoconstrictor which binds to the endothelin receptors to elicit vasoconstriction. Antagonists of the endothelin receptor such as ambrisentan, bosentan, and macitentan have been approved for the treatment of PAH. Despite their premium pricing, these drugs are all considered to be palliative and not disease-modifying. Specifically, these drugs do not address the underlying causes of the disease, especially in PAH patients with connective tissue diseases, or CTD, or PAH patients with inflammation, highlighting the need for novel therapeutic approaches. An estimated 30,000 PAH patients and 15,000 PAH patients receive pharmacologic therapy in the United States and Europe, respectively. 

Preclinical LTB4 Data in PAH 

In animal models of PAH, LTB 4 was significantly elevated in both broncho-alveolar lavage fluid and in serum, suggesting that LTB 4 may play a key role in development of the pathology associated with PAH. 

&#160;

&#160; Significantly elevated levels of LTB 4 were also observed in serum from PAH patients, with the highest levels in patients with systemic sclerosis-related PAH, or SSc-PAH, identifying a link between the pathology of the animal model of PAH disease and human PAH disease. 

&#160;

Index to Financial Statements 

&#160;

In animal models of PAH, right ventricular systolic pressure is greatly elevated and there is hypertrophy of the right ventricle 21 days after induction of the disease. Treatment with ubenimex for 14 days reversed these effects, normalizing ventricular pressure and right ventricular size. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

The activity of ubenimex in this PAH animal model is more pronounced when overall survival is examined. All of the animals tested in this model that received ubenimex survived until at least day 35, whereas none of the untreated animals survived. 

&#160;

Index to Financial Statements 

&#160;

Improvements in pressures and survival with ubenimex were seen in three distinct animal models of PAH disease: SU5416 induced-PAH in athymic rats, SU5416-induced PAH in hypoxia-induced PAH, and monocrotaline-induced PAH. Activity of ubenimex in treated animals correlated with LTB 4 levels in the model. 

Eiger&#146;s Planned Solution: Ubenimex for PAH 

Ubenimex is a well-characterized, oral, small-molecule, dual-inhibitor of aminopeptidase and LTA 4 H, the enzyme responsible for catalyzing the committed step in the formation of the proinflammatory mediator LTB 4 . Ubenimex is approved in Japan as an adjuvant to chemotherapy agents to extend survival and to maintain remission after treatment for acute non-lymphocytic leukemia in adults. Ubenimex has been used for over 25 years in Japan and remains commercially available through Nippon Kayaku. The FDA and EMA granted orphan drug designation to ubenimex for the treatment of PAH in the United States and Europe, respectively. Ubenimex is not approved for any indication in the United States or Europe. 

Clinical Data to Date and Clinical Development Plan 

Eiger in-licensed ubenimex from Nippon Kayaku in 2015 and has relied on Nippon Kayaku&#146;s prior Phase 1 clinical data and experience with ubenimex to understand safety. Nippon Kayaku conducted four Phase 1 studies in healthy subjects and cancer patients to study metabolite determination, metabolism and excretion, drug absorption, and a pharmacokinetic study in lymphoma patients. 

In the metabolite determination study, ubenimex was rapidly absorbed following oral administration of single doses ranging from 10 mg to 200 mg, reaching a maximum serum level between 30 minutes and three hours after dosing. Mean peak concentrations after 30 mg, 100 mg and 200 mg were 2.9 &#181;g/mL at one hour, 2.5 &#181;g/mL at three hours, and 7.4 &#181;g/mL at two hours, respectively. 

In the metabolism and excretion study, 84% to 94% of the administered doses of ubenimex was recovered in urine within 24 hours of dosing. 

&#160;

Index to Financial Statements In the absorption study, prolonged administration of ubenimex to cancer patients showed rapid absorption of the drug and maximum peak levels which ranged from 30 minutes to three hours in most patients. In a small study of eight patients receiving 30 mg of ubenimex daily, delayed &#097; -phase decrease, an initial phase of rapid decrease of concentration of the drug in the plasma, was observed in patients with renal cancer compared to patients with bladder cancer, suggesting that clearance of ubenimex may be slower in patients with impaired renal function. The pharmacokinetics did not appear to change over time with repeated administration of ubenimex. 

In a Phase 1b study performed in bone marrow transplant lymphoma patients in the United States, PK evaluation was performed in groups of ten patients receiving 10 mg of ubenimex QD, 30 mg of ubenimex QD, 30 mg of ubenimex three times a day, or TID, or 60 mg of ubenimex TID, in each case for up to 60 days. The mean AUC and C max increased with increasing doses of 10 mg, 30 mg, 90 mg or 180 mg ubenimex daily. At all doses, no accumulation was apparent over the six days. 

Eiger completed a pre-IND meeting at FDA in May 2014 where Eiger discussed both Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical development plans for ubenimex in patients with PAH. Eiger subsequently filed an IND with FDA which was approved in September 2015 for the study to proceed. Eiger&#146;s planned Phase 2 trial for ubenimex in PAH will be called LIBERTY (A Randomized, Double-BLInd, Placebo-Controlled Study of uBEnimex in Patients with PulmonaRy ArTerial HYpertension) and is planned to enroll a total of approximately 45 patients with PAH in multiple centers. The trial will assess activity of ubenimex combined with standard of care treatment for PAH versus placebo combined with standard of care treatment for PAH. The primary endpoint will be a measure of change in pulmonary vascular resistance, or PVR, with secondary endpoints based on hemodynamic changes and exercise tolerance tests, including a six minute walk. Based on the proposed mechanism of action of ubenimex as a potential anti-proliferative, anti-inflammatory and disease modifying agent, dosing in the LIBERTY trial will be six months, which Eiger believes will be sufficient time to demonstrate activity. Eiger plans to initiate enrollment in LIBERTY in the first half of 2016. 

Ubenimex for Lymphedema 

A study conducted at Stanford demonstrated that LTB 4 is elevated in both animal models of lymphedema and human lymphedema. Elevated LTB 4 is associated with tissue inflammation and impaired lymphatic function. Targeted pharmacologic inhibition of LTB 4 promotes physiologic lymphatic repair and reverses lymphedema disease in treated animals. 

Researchers at Stanford demonstrated a novel function of LTB 4 in the pathogenesis of lymphedema suggesting that blocking the effects of LTB 4 may be a promising and potentially safe new therapeutic strategy for this disease. Eiger intends to conduct a clinical study to explore if blocking the effects of LTB 4 may be useful as a new treatment for lymphedema. 

Lymphedema Disease Overview 

Lymphedema is the build-up of fluid in soft body tissues when the lymph system has been damaged or blocked. It is characterized by swelling due to abnormal transport of lymphatic fluid and thickening or hardening of the skin in affected areas. As fluid builds up, swelling occurs, usually in an arm or a leg, but can also affect other parts of the body. Lymphedema often causes long-term physical, psychological and social problems for patients and significantly impacts quality of life. There are currently no approved pharmacological treatments for lymphedema and the unmet medical need is high. 

Lymphedema can be either primary, meaning it is congenital or occurs on its own, or secondary, meaning it is caused by another disease or condition. Primary lymphedema is caused by the absence of certain lymph vessels at birth or by abnormalities in the lymphatic vessels. It can be divided into three forms, depending on age of onset. The prevalence of primary lymphedema is less than 200,000 in the United States and less than 5 in 10,000 

&#160;

Index to Financial Statements in the European Union, and expected to be eligible for orphan drug designation by regulatory authorities. Secondary lymphedema usually develops as a result of a blockage or interruption that alters the flow of lymph through the lymphatic system and can develop from an infection, malignancy, surgery, scar tissue formation, trauma, radiation, or other cancer treatment. 

Primary lymphedema and secondary lymphedema can both be debilitating disorders with negative impact on quality of life and a large unmet medical need exists for an effective therapy. There is no approved pharmacologic treatment for lymphedema. Available treatments include compression garments, massage and exercise. Several agents such as coumarin have been tested in investigator-initiated clinical trials but have shown no clinical efficacy. 

Preclinical LTB 4 Data in Lymphedema 

An animal model of lymphedema was used to mimic the physiological changes seen in lymphedema patients. In this model, acquired lymphedema was surgically induced in the tails of mice through the ablation of lymphatic trunks. As the tail volume increases, there is an accumulation of fibroblasts, fat cells and skin cells in the tail, and poor clearance of immune cells from the tail. As lymphedema is established in this model, the levels of LTB 4 in serum rise significantly. For surgical controls (sham animals), skin incision alone was performed without lymphatic cautery. Normal controls did not go under any surgical manipulation. When serum from human lymphedema patients was examined, the LTB 4 levels were also significantly (p&#60;0.0001) elevated compared to normal controls (control n=17, lymphedema patients n=8). 

&#160;

&#160; In animal models, ubenimex significantly reduced tail volume (p&#60;0.0001, sham n=13, saline n=14, ubenimex n=14). Sham surgery (placebo surgery) is a faked surgical intervention that omits the step thought to be therapeutically necessary. In clinical trials of surgical interventions, sham surgery is an important scientific control. This is because it isolates the specific effects of the treatment as opposed to the incidental effects caused by anesthesia, the incisional trauma, pre- and postoperative care, and the patient&#146;s perception of having had a regular operation. Thus, sham surgery serves an analogous purpose to placebo drugs, neutralizing biases such as the placebo effect.

Eiger&#146;s Planned Solution: Ubenimex for Lymphedema 

Clinical Plan 

Eiger in-licensed ubenimex from Nippon Kayaku in 2015 and has relied on Nippon Kayaku&#146;s prior Phase 1 clinical data and experience with ubenimex to understand safety. Eiger received approval for a U.S. IND in January 2016 of ubenimex in lymphedema and plans to begin enrolling a Phase 2 clinical trial in the first half of 2016. Eiger filed an additional IND for ubenimex in lymphedema with FDA in December 2015, which was approved to proceed. Eiger&#146;s Phase 2 clinical proof of concept trial for ubenimex in lymphedema will be called ULTRA ( U benimex L ymphedema T rial to R estore A ctivity). The trial is expected to enroll approximately 40 patients at Stanford with a goal to assess activity of ubenimex versus placebo. The primary endpoint is planned to be a measure of change in skin fold thickness from baseline. Secondary endpoints are expected to include change in limb volume from baseline and patient reported outcomes, including quality of life. Based on the proposed 

&#160;

Index to Financial Statements mechanism of action of ubenimex, as a potential anti-proliferative and a potential disease modifying agent, dosing in the planned trial is expected to be six months, which Eiger believes represents sufficient time to demonstrate activity. Eiger plans to initiate enrollment in its Phase 2 clinical proof of concept trial in the first half of 2016. 

Manufacturing 

Eiger currently contracts with third parties for the manufacturing of all of its product candidates for preclinical and clinical studies and intends to do so in the future. Eiger does not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of clinical trial quantities of its product candidates and has no plans to build its own clinical or commercial scale manufacturing capabilities. Eiger believes that the use of contracted manufacturing organization, or CMOs, eliminates the need for Eiger to directly invest in manufacturing facilities and equipment and additional staff. Although Eiger relies on contract manufacturers, Eiger&#146;s personnel and consultants have extensive manufacturing experience overseeing its CMOs. 

To date, Eiger&#146;s third-party manufacturers have met the manufacturing requirements for the product candidates. Eiger expects third-party manufacturers to be capable of providing sufficient quantities of its product candidates to meet anticipated full scale commercial demands but has not assessed these capabilities beyond the supply of clinical material. Eiger plans to identify commercial contract manufacturers as it moves its product candidates to Phase 3 clinical trials. Eiger believes there are alternate sources of manufacturing that could be identified and enabled to satisfy its clinical and commercial requirements, however Eiger cannot be certain that identifying and establishing alternative relationships with such sources can be successful, cost effective, or completed on a timely basis without significant delay in the development or commercialization of its product candidates. 

Lonafarnib 

The drug product for lonafarnib Phase 2 clinical studies for the treatment of HDV was manufactured by Merck. Merck is currently in the process of transferring 50 kilograms, or kg, of drug substance and the manufacturing technology for lonafarnib drug substance and drug product to Eiger. Eiger believes that the 50 kg of drug substance are sufficient to provide drug product for Phase 3 pivotal studies. Eiger is in the process of selecting CMOs to manufacturer lonafarnib drug substance and drug product for future clinical studies and commercial supply. 

Exendin 9-39 

The drug product for exendin (9-39) for the treatment of hypoglycemia associated with bariatric surgery for Phase 2 clinical studies are manufactured by a third party CMO. 

Ubenimex 

Nippon Kayaku manufactures the drug substance and drug product for ubenimex Phase 2 clinical studies for the treatment of PAH and lymphedema. Upon completion of Phase 2 clinical studies in PAH and lymphedema, Nippon Kayaku will transfer the manufacturing technology to Eiger and its CMOs, who will supply Phase 3 clinical trial materials and, if successful, commercial materials. 

Intellectual Property 

Eiger strives to protect those proprietary technologies it believes are important to its business. Eiger seeks and maintains, where available, patent protection for its product candidates including: composition of matter, method(s) of use, and process patents covering manufacture and/or formulation. Eiger has also licensed patents and patent applications that cover certain of its product candidates and/or their manufacture, use, or formulation. 

&#160;

Index to Financial Statements Eiger also relies, or plans to rely, on regulatory exclusivity, including orphan drug designation and New Chemical Entity (NCE) and Biologic License Application (BLA) exclusivities, as well as trade secrets and carefully monitors its proprietary information to protect all aspects of its business. 

Eiger plans to continue to expand its intellectual property portfolio by filing patent applications on new dosage forms, methods of treatment, and compositions of matter for its product candidates. Eiger files and prosecutes patent applications in the United States and Europe, and when appropriate, additional countries, including Japan, Korea and China. 

Eiger&#146;s success will depend significantly upon its ability to: (i) obtain and maintain patents and other exclusivity protections for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to its business; (ii) prosecute its patent applications to issue as patents and defend and enforce its patents; (iii) maintain its licenses to use intellectual property owned by others; (iv) preserve the confidentiality of its trade secrets, and (v) operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and other proprietary rights of others. In addition to maintaining its existing proprietary assets, Eiger seeks to strengthen its proprietary positions when economically reasonable to do so. Eiger&#146;s ability to augment its proprietary position relies on its: (i) know-how; (ii) ability to access technological innovations, and (iii) ability to in-license technology when appropriate. 

The patent positions of pharmaceutical/biotechnology companies like Eiger are generally uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific, and factual issues. In addition, the scope claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced during the patent prosecution process before any patent issues. After issuance of a patent, if the issued patent is challenged, then the courts can redefine the scope of the patent, including by invalidating some or all of the patent claims, or rendering the patent unenforceable in its entirety. Consequently, Eiger does not know with certainty whether patents will issue in each country where it or its licensors file patent applications, or if those patent applications, if ever issued, will issue with claims that cover Eiger&#146;s product candidates, or, even if they do issue, whether the patent or its relevant claims will remain enforceable upon challenge. Accordingly, Eiger cannot predict with certainty whether the patent applications it is currently pursuing will issue as patents in a particular jurisdiction or whether the claims of any issued patents will provide sufficient proprietary protection from potential competitors to make any of Eiger&#146;s products commercially successful. Any of Eiger&#146;s patents, including already issued in-licensed patents or any patents that may issue to Eiger or its licensors in the future, could be challenged, narrowed, circumvented, or invalidated by third parties.Newly filed patent applications in the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or the USPTO, and certain other patent offices are maintained in secrecy for a minimum of 18 months, and publications of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lag far behind the actual discoveries themselves. Further, the date of an invention is typically not publicly disclosed. For these reasons, Eiger cannot be certain that inventions claimed in pending patent applications were not invented by another party prior to Eiger&#146;s invention, or claimed in a patent application filed before the effective filing date of Eiger&#146;s applications, in either of which case the claims may not be patentable to Eiger. For certain applications with an effective filing date prior to March 13, 2013, Eiger may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the USPTO to determine priority of invention. Also, while Eiger is not currently participating in any interferences or post-grant challenge proceedings, such as patent oppositions, post-grant reexamination proceedings, inter partes review proceedings and patent litigation, that seek to invalidate claims of pending patent applications or issued patents, Eiger may have to participate in such proceedings in the future. Such proceedings could result in substantial cost, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to Eiger. 

The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries where they are issued. In most countries, the standard patent term for inventions relating to human drugs and their formulation and use is 20 years from the date of filing the first non-provisional patent or international application under the Patent Cooperation Treaty of 1970, or the PCT. 

&#160;

Index to Financial Statements Patent Protection of Eiger&#146;s Product Candidates 

Eiger&#146;s product candidates and/or their uses in one or more indications of interest to Eiger are covered by in-licensed patents and patent applications and by Eiger&#146;s own patent applications. 

Lonafarnib . Eiger has in-licensed from Merck a portfolio of patents that will expire before the anticipated launch date of the lonafarnib product candidate. Eiger has a PCT application that claims the use of lonafarnib in combination with ritonavir and/or optionally other drugs for the treatment of HDV infection. Eiger anticipates that this PCT will mature into patent applications in at least the United States, the European Patent Office (the &#147;EPO&#148;), and Japan. Any patents that issue from this PCT will expire in 2035, but a patent term extension (as described below) of up to 5 years is available in the United States, and Eiger expects lonafarnib to be eligible for this additional protection. In addition, Eiger expects lonafarnib to be eligible for NCE status, and lonafarnib has been granted orphan drug designation by the FDA and the EMA in this indication, which respectively provide five, seven and ten years of regulatory exclusivity. The PCT is an international patent law treaty that provides a single PCT application can be converted into a patent application in any of the more than 145 PCT contracting states, providing a cost-effective means for seeking patent protection in numerous regions or countries. Conversion of the PCT application into an application in any of the contracting states typically occurs about 30 months after a priority application is filed, or about 18 months after the PCT application filing date. An applicant must undertake prosecution within the allotted time in the patent offices of any, or a combination, of the contracting states or in a regional patent office it determines to undertake patent issuance in protection in such country or territory. Eiger has not yet determined the countries in which it will pursue potential patent protection from this PCT application, but even if Eiger determines to make such filings, its efforts may not result in the issuance of patents as a result. Even if no patents issue from this PCT, Eiger has filed other U.S. provisional applications, two of which were filed in April 2015, relating to combination dose forms of lonafarnib and ritonavir, and two relating to treating HDV with lonafarnib either alone and in combination with other agents filed in November 2015 and in February of this year. 

Exendin (9-39) . Eiger has in-licensed from Stanford two U.S. provisional applications that claim the use of exendin (9-39) and other agents in the treatment of hypoglycemia associated with bariatric surgery, including in post-bariatric surgery hypoglycemia. Eiger anticipates filing a PCT application in 2016 claiming priority to these two provisional applications. Any patents that issue from this PCT will expire in 2036, but patent term extension of up to 5 years is available in the United States, and Eiger expects exendin (9-39) to be eligible for this additional protection. In addition, Eiger expects exendin (9-39) to be eligible for orphan drug designation exclusivity and BLA exclusivity, which respectively provide seven years and twelve years of regulatory exclusivity in the United States. 

Ubenimex. 

PAH . Eiger has in-licensed from Stanford issued U.S. Patent No. 9,233,089 and a corresponding pending EPO application that claim the use of ubenimex and other agents in the treatment of PAH; a continuation application of the U.S. patent is also pending. Eiger has also in-licensed from Nippon Kayaku the exclusive right outside Asia to access its regulatory dossier for ubenimex, which Eiger believes to be a significant competitive advantage. U.S. Patent No. 9,233,089 (and from any patent that issues in the EPO or from any U.S. continuation) will expire in 2033, but may be extended as described below. 

Lymphedema . Eiger has in-licensed from Stanford a pending PCT application that claims the use of ubenimex in the treatment of lymphedema. Eiger has also in-licensed from Nippon Kayaku the exclusive right outside Asia to access its regulatory dossier for ubenimex. Any patents that issue from this PCT will expire in 2036, but may be extended as described below. 

Regulatory Exclusivity and Patent Term Extension . If ubenimex is approved in any indication, it would be entitled to NCE exclusivity, which would provide for five years of regulatory exclusivity for the approved 

&#160;

Index to Financial Statements product for the treatment of such indication. In addition, the FDA has granted orphan drug designation to ubenimex for the treatment of PAH, and Eiger is seeking orphan drug designation for ubenimex for the treatment of lymphedema. Orphan drug designation, if obtained, provides seven years of regulatory exclusivity for each indication. However, patent term extension, as described below, will potentially be available only for the first of the two indications, PAH and lymphedema, to be approved. 

Patent Term 

In the United States, the patent term for an FDA-approved drug may be eligible for a patent term extension, or a PTE. The Hatch-Waxman Act of 1984 permits restoration of a portion of the patent term of a U.S. patent as compensation for the patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process if approval of the application for the product is the first permitted commercial marketing of a drug or biological product containing the active ingredient. The length of the PTE is based on the length of time it takes for the drug to complete the pre-market regulatory approval requirements. The time required for approval of a NDA or BLA and 50% of the time spent in testing phase, reduced by any periods of lack of diligence, are creditedup to a maximum five year extension. The PTE cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval. Only one patent per approved drug may be extended and a patent can only be extended once; thus, even if a single patent is applicable to multiple products, it can only be extended based on one product. 

Similar provisions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug may be available in certain other foreign jurisdictions. For example, in Europe, a supplementary protection certificate (SPC), if granted, may extend certain patent rights for up to 5 years. In addition, in Europe, marketing approval obtained through the European Medicines Agency (EMA) may provide a period of ten years of regulatory data exclusivity from the time of approval. When possible, depending upon the length of clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of NDAs and BLAs for its products, Eiger expects to apply for patent term extension for patents covering its product candidates and their methods of use both in the United States and any foreign jurisdiction where available. There is no guarantee, however, that the applicable authorities will agree to grant extensions, and if granted, what the length of those extensions will be. 

Other Proprietary Rights and Processes 

Eiger also relies on trade secret protection for some of its confidential and proprietary information. It is Eiger&#146;s policy to require its employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with Eiger. These agreements provide that all confidential information concerning Eiger&#146;s business, scientific, development or financial affairs that are either developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual&#146;s relationship with Eiger are to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. Although Eiger takes steps to protect its proprietary information and trade secrets, including through contractual means with its employees and consultants, third parties may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to Eiger&#146;s trade secrets and disclose its technology. If these events happen, Eiger may not be able to meaningfully protect its trade secrets. 

Eiger&#146;s agreements with employees also provide that all inventions conceived by the employee in the course of employment with Eiger or based on the employee&#146;s use of Eiger&#146;s confidential information are Eiger&#146;s exclusive property or that Eiger has an exclusive royalty free license to use such technology. 

Competition 

The biopharmaceutical industry is highly competitive. Eiger faces competition from major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies worldwide. Given the significant 

&#160;

Index to Financial Statements unmet medical need for novel therapies to treat chronic hepatitis delta infection, post-bariatric surgery-induced hypoglycemia associated with bariatric surgery, PAH and lymphedema , these conditions are where various treatments from many companies are used and where many public and private universities and research organizations are actively engaged in the discovery, research and development of product candidates. As a result, there are and will likely continue to be extensive resources invested in the discovery and development of new products to treat these unmet medical needs. Eiger anticipates facing intense and increasing competition as new products enter the market and advanced technologies become available. 

In addition, there are numerous multinational pharmaceutical companies and large biotechnology companies currently marketing or pursuing the development of products or product candidates targeting the same indications as Eiger&#146;s product candidates. Many of Eiger&#146;s competitors, either alone or with strategic partners, have or will have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than Eiger. Accordingly, Eiger&#146;s competitors may be more successful than Eiger in developing or marketing products and technologies that are more effective, safer or less costly. Additionally, Eiger&#146;s competitors may obtain regulatory approval for their products more rapidly and may achieve more widespread market acceptance. Accelerated mergers and acquisitions activity in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of Eiger&#146;s competitors. These companies also compete with Eiger in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical study sites and patient registration for clinical studies and acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, Eiger&#146;s programs. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. 

Eiger&#146;s potential competitors and the related stage of development of their product candidates in target indications is as follows: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Hepatitis delta virus: Replicor, Inc. (Phase 2), Hepatera Ltd (Phase 2), Alnylam Pharmaceutical, Inc. (preclinical), Arbutus Biopharma (preclinical) and Arrowhead Research Corporation (preclinical); &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Hypoglycemia associated with bariatric surgery: Xoma Corporation (Phase 1); &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Pulmonary arterial hypertension: Gilead Sciences, Inc. (Phase 2), Reata Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Phase 2), AADi LLC (Phase 1), United Therapeutics Corporation (Phase 1) and Arena Pharmaceuticals (Phase 2); and &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Lymphedema: Novartis (Phase 2). There are other therapies that are used or may be used for Eiger&#146;s targeted indications, however Eiger does not believe that these therapies are potentially curative for Eiger&#146;s targeted indications. For example, there are a number of therapies used for symptomatic relief of PAH such as calcium channel blockers and diuretics as well as vasodilators. Other products in clinical development or marketed for other indications may be used in competition with Eiger&#146;s product candidates if Eiger is able to identify potential market opportunities of interest. For example, HDV has not been generally identified as a target for development compared to hepatitis B or hepatitis C, and products on the market or in development for those indications may potentially be tested in HDV as the understanding of the potential medical need for therapies in this indication become more widely understood. 

Eiger believes that the key competitive factors that will affect the development and commercial success of its product candidates are efficacy, safety and tolerability profile, convenience in dosing, product labeling, cost-effectiveness, price, the level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from the government and other third-parties. Eiger&#146;s commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated for any of its products if its competitors have products that are approved earlier than Eiger&#146;s product candidates or are superior compared to Eiger&#146;s product candidates or if Eiger&#146;s product candidates do not result in an improvement in condition compared to those other products. 

&#160;

Index to Financial Statements License and Asset Purchase Agreements 

License Agreement with Merck 

In September 2010, Eiger entered a License Agreement with Merck, dated September 3, 2010, or the Merck License Agreement. 

Under the Merck License Agreement, Merck granted Eiger an exclusive, worldwide license to develop, manufacture, and sell products containing the compounds Sarasar &#174; (lonafarnib) for the treatment of all human viruses except certain specified viruses such as hepatitis B and hepatitis C alone. 

Eiger is responsible for the manufacture, development, and commercialization of the product at its cost and expense, and is obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize the product in the licensed field; provided however, that Merck agreed to provide sufficient product, free of charge, for Eiger to complete the proof of concept trial. 

Under the Merck License Agreement, Eiger provided Merck a $500,000 equity interest in EB Pharma, LLC, its wholly-owned subsidiary, which has an obligation to make development milestone payments in aggregate of up to $27.0 million, and pay a tiered royalty, ranging from mid single to low double digits, based on increasing tiered levels of aggregate annual net sales of all licensed products. 

The Merck License will continue for so long as Eiger owes royalty payments to Merck under the agreement. Each party has the right to terminate the Merck License Agreement for the other party&#146;s uncured material breach or bankruptcy. Merck also has the right to terminate the agreement if Eiger discontinues development and commercialization of lonafarnib for a specified period of time. In addition, Eiger has the right to terminate the agreement, with notice, for any reason. 

Asset Purchase Agreement with Eiger Group International, Inc. 

In December 2010, Eiger entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Eiger Group International, Inc., or EGI, dated December 8, 2010, or the EGI APA. Dr. Jeffrey Glenn is the sole owner of EGI. 

Under the EGI APA, Eiger purchased all intellectual property rights regarding the use of farnesyl transferase inhibitors as anti-viral agents and methods to treat viral infection with those inhibitors. Eiger also purchased all intellectual property rights regarding the use of inhibitors of prenylation, prenyl cysteine methyltransferase, and a specified protease as anti-viral agents and methods to treat viral infection with those inhibitors. Eiger is obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize the licensed products in major markets. 

Under the EGI APA, Eiger paid EGI an upfront payment of $350,000. Additionally, Eiger is obligated to pay EGI a low single-digit royalty based on aggregate annual net sales of products developed using the intellectual property. Eiger&#146;s obligation to pay EGI royalties on a product ends when that product is no longer sold in a country. 

The term of the EGI APA extends until expiration of all payment obligations, and Eiger may terminate the agreement upon notice to EGI. EGI may terminate the EGI APA if Eiger fails to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize licensed products. In addition, each party may terminate the EGI APA for the other party&#146;s uncured material breach or bankruptcy. In the event of any termination, other than termination by Eiger for EGI&#146;s breach, Eiger will assign the purchased assets back to EGI. 

License Agreement with Janssen Pharmaceutica NV 

In December 2014, Eiger, through its wholly-owned subsidiary EB Pharma, LLC, or EBP, entered a License Agreement, or the Janssen License Agreement, with Janssen Pharmaceutica NV, or Janssen, dated December 19, 2014. 

&#160;

Index to Financial Statements Under the Janssen License Agreement, Janssen granted Eiger an exclusive, worldwide, license to develop, manufacture, and sell products containing the compound tipifarnib for all therapeutic and diagnostic uses in humans, including any such uses for human virology diseases, but excluding oncology diseases. 

Eiger is responsible for the development of at least one product in a major market country and for commercialization of products in all countries where necessary authorization is obtained, both at Eiger&#146;s cost and expense. Eiger may manufacture, develop, and commercialize the products itself or it may grant one or more sublicenses for such purposes. However, for a period of time following completion of the proof of concept trial, Janssen has a first right of negotiation for an exclusive license back from Eiger to develop and commercialize tipifarnib in any country in the world. 

Under the Janssen License Agreement, Eiger is obligated to make development milestone payments in aggregate of up to $38.0 million, sales milestone payments in aggregate of up to $65.8 million, and pay a tiered royalty, ranging from the mid single to low double digits, based on aggregate annual net sales of all licensed products. If Eiger grants a sublicense, Eiger is obligated to pay Janssen a portion of the sublicensing income received. 

The Janssen License Agreement will continue for so long as Eiger owes royalty payments to Janssen under the agreement or for so long as there is a valid patent claim under the agreement, whichever is longer. Both parties have the right to terminate the agreement for the other party&#146;s uncured material breach of the agreement or for the other party&#146;s bankruptcy. Janssen also has the right to terminate the agreement if Eiger fails to meet certain specified diligence obligations. In addition, Eiger has the right to terminate the agreement without cause at any time. 

License Agreement with Nippon Kayaku Co., Ltd. 

In May 2015, Eiccose, LLC, or Eiccose, and Nippon Kayaku Co., Ltd, or NK, entered into a License Agreement, or NK License, dated May 1, 2015 pursuant to which NK granted Eiccose an exclusive license to develop, manufacture, and sell ubenimex outside certain identified Asia countries, including Japan, for the treatment of PAH and other inflammatory disease involving leukotriene B4. Eiccose assigned the NK License to Eiger as part of the Eiccose asset purchase described below. 

Under the NK License, Eiger is responsible for the development and commercialization of ubenimex in its territory at its cost and expense. Eiger will purchase ubenimex for development and commercial use from NK at agreed transfer prices under a separate supply agreement, but Eiger has the option to manufacture and supply the product for Phase 3 studies and/or commercial use. If Eiger exercises the manufacturing option, NK will transfer the manufacture of the product to Eiger or Eiger&#146;s contract manufacturer, at Eiger&#146;s cost and expense, and Eiger will pay NK a running, mid, single-digit royalty on the net sales of ubenimex sold in Eiger&#146;s territory or, if the parties agree, a lump-sum payment, for the use of NK&#146;s manufacturing know-how. 

Under the NK License, Eiger also granted back to NK an exclusive license to develop, manufacture, and sell ubenimex for the treatment of PAH and other inflammatory disease involving leukotriene B4 in the Asia countries comprising the NK territory. NK is responsible for the development and commercialization of ubenimex in the licensed indications in its territory at its own cost and expense. NK will pay Eiger a running, mid, single-digit royalty on net sales of ubenimex in the specified indications in NK&#146;s territory. 

The NK License Agreement will continue for so long as the parties and their sublicensees continue to develop and commercialize ubenimex for the treatment of PAH and other inflammatory disease involving leukotriene B4. Both parties have the right to terminate the agreement for the other party&#146;s uncured material breach, and NK also has the right to terminate the agreement if Eiger fails to meet certain specified diligence obligations. In addition, the parties may terminate the agreement if further development of the product is commercially, financially, or otherwise not advisable. 

&#160;

Index to Financial Statements Asset Purchase Agreement with Tracey McLaughlin and Colleen Craig 

In September 2015, Eiger entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with two individuals, Drs. Tracey McLaughlin and Colleen Craig, or the Sellers, dated September 25, 2015, or the Exendin APA. 

Under the Exendin APA, Eiger purchased all intellectual property rights from the Sellers, including an assignment of a license agreement with Stanford which covered exclusive rights with respect to the compound exendin. Under the assigned Stanford exclusive license agreement, Eiger is obligated to pay Stanford a low, single-digit royalty on net sales. 

Under the Exendin APA, Eiger is obligated to pay to each of the Sellers milestone payments in aggregate up to $1.0 million and a low, single-digit royalty based on aggregate annual net sales of all products developed based on exendin. Eiger also agreed to retain each of the Sellers pursuant to a consulting agreement with a term of one year, subject to annual renewal. 

Asset Purchase Agreement with Eiccose, LLC 

In October 2015, Eiger entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement, or the Eiccose APA, with Eiccose. David Cory, the President, Chief Executive Officer and a director of Eiger, is a managing member and significant equity interest holder of Eiccose. 

Under the Eiccose APA, Eiger purchased all intellectual property rights with respect to ubenimex from Eiccose. Specifically, under the Eiccose APA, Eiccose assigned to Eiger the exclusive license agreement regarding ubenimex between Eiccose and Nippon Kayaku Co., Ltd., or the NK License. Eiger also purchased intellectual property rights related to Stanford Docket S11-438&#151;Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension and Stanford Docket S14-323&#151;Lymphedema, and Eiccose assigned to Eiger the exclusive license agreements between Eiccose and the Board of Trustees of Stanford regarding these two Stanford Dockets, or the Stanford Licenses. 

Under the Eiccose APA, Eiger also paid to Eiccose a total of $119,673, representing reimbursement of certain specified expenses, including payments and accrued amounts owed under the Stanford Licenses for previously incurred patent expenses and costs related to the negotiation and assignment of the Stanford Licenses. Under the terms of the Eiccose APA, at the closing of the next round of financing pursuant to which Eiger sells shares of its preferred stock (or if there is no preferred stock, then common stock) resulting in gross proceeds to Eiger of at least $25.0 million, Eiger committed to issue to Eiccose the number of fully vested shares of Eiger&#146;s common stock equal to 1.75% of the total number of Eiger&#146;s outstanding capital stock following the first closing of such financing, which is expected to be issued upon the closing of the merger. Under the terms of the Eiccose APA, Eiger is further required to pay Eiccose milestone payments totaling up to $10.0 million after achievement of specified milestones. Eiger is also required to pay Eiccose royalties at a rate in the low single digits based on the net sales of the first pharmaceutical product sold to an independent third party that contains or uses ubenimex. 

Exclusive Agreement with the Board of Trustees of the Leland Stanford Junior University&#151;Lymphedema 

In October 2015, as part of the assets Eiger purchased from Eiccose, Eiger acquired and was assigned an Exclusive Agreement, or the Stanford Lymphedema Agreement, between Eiccose and the Board of Trustees of Stanford dated October 27, 2015. 

Under the Stanford Lymphedema Agreement, Stanford granted Eiger an exclusive, worldwide license under specified patent rights related to the treatment of lymphedema, to manufacture, use, and sell products covered by the licensed patents for all uses. 

Eiger is responsible for the development and commercialization of any products under the license at its cost and expense, and is obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to achieve certain specified milestones. In 

&#160;

Index to Financial Statements consideration of the license, Eiger paid to Stanford a low, single-digit equity interest and is obligated to make milestone payments in aggregate of up to $1.5 million as well as a low, single-digit royalty on net sales of any products. 

Stanford may terminate the agreement for Eiger&#146;s uncured material breach or bankruptcy. Stanford also has the right to terminate the agreement if Eiger fails to develop and commercialize products in accordance with certain specified diligence obligations. Eiger has the right to terminate the agreement without cause at any time. 

Exclusive Agreement with the Board of Trustees of the Leland Stanford Junior University&#151;PAH 

In October 2015, as part of the assets Eiger purchased from Eiccose, Eiger also acquired an Exclusive Agreement between Eiccose and Stanford, dated May 1, 2015, or the Stanford PAH Agreement. 

Under the Stanford PAH Agreement, Stanford granted Eiger an exclusive, worldwide license under specified patent rights related to the treatment of PAH and improved right ventricle function, to manufacture, use, and sell products covered by the licensed patents for all uses. Stanford and other non-profit research institutions retain the right to practice under the licensed patents for any non-profit purpose. 

Eiger is responsible for the development and commercialization of the products at its cost and expense, and is obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to achieve certain specified milestones. Eiger may satisfy these requirements itself, through its affiliates, or through granting one or more sublicenses. Eiger is obligated to give Stanford a low, single-digit equity interest, make milestone payments in aggregate of up to $1.5 million, and pay a low, single-digit royalty on net sales of the products. If Eiger grants a sublicense, it will pay Stanford a portion of the sublicensing income received. 

Stanford may terminate the agreement for Eiger&#146;s uncured material breach or bankruptcy. Stanford also has the right to terminate the agreement if Eiger fails to develop and commercialize products in accordance with certain specified diligence obligations. Eiger has the right to terminate the agreement, with notice, for any reason. 

Government Regulations and Product Approvals 

Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, import and export of pharmaceutical products such as those Eiger is developing. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. 

FDA Approval Process 

All of Eiger&#146;s current product candidates are subject to regulation in the United States by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDC Act, and its implementing regulations. The FDA subjects drugs to extensive pre and post market regulation. Failure to comply with the FDC Act and other federal and state statutes and regulations may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending NDAs, withdrawal of approvals, clinical holds, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal penalties. 

FDA approval is required before any new unapproved drug or dosage form, including a new use of a previously approved drug, can be marketed in the United States. The process required by the FDA before a new drug may be marketed in the United States is long, expensive, and inherently uncertain. Drug development in the United States typically involves completion of preclinical laboratory and animal tests, submission to the FDA of 

&#160;

Index to Financial Statements an Investigational New Drug application, or IND, which must become effective before clinical testing may commence, approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated, performance of adequate and well controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the drug for each indication for which FDA approval is sought, submission to the FDA of an NDA, satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced, and FDA review and approval of the NDA. Developing the data to satisfy FDA pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity, and novelty of the product, disease or indication. 

Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of the product&#146;s chemistry, formulation, and toxicity, as well as animal studies to characterize and assess the potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including good laboratory practice, or GLP, regulations. These preclinical results are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including information about the product&#146;s chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long term preclinical studies including reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity may be initiated or continue after the IND is submitted. 

An IND must become effective before United States clinical trials may begin. A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If the FDA has neither commented on nor questioned the IND within this 30-day period, the IND automatically becomes effective and the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin. If the FDA does raise any concerns or questions and places the clinical trial on a clinical hold, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, a submission of an IND may not result in FDA authorization to commence a clinical trial. A separate submission to an existing IND must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development. 

Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to human subjects under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted: (i) in compliance with federal regulations, including good clinical practice, or GCP, requirements for conducting, monitoring, recording and reporting the results of clinical trials, in order to ensure that the data and results are scientifically credible and accurate and that the trial subjects are adequately informed of the potential risks of participating in clinical trials; and (ii) with protocols that detail, among other things, the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. 

The FDA may order the temporary, or permanent, discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. The study protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be submitted to and approved by an IRB at each study site before the study commences at that site and the IRB must monitor the clinical trial until it is completed. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at that site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB&#146;s requirements or if the drug candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients, or the IRB may impose other conditions. The study sponsor or the FDA may also suspend or discontinue a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a determination that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. 

Clinical trials to support an NDA for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, although there is leeway to overlap or combine these phases. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Phase 1. The drug candidate is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition, and is tested to assess safety, dosage tolerance, pharmacokinetics and pharmacological activity, and, when possible, to ascertain evidence of efficacy. The drug candidate 

&#160;

Index to Financial Statements &#160; may also be tested in patients with severe or life-threatening diseases to gain an early indication of its effectiveness. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Phase 2. The trials are conducted using a limited patient population for the purposes of preliminarily determining the effectiveness of the drug in that particular indication, ascertaining dosage tolerance, discerning the optimal dosage, and identifying possible adverse effects and safety risks. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Phase 3. If a compound demonstrates evidence of efficacy and has an acceptable safety profile in the Phase 2 clinical trials, then Phase 3 clinical trials are undertaken to obtain additional information from an expanded and diverse patient population, at multiple, geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in randomized controlled studies often with a double-blind design to maximize the reproducibility of the study results. Typically, a minimum of two positive Phase 3 clinical trials are submitted to support the product&#146;s marketing application. These Phase 3 clinical trials are intended to provide sufficient data demonstrating evidence of the efficacy and safety of the drug such that the FDA can evaluate the overall benefit-risk of the drug and provide adequate information for the labeling and package insert for the drug. Trials conducted outside of the United States under similar, GCP-compliant conditions in accordance with local applicable laws may also be acceptable to FDA in support of product approval. Sponsors of clinical trials for investigational drugs must publicly disclose certain clinical trial information, including detailed trial design. These requirements are subject to specific timelines and apply to most Phase 3 clinical trials of FDA-regulated products. 

In some cases, FDA may condition approval of an NDA for a product candidate on the sponsor&#146;s agreement to conduct additional clinical trials after NDA approval. In other cases, a sponsor may voluntarily conduct additional clinical trials post approval to gain more information about the drug. Such post approval trials are typically referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials. 

Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study. Phase 1, Phase 2, Phase 3 and Phase 4 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. 

Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually finalize a process for manufacturing the drug in commercial quantities in accordance with current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 

After completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA is prepared and submitted to the FDA requesting approval to market the drug for one or more specified indications. FDA review and approval of the NDA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the United States. The NDA must include the results of all preclinical, clinical, and other testing, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with other detailed information including compilation of data relating to the product&#146;s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture, and controls. The NDA must also contain extensive manufacturing information. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a drug is safe and effective for its intended use. The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA is substantial. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs is subject to both a substantial application user fee and annual product and establishment user fees. The sum of these fees may total several million dollars and they are typically increased annually. 

&#160;

Index to Financial Statements The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency&#146;s threshold determination that the application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. 

Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of NDAs. Standard NDAs are generally reviewed within ten months of filing, or twelve months from submission. Although FDA often meets its user fee performance goals, the FDA can extend these timelines if necessary, and FDA review may not occur on a timely basis. The FDA usually refers applications for novel drugs, or drugs that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an advisory committee&#151;a panel of independent experts, typically including clinicians and other scientific experts&#151;for review, evaluation, and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of the advisory committee, but it generally follows its recommendations. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one, or more, clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it verifies that compliance with cGMP requirements is satisfactory and that the manufacturing processes and facilities are adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. The FDA will not approve a drug unless the application contains data showing substantial evidence that it is safe and effective in the indication studied. 

After the FDA evaluates the NDA and conducts its inspections, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies contained in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application, including potentially significant, expensive and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, nonclinical studies or manufacturing. Even if such data are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data from clinical trials are not always conclusive, and the FDA may interpret data differently than Eiger does. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA&#146;s satisfaction in a resubmission of the application, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of additional information requested. FDA approval is never guaranteed. The FDA may refuse to approve an NDA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied. 

An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. The approval for a drug may be significantly more limited than requested in the application, including limitations on the specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. The FDA may also require that certain contraindications, warnings, or precautions be included in the product&#146;s package insert, or labeling. 

In addition, as a condition of approval, the FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, to help ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guidelines, communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use, or ETASU. ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing-including dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. The requirement for a REMS or use of a companion diagnostic with a drug can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the drug. Moreover, product approval may require, as a condition of approval, substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug&#146;s safety or efficacy. The FDA may also condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling or development of adequate controls and specifications. 

Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards are not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing. In addition, after approval, some types of 

&#160;

Index to Financial Statements changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes, and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data. 

Orphan Drugs 

Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant an orphan drug designation to products intended to treat a rare disease or condition&#151;generally one that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting the NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the FDA publicly discloses the drug&#146;s identity and its intended orphan use. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. The first NCE to be approved to treat a disease with FDA&#146;s orphan drug designation is entitled to a seven-year period of marketing exclusivity in the United States for that product, for that indication. During the seven-year exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same orphan indication, regardless of patent status, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity or if the FDA finds that the holder of the orphan exclusivity has not shown that it can assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the orphan drug to meet the needs of patients with the disease or condition for which the drug was designated. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different chemical/biological entity for the same disease or condition. An orphan drug designation also does not preclude the same drug from being developed for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research expenses and a waiver of the NDA application user fee. 

Advertising and Promotion 

Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing post-approval regulatory requirements. For instance, the FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of drugs, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the Internet. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in adverse publicity as well as significant penalties, including the issuance of warning letters directing a company to correct any deviations from the FDA&#146;s standards. The FDA may also impose a requirement that future advertising and promotional materials be pre-cleared by the FDA, and the company may face federal and/or state civil and criminal investigations and prosecutions. 

Drugs may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement before the change can be implemented. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs. Obtaining new indication is an important part of managing the life cycle of the drug. 

Adverse Event Reporting and cGMP Compliance 

Recordkeeping, adverse event reporting and the submission of periodic reports are required following the FDA&#146;s approval of an NDA. The FDA also may require post-marketing testing or Phase 4 clinical trials, REMS, or surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved drug. In addition, the FDA may place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. Furthermore, manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage and distribution procedures must continue to conform to cGMPs after approval. Manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state 

&#160;

Index to Financial Statements agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies to assess compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMPs. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP requirements and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the areas of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMPs. Failure to comply with the statutory and regulatory requirements can subject a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, such as warning letters, suspension of manufacturing, seizure of product, injunctive action or possible civil penalties. Eiger cannot be certain that it or its present or future third-party manufacturers or suppliers will be able to comply with the cGMP regulations and other ongoing FDA regulatory requirements. If Eiger or its present or future third-party manufacturers or suppliers are not able to comply with these requirements, the FDA may halt Eiger&#146;s clinical trials, require Eiger to recall a drug from distribution or withdraw approval of the NDA for that drug. Regulatory authorities may also withdraw product approvals, request product recalls, or impose marketing restrictions through labeling changes or product removals upon discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes. 

Companion Diagnostics 

In vitro diagnostics, or IVDs, are a type of medical device that are intended to detect diseases, conditions, infections, biomarkers, or the presence of specific genetic alleles. If the safe and effective use of a drug requires an IVD, the FDA generally will demand clearance or approval of the companion diagnostic at the same time they approve the therapeutic. The FDA has required in vitro companion diagnostics to obtain premarket clearance or approval simultaneously with drug approval if the diagnostic is intended to identify those patients most likely to respond to drug treatment. Accordingly, a required companion diagnostic has the potential to delay approval of the drug. 

In the United States, the FDC Act and its implementing regulations, and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, the design and development, preclinical and clinical testing, premarket clearance or approval, registration and listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, export and import, and post-market surveillance of medical devices, including IVDs. Unless an exemption applies, diagnostic tests require marketing clearance or approval from the FDA prior to commercial distribution. The two primary types of FDA marketing authorization applicable to a medical device are premarket notification, also called 510(k) clearance, and approval of a premarket approval application, or PMA. The FDA classifies all medical devices into one of three classes. Devices deemed to pose lower risk are categorized as either Class I or II, which requires the manufacturer to submit to the FDA a 510(k) pre-market notification requesting clearance of the device for commercial distribution in the United States, unless an exemption applies. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, or devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a previously 510(k)-cleared device are categorized as Class III, requiring a PMA. 

To obtain 510(k) clearance for a medical device, a pre-market notification must be submitted to the FDA demonstrating that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to a previously 510(k)-cleared device or a device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976 for which FDA has not yet called for the submission of a PMA, or the device must be one that has been reclassified from Class III to either Class II or I. The 510(k) clearance process usually takes from three to twelve months from the date the application is submitted and filed with the FDA, but may take significantly longer and clearance is never assured. Although many 510(k) pre-market notifications are cleared without clinical data, in some cases, the FDA requires significant clinical data to support substantial equivalence. In reviewing a pre-market notification, the FDA may request additional information, including clinical data, which may significantly prolong the review process. After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any subsequent modification of the device that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) 

&#160;

Index to Financial Statements clearance or could require pre-market approval. The FDA requires each manufacturer to make this determination initially, but the FDA may review any such decision and may disagree with a manufacturer&#146;s determination. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer&#146;s determination, the FDA may require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or a PMA is obtained. 

PMAs must be supported by valid scientific evidence, which typically requires extensive data, including technical, preclinical, clinical and manufacturing data, to demonstrate to the FDA&#146;s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the device. For diagnostic tests, a PMA typically includes data regarding analytical and clinical validation studies. As part of its review of the PMA, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities to ensure compliance with the Quality System Regulation, or QSR, which requires manufacturers to follow design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures. FDA review of an initial PMA is required by statute to take between six to ten months, although the process typically takes longer, and may require several years to complete. If the FDA evaluations of both the PMA and the manufacturing facilities are favorable, the FDA will either issue an approval letter or an approvable letter, which usually contains a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure the final approval of the PMA. If the FDA&#146;s evaluation of the PMA or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, the FDA will deny approval of the PMA or issue a not approvable letter. A not approvable letter will outline the deficiencies in the application and, where practical, will identify what is necessary to make the PMA approvable. The FDA may also determine that additional clinical trials are necessary, in which case the PMA approval may be delayed for several months or years while the trials are conducted and then the data submitted in an amendment to the PMA. Once granted, PMA approval may be withdrawn by the FDA if compliance with post approval requirements, conditions of approval or other regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing. 

Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements 

In the United States, Eiger&#146;s activities are potentially subject to regulation by federal, state, and local authorities in addition to the FDA. These other agencies include, without limitation, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the U.S. Department of Justice and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the Department of Justice, as well as state and local governments. Such agencies enforce a variety of laws, including without limitation, anti-kickback and false claims laws, data privacy and security laws, and physician payment transparency laws. 

The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease or order of any good, facility, item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term &#147;remuneration&#148; has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. Several courts have interpreted the statute&#146;s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the Anti-Kickback Statute has been violated. 

Additionally, the intent standard under the Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or the ACA, to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the 

&#160;

Index to Financial Statements statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, ACA codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. 

The federal civil False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment to or approval by the federal government or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. A claim includes &#147;any request or demand&#148; for money or property presented to the U.S. government. Several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for, among other things, allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies&#146; marketing of products for unapproved, and thus non-reimbursable, uses. In addition, the civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person or entity that, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. 

The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Like the Anti-Kickback Statute, ACA broadened the reach of certain criminal healthcare fraud statutes created under HIPAA by amending the intent requirement such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. 

Also, many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of payor, in addition to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs. 

Eiger may be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which Eiger conducts its business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, including the final Omnibus Rule published on January 25, 2013, imposes specified requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA&#146;s security standards directly applicable to business associates, defined as service providers of covered entities that create, receive, maintain or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys&#146; fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, many state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from HIPAA and each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. 

In addition, there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians and other healthcare providers. ACA imposed, among other things, new annual reporting requirements for covered manufacturers for certain payments and &#147;transfers of value&#148; provided to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to submit timely, accurately and completely the required information for all payments, transfers of value and ownership or investment interests may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $150,000 per year and up to an aggregate of $1 million per year for &#147;knowing failures.&#148; Covered manufacturers were required to begin collecting data on August 1, 2013 and submit reports on aggregate payment data to the government for the first reporting period (August 1, 2013&#151;December 31, 2013) by March 31, 2014, 

&#160;

Index to Financial Statements and were required to report detailed payment data for the first reporting period and submit legal attestation to the completeness and accuracy of such data by June 30, 2014. Thereafter, covered manufacturers must submit reports by the 90th day of each subsequent calendar year. In addition, certain states require implementation of commercial compliance programs and compliance with the pharmaceutical industry&#146;s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, impose restrictions on marketing practices, and/or tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration or items of value provided to physicians and other healthcare professionals and entities. 

If Eiger&#146;s operations are found to be in violation of any of the health regulatory laws described above or any other laws that apply to it, Eiger may be subject to penalties, including potentially significant criminal, civil and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of its operations, any of which could adversely affect Eiger&#146;s ability to operate its business and its results of operations. 

International Regulation 

In addition to regulations in the United States, a variety of foreign regulations govern clinical trials, commercial sales, and distribution of drugs. Whether or not Eiger obtains FDA approval for a drug, Eiger or its collaborators must obtain approval of the drug by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before commencing clinical trials or marketing of the drug in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and the time to approve may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. Further, to the extent that any of Eiger&#146;s products are sold in a foreign country, Eiger may be subject to additional foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals. 

Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement 

In the United States and other countries, patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Patients are unlikely to use Eiger&#146;s products unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of its products. Sales of any products for which Eiger receives regulatory approval for commercial sale will therefore depend in part on the availability of reimbursement from third-party payors, including government health administrative authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers, and other organizations. 

The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a drug product typically is separate from the process for setting the price of a drug product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the drug product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. A decision by a third-party payor not to cover Eiger&#146;s product candidates could reduce physician utilization of Eiger&#146;s products once approved and have a material adverse effect on Eiger&#146;s sales, results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, a third-party payor&#146;s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable Eiger to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on Eiger&#146;s investment in product development. Additionally, coverage and reimbursement for drug products can differ significantly from payor to payor. One third-party payor&#146;s decision to cover a particular medical product or service does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the medical product or service, or will provide coverage at an adequate reimbursement rate. As a result, the coverage determination process will require Eiger to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of its products to each payor separately and will be a time-consuming process.

Index to Financial Statements The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of drug products and medical services, in addition to questioning safety and efficacy. If these third-party payors do not consider Eiger&#146;s products to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover Eiger&#146;s products after FDA approval or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow Eiger to sell its products at a profit. 

In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on coverage and reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. By way of example, in the United States, ACA contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of drug products. The ACA, among other things, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by most manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, extended the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to utilization of prescriptions for individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care plans, imposed mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries and subjected manufacturers to new annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies&#146; share of sales to federal healthcare programs. Eiger expects that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for Eiger&#146;s products once approved or additional pricing pressures. 

Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since ACA was enacted. On August 2, 2011, the President signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend to Congress proposals in spending reductions. The Joint Select Committee did not recommend and Congress did not enact legislation to reduce the deficit by at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, triggering the legislation&#146;s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and will remain in effect through 2024 unless additional Congressional action is taken. On January 2, 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers.
