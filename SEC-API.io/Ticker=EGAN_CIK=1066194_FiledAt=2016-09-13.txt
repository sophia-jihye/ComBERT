Industry Background 

As products get commoditized in a global economy and a digital world, customer loyalty increasingly depends on customer engagement. For businesses that sell to consumers, or B2C companies, one poor customer experience can be amplified and spread overnight through social networks. Today&#8217;s digital consumers expect businesses to serve them conveniently and intelligently across traditional and new touch points. They are more demanding, and they spend more than the average customer. Not surprisingly, businesses are looking for efficient, scalable solutions to deliver smart customer experiences that are easy, quick and helpful. 

Traditional customer relationship management, or CRM, solutions are not designed for the digital world. Mostly, they view the phone as the primary customer interaction channel. Digital channels like web, mobile and social are seen as secondary and are often not designed in the solution from the start. As a result, customer experience delivered through these platforms tends to be fragmented and inconsistent across channels. For instance, unified customer history across channels typically requires significant backend integration and user interface patchwork. Moreover, these CRM tools do not leverage the power of knowledge, AI and analytics to automate or optimize customer journey and agent capability. 

The eGain Solution 

Our solution is designed to make it easy for B2C businesses to do business with their customers. We provide our clients with the following benefits: 

&#183; 

Build profitable long-term customer relationships . Customers are spending more time conducting business on the web, mobile and social channels. Our solution helps businesses design brand-aligned, omnichannel customer journeys that are easy, quick and helpful. Whether a customer is looking to buy, ask a question, or pay a bill, our solution helps businesses provide customers personalized, guided and consistent responses. As a result, businesses improve their customer satisfaction and NPS scores. 

&#183; 

Reduce operating costs through improved agent productivity and self-service automation . Our solution helps companies provide highly effective customer service while reducing operating costs. Intelligent routing, auto-response, tracking, and reporting features, complemented with agent-facing knowledge tools, measurably enhance the productivity of service agents. AI-based process guidance reduces time to competence for agents, while ensuring compliance with policy and regulation in consumer interactions. Robust customer self-service tools fronted by chatbots, guided by AI, and scaffolded with context-aware escalation paths reduce cost of service without compromising customer effort. 

&#183; 

Increase revenue through intelligent offers and contextual promotions. Our solution also helps businesses convert more website visitors into buyers, reduce shopping cart abandonment and increase average order value. It enables agents to contextually up-sell and cross-sell products in the course of customer interactions. A visitor to a website using eGain can be proactively offered personalized promotions or real-time assistance, based on configurable business rules informed by visitor behavior and history. Visitors can collaborate with 

&#160;

a customer service agent live over the web through click-to-call, text and video chat, and cobrowse to inquire about and buy a product. Customers calling into a service center can be offered powerful cross-sell offers by agents using AI-driven reasoning capability of eGain.

Operational redundancy features include redundant power, on-site backup generators, multiple carrier entrance facilities, and robust environmental controls and monitoring. 

We employ a wide range of security features, including two-factor authentication, data encryption, encoded session identifications and passwords. We contract with specialized security vendors to conduct regular security audits of our infrastructure. We also employ outside vendors for 24x7 managed network security and monitoring. Every page we serve is delivered encrypted to the end user via a Secure Socket Layer, or SSL, transaction. We also use encryption in our storage systems and backup technology. 

We continuously monitor the performance of our application suite using a variety of automated tools. We designed our infrastructure with built-in redundancy for all key components. Our network includes redundant firewalls, switches and intrusion detection systems, and incorporates failover backup for maximum uptime. We load balance at each tier in the network infrastructure. We also designed our application server clusters so that servers can fail without interrupting the user experience, and our database servers are clustered for failover. We regularly back up and store customer data both on and off-site in secure locations to minimize the risk of data loss at any facility. 

Customers 

We serve a worldwide customer base across a wide variety of industry sectors, including healthcare, retail, telecommunications, financial services, insurance, outsourced services, technology, utilities, government, manufacturing and consumer electronics. Our product is sold primarily to large B2C enterprises (over $500 million in annual revenue). For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, international revenue accounted for 50% and domestic revenue for 50% of total 

&#160;

revenue, compared to 52% and 48%, respectively, for fiscal year 2015, and 45% and 55%, respectively, for fiscal year 2014.

Competition 

We compete with other application software vendors including Genesys Telecommunications, Live Person, Inc., and Moxie Software, Inc. In addition, we face actual or potential competition from larger software companies such as Microsoft Corporation, Oracle Corporation, Salesforce.com, Inc., and Verint KANA. that may attempt to sell customer engagement software to their installed base. We also compete with internally developed applications within large enterprises. Finally, we face, or expect to face, competition from software vendors who may develop toolsets and products that allow customers to build new applications that run on the customers&#8217; infrastructure or as hosted services.

&#183;

&#183;

Sales and Marketing 

Sales Strategy 

Our sales strategy is to pursue targeted accounts, mostly B2C enterprises, through a combination of our direct sales force and partners. We target our sales efforts at enterprise companies. Our North American direct sales organization is based at our corporate headquarters in Sunnyvale, California, with field sales presence throughout the United States. Internationally, we have offices in India and the United Kingdom. 

The direct sales force is organized into teams that include field sales representatives and sales consultants. Our direct sales force is complemented by lead generation representatives and sales development representatives. 

We also complement our direct sales force with reseller and sales alliances. We believe we are able to leverage additional sales, marketing and deployment capabilities through these alliances. 

&#160;

Marketing and Partner Strategy 

Our marketing strategy is to build our brand around innovative and robust products trusted by leading enterprises. Our marketing organization focuses on public relations, analyst relations, marketing communications and demand generation. We employ a wide range of marketing avenues to deliver our message, including print and Internet advertising, targeted electronic and postal mailing, email newsletters, and a variety of trade shows, seminars, webinars, and interest groups. 

Our marketing group also produces sales tools, including product collateral, customer case studies, demonstrations, presentations, and competitive analyses. In addition, the group performs market analyses and customer reviews to identify and develop key partnership opportunities and product capabilities. 

We believe that our partners help extend the breadth and depth of our product offerings, drive market penetration, and augment our professional service capabilities. We believe these relationships are important to delivering successful, integrated products and services to our customers, and scaling our business. Our partner portal, EcoNet&#8482;, enables us to provide comprehensive sales, support and services information for channel partners, while enabling them to collaborate with one another through an online forum. Partner enablement is a key focus area for our consulting and training teams too. 

As of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, we had 110 employees engaged in worldwide sales and marketing activities. 

Consulting and Education 

Our worldwide professional services organization provides consulting and education services designed to facilitate customer success and build customer loyalty. 

&#183; 

Consulting Services . Our consulting services group offers rapid implementation services, custom solution development, and systems integration services. Consultants work with customers to understand their specific requirements, analyze their business needs, and implement integrated solutions. We provide these services independently or in partnership with system integrators who have developed consulting expertise on our platform. 

&#183; 

Education Services. Our education services group provides a comprehensive set of basic and customized training programs to our customers and partners in addition to online tutorial modules for ongoing refresher courses. Training programs are offered either in-person at the customer site, or at one of our worldwide training centers. 

As of fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, we had 102 professionals providing worldwide services for systems installation, solutions development, application management, and education. 

Customer Support 

We offer a comprehensive collection of support services designed to rapidly respond to inquiries. Our technical support services are available to customers worldwide under maintenance agreements. The customer success team uses eGain&#8217;s own software suite to provide world-class service to all our customers through support centers located in California, the United Kingdom, and India. 

As of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, there were 61 employees engaged in worldwide customer support services and 39 employees engaged in worldwide cloud services and maintenance support. 

Research and Development 

The market for our products changes rapidly and is characterized by evolving industry standards, swift changes in customer requirements, and frequent new product introductions and enhancements. We believe that strong product 

&#160;

development capabilities are essential to our strategy of maintaining technology leadership. This includes enhancing current technology, providing excellent quality, performance, and functionality, as well as developing additional applications, and maintaining the competitiveness of our product and service offerings. 

We continuously analyze market and customer requirements and evaluate external technology that we believe will enhance our competitiveness, increase our lifetime customer value or expand our target market. As a result of this process, we acquired Exony Limited, a leader in enterprise contact center analytics software, in August 2014. 

As of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, we had 143 employees engaged in worldwide product development activities. We spent approximately $16.1 million on research and development in fiscal year 2016, and $16.0 million and $10.0 million, respectively, in fiscal years 2015 and 2014. 

Intellectual Property 

We regard our intellectual property as critical to our success. We rely on intellectual property and other laws, in addition to confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements, to protect the proprietary aspects of our technology and business. 

As of June 30, 2016, we had six issued patents in the United States. In addition, we have a number of pending patent applications in the United States, including one provisional filing and several non&#8209;provisional filings. Our issued U.S. patents expire at various times between 2029 and 2032. 

We continually assess the propriety of seeking intellectual property protection for those aspects of our technology that we believe constitute innovations providing significant competitive advantages. Future applications may or may not receive the issuance of valid patents or registered trademarks. 

We routinely require our employees, customers, and potential business partners to enter into confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements before we will disclose any sensitive aspects of our products, technology, or business plans. In addition, we require employees to agree to surrender to us any proprietary information, inventions or other intellectual property they generate or come to possess while employed by us. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights through confidentiality and license agreements, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology. These precautions may not prevent misappropriation or infringement of our intellectual property. In addition, some of our license agreements with certain customers and partners require us to place the source code for our products into escrow. These agreements typically provide that some party will have a limited, non-exclusive right to access and use this code as authorized by the license agreement if there is a bankruptcy proceeding instituted by or against us, or if we materially breach a contractual commitment to provide support and maintenance to the party. 

Employees 

As of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, we had 507 full-time employees, of which 143 were in product development, 202 in services and support, 110 in sales and marketing, and 52 in finance and administration. 

None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. While we believe our relations with our employees are good, our future performance depends largely upon the continued service of our key technical, sales and marketing, and senior management personnel, none of whom are bound by employment agreements requiring service for a defined period of time.
