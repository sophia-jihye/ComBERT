 ITEMS 1 AND 2. BUSINESS AND PROPERTIES 

General 

Range Resources Corporation, a Delaware corporation, is a Fort Worth, Texas-based independent natural gas, NGLs and oil company, engaged in the exploration, development and acquisition of natural gas and oil properties, mostly focused in the Appalachian region of the United States. Our corporate offices are located at 100 Throckmorton Street, Suite 1200, Fort Worth, Texas 76102 (telephone (817) 870-2601). We have a regional office in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania. Our common stock is listed and trades on the New York Stock Exchange (the &#8220;NYSE&#8221;) under the symbol &#8220;RRC.&#8221; At December 31, 2015, we had 169.4 million shares outstanding. 

Our 2015 production had the following characteristics: 

&#160;

&#183; 

average total production of 1,395.4 Mmcfe per day, an increase of 20% from 2014; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

71% natural gas; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

total natural gas production of 362.7 Bcf, an increase of 26% from 2014;

&#160;

&#9679; 

total NGLs production of 20.4 Mmbbls (including ethane), an increase of 8% from 2014; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

total crude oil and condensate production of 4.1 Mmbbls which was the same as 2014; and

&#160;

&#9679; 

86% of our total production was from the Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania.

At year-end 2015, our proved reserves had the following characteristics: 

&#160;

&#9679; 

9.9 Tcfe of proved reserves; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

64% natural gas, 33% NGLs and 3% crude oil;

&#160;

&#9679; 

55% proved developed; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

98% operated; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

97% of proved reserves are in the Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania;

&#160;

&#9679; 

a reserve life index of approximately 19 years (based on fourth quarter 2015 production); 

&#160;

&#9679; 

a pretax present value of $3.0 billion of future net cash flows, discounted at 10% per annum (&#8220;PV-10&#8221; (a) ); and 

&#160;

&#9679; 

a standardized after-tax measure of discounted future net cash flows of $2.7 billion. 

(a) 

PV-10 is considered a non-GAAP financial measure as defined by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#8220;SEC&#8221;). We believe that the presentation of PV-10 is relevant and useful to our investors as supplemental disclosure to the standardized measure, or after-tax amount, because it presents the discounted future net cash flows attributable to our proved reserves before taking into account future corporate income taxes and our current tax structure. While the standardized measure is dependent on the unique tax situation of each company, PV-10 is based on prices and discount factors that are consistent for all companies. Because of this, PV-10 can be used within the industry and by creditors and security analysts to evaluate estimated net cash flows from proved reserves on a more comparable basis. The difference between the standardized measure and the PV-10 amount is discounted estimated future income tax of $303.3 million at December 31, 2015.

Ou r Business Strategy 

Our overarching business objective is to build stockholder value through consistent growth in reserves and production on a cost-efficient basis. Our strategy to achieve our business objective is to increase reserves and production through internally generated drilling projects coupled with occasional complementary acquisitions and divestitures of non-core assets. Our strategy requires us to make significant investments and financial commitments in technical staff, acreage, seismic data, drilling and completion technology and gathering and transportation arrangements to build drilling inventory and market our products. Our strategy has the following key elements: 

&#160;

&#9679; 

commit to environmental protection and worker and community safety; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

concentrate in core operating areas; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

maintain a multi-year drilling inventory; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

focus on cost efficiency; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

maintain a long-life reserve base; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

market our products to a large number of customers in different markets under a variety of commercial terms;

&#160;

&#9679; 

maintain operational and financial flexibility; and 

&#160;

&#9679; 

provide employee equity ownership and incentive compensation. 

Commit to Environmental Protection and Worker and Community Safety. We strive to implement the latest technologies and best commercial practices to minimize adverse impacts from the development of our properties on the environment, worker health and safety and the safety of the communities where we operate. We analyze and review performance while striving for continual improvement by working with peer companies, regulators, non-governmental organizations, industries not related to the oil and natural gas industry and other engaged stakeholders. We participate in FracFocus, a national publically accessible web-based registry to report, on a well-by-well basis, the additives and chemicals and amount of water used in the hydraulic fracturing process for each of the wells we operate. We expect every employee to maintain safe operations, minimize environmental impact and conduct their daily business with the highest ethical standards. 

Concentrate in Core Operating Areas. We currently operate primarily in one region: Pennsylvania. Concentrating our drilling and producing activities in a core area allows us to develop the regional expertise needed to interpret specific geological and operating conditions and develop economies of scale. Operating in a core area as large as the Marcellus Shale allows us to reach our goal of consistent production and reserve growth at attractive returns. We intend to further develop our acreage in the Marcellus Shale and improve our well results through the use of technology and detailed analysis of our properties. We periodically evaluate and pursue acquisition opportunities in the United States (including opportunities to acquire particular natural gas and oil properties or entities owning natural gas and oil assets) and at any given time we may be in various stages of evaluating such opportunities. 

Maintain a Multi-Year Drilling Inventory . We focus on areas with multiple prospective and productive horizons and development opportunities. We use our technical expertise to build and maintain a multi-year drilling inventory. We believe that a large, multi-year inventory of drilling projects increases our ability to efficiently plan for the economic growth of production and reserves. Currently, we have over 5,000 proven and unproven drilling locations in inventory. We actively seek to find and develop new natural gas and oil plays with significant exploration and exploitation potential. 

Focus on Cost Efficiency . We concentrate in areas which we believe to have sizeable hydrocarbon deposits in place that will allow us to consistently increase production while controlling costs. Because there is little long-term competitive sales price advantage available to a commodity producer, the costs to find, develop, and produce a commodity are important to organizational sustainability and long-term stockholder value creation. We endeavor to control costs such that our cost to find, develop and produce natural gas, NGLs and oil is one of the lowest in the industry. We operate almost all of our total net production and believe that our extensive knowledge of the geologic and operating conditions in the areas where we operate provides us with the ability to achieve operational efficiencies. 

Maintain a Long-Life Reserve Base. Long-life natural gas and oil reserves provide a more stable growth platform than short-life reserves. Long-life reserves reduce reinvestment risk as they lessen the amount of reinvestment capital deployed each year to replace production. Long-life natural gas and oil reserves also assist us in minimizing costs as stable production makes it easier to build and maintain operating economies of scale. Long-life reserves also offer upside from technology enhancements. We use our drilling, divestiture and acquisition activities to assist in executing this strategy. 

Market Our Products to A Large Number of Customers in Different Markets Under a Variety of Commercial Terms. We market our natural gas, NGLs, and oil to a large number of customers in both domestic and international markets to maximize cash 

&#160;

flow and diversify risk. We hold numerous firm transportation contracts on multiple pipelines to e nable us to transport and sell natural gas and NGLs in the Midwest, Gulf Coast, Southeast, Northeast and international markets. We sell our products under a variety of price indexes and price formulas that assist us in optimizing regional price differentia ls and commodity price volatility. 

Maintain Operational and Financial Flexibility . Because of the risks involved in drilling, coupled with changing commodity prices, we are flexible and adjust our capital budget throughout the year. If certain areas generate higher than anticipated returns, we may accelerate development in those areas and decrease expenditures elsewhere. We also believe this in maintaining a strong balance sheet, ample liquidity and using commodity derivatives to help stabilize our realized prices. We believe provides more predictable cash flows and financial results. We regularly review our asset base to identify nonstrategic assets, the disposition of which will increase capital resources available for other activities and create organizational and operational efficiencies. 

Provide Employee Equity Ownership and Incentive Compensation. We want our employees to think and act like business owners. To achieve this, we reward and encourage them through equity ownership in Range. All full-time employees are eligible to receive equity grants. As of December 31, 2015, our employees and directors owned equity securities in our benefit plans (vested and unvested) that had an aggregate market value of approximately $114 million. 

Significant Accomplishments in 2015 

&#160;

&#9679; 

Production growth &#8211; In 2015, our production averaged 1,395.4 Mmcfe per day, an increase of 20% from 2014. Drilling in the Marcellus Shale play in Pennsylvania drove our production growth. Our capital program is designed to allocate investments based on growth projects that produce the highest returns.

&#160;

&#9679; 

Proved reserves &#8211; Total proved reserves decreased 4% in 2015, from 10.3 Tcfe to 9.9 Tcfe. On a pro forma basis, adjusted for the sale of our Virginia and West Virginia assets, our proved reserves increased 6% in 2015, despite a reduced capital budget in 2015. This achievement is the result of continued drilling success, as all of our production and reserve growth in 2015, before asset sales, came from our drilling program. While consistent growth is challenging to sustain, we believe the quality of our technical teams and our substantial inventory of high quality drilling locations provide the basis for future reserve and production growth. 

&#160;

&#9679; 

Low price environment initiatives &#8211; As a result of the significant drop in commodity prices, we took action to reduce capital spending, operating costs and general and administrative costs. We lowered our 2015 capital expenditure budget that was announced in December 2014 from $1.3 billion to $870 million. Other initiatives included the closing of our Oklahoma City divisional office in early 2015 and additional workforce reductions, which has continued into early 2016. In February 2016, the board of directors approved a reduction of our quarterly dividend from $0.04 per share to $0.02 per share.

&#160;

&#9679; 

Successful drilling program &#8211; In 2015, we drilled 152 gross natural gas and oil wells. We replaced 248% of our production through drilling in 2015 and our overall drilling success rate was 100%. We continue to build our drilling inventory which is critical to our ability to drill a large number of wells each year on a cost effective and efficient basis.

&#160;

&#9679; 

Large resource potential &#8211; Maintaining an exposure to large potential resources is important. We continued expansion of our shale plays in 2015. We have three large unconventional and prospective plays &#8211; the Marcellus, Utica/Point Pleasant and Upper Devonian shales in Pennsylvania. These plays cover expansive areas, provide multi-year drilling opportunities, are in many cases stacked pay and, collectively, have sustainable lower risk growth profiles. The economics of these plays have been enhanced by continued advancements in drilling and completion technologies. 

&#160;

&#9679; 

Focus on financial flexibility &#8211; We ended 2015 with less debt than year-end 2014. Debt per mcfe of proved reserves was $0.27 at December 31, 2015 compared to $0.30 at December 31, 2014. In May 2015, we issued $750.0 million principal amount of 4.875% senior notes due 2025 and in July 2015, we redeemed all $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 6.75% senior subordinated notes due 2020. As of December 31, 2015, we maintain a $4.0 billion bank credit facility, with a borrowing base of $3.0 billion and committed borrowing capacity was $2.0 billion. As we have done historically, we may adjust our capital program, divest of non-strategic assets and use derivatives to protect a portion of our future production from commodity price volatility to ensure adequate funds to execute our drilling program and maintain liquidity.

&#160;

&#9679; 

Dispositions completed &#8211; In December 2015, we sold the majority of our Virginia and West Virginia assets for proceeds of $876.0 million, before closing adjustments. We recognized a pretax loss of $407.7 million. We also received $14.9 million of additional proceeds during the year related to the sale of miscellaneous proved and unproved property and inventory. 

&#160;

&#9679; 

Leasing acquisitions completed &#8211; In 2015, we leased or renewed $73.0 million of acreage located in our core areas, primarily in the Marcellus Shale. We continue to see outstanding results in the Marcellus Shale. Production in the Marcellus Shale increased 27% and we continue to prove up acreage, acquire additional acreage and gain access to additional pipeline and processing capacity. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#9679; 

Continued development of processing, pipeline takeaway capacity and marketing of NGLs &#8211; We continue our efforts to ensure we have sufficient processing capacity and ma rketing agreements in place for our Pennsylvania production. In 2012, we entered into a fifteen year agreement to transport ethane and propane from the tailgate of a third-party processing plant to a terminal and dock facility near Philadelphia (&#8220;Mariner E ast&#8221;). At the end of December 2014, line fill on the propane portion of this pipeline was completed with propane delivered to storage caverns to be sold at a later date. At the end of January 2016, startup of ethane operations was in process. We expect bot h propane and ethane operations on Mariner East to be fully functional by the end of first quarter 2016. &#160;

Industry Operating Environment 

We operate entirely within the continental United States. The oil and natural gas industry is affected by many factors that we cannot control. Government regulations, particularly in the areas of taxation, energy, climate change and the environment, can have a significant impact on our operations and profitability. The impact of these factors is extremely difficult to accurately predict or anticipate. It is difficult for us to predict the occurrence of events that may affect commodity prices or the degree to which these prices will be affected; however, the prices we receive for the commodities we produce will generally approximate current market prices in the geographic region of the production, not including the impact of our derivative program. 

Natural gas prices are primarily determined by North American supply and demand. The New York Mercantile Exchange (&#8220;NYMEX&#8221;) monthly settlement prices for natural gas averaged $2.65 per mcf in 2015, with a high of $3.19 per mcf in January and a low of $2.03 per mcf in November. In 2014, monthly NYMEX settlement prices averaged $4.37 per mcf. Since the end of 2015, natural gas prices have remained depressed, with the monthly settlement price for natural gas falling from $2.21 per mcf in December 2015 to $2.19 per mcf in February 2016. Natural gas prices continue to be under pressure largely due to excess supply of natural gas caused by the high productivity of shale plays in the United States which is outpacing demand. Demand for drilling rigs, oilfield supplies and drill pipe declines with falling commodity prices but such declines tend to lag behind the declines in natural gas and crude oil prices. Depressed natural gas prices continue to reflect the expectation there will be an oversupply of natural gas in 2016 and storage levels will remain higher than normal.

Significant factors that will impact 2016 crude oil prices include worldwide economic conditions, political and economic developments in the Middle East, demand in Asian and European markets and the extent to which members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other oil exporting nations choose to manage oil supply through export quotas. NYMEX monthly settlement prices for oil averaged $49.21 per barrel in 2015, with a high of $59.83 per barrel in June and a low of $37.33 per barrel in December. In 2014, NYMEX monthly settlement oil averaged $92.64 per barrel. Since the end of 2015, crude oil prices have declined significantly, with the monthly settlement price for crude oil falling from $37.33 per barrel in December 2015 to $31.78 per barrel in January 2016. The market oversupply of oil is expected to continue in 2016 with oil prices expected to remain under pressure.

NGLs prices are generally determined by North American supply and demand. We expect NGLs prices in 2016 to continue to be under pressure due to excess supply. The growth of unconventional drilling has substantially increased the supply of NGLs, which has caused a significant decline in NGL component prices. While more export facilities have been built and NGL exports are increasing along with the expansion of ethane cracking capacity, the overall United States demand for NGL products has not kept pace with supply of such products.

Natural gas, NGLs and oil prices affect: 

&#160;

&#9679; 

revenues, profitability and cash flow;

&#160;

&#9679; 

the quantity of natural gas, NGLs and oil that we can economically produce; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

the amount of cash flow available to us for capital expenditures; and

&#160;

&#9679; 

our ability to borrow and raise additional capital.

Natural gas and NGLs prices are likely to affect us more than oil prices because approximately 97% of our proved reserves is natural gas and NGLs. Any continued or extended decline in natural gas, NGLs and oil prices could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and access to capital. To achieve more predictable cash flows and to reduce our exposure to downward price fluctuations, we currently, and may in the future, use derivative instruments to hedge future sales prices on our natural gas, NGLs and oil production. The use of derivative instruments has in the past, and may in the future, prevent us from realizing the full benefit of upward price movements but also partially protect us from declining price movements. 

Segment and Geographical Information 

Our operations consist of one reportable segment. We have a single, company-wide management team that administers all properties as a whole rather than by discrete operating segments. We track only basic operational data by area. We do not maintain complete separate financial statement information by area. We measure financial performance as a single enterprise and not on an 

&#160;

area-by-area basis. Our operations are limited to the United States and we are currently focused on both unconventional resource plays and conventional plays in Pennsylvania. 

Outlook for 2016 

For 2016, we have established a $495.0 million capital budget for natural gas, NGLs, crude oil and condensate related activities, excluding proved property acquisitions, for which we do not budget. Of this amount, 98% is allocated to our Marcellus Shale operations. As has been our historical practice, we will periodically review our capital expenditures throughout the year and may adjust the budget based on commodity prices, drilling success and other factors. To the extent our 2016 capital requirements exceed our internally generated cash flow, proceeds from asset sales, drawing on our committed capacity under our bank credit facility, debt or equity may be used to fund these requirements. The prices we receive for our natural gas, NGLs and oil production are largely based on current market prices, which are beyond our control. The price risk on a portion of our forecasted natural gas, NGLs and oil production for 2016 is mitigated using commodity derivative contracts and we intend to continue to enter into these transactions. As a result of the significant drop in commodity prices, we have implemented initiatives to reduce capital spending, operating costs and administrative expenses to minimize spending in excess of cash flows. During 2015 and continuing into early 2016, we continue to work with our service providers to reduce costs. Also during 2015 and continuing into early 2016, we have implemented workforce reduction plans to reduce general operating expenses and we expect to continue to achieve savings from these initiatives into 2016. In February 2016, the board of directors approved a reduction of our quarterly dividend from $0.04 per share to $0.02 per share.

PV-10 was prepared using the twelve-month average prices for 2015, discounted at 10% per annum. Year-end PV-10 is a non-GAAP financial measure as defined by the SEC. We believe that the presentation of PV-10 is relevant and useful to our investors as supplemental disclosure to the standardized measure, or after tax amount, because it presents the discounted future net cash flows attributable to our proved reserves prior to taking into account future corporate income taxes and our current tax structure. While the standardized measure is dependent on the unique tax situation of each company, PV-10 is based on prices and discount factors that are consistent for all companies. Because of this, PV-10 can be used within the industry and by creditors and securities analysts to evaluate estimated net cash flows from proved reserves on a more comparable basis. Our total standardized measure was $2.7 billion at December 31, 2015. The difference between the standardized measure and the PV-10 amount is the discounted estimated future income tax of $303.3 million at December 31, 2015. Included in the $3.0 billion pretax PV-10 is $2.4 billion related to proved developed reserves. 

Reserve Estimation 

All reserve information in this report is based on estimates prepared by our petroleum engineering staff. We also had Wright and Company, Inc., an independent petroleum consultant, conduct an audit of our year-end reserves. This engineering firm was selected for their geographic expertise and their historical experience in engineering certain properties. The proved reserve audits performed for 2015, 2014 and 2013, in the aggregate represented 94%, 96% and 96% of our proved reserves. The reserve audits performed for 2015, 2014 and 2013, in the aggregate represented 97%, 98% and 97% of our 2015, 2014 and 2013 associated pretax present value of proved reserves discounted at ten percent. Copies of the summary reserve report prepared by our independent petroleum consultant is included as an exhibit to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The technical person at our independent petroleum consulting firm responsible for reviewing the reserve estimates presented herein meets the requirements regarding qualifications, independence, objectivity and confidentiality as set forth in the Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. We maintain an internal staff of petroleum engineers and geoscience 

&#160;

profession als who work closely with our independent petroleum consultant to ensure the integrity, accuracy and timeliness of data furnished during the reserve audit process. Throughout the year, our technical team meets periodically with representatives of our indep endent petroleum consultant to review properties and discuss methods and assumptions. While we have no formal committee specifically designated to review reserves reporting and the reserve estimation process, our senior management reviews and approves sign ificant changes to our proved reserves. We provide historical information to our consultant for our largest producing properties such as ownership interest, natural gas, NGLs and oil production, well test data, commodity prices and operating and developmen t costs. Our consultant performs an independent analysis and differences are reviewed with our Senior Vice President of Reservoir Engineering and Economics. In some cases, additional meetings are held to review identified reserve differences. The reserve a uditor estimates of proved reserves and the pretax present value of such reserves discounted at 10% did not differ from our estimates by more than 10% in the aggregate. However, when compared on a lease-by-lease, field-by-field or area-by-area basis, some of our estimates may be greater than those of our auditor and some may be less than the estimates of the reserve auditor. When such differences do not exceed 10% in the aggregate, our reserve auditor is satisfied that the proved reserves and pretax present value of such reserves discounted at 10% are reasonable and will issue an unqualified opinion. Remaining differences are not resolved due to the limited cost benefit of continuing such analysis. 

Historical variances between our reserve estimates and the aggregate estimates of our independent petroleum consultants have been less than 5%. All of our reserve estimates are reviewed and approved by our Senior Vice President of Reservoir Engineering and Economics, Mr. Alan Farquharson, who reports directly to our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. Our Senior Vice President of Reservoir Engineering and Economics holds a Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical Engineering from the Pennsylvania State University. Before joining Range, he held various technical and managerial positions with Amoco, Hunt Oil and Union Pacific Resources and has more than thirty-five years of engineering experience in the oil and gas industry. During the year, our reserves group may also perform separate, detailed technical reviews of reserve estimates for significant acquisitions or for properties with problematic indicators such as excessively long lives, sudden changes in performance or changes in economic or operating conditions. We did not file any reports during the year ended December 31, 2015 with any federal authority or agency with respect to our estimate of natural gas and oil reserves. 

Reserve Technologies 

Proved reserves are those quantities of natural gas, natural gas liquids and oil that by analysis of geoscience and engineering data can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations. The term &#8220;reasonable certainty&#8221; implies a high degree of confidence that the quantities of natural gas, NGLs and oil actually recovered will equal or exceed the estimate. To achieve reasonable certainty, our internal technical staff employs technologies that have been demonstrated to yield results with consistency and repeatability. The technologies and economic data used in the estimation of our proved reserves include, but are not limited to, empirical evidence through drilling results and well performance, well logs, geologic maps and available downhole and production data, seismic data, well test data and reservoir simulation modeling. 

Reporting of Natural Gas Liquids 

We produce NGLs as part of the processing of our natural gas. The extraction of NGLs in the processing of natural gas reduces the volume of natural gas available for sale. At December 31, 2015, NGLs represented approximately 33% of our total proved reserves on an mcf equivalent basis. NGLs are products priced by the gallon (and sold by the barrel) to the end-user. In reporting proved reserves and production of NGLs, we have included production and reserves in barrels. Prices for a barrel of NGLs in 2015 averaged approximately 75% lower than the average prices for equivalent volumes of oil. We report all production information related to natural gas net of the effect of any reduction in natural gas volumes resulting from the processing of NGLs. As of December 31, 2015, we have 292.8 Mmbbls of ethane reserves (1,296 Bcfe) associated with our Marcellus Shale properties, which are included in NGLs proved reserves and represent 53% of our total NGLs reserves. We currently include ethane in our proved reserves which match volumes delivered under our existing long-term, extendable ethane contracts. 

Proved Undeveloped Reserves (PUDs) 

As of December 31, 2015, our PUDs totaled 21.5 Mmbbls of crude oil, 239.8 Mmbbls of NGLs and 2.9 Tcfe of natural gas, for a total of 4.5 Tcfe. Costs incurred in 2015 relating to the development of PUDs were approximately $398.8 million. Approximately 98% of our PUDs at year-end 2015 were associated with the Marcellus Shale. All PUD drilling locations are scheduled to be drilled prior to the end of 2020 with more than 78% of the future development costs expected to be spent in the next three years. Changes in PUDs that occurred during the year were due to: 

&#160;

&#9679; 

conversion of approximately 762.9 Bcfe of PUDs into proved developed reserves; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

addition of new PUDs consisting of 915.7 Bcfe; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#9679; 

441.9 Bcfe negative revision with 1.2 Tcfe of reserves reclass ified to unproved because of reduced future capital spending due to lower commodity prices partially offset by improved recovery and other positive performance revisions of 725.6 Bcfe; and &#160;

&#160;

&#9679; 

201.8 Bcfe reduction from the sale of properties.

For an additional description of changes in PUDs for 2015, see Note 18 to our consolidated financial statements. We believe our PUDs reclassified to unproved can be included in our future proved reserves as these locations are added back into our five-year development plan.

Proved Reserves (PV-10) 

The following table sets forth the estimated future net cash flows, excluding open derivative contracts, from proved reserves, the present value of those net cash flows discounted at a rate of 10% (PV-10), and the expected benchmark prices and average field prices used in projecting net cash flows over the past five years.

Future net cash flows represent projected revenues from the sale of proved reserves, net of production and development costs (including operating expenses and production taxes). Revenues are based on a twelve-month unweighted average of the first day of the month pricing, without escalation. Future cash flows are reduced by estimated production costs, administrative costs, costs to develop and produce the proved reserves and abandonment costs, all based on current economic conditions at each year-end. There can be no assurance that the proved reserves will be produced in the future or that prices, production or development costs will remain constant. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating reserves and related information and different reservoir engineers often arrive at different estimates for the same properties. 

Property Overview 

Currently, our natural gas and oil operations are concentrated in the Appalachian region of the United States, primarily in the Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania. Our properties consist of interests in developed and undeveloped natural gas and oil leases. These interests entitle us to drill for and produce natural gas, NGLs, crude oil and condensate from specific areas. Our interests are mostly in the form of working interests and, to a lesser extent, royalty and overriding royalty interests. We have a single company-wide management team that administers all properties as a whole. We track only basic operational data by area. We do not maintain complete separate financial statement information by area. We measure financial performance as a single enterprise and not on an area-by-area basis. 

The table below summarizes our operating data for the year ended December 31, 2015.

Appalachian Region 

Our properties in this area are located in the Appalachian Basin in the northeastern United States, predominantly in Pennsylvania. Currently, our reserves are primarily in the Marcellus Shale formation but also include the Utica/Point Pleasant, Medina and Upper Devonian formations which principally produce at depths ranging from 3,500 feet to 11,500 feet. We own 4,462 net producing wells, 99% of which we operate. Our average working interest in this region is 87%. As of December 31, 2015, we have approximately 1.0 million gross (905,000 net) acres under lease. 

Reserves at December 31, 2015 were 9.6 Tcfe, a decrease of 298.1 Bcfe, or 3%, from 2014. Drilling additions (1.2 Tcfe), favorable reserve revisions for performance and improved recovery were more than offset by production, downward revisions for proved undeveloped reserves no longer in our current five year development plan (1.1 Tcfe), sales of 948.3 Bcfe and negative pricing revisions. Annual production increased 25% from 2014. During 2015, we spent $793.7 million in this region to drill 123 (113.4 net) development wells and 19 (19.0 net) exploratory wells, all of which were productive. At December 31, 2015, the Appalachian region had an inventory of over 350 proven drilling locations and over 80 proven recompletions. During the year, the Appalachian region drilled 84 proven locations, added 85 new proven drilling locations and deleted 152 proven drilling locations with reserves reclassified to unproved because of lower future capital spending in response to lower commodity prices. During the year, the region achieved a 100% drilling success rate. 

&#160;

Marcellus Shale 

We began operations in the Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania during 2004. The Marcellus Shale is an unconventional reservoir, which produces natural gas, NGLs and condensate. This has been our largest investment area over the last seven years. We had over 350 proven drilling locations at December 31, 2015. Our 2015 production from the Marcellus Shale increased 27% from 2014. During 2015, we drilled 111 (101.4 net) development wells and 19 (19.0 net) exploratory wells, all of which were successful. In 2016, we plan to drill over 65 net wells. During 2015, we had approximately 9 drilling rigs in the field and expect to run an average of 3 rigs throughout 2016. 

We have long-term agreements with third parties to provide gathering and processing services and infrastructure assets in the Marcellus Shale, which includes gathering and residue gas pipelines, compression, cryogenic processing, de-ethanization and liquid fractionation. In 2011, we executed an ethane sales contract for the liquids-rich gas in southwestern Pennsylvania whereby a third party will purchase and transport ethane from the tailgate of a third-party processing and fractionation facilities to the international border for further delivery into Canada. Initial deliveries commenced in second half 2013. Also in 2011, we entered into an agreement to transport ethane to the Gulf Coast where initial deliveries also commenced in late 2013. 

In 2012, we entered into a fifteen year agreement to transport ethane and propane from the tailgate of a third-party processing plant to a terminal and dock facility near Philadelphia. Line fill on the propane portion of this pipeline was completed in late December 2014, with propane delivered to storage caverns to be sold at a later date. At the end of January 2016, startup of ethane operations was in process. We expect both propane and ethane operations to be fully functional by the end of first quarter 2016. In the meantime, since 2012, we have been transporting a portion of our propane by rail and truck to the terminal and dock facility near Philadelphia for sale to domestic and international customers. Also in 2012, we executed a fifteen year agreement relating to ethane sales from the same terminal near Philadelphia which is expected to begin in early 2016. 

Other

Our other operations include drilling, production and field operations in the Texas Panhandle, as well as in the Anadarko Basin of western Oklahoma, the Nemaha Uplift of Northern Oklahoma and Kansas, the Permian Basin of West Texas and Mississippi. We own 444 net producing wells in these locations, 96% of which we operate. Our average working interest is 74%. As of December 31, 2015, we have approximately 396,000 gross (308,000 net) acres under lease. 

Total proved reserves decreased 120.5 Bcfe, or 29%, at December 31, 2015, when compared to year-end 2014. Drilling additions (31.5 Bcfe) were offset by production, property sales (15.1 Bcfe), negative performance revisions and downward revisions for proved undeveloped reserves no longer in our current five year development plan (61.7 Bcfe) and negative pricing revisions. Annual production volumes decreased 36% from 2014. During 2015, this region spent $23.5 million to drill 10 (8.9 net) development wells, all of which were productive. During the year, the region achieved a 100% drilling success rate. 

At December 31, 2015, this area had a development inventory of over 55 proven drilling locations and over 30 proven recompletions. During the year, this area drilled 4 proven locations, added 12 new proven locations and deleted 41 proven drilling locations. Development projects include recompletions and infill drilling. These activities also include increasing reserves and production through cost control, upgrading lifting equipment, improving gathering systems and surface facilities, and performing restimulations and refracturing operations. 

Divestitures

Over the last three years, we have divested over $1.4 billion of non-strategic assets in order to increase capital resources available for other activities, reduce our unit cost structure, create organizational and operating efficiencies and increase financial flexibility through reduced debt levels. In 2015, we sold the following assets:

Virginia and West Virginia. &#160; On December 30, 2015, we closed the sale of the majority of our natural gas and oil properties and gathering assets in Virginia and West Virginia for cash proceeds of $876.0 million, before closing adjustments. We used the proceeds from this sale to reduce the balance on our bank credit facility. 

West Texas. In February 2015, we sold our remaining properties in West Texas for proceeds of $10.5 million. 

Miscellaneous. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we sold miscellaneous unproved property, inventory and other assets for proceeds of $4.4 million. 

&#160;

Producing Wells 

The following table sets forth information relating to productive wells at December 31, 2015. If we own both a royalty and a working interest in a well, such interest is included in the table below. Wells are classified as natural gas or crude oil according to their predominant production stream. We do not have a significant number of dual completions.

The day-to-day operations of natural gas and oil properties are the responsibility of the operator designated under pooling or operating agreements. The operator supervises production, maintains production records, employs or contracts for field personnel and performs other functions. An operator receives reimbursement for direct expenses incurred in the performance of its duties as well as monthly per-well producing and drilling overhead reimbursement at rates customarily charged by unaffiliated third parties. The charges customarily vary with the depth and location of the well being operated. 

Drilling Activity 

The following table summarizes drilling activity for the past three years. Gross wells reflect the sum of all wells in which we own an interest. Net wells reflect the sum of our working interests in gross wells. As of December 31, 2015, we were in the process of drilling 30 (28.0 net) wells.

Gross and Net Acreage 

We own interests in developed and undeveloped natural gas and oil acreage. These ownership interests generally take the form of working interests in oil and natural gas leases that have varying terms. Developed acreage includes leased acreage that is allocated or assignable to producing wells or wells capable of production even though shallower or deeper horizons may not have been fully explored. Undeveloped acreage includes leased acres on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of commercial quantities of natural gas or oil, regardless of whether or not the acreage contains proved reserves. 

&#160;

The following table sets forth certain information regarding the developed and undeveloped acreage in which we own a working interest as of December 31, 2015. Acreage related to royalty, overriding royalty and other similar interests is excluded from this summary:

In all cases the drilling of a commercial well will hold acreage beyond the lease expiration date. We have leased acreage that is subject to lease expiration if initial wells are not drilled within a specified period, generally between three to five years. However, we have in the past and expect in the future, to be able to extend the lease terms of some of these leases and sell or exchange some of these leases with other companies. The expirations included in the table above do not take into account the fact that we may be able to extend the lease terms. We do not expect to lose significant lease acreage because of failure to drill due to inadequate capital, equipment or personnel. However, based on our evaluation of prospective economics, we have allowed acreage to expire from time to time and expect to allow additional acreage to expire in the future. 

Title to Properties 

We believe that we have satisfactory title to all of our producing properties in accordance with generally accepted industry standards. As is customary in the industry, in the case of undeveloped properties, often minimal investigation of record title is made at the time of lease acquisition. Investigations are made before the consummation of an acquisition of producing properties and before commencement of drilling operations on undeveloped properties. Individual properties may be subject to burdens that we believe do not materially interfere with the use or affect the value of the properties. Burdens on properties may include: 

&#160;

&#9679; 

customary royalty interests; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

liens incident to operating agreements and for current taxes; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

obligations or duties under applicable laws; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

development obligations under oil and gas leases; or 

&#160;

&#9679; 

net profit interests. 

Delivery Commitments 

For a discussion of our delivery commitments, see &#8220;Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations- Delivery Commitments .&#8221;

&#160;

Employees 

As of January 1, 2016, we had 744 full-time employees. All full-time employees are eligible to receive equity awards approved by the compensation committee of the board of directors. No employees are currently covered by a labor union or other collective bargaining arrangement. We believe that the relationship with our employees is excellent. 

Competition 

Competition exists in all sectors of the oil and gas industry and in particular, we encounter substantial competition in developing and acquiring natural gas and oil properties, securing and retaining personnel, conducting drilling and field operations and marketing production. Competitors in exploration, development, acquisitions and production include the major oil and gas companies as well as numerous independent oil and gas companies, individual proprietors and others. Although our sizable acreage position and core area concentration provide some competitive advantages, many competitors have financial and other resources substantially exceeding ours. Therefore, competitors may be able to pay more for desirable leases and evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties or prospects than our financial or personnel resources allow. We face competition for pipeline and other services to transport our product to markets, particularly in the Northeastern portion of the United States. Our ability to replace and expand our reserve base depends on our ability to attract and retain quality personnel and identify and acquire suitable producing properties and prospects for future drilling. For more information, see &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors.&#8221; 

Marketing and Customers 

We market the majority of our natural gas, NGLs, crude oil and condensate production from the properties we operate for our interest, and that of the other working interest owners. We pay our royalty owners from the sales attributable to our working interest. Natural gas, NGLs and oil purchasers are selected on the basis of price, credit quality and service reliability. For a summary of purchasers of our natural gas, NGLs and oil production that accounted for 10% or more of consolidated revenue, see Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements. Because alternative purchasers of natural gas and oil are usually readily available, we believe that the loss of any of these purchasers would not have a material adverse effect on our operations. Production from our properties is marketed using methods that are consistent with industry practice. Sales prices for natural gas, NGLs and oil production are negotiated based on factors normally considered in the industry, such as index or spot price, distance from the well to the pipeline, commodity quality and prevailing supply and demand conditions. Our natural gas production is sold to utilities, marketing and midstream companies and industrial users. Our NGLs production is typically sold to natural gas processors or users of NGLs. Our oil and condensate production is sold to crude oil processors, transporters and refining and marketing companies in the area. Market volatility due to fluctuating weather conditions, international political developments, overall energy supply and demand, economic growth rates and other factors in the United States and worldwide have had, and will continue to have, a significant effect on energy prices. 

We enter into derivative transactions with unaffiliated third parties for a varying portion of our production to achieve more predictable cash flows and to reduce our exposure to short-term fluctuations in natural gas, NGLs and oil prices. For a more detailed discussion, see &#8220;Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; and &#8220;Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.&#8221; 

We incur gathering and transportation expense to move our production from the wellhead and tanks to purchaser-specified delivery points. These expenses vary based on volume, distance shipped and the fee charged by the third-party gatherers and transporters. In Oklahoma and Texas, our production is transported primarily through purchaser-owned or third-party trucks, field gathering systems and transmission pipelines. Transportation capacity on these gathering and transportation systems and pipelines is occasionally constrained. Our Appalachian production is transported on third-party pipelines on which, in most cases, we hold long-term contractual capacity. We attempt to balance sales, storage and transportation positions, which can include purchase of commodities from third parties for resale, to satisfy transportation commitments. 

We have not experienced significant difficulty to date in finding a market for all of our production as it becomes available or in transporting our production to those markets; however, there is no assurance that we will always be able to transport and market all of our production or obtain favorable prices. 

We have entered into three ethane agreements to sell or transport ethane from our Marcellus Shale area. Initial deliveries commenced in late 2013 on two of these agreements. The remaining agreement is expected to begin in early 2016. For more information, see &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors &#8211; Our business depends on natural gas and oil transportation and NGLs processing facilities, most of which are owned by others and depends on our ability to contract with those parties.&#8221; 

Seasonal Nature of Business 

Generally, but not always, the demand for natural gas and propane decreases during the summer months and increases during the winter months. Seasonal anomalies such as mild winters or hot summers also may impact this demand. In addition, pipelines, 

&#160;

utilities, local di stribution companies and industrial end-users utilize natural gas storage facilities and purchase some of their anticipated winter requirements during the summer. This can also impact the seasonality of demand. 

Governmental Regulation 

Enterprises that sell securities in public markets are subject to regulatory oversight by federal agencies such as the SEC and the NYSE, a private stock exchange which requires us to comply with listing requirements for our common stock. This regulatory oversight imposes on us the responsibility for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting, and ensuring that the financial statements and other information included in submissions to the SEC do not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made in such submissions not misleading. Failure to comply with the NYSE listing rules and regulations of the SEC could subject us to litigation from public or private plaintiffs. Failure to comply with the rules of the NYSE could result in the de-listing of our common stock, which could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. Compliance with some of these rules and regulations is costly and regulations are subject to change or reinterpretation. 

Exploration and development and the production and sale of oil and gas are subject to extensive federal, state and local regulations. An overview of these regulations is set forth below. We believe we are in substantial compliance with currently applicable laws and regulations and the continued substantial compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, cash flows or results of operations. However, current regulatory requirements may change, currently unforeseen environmental incidents may occur or past non-compliance with environmental laws or regulations may be discovered. See &#8220; Item 1A. Risk Factors &#8211; The natural gas and oil industry is subject to extensive regulation.&#8221; We do not believe we are affected differently by these regulations than others in the industry.

&#160;

In August 2005, Congress enacted the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (&#8220;EPAct 2005&#8221;). Among other matters, EPAct 2005 amends the Natural Gas Act (&#8220;NGA&#8221;) to make it unlawful for &#8220;any entity,&#8221; including otherw ise non-jurisdictional producers such as Range, to use any deceptive or manipulative device or contrivance in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas or the purchase or sale of transportation services subject to regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (the &#8220;FERC&#8221;), in contravention of rules prescribed by the FERC. In January 2006, the FERC issued rules implementing this provision. The rules make it unlawful in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas subject to the juri sdiction of the FERC, or the purchase or sale of transportation services subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC, for any entity, directly or indirectly, to use or employ any device, scheme or artifice to defraud; to make any untrue statement of material f act or omit any such statement necessary to make the statements not misleading; or to engage in any act or practice that operates as a fraud or deceit upon any person. EPAct 2005 also gives the FERC authority to impose civil penalties for violations of the NGA of up to $1,000,000 per day per violation. The anti-manipulation rule does not apply to activities that relate only to intrastate or other non-jurisdictional sales or gathering, but does apply to activities or otherwise non-jurisdictional entities to the extent the activities are conducted &#8220;in connection with&#8221; gas sales, purchases or transportation subject to the FERC&#8217;s jurisdiction which includes the reporting requirements under Order 704, defined and described below. It therefore was a significant ex pansion of the FERC&#8217;s enforcement authority. Range has not been affected differently than any other producer of natural gas by this act. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations can result in substantial penalties. The regulatory burden on th e industry increases the cost of doing business and affects profitability. Although we believe we are in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, such laws and regulations are frequently amended or reinterpreted. Therefore, we are u nable to predict the future costs or impact of compliance. Additional proposals and proceedings that affect the oil and natural gas industry are regularly considered by Congress, the states, the FERC and the courts. We cannot predict when or whether any su ch proposals may become effective. 

In December 2007, the FERC issued a final rule on the annual natural gas transaction reporting requirements, as amended by subsequent orders on rehearing (&#8220;Order 704&#8221;). Under Order 704, wholesale buyers and sellers of more than 2.2 million MMBtus of physical natural gas in the previous calendar year, including natural gas gatherers and marketers, are required to report to the FERC, on May 1 of each year, aggregate volumes of natural gas purchased or sold at wholesale in the prior calendar year to the extent such transactions utilize, contribute to, or may contribute to the formation of price indices. It is the responsibility of the reporting entity to determine which individual transactions should be reported based on the guidance of Order 704. Order 704 also requires market participants to indicate whether they report prices to any index publishers, and if so, whether their reporting complies with the FERC&#8217;s policy statement on price reporting. 

Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety Matters 

Our operations are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations governing occupational health and safety, the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection, some of which carry substantial administrative, civil and criminal penalties for failure to comply. These laws and regulations may include but are not limited to: 

&#160;

&#9679; 

the acquisition of a permit before drilling commences;

&#160;

&#9679; 

restriction of the types, quantities and concentrations of various substances that can be released into the environment in connection with drilling, production and transporting through pipelines;

&#160;

&#9679; 

governing the sourcing and disposal of water used in the drilling and completion process;

&#160;

&#9679; 

limiting or prohibiting drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands, frontier and other protected areas;

&#160;

&#9679; 

requiring some form of remedial action to prevent or mitigate pollution from existing and former operations such as plugging abandoned wells or closing earthen impoundments; and

&#160;

&#9679; 

imposing substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from operations or failure to comply with regulatory filings. 

These laws and regulations also may restrict the rate of production. Moreover, changes in environmental laws and regulations often occur, and any changes that result in more stringent and costly well construction, drilling, water management or completion activities or more restrictive waste handling, storage, transport, disposal or cleanup requirements for any substances used or produced in our operations could materially adversely affect our operations and financial position, as well as those of the oil and natural gas industry in general. 

Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, as amended (&#8220;CERCLA&#8221;), also known as the &#8220;Superfund&#8221; law and comparable state laws impose liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a &#8220;hazardous substance&#8221; into the environment. These persons may include owners or operators of the disposal site or sites where the hazardous substance release occurred and companies that disposed of or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances at the site where the release occurred. Under CERCLA, all of these persons may be subject to joint and 

&#160;

several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. In addition, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties, pursuant to environmental statutes, common law or both, to file claims for personal injury and property damages allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances or other pollutants into the environment . Although petroleum, including crude oil and natural gas, is not a &#8220;hazardous substance&#8221; under CERCLA, at least two courts have ruled that certain wastes associated with the production of crude oil may be classified as &#8220;hazardous substances&#8221; under CERCLA and that releases of such wastes may therefore give rise to liability under CERCLA. While we generate materials in the course of our operations that may be regulated as hazardous substances, we have not received notification that we may be potentially resp onsible for cleanup costs under CERCLA. In addition, certain state laws also regulate the disposal of oil and natural gas wastes. New state and federal regulatory initiatives that could have a significant adverse impact on us may periodically be proposed a nd enacted. 

Waste handling. We also may incur liability under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended (&#8220;RCRA&#8221;) and comparable state laws, which impose requirements related to the handling and disposal of non-hazardous solid wastes and hazardous wastes. Drilling fluids, produced waters, and other wastes associated with the exploration, development or production of crude oil, natural gas or geothermal energy are currently regulated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (&#8220;EPA&#8221;) and state agencies under RCRA&#8217;s less stringent non-hazardous solid waste provisions. It is possible that these solid wastes could in the future be reclassified as hazardous wastes, whether by amendment of RCRA or adoption of new laws, which could significantly increase our costs to manage and dispose of such wastes. Moreover, ordinary industrial wastes, such as paint wastes, waste solvents, laboratory wastes and waste compressor oils, may be regulated as hazardous wastes. Although the costs of managing wastes classified as hazardous waste may be significant, we do not expect to experience more burdensome costs than similarly situated companies in our industry. 

We currently own or lease, and have in the past owned or leased, properties that for many years have been used for the exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas. Petroleum hydrocarbons or wastes may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties owned or leased by us, or on or under other locations where such materials have been taken for disposal. In addition, some of these properties have been operated by third parties whose treatment and disposal or release of petroleum hydrocarbons and wastes was not under our control. These properties and the materials disposed or released on them may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and comparable state laws and regulations. Under such laws and regulations, we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes or property contamination, or to perform remedial activities to prevent future contamination. 

Water discharges and use. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as amended (the &#8220;CWA&#8221;), and comparable state laws impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants, including produced waters and other oil and natural gas wastes, into federal and state waters. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or the state. These laws also prohibit the discharge of dredge and fill material in regulated waters, including wetlands, unless authorized by permit. These laws and any implementing regulations provide for administrative, civil and criminal penalties for any unauthorized discharges of oil and other substances in reportable quantities and may impose substantial potential liability for the costs of removal, remediation and damages. Pursuant to these laws and regulations, we may be required to obtain and maintain approvals or permits for the discharge of wastewater or storm water and are required to develop and implement spill prevention, control and countermeasure plans, also referred to as &#8220;SPCC plans,&#8221; in connection with on-site storage of greater than threshold quantities of oil. We regularly review our natural gas and oil properties to determine the need for new or updated SPCC plans and, where necessary, we will be developing or upgrading such plans, the costs of which are not expected to be substantial. 

The Oil Pollution Act of 1990, as amended (&#8220;OPA&#8221;), contains numerous requirements relating to the prevention of and response to oil spills into waters of the United States. The OPA subjects owners of facilities to strict, joint and several liability for all containment and cleanup costs and certain other damages arising from an oil spill, including, but not limited to, the costs of responding to a release of oil to surface waters. While we believe we have been in substantial compliance with OPA, noncompliance could result in varying civil and criminal penalties and liabilities. 

The Underground Injection Control (UIC) Program authorized by the Safe Drinking Water Act prohibits any underground injection unless authorized by a permit. In connection with our operations, Range may dispose of produced water in underground wells, which are designed and permitted to place the water into deep geologic formations, isolated from fresh water sources. However, because some states have become concerned that the disposal of produced water could under certain circumstances contribute to seismicity, they have adopted or are considering adopting additional regulations governing such disposal. For example, in January 2016, Ohio lawmaker&#8217;s proposed new legislation that would, among other things, require injection wells be located more than 2,000 feet from any occupied dwelling. Should future onerous regulations or bans relating to underground wells be placed in effect in areas where Range has significant operations, there could be an impact on Range&#8217;s ability to operate.

Hydraulic fracturing. Hydraulic fracturing, which has been used by the industry for over 60 years, is an important and common practice to stimulate production of natural gas and/or oil from dense subsurface rock formations. The hydraulic fracturing process involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into targeted subsurface formations to fracture the surrounding rock 

&#160;

and stimulate production. We routinely apply hydraulic fracturing techniques as part of our operations. This process is typically regulated by state environmental agencies and oil and natura l gas commissions; however, several federal agencies have asserted regulatory authority over certain aspects of the process. For example, the EPA has issued final Clean Air Act regulations governing performance standards, including standards for the captur e of air emissions released during hydraulic fracturing; proposed effluent limit guidelines that wastewater from shale gas extraction operations must meet before discharging to a treatment plant; and issued in May 2014 a prepublication of its Advance Notic e of Proposed Rulemaking regarding Toxic Substances Control Act reporting of the chemical substances and mixtures used in hydraulic fracturing. Also, in March 2015, the Federal Bureau of Land Management (&#8220;BLM&#8221;) released a final rule setting forth disclosur e requirements and other regulatory mandates for hydraulic fracturing on federal lands. Moreover, from time to time, Congress has considered adopting legislation intended to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure o f the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. In addition to any actions by Congress, certain states in which we operate, including Pennsylvania and Texas have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, regulations imposing or that cou ld impose new or more stringent permitting, public disclosure, or well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations. States could also elect to prohibit hydraulic fracturing altogether, such as in the State of New York. Local governments al so may seek to adopt ordinances within their jurisdiction regulating the time, place or manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular. If new or more stringent federal, state or local legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process is adopted in areas where we currently or in the future plan to operate, we may incur additional, more significant, costs to comply with such requirements and also could become subject to additional permitting requiremen ts and experience added delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities. 

In addition, certain government reviews are underway that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices. The White House Council on Environmental Quality is coordinating an administration-wide review of hydraulic fracturing practices. The EPA issued a draft report in June 2015 concluding that, although hydraulic fracturing activities have the potential to impact drinking water resources through water withdrawals, spills, fracturing directly into such resources, underground migration of liquids and gases, and inadequate treatment and discharge of wastewater. The EPA did not find evidence that these mechanisms have led to widespread, systematic impacts on drinking water resources. The draft report has not yet been finalized. These existing or any future studies, depending on any meaningful further results obtained, could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing under the federal Safe Drinking Act or other regulatory mechanisms. 

We believe that our hydraulic fracturing activities follow applicable industry practices and legal requirements for groundwater protection and that our fracturing operations have not resulted in material environmental liabilities. We do not maintain insurance policies intended to provide coverage for losses solely related to hydraulic fracturing operations; however, we believe our existing insurance policies would cover any alleged third-party bodily injury and property damage caused by hydraulic fracturing including sudden and accidental pollution coverage. 

Air emissions. The Clean Air Act, as amended, and comparable state laws restrict the emission of air pollutants from many sources, including compressor stations. These laws and any implementing regulations may require us to obtain pre-approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce air emissions, impose stringent air permit requirements, or use specific equipment or technologies to control emissions. We may be required to incur certain capital expenditures in the next few years for air pollution control equipment in connection with maintaining or obtaining operating permits and approvals for emissions of pollutants. For example, pursuant to President Obama&#8217;s Strategy to Reduce Methane Emissions, the EPA proposed in August 2015 new regulations that will set methane emission standards for new and modified oil and natural gas production and natural gas processing and transmission facilities as part of the Administration&#8217;s efforts to reduce methane emissions from the oil and natural gas sector by up to 45 percent from 2012 levels by 2025. The EPA is expected to finalize the proposed regulations in 2016. In a second example, in October 2015, the EPA finalized a rulemaking proposal that revises the National Ambient Air Quality Standard for ozone to 70 parts per billion for both the 8-hour primary and secondary standards. Compliance with one or both of these regulatory initiatives could directly impact us by requiring installation of new emission controls on some of our equipment, resulting in longer permitting timelines, and significantly increasing our capital expenditures and operating costs, which could adversely impact our business. 

Climate change. In 2009, the EPA published its findings that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases (&#8220;GHGs&#8221;) present a danger to public health and the environment because emissions of such gases are, according to the EPA, contributing to warming of the Earth&#8217;s atmosphere and other climatic conditions. Based on these findings, the EPA adopted regulations under the existing Clean Air Act establishing Title V and Prevention of Significant Deterioration (&#8220;PSD&#8221;) permitting reviews for GHG emissions from certain large stationary sources that already are potential major sources of certain principal, or criteria, pollutant emissions. We could become subject to these Title V and PSD permitting reviews and be required to install &#8220;best available control technology&#8221; to limit emissions of GHGs from any new or significantly modified facilities that we may seek to construct in the future if such facilities emitted volumes of GHGs in excess of threshold permitting levels. The EPA has also adopted rules requiring the reporting of GHG emissions from specified emission sources in the United States on an annual basis, including certain oil and natural gas production facilities, which include several of our facilities. We believe that our monitoring activities and reporting are in substantial compliance with applicable obligations. 

&#160;

While Congress has from time to time considered legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs, there has not been significant activity in t he form of adopted legislation to reduce GHG emissions at the federal level in recent years. In the absence of federal climate legislation in the U.S., a number of state and regional efforts have emerged that are aimed at tracking and/or reducing GHG emiss ions by means of cap and trade programs that typically require major sources of GHG emissions, such as electric power plants, to acquire and surrender emission allowances in return for emitting those GHGs. 

Although it is not possible at this time to predict how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted to address GHG emissions would impact our business, any such future laws and regulations, or international compacts, could require us to incur increased operating costs, such as costs to purchase and operate emissions control systems, to acquire emission allowances or comply with new regulatory or reporting requirements. For example, as noted above, the EPA has proposed new regulations that will set methane emission standards for new and modified oil and natural gas production and natural gas processing and transmission facilities as part of the Administration&#8217;s efforts to reduce methane emissions from the oil and natural gas sector by up to 45 percent from 2012 levels by 2025. Any such legislation or regulatory programs could also increase the cost of consuming, and thereby could reduce demand for the oil and natural gas that we produce. Finally, it should be noted that some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the Earth&#8217;s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts and floods and other climatic events. If any such effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 

Activities on federal lands. Oil and natural gas exploration, development and production activities on federal lands, including Indian lands and lands administered by the Federal Bureau of Land Management (the &#8220;BLM&#8221;), are subject to the National Environmental Policy Act, as amended (&#8220;NEPA&#8221;). NEPA requires federal agencies, including the BLM, to evaluate major agency actions having the potential to significantly impact the environment. In the course of such evaluations, an agency will prepare an Environmental Assessment that assesses the potential direct, indirect and cumulative impacts of a proposed project and, if necessary, will prepare a more detailed Environmental Impact Statement that may be made available for public review and comment. Currently, we have minimal exploration and production activities on federal lands. However, for those current activities as well as for future or proposed exploration and development plans on federal lands, governmental permits or authorizations that are subject to the requirements of NEPA are required. This process has the potential to delay or limit, or increase the cost of, the development of oil and natural gas projects. Authorizations under NEPA are also subject to protest, appeal or litigation, any or all of which may delay or halt projects. 

Endangered species. The federal Endangered Species Act, as amended (the &#8220;ESA&#8221;), restricts activities that may affect endangered and threatened species or their habitats. If endangered species are located in an area where we wish to conduct seismic surveys, development activities or abandonment operations, the work could be prohibited or delayed or expensive mitigation may be required. Moreover, the designation of previously unidentified endangered or threatened species could cause us to incur additional costs or become subject to operating restrictions or bans in the affected areas. As a result of a settlement approved by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in September 2011, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (&#8220;FWS&#8221;) is required to make a determination on the listing of numerous species as endangered or threatened under the Endangered Species Act prior to the completion of the agency&#8217;s 2017 fiscal year. In March 2014, the FWS announced a final rule that will limit regulatory impacts on landowners and businesses from the listing if those landowners and businesses have entered into certain range-wide conservation planning agreements. The designation of previously unprotected species in areas where we operate as threatened or endangered could cause us to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures or could result in limitations on our exploration and production activities that could have an adverse impact on our ability to develop and produce our reserves. 

The Migratory Bird Treaty Act implements various treaties and conventions between the United States and certain other nations for the protection of migratory birds. In accordance with this law, the taking, killing or possessing of migratory birds covered under this act is unlawful without a permit. If there is the potential to adversely affect migratory birds as a result of our operations, we may be required to obtain necessary permits to conduct those operations, which may result in specified operating restrictions on a temporary, seasonal, or permanent basis in affected areas and an adverse impact on our ability to develop and produce our reserves. 

We believe we are in substantial compliance with currently applicable environmental laws and regulations. Although we have not experienced any material adverse effect from compliance with environmental requirements, there is no assurance that this will continue. We did not have any material capital or other non-recurring expenditures in connection with complying with environmental laws or environmental remediation matters in 2015, nor do we anticipate that such expenditures will be material in 2016. However, we regularly have expenditures to comply with environmental laws and we anticipate those costs will continue to be incurred in the future. 

Occupational health and safety. We are also subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, as amended (&#8220;OSHA&#8221;), and comparable state laws that regulate the protection of the health and safety of employees. In addition, OSHA&#8217;s hazard communication standard requires that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens. We believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with the OSHA requirements.
