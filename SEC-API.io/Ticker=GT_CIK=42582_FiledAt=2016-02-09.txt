BUSINESS OF GOODYEAR 

The Goodyear Tire &#38; Rubber Company (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) is an Ohio corporation organized in 1898. Its principal offices are located at 200 Innovation Way, Akron, Ohio 44316-0001. Its telephone number is (330) 796-2121. The terms &#8220;Goodyear,&#8221; &#8220;Company&#8221; and &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us&#8221; or &#8220;our&#8221; wherever used herein refer to the Company together with all of its consolidated U.S. and foreign subsidiary companies, unless the context indicates to the contrary. 

We are one of the world&#8217;s leading manufacturers of tires, engaging in operations in most regions of the world. In 2015 , our net sales were $16,443 million &#32;and Goodyear&#8217;s net income and net income available to common shareholders were $307 million , including an after-tax charge of $577 million related to the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan subsidiary. Together with our U.S. and international subsidiaries, we develop, manufacture, market and distribute tires for most applications. We also manufacture and market rubber-related chemicals for various applications. We are one of the world&#8217;s largest operators of commercial truck service and tire retreading centers. In addition, we operate approximately 1,100 &#32;tire and auto service center outlets where we offer our products for retail sale and provide automotive repair and other services. We manufacture our products in 49 &#32;manufacturing facilities in 22 &#32;countries, including the United States, and we have marketing operations in almost every country around the world. We employ approximately 66,000 full-time and temporary associates worldwide. 

Dissolution of Global Alliance with Sumitomo Rubber Industries 

On October 1, 2015, we completed the previously announced dissolution of our global alliance with Sumitomo Rubber Industries, Ltd. (&#8220;SRI&#8221;) in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in the Framework Agreement, dated as of June 4, 2015, by and between us and SRI. 

Under the global alliance, we owned 75% and SRI owned 25% of two companies, Goodyear Dunlop Tires Europe B.V. (&#8220;GDTE&#8221;) and Goodyear Dunlop Tires North America, Ltd. (&#8220;GDTNA&#8221;). In Japan, we owned 25%, and SRI owned 75%, of two companies, one, Nippon Goodyear Ltd. (&#8220;NGY&#8221;), for the sale of Goodyear-brand passenger and truck tires for replacement in Japan and the other, Dunlop Goodyear Tires Ltd. (&#8220;DGT&#8221;), for the sale of Goodyear-brand and Dunlop-brand tires to vehicle manufacturers in Japan. We also own 51%, and SRI owns 49%, of a company that coordinated and disseminated both commercialized tire technology and non-commercialized technology among us and SRI, the joint ventures and their respective affiliates (the &#8220;Technology JV&#8221;), and we own 80%, and SRI owns 20%, of a global purchasing company (the &#8220;Purchasing JV&#8221;). The global alliance also provided for the investment by us and SRI in the common stock of the other. 

As result of the completion of certain of the transactions contemplated by the Framework Agreement: 

&#8226; 

we acquired SRI&#8217;s 25% interest in GDTE and SRI&#8217;s 75% interest in NGY; 

&#8226; 

we sold to SRI our 75% interest in GDTNA, as well as the Huntsville, Alabama test track used by GDTNA, and our 25% interest in DGT; 

&#8226; 

we maintained control of the Dunlop-related trademarks for tire-related businesses in North America but granted to SRI an exclusive license to develop, manufacture and sell Dunlop-brand tires for motorcycles and for Japanese-owned original equipment manufacturers operating in North America; and 

&#8226; 

SRI obtained exclusive rights to sell Dunlop-brand tires in those countries that were previously non-exclusive under the global alliance, including Russia, Turkey and certain countries in Africa. 

We paid to SRI a net amount of $271 million and delivered a promissory note to GDTNA in the initial principal amount of $56 million at an interest rate of LIBOR plus 0.1% and with a maturity date three years following the date of dissolution. 

The Framework Agreement also provides that we will liquidate the Technology JV and the Purchasing JV and distribute the remaining assets and liabilities of those entities to us and SRI in accordance with our respective ownership interests, and that we and SRI will conduct an orderly sale of the investments in the common stock of the other.

DESCRIPTION OF GOODYEAR&#8217;S BUSINESS 

G ENERAL &#32;I NFORMATION &#32;R EGARDING &#32;O UR &#32;S EGMENTS 

For the year ended December 31, 2015 , we operated our business through four operating segments representing our regional tire businesses: North America; Europe, Middle East and Africa (&#8220;EMEA&#8221;); Asia Pacific; and Latin America. 

Financial information related to our operating segments for the three year period ended December 31, 2015 &#32;appears in the Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 8, Business Segments. 

Effective January 1, 2016, we combined our North America and Latin America strategic business units into one Americas strategic business unit. We have combined the North America and Latin America reportable segments effective on this date to align with the new organizational structure and the basis used for reporting to our Chief Executive Officer beginning in 2016. Our first quarter 2016 Form 10-Q will reflect the new segment structure with prior periods recast for comparable disclosure. 

Our principal business is the development, manufacture, distribution and sale of tires and related products and services worldwide. We manufacture and market numerous lines of rubber tires for: 

&#8226; 

automobiles 

&#8226; 

trucks 

&#8226; 

buses 

&#8226; 

aircraft 

&#8226; 

motorcycles 

&#8226; 

earthmoving and mining equipment 

&#8226; 

farm implements 

&#8226; 

industrial equipment, and 

&#8226; 

various other applications. 

In each case, our tires are offered for sale to vehicle manufacturers for mounting as original equipment (&#8220;OE&#8221;) and for replacement worldwide. We manufacture and sell tires under the Goodyear, Dunlop, Kelly, Debica, Sava and Fulda brands and various other Goodyear owned &#8220;house&#8221; brands, and the private-label brands of certain customers. In certain geographic areas we also: 

&#8226; 

retread truck, aviation and off-the-road, or OTR, tires, 

&#8226; 

manufacture and sell tread rubber and other tire retreading materials, 

&#8226; 

sell chemical products, and 

&#8226; 

provide automotive repair services and miscellaneous other products and services. 

Our principal products are new tires for most applications. Approximately 87% &#32;of our sales in 2015 &#32;and 2014 were for new tires, compared to 86% &#32;in 2013 . Sales of chemical products and natural rubber to unaffiliated customers were 2% &#32;in 2015 , 3% &#32;in 2014 &#32;and 4% &#32;in 2013 &#32;of our consolidated sales ( 5% , 7% &#32;and 9% &#32;of North America&#8217;s total sales in 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively). The percentages of each segment&#8217;s sales attributable to new tires during the periods indicated were:

New tires are sold under highly competitive conditions throughout the world. On a worldwide basis, we have two major competitors: Bridgestone (based in Japan) and Michelin (based in France). Other significant competitors include Continental, Cooper, Hankook, Kumho, Pirelli, SRI, Toyo, Yokohama and various regional tire manufacturers. 

We compete with other tire manufacturers on the basis of product design, performance, price and terms, reputation, warranty terms, customer service and consumer convenience. Goodyear and Dunlop brand tires enjoy a high recognition factor and have a reputation for performance and product design. The Kelly, Debica, Sava and Fulda brands and various house brand tire lines offered by us, and tires manufactured and sold by us to private brand customers, compete primarily on the basis of value and price. 

Although we do not consider our tire businesses to be seasonal to any significant degree, we historically sell more replacement tires in EMEA during the third quarter.

North America is a major supplier of tires to most manufacturers of automobiles, trucks and aircraft that have production facilities located in North America. 

North America&#8217;s primary competitors are Bridgestone and Michelin. Other significant competitors include Continental, Cooper, Pirelli, and imports from other regions, primarily Asia. 

Goodyear, Dunlop and Kelly brand tires are sold in the United States and Canada through several channels of distribution. The principal channel for Goodyear brand tires is a large network of independent dealers. Goodyear, Dunlop and Kelly brand tires are also sold to numerous national and regional retail marketing firms and in Goodyear Company-owned stores in the United States. 

We are subject to regulation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (&#8220;NHTSA&#8221;), which has established various standards and regulations applicable to tires sold in the United States. NHTSA has the authority to order the recall of automotive products, including tires, having a defect related to motor vehicle safety. In addition, the Transportation Recall Enhancement, Accountability, and Documentation Act (the &#8220;TREAD Act&#8221;) imposes numerous reporting requirements with respect to tires. The TREAD Act also requires tire manufacturers, among other things, to remedy tire safety defects without charge for five years and comply with revised and more rigorous tire testing standards. NHTSA is also in the process of establishing national tire labeling regulations, under which certain tires sold in the United States will be required to be rated for rolling resistance, traction and tread wear.

Currency exchange control regulations and continued reductions in access to U.S. dollars through official currency exchange mechanisms have restricted the ability of our Venezuelan subsidiary to pay dividends and royalties and to settle liabilities. These conditions, combined with other government regulations such as price and profit margin controls and strict labor laws, have increasingly limited our ability to make and execute operational decisions at our Venezuelan subsidiary. We concluded that we no longer meet the accounting criteria for control and, as a result, we deconsolidated our Venezuelan subsidiary on December 31, 2015.

In 2012, Brazil adopted a tire labeling regulation, which took effect in 2015 and set requirements for tire certification and labeling for rolling resistance, wet grip braking and noise for all radial passenger car, light truck and commercial truck tires sold in that country. The adoption of labeling regulations is in two phases, with labeling of certain new products required in 2015 and labeling of all tires required by the end of 2016. 

GENERAL BUSINESS INFORMATION 

Sources and Availability of Raw Materials 

The principal raw materials used by Goodyear are synthetic and natural rubber. Synthetic rubber accounts for approximately 60% of all rubber consumed by us on an annual basis. Our plants located in Beaumont and Houston, Texas supply a major portion of our global synthetic rubber requirements. We purchase all of our requirements for natural rubber in the world market. 

Other important raw materials and components we use are carbon black, steel cord, fabrics and petrochemical-based commodities. Substantially all of these raw materials and components are purchased from independent suppliers, except for certain chemicals we manufacture. We purchase most raw materials and components in significant quantities from several suppliers, except in those instances where only one or a few qualified sources are available. We anticipate the continued availability of all raw materials and components we will require during 2016 , subject to spot shortages and unexpected disruptions caused by natural disasters such as hurricanes and other similar events. 

Substantial quantities of fuel and other petrochemical-based commodities are used in the production of tires, synthetic rubber and other products. Supplies of such fuels and commodities have been and are expected to continue to be available to us in quantities sufficient to satisfy our anticipated requirements, subject to spot shortages. 

In 2015 , raw material costs decreased by approximately 11% in our tire businesses compared to 2014 , primarily driven by a decrease in natural and synthetic rubber prices and cost savings initiatives during 2015. For the full year of 2016 , we expect our raw material costs, including raw material cost savings, will decline approximately 9% compared to 2015 . However, natural and synthetic rubber prices and other commodity prices have experienced significant volatility, and this estimate could change significantly based on fluctuations in the cost of these and other key raw materials. 

Patents and Trademarks 

We own approximately 2,000 &#32;product, process and equipment patents issued by the United States Patent Office and approximately 3,500 &#32;patents issued or granted in other countries around the world. We have approximately 500 &#32;applications for United States patents pending and approximately 2,200 &#32;patent applications on file in other countries around the world. While such patents and patent applications as a group are important, we do not consider any patent or patent application to be of such importance that the loss or expiration thereof would materially affect Goodyear or any business segment. 

We own, control or use approximately 1,700 &#32;different trademarks, including several using the word &#8220;Goodyear&#8221; or the word &#8220;Dunlop.&#8221; Approximately 13,200 &#32;registrations and 700 &#32;pending applications worldwide protect these trademarks. While such trademarks as a group are important, the only trademarks we consider material to our business, or to the business of any of our segments, are those using the word &#8220;Goodyear,&#8221; and with respect to certain of our international business segments, those using the word &#8220;Dunlop.&#8221; We believe our trademarks are valid and most are of unlimited duration as long as they are adequately protected and appropriately used. 

Backlog 

Our backlog of orders is not considered material to, or a significant factor in, evaluating and understanding any of our business segments or our businesses considered as a whole. 

Research and Development 

Our direct and indirect expenditures on research, development and certain engineering activities relating to the design, development and significant modification of new and existing products and services and the formulation and design of new, and significant improvements to existing, manufacturing processes and equipment during the periods indicated were:

Employees 

At December 31, 2015 , we employed approximately 66,000 full-time and temporary people throughout the world, including approximately 36,000 people covered under collective bargaining agreements. Approximately 6,700 &#32;of our employees in the United States are covered by a master collective bargaining agreement with the United Steelworkers ("USW"), which expires in July 2017. Approximately 21,000 &#32;of our employees outside of the United States are covered by union contracts that currently have expired or that will expire in 2016 , primarily in Germany, Brazil and South Africa. In addition, approximately 1,000 &#32;of our employees in the United States are covered by other contracts with the USW and various other unions. Unions represent the major portion of our employees in Europe and Latin America. 

Compliance with Environmental Regulations 

We are subject to extensive regulation under environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations. These laws and regulations relate to, among other things, air emissions, discharges to surface and underground waters and the generation, handling, storage, transportation and disposal of waste materials and hazardous substances. We have several continuing programs designed to ensure compliance with Federal, state and local environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations. We expect capital expenditures for pollution control facilities and occupational safety and health projects to be $35 million to $45 million &#32;annually in 2016 &#32;and 2017 . 

We also incur ongoing expenses to maintain and operate our pollution control facilities and conduct our other environmental activities, including the control and disposal of hazardous substances. These expenditures are expected to be sufficient to comply with existing environmental laws and regulations and are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our competitive position. 

In the future, we may incur increased costs and additional charges associated with environmental compliance and cleanup projects necessitated by the identification of new waste sites, the impact of new environmental laws and regulatory standards, or the availability of new technologies. Compliance with Federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations in the future may require a material increase in our capital expenditures and could adversely affect our earnings and competitive position. 

INFORMATION ABOUT INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS 

We engage in manufacturing and/or sales operations in most countries in the world, often through subsidiary companies. We have manufacturing operations in 22 &#32;countries, including the United States. Most of our international manufacturing operations are engaged in the production of tires.
