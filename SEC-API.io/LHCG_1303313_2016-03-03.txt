Business. 

Overview 

We provide post-acute health care services to patients through our home nursing agencies, hospice agencies, community-based services agencies, and long-term acute care hospitals (&#8220;LTACHs&#8221;). As of December 31, 2015 , through our wholly- and majority-owned subsidiaries, equity joint ventures and controlled affiliates, we operated in 363 &#32;service providers in 25 &#32;states within the continental United States. We operate in four segments: home health services, hospice services, community-based services, and facility-based services, the latter through our LTACHs. 

Our home health service locations offer a wide range of services, including skilled nursing, medically-oriented social services and physical, occupational, and speech therapy. The nurses, home health aides, and therapists in our home health agencies work closely with patients and their families to design and implement individualized treatment plans in accordance with a physician-prescribed plan of care. As of December 31, 2015 , we operated 283 &#32;home health service locations, of which 168 &#32;are wholly-owned by us, 109 &#32;are majority-owned by us through equity joint ventures, three &#32;are under license lease arrangements, and the operations of the remaining three &#32;locations are managed by us. 

Our hospices provide end-of-life care to patients with terminal illnesses through interdisciplinary teams of physicians, nurses, home health aides, counselors, and volunteers. We offer a wide range of services, including pain and symptom management, emotional and spiritual support, inpatient and respite care, homemaker services, and counseling. As of December 31, 2015 , we operated 56 &#32;hospice locations, of which 43 &#32;are wholly-owned by us, 11 &#32;are majority-owned by us through equity joint ventures, and two &#32;are under license lease arrangements. 

Our community-based service locations offer assistance with activities of daily living to elderly, chronically ill, and disabled patients. As of December 31, 2015 , we operated 13 &#32;locations, of which 12 &#32;are wholly-owned by us and 1 &#32;is majority-owned by us through an equity joint venture. 

Our LTACH locations provide services primarily to patients with complex medical conditions who have transitioned out of a hospital intensive care unit but whose conditions remain too severe for treatment in a non-acute setting. As of December 31, 2015 , our LTACHs had 223 licensed beds. We own and operate six LTACHs with eight locations, of which all but one are located within host hospitals. We also own and operate a pharmacy, a family health center, and a family health clinic. Of these 11 facility-based services locations, six are wholly-owned by us and five are majority-owned by us through equity joint ventures. 

Our net service revenue by segment for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 &#32;was as follows (amounts in thousands):

Our founders began operations in September 1994 as St. Landry Home Health, Inc. in Palmetto, Louisiana. After several years of expansion, our founders reorganized their business and began operating as Louisiana Healthcare Group, Inc. in June 2000. In March 2001, Louisiana Healthcare Group, Inc. reorganized and became a wholly owned subsidiary of The Healthcare Group, Inc., a Louisiana business corporation. In December 2002, The Healthcare Group, Inc. merged into LHC Group, LLC, a Louisiana limited liability company, with LHC Group, LLC being the surviving entity. In January 2005, LHC Group, LLC established a wholly owned Delaware subsidiary, LHC Group, Inc. and on February 9, 2005, LHC Group, LLC merged into LHC Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation with LHC Group, Inc. being the surviving entity. Our principal executive offices are located at 901 Hugh Wallis Road, South, Lafayette, Louisiana, 70508. Our telephone number is (337) 233-1307. Our website is www.lhcgroup.com . Information contained on our website is not part of or incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Business Strategy 

Our objective is to become the leading provider of home health, hospice, and community-based services in the United States. To achieve this objective, we intend to: 

Drive internal growth in existing markets . We intend to drive internal growth in our current markets by increasing the number of health care providers from whom we receive referrals and by expanding the breadth of our services in each market. We intend to achieve this growth by: (1) continuing to educate health care providers about the benefits of our services, (2) reinforcing the position of our agencies and facilities as community assets, (3) maintaining our emphasis on high-quality medical care for our patients, (4) identifying related products and services needed by our patients and their communities, and (5) providing a superior work environment for our employees. 

Achieve margin improvement through the active management of costs . The majority of our net service revenue is generated under the Medicare prospective payment systems (&#8220;PPS&#8221;) through which we are paid pre-determined rates based upon the clinical condition and severity of the patients in our care. Because our profitability in a fixed payment system depends upon our ability to manage the costs of providing care, we continue to pursue initiatives to improve our margins and net income. 

Expand into new markets. We intend to continue expanding into new markets by utilizing our point of care technology, developing de novo locations, and acquiring existing Medicare and/or Medicaid-certified agencies in attractive markets throughout the United States. We will also continue our unique strategy of partnering with hospitals and health systems, as these ventures provide significant return on investment. We also plan to acquire larger freestanding agencies that can serve as growth platforms in markets we do not currently serve in order to support our growth into new markets. 

Pursue strategic acquisitions and develop joint ventures . We will continue to identify and evaluate opportunities for strategic acquisitions in new and existing markets that will enhance our market position, increase our referral base, and expand the breadth of services we offer. We endeavor to joint venture with hospitals to provide post-acute services, such as home health, hospice, and community-based services. 

Services 

We provide post-acute care services in the United States by providing quality cost-effective health care services to patients within the comfort and privacy of their home, place of residence, or long-term acute care hospital facility. Our services can be broadly classified into four principal categories: (1) home health services, (2) hospice services, (3) community-based services, and (4) facility-based services offered through our LTACHs. 

Home Health Services 

Our registered nurses and licensed practical nurses provide a variety of medically necessary services to homebound patients who are suffering from acute or chronic illness, recovering from injury or surgery, or who otherwise require caring, teaching or monitoring. These services include, but are not limited to: 

&#8226; 

wound care and dressing changes, 

&#8226; 

cardiac rehabilitation, 

&#8226; 

infusion therapy, 

&#8226; 

pain management, 

&#8226; 

pharmaceutical administration, 

&#8226; 

skilled observation and assessment, and 

&#8226; 

patient education. 

We have also designed proprietary guidelines to treat chronic diseases and conditions, including diabetes, hypertension, arthritis, Alzheimer&#8217;s disease, low vision, spinal stenosis, Parkinson&#8217;s disease, osteoporosis, complex wound care, and chronic pain. Through our medical social workers, we counsel patients and their families with regard to financial, personal, and social concerns that arise from a patient&#8217;s health-related problems. We provide skilled nursing, ventilator and tracheotomy services, extended care specialties, medication administration and management, and patient and family assistance and education. We also provide management services to third-party home nursing agencies, often as an interim solution until proper state and regulatory approvals for an acquisition can be obtained. 

Our physical, occupational and speech therapists provide therapy services to patients in their home. Our therapists coordinate multi-disciplinary treatment plans with physicians, nurses and social workers to restore basic mobility skills such as getting out of bed and walking safely with crutches or a walker. As part of the treatment and rehabilitation process, a therapist will stretch and strengthen muscles, test balance and coordination abilities, and teach home exercise programs. Our therapists assist patients and their families with improving and maintaining a patient&#8217;s ability to perform functional activities of daily living, such as the ability to dress, cook, clean, and manage other activities safely in the home environment. Our speech and language therapists provide corrective and rehabilitative treatment to patients who suffer from physical or cognitive deficits or disorders that create difficulty with verbal communication or swallowing. 

All of our home nursing agencies offer 24-hour personal emergency response system and support services through a third-party service provider ("PERS") for qualified patients who require intensive medical monitoring, but want to maintain an independent lifestyle. These services consist principally of a communicator that connects to the telephone line in the patient&#8217;s home and a personal help button that is worn or carried by the individual patient that, when activated, initiates a telephone call from the patient&#8217;s communicator to PERS's central monitoring facilities. Their trained personnel identify the nature and extent of the patient&#8217;s particular need and notify the patient&#8217;s family members, neighbors, and/or emergency personnel, as needed. 

We believe our use of this system increases patient satisfaction and loyalty by providing our patients a point of contact between scheduled nursing visits. As a result, we believe that we provide a more complete regimen of care management than our competitors in the markets in which we operate by offering this service to qualified patients as part of their home health plan of care. 

Hospice Services &#32; 

Our Medicare-certified hospice operations provide a full range of hospice services designed to meet the individual physical, spiritual, and psychosocial needs of terminally ill patients and their families. Our hospice services are primarily provided in a patient&#8217;s home, but can also be provided in a nursing home, assisted living facility or hospital. The key services provided through our hospice agencies include pain and symptom management accompanied by palliative medication, emotional, and spiritual support, inpatient and respite care, homemaker services, dietary counseling, and family bereavement counseling and social worker visits for up to 13 months after a patient&#8217;s death. 

Community-Based Services 

Our community-based service operations offer a wide range of services to patients in their home or in a medical facility. The services range from assistance with grooming, medication reminders, meal preparation, assistance with feeding, light housekeeping, respite care, transportation, and errand services. 

Facility-Based Services 

Long-term Acute Care Hospitals . Our LTACHs treat patients with severe medical conditions who require a high-level of care and frequent monitoring by physicians and other clinical personnel. Patients who receive our services in an LTACH have been diagnosed as being too medically unstable for treatment in a non-acute setting. For example, our LTACHs typically serve patients suffering from respiratory failure, neuromuscular disorders, cardiac disorders, non-healing wounds, renal disorders, cancer, head and neck injuries, and mental disorders. We also treat patients diagnosed with musculoskeletal impairments that restrict their ability to perform normal activities of daily living. 

Other . &#32;As part of our facility-based services, we operate an institutional pharmacy, which focuses on providing a full array of services to our LTACHs, a family health center, and a family health clinic. 

Operations 

Financial information relating to the home health, hospice, community-based, and facility-based operating segments of our business, including their contributions to our net service revenue, operating income, and total assets for each of the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively, is found in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Our home health agencies are operated in one segment that is separated into four geographical regions and further separated into individual operating areas. Our hospice agencies are operated in one segment that is separated into four geographical regions. Our community-based agencies are operated in one segment within one geographic region. Each of our home health agencies is staffed with experienced clinical home health and administrative professionals who provide a wide range of patient care services. Each of our home health agencies, hospice agencies, and community-based agencies are licensed and certified by the state and federal governments. As of December 31, 2015 , 268 of our 283 &#32;home health service locations and 34 of our 56 &#32;hospice service locations were accredited by the Joint Commission, a nationwide commission that establishes standards relating to the facilities, administration, quality of patient care, and operation of medical staffs of hospitals. Those not yet accredited are working towards achieving this accreditation, a process which can take up to six months. As we acquire companies, we apply for accreditation 12 to 18 months after completing the acquisition. 

Our facility-based service locations are operated in one segment within one geographic region. Our facility-based services follow a clinical approach under which each patient is discussed in weekly, multidisciplinary team meetings. In these meetings, patient progress is assessed and compared to goals and future goals are set. We believe that this model results in higher quality care and more predictable discharge patterns and avoids unnecessary delays. 

Our home health service locations use our Service Value Point system, a proprietary clinical resource allocation model and cost management system. The system is a quantitative tool that assigns a target level of resource units to a group of patients based upon their initial assessment and estimated skilled nursing and therapy needs. The Service Value Point system allows the Director of Nursing or Branch Manager to allocate adequate resources throughout the group of patients assigned to his or her care, rather than focusing on the profitability of an individual patient. 

Patient care is coordinated on-site at the agency level of each home health service, hospice service, and community-based service location. All coding, medical records, case management, utilization review, and medical staff credentialing are provided on-site at the hospital level of each facility-based service location. Centralized functions such as payroll, accounting, financial reporting, billing, collections, regulatory and legal compliance, risk management, pharmacy, information technology, and general clinical oversight accomplished by periodic on-site surveys are provided from our executive offices. 

Joint Ventures 

As of December 31, 2015 , we had 64 equity joint ventures including 57 with hospitals, four with physicians, and three with other parties. We also operated three agency license leasing agreements. 

Equity Joint Ventures 

Our equity joint ventures are generally structured as limited liability companies in which we own a majority equity interest and our partner(s) own(s) a minority equity interest. At the time of formation, each party contributes capital to the equity joint venture in the form of cash or property. We believe that the amount contributed by each party to the equity joint venture represents their pro-rata portion of the fair market value of the equity joint venture, and we maintain processes to confirm and document those determinations. None of our equity joint venture partners are required to make or influence referrals to our equity joint ventures. In fact, agreements with our hospital joint venture partners, which make up 89% of our equity joint venture partners, require that they follow the same Medicare discharge planning regulations, that, among other things, require the hospitals to offer each Medicare patient a list of available Medicare-certified home nursing agency options and to allow the patient to choose his or her own provider. 

We structure our equity joint ventures as either manager-managed or board-managed. We control our manager-managed joint ventures, since LHC Group, Inc. is typically designated as the manager to oversee the day-to-day operations of the joint venture. We control our board-managed joint ventures, since we typically hold a majority of the votes required to take board action and/or we control the senior officer positions, although a majority of our joint ventures require super majority board approval for certain actions. Our equity joint venture partners participate in the profits and losses of the joint venture in proportion to their equity interests. Distributions from our equity joint ventures are made pro-rata based on percentage ownership interests and are not based on referrals made to the equity joint venture by any of the partners. 

The 64 equity joint ventures individually contribute between 0.02% and 3.46% of our consolidated net service revenue, with only two of the equity joint ventures accounting for greater than 3% of our consolidated net service revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 . 

Most of our equity joint ventures include a buy/sell option that grants to us and our equity joint venture partners the right to require the other party to either purchase all of the exercising member&#8217;s membership interests or sell to the exercising member all of the non-exercising member&#8217;s membership interests, at the non-exercising member&#8217;s option, within 30 days of the receipt of notice of the exercise of the buy/sell option. In some instances, the purchase price under these buy/sell provisions is based on a multiple of the historical or future earnings before income taxes, depreciation and amortization of the equity joint venture at the time the buy/sell option is exercised. In other instances, the buy/sell purchase price will be negotiated by the parties but will be subject to a fair market valuation process. 

License Leasing Agreements 

As of December 31, 2015 , we had three license leasing agreements, through our wholly-owned subsidiaries, granting us the right to use the lessors' home health licenses necessary to operate home nursing agencies and hospice agencies. These license leasing agreements are entered into when state law would otherwise prohibit the sale and transfer of the agency. The table below details the monthly fees and termination dates of the license leasing agreements.

In all three license leasing agreements, we have a right of first refusal in the event that the lessor intends to sell the agency to a third party. 

Management Services Agreements 

As of December 31, 2015 , we had three management services agreements under which we manage the operations of home nursing agencies. We do not have ownership interest in these home nursing agencies. Instead, for a fee, we provide billing, management, and other consulting services suited to and designed for the efficient operation of the home nursing agency. We are responsible for the costs associated with the locations and personnel required for the provision of services. Under one management services agreement, we are compensated based on a percentage of cash collections for the agency, and under the other two management services agreements we are reimbursed for operating expenses and receive a percentage of the operating net income of the agencies. The term of these management 

services agreements is typically five years, with an option to renew for an additional five-year term. All management services agreements will automatically renew annually unless either party gives written notice of termination. 

We record management services revenue as services are provided in accordance with the management services agreements. 

Competition 

The home health care market is highly fragmented. According to the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, an independent agency that advises Congress on various Medicare issues (&#8220;MedPac&#8221;), there were approximately 12,613 Medicare-certified home nursing agencies in the United States in 2013. In 2015, MedPac estimated that approximately 16% of Medicare-certified home health agencies provided a majority of their services in rural areas, and 89% of agencies were proprietary. We believe we are well positioned to build and maintain long-term relationships with local hospitals, physicians, and other health care providers and to become the highest quality post-acute provider in our markets. In our experience, because most rural areas do not have the population size to support more than one or two general acute care hospitals, the local community hospital often plays a significant role in rural market health care delivery systems. Rural patients who require home nursing frequently receive care from a small home care agency or an agency that, while owned and run by the local community hospital, is not an area of focus for that hospital. Similarly, patients in these markets who require services typically offered by LTACHs are more likely to remain in the community hospital because it is often the only local facility equipped to deal with severe and complex medical conditions. We choose to enter these rural markets through affiliations with local hospitals, since we typically experience significantly less competition for the services we provide. 

As we expand into new markets, we may encounter competitors that have greater resources or greater access to capital. Generally, competition in our home health service markets comes from small local and regional providers. These providers include facility- and hospital-based providers, visiting nurse associations, and nurse registries. We are unaware of any competitor offering our breadth of services and focusing on the needs of rural markets. 

Although several publicly-held and privately-owned national and regional companies own or manage LTACHs, they generally do not operate in the rural markets that we serve. Generally, competition in our facility-based service markets comes from local health care providers. We believe our diverse service offerings, collaborative approach to working with health care providers, business experience gained from focusing on rural markets and patient-oriented operating model provide our principal competitive advantages over local providers. 

Quality Control 

The LHC Group Quality Department, led by our Chief Clinical Officer, is responsible for formulating quality of care indicators, identifying performance improvement priorities, and facilitating best-practices for quality care. Company-wide, we have adopted a &#8220;Plan, Do, Check, Act&#8221; methodology for our quality/performance improvement activities and initiatives. We also set forth a quality platform that reviews: 

&#8226; 

performance improvement audits; 

&#8226; 

Joint Commission accreditation; 

&#8226; 

state and regulatory surveys; 

&#8226; 

publicly reported quality data; and 

&#8226; 

patient perception of care. 

The Quality Department is also responsible for ensuring that the infrastructure of the quality initiatives throughout the Company is appropriate, for overseeing and evaluating the effectiveness of the quality plans and initiatives, and for recommending appropriate quality and performance improvement initiatives. 

The Clinical Quality Committee of the Board of Directors is responsible for advising our clinical leadership, monitoring the performance of our locations based on internal and external benchmarks, overseeing and evaluating the effectiveness of the performance improvement and quality plans, facilitating best practices based on internal and external comparisons, and fostering enhanced awareness of clinical performance by the Board of Directors. 

As part of our ongoing quality control, internal auditing, and monitoring programs, we conduct internal regulatory audits and mock surveys at each of our agencies and facilities at least once a year. If an agency or facility does not achieve a satisfactory rating, we require that it prepare and implement a plan of correction. We then follow-up to verify that all deficiencies identified in the initial audit and survey have been corrected. 

As required under the Medicare conditions of participation, we maintain a continuous quality improvement program, which involves: 

&#8226; 

ongoing education of staff and quarterly continuous quality improvement meetings at each of our agencies, facilities and principal executive offices; 

&#8226; 

monthly comprehensive audits of patient charts performed at each of our agencies and facilities; 

&#8226; 

at least annually, a comprehensive survey readiness assessment on each of our agencies and facilities; 

&#8226; 

review of Home Health Compare scores; 

&#8226; 

assessment of patient&#8217;s and/or family member&#8217;s perception of care using Press Ganey, SHP and Deyta; and 

&#8226; 

assessment of infection control practices and risk events. 

We constantly expand and refine our continuous quality improvement programs. Specific written policies, procedures, training, and educational materials and programs, as well as auditing and monitoring activities, have been prepared and implemented to address the functional and operational aspects of our business. Our programs also address specific areas identified for improvement through regulatory interpretation and enforcement activities. We believe our consistent focus on continuous quality improvement programs provide us with a competitive advantage in the markets we serve. 

Compliance 

We have established and continually maintain a comprehensive compliance and ethics program that is designed to assist all of our employees to exceed applicable standards established by federal and state laws and regulations and industry practice. Our goal is to foster and maintain the highest standards of compliance, ethics, integrity, and professionalism in every aspect of our business dealings, and we utilize our compliance and ethics program to assist our employees toward achieving that goal. 

The purpose of our compliance and ethics program is to promote and foster compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements, the requirements of the Medicare and Medicaid programs and other government healthcare programs, industry standards, our Code of Conduct and Ethics, and our other policies and procedures that support and enhance overall compliance within our Company. Our compliance and ethics program focuses on regulations related to the federal False Claims Act, the Stark Law, the federal Anti-Kickback Law, billing and overall adherence to health care regulations. 

To ensure the independence of our compliance department staff, we have implemented the following: 

&#8226; 

our Chief Compliance Officer reports to and has direct oversight by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors; 

&#8226; 

our compliance department has its own operating budget; and 

&#8226; 

our compliance department has the authority to independently investigate any compliance or ethical concerns, including, when deemed necessary, the authority to interview any company personnel, access any company property (including electronic communications) and engage counsel to assist in any investigation. 

Among other activities, our compliance department staff is responsible for the following activities: 

&#8226; 

drafting and revising the Company&#8217;s policies and procedures related to compliance and ethics issues; 

&#8226; 

reviewing, making recommended revisions, disseminating and tracking attestations to our Code of Conduct and Ethics; 

&#8226; 

measuring compliance with our policies and procedures, Code of Conduct and Ethics and legal and regulatory requirements related to the Medicare and Medicaid programs and other government healthcare programs, laws and regulations; 

&#8226; 

developing and providing compliance-related training and education to all of our employees and, as appropriate, directors, contractors and other representatives and agents, including new-hire compliance training for all new employees, annual compliance training for all employees, sales compliance training to all members of our sales team, billing compliance training to all members of our billing and revenue cycle team and other job-specific and role-based compliance training of certain employees; 

&#8226; 

performing an annual company-wide risk assessment; 

&#8226; 

implementing an annual compliance auditing and monitoring work plan and performing and following up on various risk-based auditing and monitoring activities, including both clinical and non-clinical auditing and monitoring activities at the corporate level and at the local agency/facility level; 

&#8226; 

developing, implementing and overseeing our Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (&#8220;HIPAA&#8221;) privacy and security compliance program; 

&#8226; 

monitoring, responding to and overseeing the resolution of issues and concerns raised through our anonymous compliance hotline; 

&#8226; 

monitoring, responding to and resolving all compliance and ethics-related issues and concerns raised through any other form of communication; 

&#8226; 

ensuring that we take appropriate corrective and disciplinary action when noncompliant or improper conduct is identified; and 

&#8226; 

monitoring, measuring and reporting on the Company&#8217;s compliance with its corporate integrity agreement with the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services (&#8220;OIG&#8221;), including, without limitation, reviewing, revising and distributing the Code of Conduct and Ethics and compliance-related policies and procedures, reviewing revising and distributing all required training, assisting the independent review organization with its review procedures, overseeing the 

timely repayment of any identified overpayments, overseeing the timely reporting of any reportable events and ensuring the timely submission of the Company&#8217;s annual reports to the OIG. 

All employees are required to report incidents, issues or other concerns that they believe in good faith may be in violation of our Code of Conduct and Ethics, our policies and procedures, applicable legal and regulatory requirements or the requirements of the Medicare and Medicaid programs and other government health care programs. All employees are encouraged to either contact our Chief Compliance Officer directly or to contact our 24-hour toll-free compliance hotline when they have questions or concerns about any compliance or ethics issues. All reports to our compliance hotline are kept confidential to the extent allowed by law, and employees have the option to remain anonymous. When cases reported to our compliance hotline involve a compliance or ethics issue or any possible violation of law or regulation, the matter is referred to the compliance department for investigation. Retaliation against employees in connection with reporting compliance or ethical concerns is considered a serious violation of our Code of Conduct and Ethics, and, if it occurs, will result in discipline, up to and including termination of employment. 

We continually expand and refine our compliance and ethics programs. We promote a culture of compliance, ethics, integrity and professionalism within the Company through persistent messages from our senior leadership concerning the necessity of strict compliance with legal requirements and company policies and procedures. We believe our consistent focus on our compliance and ethics program provides us with a competitive advantage in the markets we serve. 

Technology and Intellectual Property 

Our Service Value Point system is a proprietary information system that assists us in, among other things, monitoring clinical utilization and other cost factors, supporting our health care management techniques, internal benchmarking, clinical analysis, outcomes monitoring and claims generation, revenue cycle management, and revenue reporting at our home nursing agencies. We were issued a patent for our Service Value Point system during 2009 by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. This proprietary home nursing clinical resource and cost management system is a quantitative tool that assigns a target level of resource units to each patient based upon our staff's initial assessment of the patient's estimated skilled nursing and therapy needs. We designed this system to empower our direct care employees to make appropriate day-to-day clinical care decisions while also allowing us to monitor and manage the quality and delivery of care across our system, including the cost of providing that care, on both a patient-specific and agency-specific basis. 

In addition to our Service Value Point system, our business is substantially dependent on non-proprietary software. For example, we utilize a third-party software information system for billing and maintaining patient claim receivables for our LTACHs. Also, as of December 31, 2015 , our home nursing and hospice agencies primarily utilized commercially-available billing and patient claim systems. 

During 2014, we successfully completed the roll out of our point of care (&#8220;POC&#8221;) strategy. Our POC system allows a visiting clinician to access records and other information from the patient&#8217;s home or at the POC, complete required documentation at the POC and submit it electronically into our patient record system. As of December 31, 2015 , all of our home nursing and hospice locations were utilizing our POC system. 

Technology plays a key role in our ability to expand operations and maintain effective managerial control. The software we use is based on client-server technology and is highly scalable. We believe our software and systems are flexible, easy-to-use and allow us to accommodate further growth. We believe that our ability to build and enhance our information and software systems provides us with a competitive advantage that allows us to grow our business in a cost-efficient manner and provide better patient care. 

Reimbursement 

Medicare 

The federal government&#8217;s Medicare program, governed by the Social Security Act of 1965 (the &#8220;Social Security Act&#8221;), reimburses health care providers for services furnished to Medicare beneficiaries. These beneficiaries generally include persons age 65 and older and those who are chronically disabled. The program is primarily administered by the Department of Health and Human Services (&#8220;HHS&#8221;) and the Centers for Medicare &#38; Medicaid Services (&#8220;CMS&#8221;). Medicare payments accounted for 74.5% , 75.9% &#32;and 79.8% &#32;of our net service revenue for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively. Medicare reimburses us based upon the setting in which we provide our services or the Medicare category in which those services fall. 

In 2011, sequestration was implemented in the Budget Control Act of 2011(BCA, P.L. 112-25) as a tool in federal budget control. The sequestration cut to Medicare payments began on April 1, 2013, and reduced Medicare payments for patients whose service dates ended on or after April 1, 2013 by 2%. Absent any additional Congressional action, the 2% sequestration cuts are planned to continue through 2023. 

Home Health 

The Medicare home nursing benefit is available to patients who need care following discharge from a hospital, as well as patients who suffer from chronic conditions that require ongoing intermittent care. While the services received need not be rehabilitative or of a finite duration, patients who require full-time skilled nursing for an extended period of time generally do not qualify for Medicare home nursing benefits. As a condition of coverage under Medicare, beneficiaries must: (1) be homebound, meaning they are unable to leave 

their home without a considerable and taxing effort; (2) require intermittent skilled nursing, physical therapy or speech therapy services that are covered by Medicare; and (3) receive treatment under a plan of care that is established and periodically reviewed by a physician. Qualifying patients also may receive reimbursement for occupational therapy, medical social services and home health aide services if these additional services are part of a plan of care prescribed by a physician. 

We receive a standard prospective Medicare payment for delivering care over a 60-day episode of care. There is no limit to the number of episodes a beneficiary may receive as long as he or she remains eligible. The base episode payment is a flat rate that is adjusted upward or downward based upon differences in the expected resource needs of individual patients as indicated by clinical severity, functional severity and service utilization. The magnitude of the adjustment is determined by each patient&#8217;s categorization into one of 153 payment groups, known as Home Health Resource Groups and the costliness of care for patients in each group relative to the average patient. Payment is further adjusted for differences in local labor costs using the hospital wage index. We bill and are reimbursed for services in two stages: an initial request for advance payment when the episode commences and a final claim when the episode is completed. We submit all Medicare claims through the Medicare Administrative Contractors for the federal government. We receive 60% of the estimated payment for a patient&#8217;s initial episode up-front (after the initial assessment is completed and upon initial billing) and the remaining 40% upon completion of the episode and after all final treatment orders are signed by the physician. In the event of subsequent episodes, reimbursement timing is 50% up-front and 50% upon completion of the episode. Final payments may reflect one of four retroactive adjustments to ensure the adequacy and effectiveness of the total reimbursement: (1) an outlier payment if the patient&#8217;s care was unusually costly; (2) a low utilization adjustment if the number of visits was fewer than five; (3) a partial payment if the patient transferred to another provider before completing the episode; or (4) a payment adjustment based upon the level of therapy services required in the population base. Because such adjustments are determined upon the completion date of the episode, retroactive adjustments could impact our financial results. 

In 2011, CMS finalized two provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (&#8220;the PPACA&#8221;) that substantially impact our business. First, as a condition for Medicare payment, the PPACA mandates that prior to certifying a patient&#8217;s eligibility for home health services, the certifying physician must document that he or she, or allowed non-physician practitioner, had a face-to-face encounter with the patient that relates to the condition for which the patient receives home health services. The face-to-face encounter must occur within 90 days prior to the start of care or 30 days after the start of care. Documentation regarding these encounters must be present in the patient's home health medical record. In 2015, documentation supporting these encounters must be in the certifying physician's or hospital medical record. 

Beginning in 2015, CMS also made important changes to therapy assessment requirements. A professional qualified therapist assessment must take place at least once every 30 days during a therapy patient&#8217;s course of treatment. 

We verify a patient&#8217;s eligibility for home health benefits at the time of admission. Through the verification process we are able to determine the payor source and eligibility for reimbursement of each patient. Accordingly, we do not have material amounts of reimbursements pending approval based on the eligibility of a patient to receive reimbursement from the applicable payor program. Further, we provide only limited services to patients who are ineligible for reimbursement from a third party payor. Therefore, we do not have any material amounts of reimbursements due from patients who are self-pay. 

The base payment rate for Medicare home nursing was $2,961.38 per 60-day episode for the year ended December 31, 2015 . The base payment rate does not include the 2% reduction to Medicare payment through sequestration as mandated by the Budget Control Act of 2011. 

Home health payment rates are updated annually by the home health market basket percentage as adjusted by Congress. CMS establishes the home health market basket index, which measures inflation in the prices of an appropriate mix of goods and services included in home health services. 

Hospice 

In order for a Medicare beneficiary to qualify for the Medicare hospice benefit, two physicians must certify that, in their clinical judgment, the beneficiary has less than six months to live, assuming the beneficiary&#8217;s disease runs its normal course. In addition, the Medicare beneficiary must affirmatively elect hospice care and waive any rights to other Medicare curative benefits related to his or her terminal illness. At the end of each benefit period (described below), a physician must recertify that the Medicare beneficiary&#8217;s life expectancy is six months or less in order for the beneficiary to continue to qualify for and to receive the Medicare hospice benefit. The first two benefit periods are 90 days and subsequent benefit periods are 60 days. A Medicare beneficiary may revoke his or her election at any time and resume receiving traditional Medicare benefits. There is no limit on how long a Medicare beneficiary can receive hospice benefits and services, provided that the beneficiary continues to meet Medicare hospice eligibility criteria. 

Medicare reimburses for hospice care using one of four predetermined daily or hourly rates based upon the level of care we furnish to a beneficiary. These rates are subject to annual adjustments based on inflation and geographic wage considerations. The base Medicare rate for services that we provide to a beneficiary depends upon which of the following four levels of care we provide to that beneficiary: 

&#8226; 

Routine Care. &#32;Care that is not classified under any of the other levels of care, such as the work of nurses, social workers or home health aides. 

&#8226; 

General Inpatient Care. &#32;Pain control or acute or chronic symptom management that cannot be managed in a setting other than an inpatient Medicare certified facility, such as a hospital, skilled nursing facility or hospice inpatient facility. 

&#8226; 

Continuous Home Care. &#32;Care for patients experiencing a medical crisis that requires nursing services to achieve palliation and symptom control, if the agency provides a minimum of eight hours of care within a 24-hour period. 

&#8226; 

Respite Care. &#32;Short-term, inpatient care to give temporary relief to the caregiver who regularly provides care to the patient. 

Medicare limits the reimbursement we may receive for inpatient care services (both respite and general care) for hospice patients. Under the &#8220;80-20 rule,&#8221; if the number of inpatient care days of hospice care furnished by us to Medicare hospice beneficiaries under a unique provider number exceeds 20% of the total days of hospice care furnished by us to all Medicare hospice beneficiaries for both inpatient and in-home care, Medicare payments to us for inpatient care days exceeding the inpatient cap will be reduced to the routine home care rate, with excess amounts due back to Medicare. This determination is made annually based on the twelve-month period beginning on November 1 each year. Our Medicare hospice reimbursement is also subject to a cap amount calculated at the end of the hospice cap period, based on the twelve-month period beginning on November 1 each year, which determines the maximum allowable payments per provider. 

In 2011, CMS finalized a face-to-face encounter requirement for hospice reimbursement, mandating that a physician or qualifying nurse practitioner must certify a face-to-face encounter with the patient no later than the 30-day period prior to the 180 th -day recertification (beginning of the third benefit period) and each subsequent recertification in order to gather clinical findings that support continued hospice care. 

In the fiscal year 2016 hospice payment rule, CMS established a new two-tiered payment system for routine home care hospice services, which replaces the former single per diem routine home care rate. Effective January 1, 2016, hospices will be reimbursed at a higher routine home care rate ($186.84) for days 1 through 60 of a hospice episode of care and a lower rate ($146.83) for days 61 and beyond of a hospice episode of care. In this rule, CMS also provided for a Service Intensity Add-on increasing payments for routine home care services provided directly by registered nurses and social workers to hospice patients during the final seven days of life. 

Long-Term Acute Care Hospitals 

All Medicare payments to our LTACHs are made in accordance with a PPS specifically applicable to LTACHs, referred to as &#8220;LTACH-PPS.&#8221; The LTACH-PPS was established by CMS final regulations published in 2002, that require each patient discharged from an LTACH to be assigned a distinct long-term care diagnosis-related group (&#8220;MS-LTC-DRG&#8221;), which take into account (among other things) the severity of a patient's condition. Our LTACHs are paid a pre-determined fixed amount based upon the assigned MS-LTC-DRG (adjusted for area wage differences), which includes adjustments for short stay and high cost outlier patients (described in further detail below). The payment amount for each MS-LTC-DRG classification is intended to reflect the average cost of treating a Medicare patient assigned to that MS-LTC-DRG in an LTACH. 

Adjustments to MS-LTC-DRG payments might include: 

&#8226; 

Short Stay Outlier Policy. CMS has established a modified payment methodology for Medicare patients with a length-of-stay less than or equal to five-sixths of the geometric average length-of-stay for that particular MS-LTC-DRG, referred to as a short stay outlier, or &#8220;SSO.&#8221; When LTACH-PPS was established, SSO cases were paid based on the lesser of (1) 120% of the average cost of the case; (2) 120% of the LTC-DRG specific per diem amount multiplied by the patient&#8217;s length-of-stay; or (3) the full LTC-DRG payment. CMS modified the payment methodology for discharges occurring on or after July 1, 2006, which changed the limitation in clause (1) above to reduce payment for SSO cases to 100% (rather than 120%) of the average cost of the case, and also added a fourth limitation, potentially further limiting payment for SSO cases at a per diem rate derived from blending 120% of the MS-LTC-DRG specific per diem amount with a per diem rate based on the general acute care hospital inpatient prospective payment system, or &#8220;IPPS&#8221;. Under this methodology, as a patient&#8217;s length-of-stay increases, the percentage of the per diem amount based upon the IPPS component will decrease and the percentage based on the MS-LTC-DRG component will increase. 

&#8226; 

High Cost Outliers. Some cases are extraordinarily costly, producing losses that may be too large for healthcare providers to offset. Cases with unusually high costs, referred to as &#8220;high cost outliers,&#8221; receive a payment adjustment to reflect the additional resources utilized. CMS provides an additional payment if the estimated costs for the patient exceed the adjusted MS-LTC-DRG payment plus a fixed-loss amount that is established in the annual payment rate update. 

&#8226; 

Interrupted Stays. An interrupted stay occurs when an LTACH patient is admitted upon discharge to a general acute care hospital, inpatient rehab facility (&#8220;IRF&#8221;), skilled nursing facility or a swing-bed hospital and returns to the same LTACH within a specified period of time. If the length-of-stay at the receiving provider is equal to or less than the applicable fixed period of time, it is considered to be an interrupted stay case and is treated as a single discharge for the purposes of payment to the LTACH. 

Freestanding, HwH and Satellite LTACHs 

LTACHs may be organized and operated as freestanding facilities or as a hospital within a hospital, or &#8220;HwH&#8221;. An HwH is an LTACH that is located on the "campus" of another hospital, meaning the physical area immediately adjacent to a hospital&#8217;s main buildings, other areas and structures that are not strictly contiguous to a hospital&#8217;s main buildings but are located within 250 yards of its main buildings, and any other determined, on an individual case bases by the applicable CMS regional office, to be part of a hospital's campus. An LTACH that uses the same Medicare provider number of an affiliated &#8220;primary site&#8221; LTACH is known as a &#8220;satellite.&#8221; Under Medicare policy, a satellite LTACH must be located within 35 miles of its primary site LTACH and be administered by such primary site LTACH. As of December 31, 2015 , we had a total of eight LTACH facilities, with 223 licensed beds. Seven of our LTACH facilities were classified as HwHs and one was classified as freestanding. Of the seven HwH facilities, three were located in Metropolitan Statistical Area (&#8220;MSA&#8221;) or urban areas and four were located in non-MSA or rural areas. One of our HwH facilities was a satellite location of a parent hospital located in an MSA. Our single freestanding location was a remote campus site of a parent located in an MSA. 

An LTACH must have an average inpatient length-of-stay for Medicare patients (including both Medicare covered and non-covered days) of greater than 25 days during each annual cost reporting period. LTACHs that fail to exceed an average length-of-stay of 25 days during any cost reporting period may be paid under the general acute care hospital IPPS. CMS clarified its policy on the calculation of the average length-of-stay by specifying that all data on all Medicare inpatient days, including Medicare Advantage days, must be included in the average length-of-stay calculation effective for cost reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2012. 

Fiscal Year 2015 Rates 

On August 4, 2014, CMS released its final rule for LTACH Medicare reimbursement for fiscal year 2015 (affecting discharges and cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2014 through September 30, 2015). In aggregate, payments for fiscal year 2015 increased by 1.1% over fiscal year 2014 rates. The 1.1% increase consists of a 2.9% inflationary market basket update, offset by a 0.5% reduction for the productivity adjustment, and a 0.2% reduction to the market basket as defined by PPACA. LTACH payment rates were also reduced by approximately 1.3% for the "one-time" budget neutrality adjustment factor under the last year of a three-year phase in and increased by 0.2% for wage index budget neutrality adjustment. 

The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 &#32;&#8220;BBA 2013&#8221; included the following changes in LTACH policies: 

LTACH Patient Criteria : Effective for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2015, Medicare payment for LTACH services will change based on certain new patient criteria. To be paid at the full Medicare LTACH-PPS rate, a patient discharged from an LTACH must either (1) have a short-term acute care hospital stay including a three day length-of-stay in an intensive care unit during that hospitalization preceding the LTACH stay, or (2) receive ventilator services for more than 96 hours while hospitalized in the LTACH. In addition such patients cannot be hospitalized in an LTACH for a psychiatric or rehabilitation diagnosis. 

Site Neutral Payment : Also effective for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2015, all other Medicare discharges from LTACHs will be paid at a new &#8220;site neutral&#8221; rate, which is the lesser of: (1) the IPPS comparable per diem amount determined using the formula in the LTACH short-stay outlier regulation, plus applicable outlier payments, or (2) 100% of the cost of the services provided. The site neutral payment provision will be phased in over two years, so discharges receiving a &#8220;site neutral&#8221; rate get paid 50% based on current LTAC rate and 50% based on the &#8220;site neutral&#8221; rate. Our LTACHs have cost-reporting periods that begin in July or September of each year so we will not have any impact until the third quarter of 2016. 

Twenty-five Day Average Length-of-stay : Patient stays paid the site neutral rate will not count toward calculation of the 25 day average length-of-stay requirement for LTACHs. Additionally, the law clarifies that patient stays paid by Medicare Advantage plans will also not count toward the 25 day average length-of-stay requirement for LTACHs. The BBA 2013 also included a provision that these exceptions to the 25 day average length-of-stay will not be used in calculating the length-of-stay for short-term acute care hospitals that seek to qualify as LTACHs as of December 10, 2013. 

25 Percent Rule Relief : Prior relief from compliance with the 25 Percent Rule for freestanding LTACHs, HWHs and satellite facilities will be extended without interruption for cost reporting periods beginning through December 28, 2016. Grandfathered HWHs are permanently exempt from the 25 Percent Rule. CMS must report to Congress by December 18, 2015 on whether the 25 Percent Rule should continue to be applied through June 30, 2019. 

Compliance With LTACH Patient Criteria : Effective for cost reporting periods beginning in federal fiscal year 2020, LTACHs with less than half of their discharges paid at the full LTACH-PPS rates will lose certification as LTACHs and will transition to payment under the IPPS for all discharges in subsequent cost reporting periods. However, CMS is required to establish a process for LTACHs to seek reinstatement of LTACH-PPS payments for applicable discharges. 

Moratorium on LTACHs : The BBA 2013 enacted a moratorium on new LTACH beds and hospitals (including satellite locations) effective January 1, 2015 through September 30, 2017. The law clarifies that there will be no exceptions to the moratorium. 

Fiscal Year 2016 Rates 

On July 31, 2015, CMS issued a final rule to update fiscal year 2016 payment policies and rates under the IPPS and LTACH-PPS, which affects discharges occurring in cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2015. CMS projects that LTACH-PPS rates would decrease by 4.6%. This estimated decrease is primarily attributable to the statutory decrease in payment rates for site neutral LTACH-PPS cases that do not meet the clinical criteria to qualify for higher LTACH rates in cost reporting years beginning on or after October 1, 2015. Cases that do qualify for higher LTACH-PPS rates will see a payment rate increase of 1.7% (based on a market basket update of 2.4% adjusted by a multi-factor productivity adjustment of -0.5 percentage point and an additional adjustment of -0.2 percentage point in accordance with the Affordable Care Act). CMS also finalized its proposal to implement a transitional blended payment rate (50% site neutral rate and 50% LTACH-PPS rates) for site neutral discharges occurring in fiscal years 2016 and 2017. 

Medicaid 

Medicaid is a joint federal and state funded health insurance program for certain low-income individuals administered by the states. Medicaid reimburses health care providers using a number of different systems, including cost-based, prospective payment and negotiated rate systems. Rates are also subject to adjustment based on statutory and regulatory changes, administrative rulings, government funding limitations and interpretations of policy by individual state agencies. 

Non-Governmental Payors 

Payments from non-governmental payor sources are based on episodic-based rates or per visit basis depending upon the terms and conditions of the payor. This reimbursement category includes payors such as insurance companies, workers&#8217; compensation programs, health maintenance organizations, preferred provider organizations, other managed care companies and employers, as well as payments received directly from patients. 

Patients are generally not responsible for any difference between customary charges for our services and amounts paid by Medicare and Medicaid programs and the non-governmental payors, but are responsible for services not covered by these programs or plans, as well as co-payments for deductibles and co-insurance obligations of their coverage. Patient out-of-pocket costs for the payment of deductibles and co-insurance have increased in recent years. Collection of amounts due from individuals is typically more difficult than collection of amounts due from government or business payors. Because the majority of our billed services are paid in full by Medicare, Medicaid or private insurance, co-payments from patients do not represent a material portion of our billed revenue and corresponding accounts receivable. To further reduce their health care costs, most commercial payors such as insurance companies, health maintenance organizations, preferred provider organizations and other managed care companies have negotiated discounted fee structures or fixed amounts for services performed, rather than paying health care providers the amounts normally billed. 

In response to the challenges associated with collecting from commercial payors, we began negotiating higher reimbursement rates with a majority of our commercial payors. As of December 31, 2015 , our managed care contracts included 177 different payors between all of our divisions, seven of which were national contracts, 25 were regional contracts and 145 were state and local contracts/standing letters of agreement. If we are unable to continue negotiating higher reimbursement rates with commercial payors or if commercial payors continue to reduce health care costs through reduction in home health reimbursement, it could have a material adverse impact on our financial results. 

Government Regulations 

General 

The health care industry is highly regulated and we are required to comply with federal, state and local laws which significantly affect our business. These laws and regulations are extremely complex and, in many instances, the industry does not have the benefit of significant regulatory or judicial interpretation. Regulations and policies frequently change, and we monitor these changes through trade and governmental publications and associations. The significant areas of federal and state regulation that could affect our ability to conduct our business include the following: 

&#8226; 

Medicare and Medicaid participation and reimbursement regulations; 

&#8226; 

the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and similar state laws; 

&#8226; 

the federal Stark Law and similar state laws; 

&#8226; 

false claims laws and regulations; 

&#8226; 

HIPAA; 

&#8226; 

laws and regulations imposing civil monetary penalties; 

&#8226; 

environmental health and safety laws; 

&#8226; 

licensing laws and regulations; and 

&#8226; 

laws and regulations governing certificates of need and permits of approval. 

If we fail to comply with these applicable laws and regulations, we could suffer civil or criminal penalties, including the loss of our licenses to operate and our ability to participate in federal and state health care programs, which would materially adversely affect our 

financial condition and results of operations. Although we believe we are in material compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, these are complex matters and a review of our practices by a court or law enforcement or regulatory authority could result in an adverse determination that could harm our business. Furthermore, the laws applicable to us are subject to change, interpretation and amendment, which could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. 

Medicare Participation 

To participate in the Medicare program and receive Medicare payments, our agencies and facilities must comply with regulations promulgated by CMS. Among other things, these requirements, known as &#8220;conditions of participation,&#8221; relate to the type of facility, its personnel and its standards of medical care. While we intend to continue to participate in the Medicare reimbursement programs, we cannot guarantee that our agencies, facilities and programs will continue to qualify for Medicare participation. 

Federal Anti-Kickback Statute 

Provisions of the Social Security Act of 1965, commonly referred to as the Anti-Kickback Statute, prohibit the payment or receipt of anything of value in return for the referral of patients or arranging for the referral of patients, or in return for the recommendation, arrangement, purchase, lease or order of items or services that are covered by a federal health care program such as Medicare and Medicaid. Violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute is a felony and sanctions include imprisonment of up to five years, criminal fines of up to $25,000, civil monetary penalties of up to $50,000 per act plus three times the amount claimed or three times the remuneration offered and exclusion from federal health care programs (including the Medicare and Medicaid programs). Many states have adopted similar prohibitions against payments intended to induce referrals of Medicaid and other third-party payor patients. 

The OIG has published numerous &#8220;safe harbors&#8221; that exempt some practices from enforcement action under the Anti-Kickback Statute. These safe harbors exempt specified activities, including bona-fide employment relationships, contracts for the rental of space or equipment, personal service arrangements and management contracts, so long as all of the requirements of the safe harbor are met. The OIG has recognized that the failure of an arrangement to satisfy all of the requirements of a particular safe harbor does not necessarily mean that the arrangement violates the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, each arrangement is analyzed on a case-by-case basis, which is very fact specific. While we operate our business to comply with the prohibitions of the Anti-Kickback Statute, we cannot guarantee that all our arrangements will satisfy a safe harbor or will ultimately be viewed as being compliant with the Anti-Kickback Statute. 

We endeavor to conduct our operations in compliance with federal and state health care fraud and abuse laws, including the Anti-Kickback Statute and similar state laws. However, our practices may be challenged in the future and the fraud and abuse laws may be interpreted in a way that finds us in violation of these laws. If we are found to be in violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute, we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties and we could be excluded from participating in federal health care programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. The occurrence of any of these events could significantly harm our business and financial condition. 

Stark Law 

Congress has passed significant prohibitions against physician self-referrals of patients for certain designated health care services, commonly known as the Stark Law, which prohibits a physician from making referrals for particular health care services (called designated health services) to entities with which the physician, or an immediate family member of the physician, has a financial relationship. 

The term &#8220;financial relationship&#8221; is defined very broadly to include most types of ownership or compensation relationships. The Stark Law also prohibits the entity receiving the referral from seeking payment under the Medicare or Medicaid programs for services rendered pursuant to a prohibited referral. If an entity is paid for services rendered pursuant to a prohibited referral, it may incur civil penalties and could be excluded from participating in the Medicare or Medicaid programs. If an arrangement is covered by the Stark Law, the requirements of a Stark Law exception must be met for the physician to be able to make referrals to the entity for designated health services and for the entity to be able to bill for these services. 

&#8220;Designated health services&#8221; under the Stark Law is defined to include home health services, inpatient and outpatient hospital services, clinical laboratory services, physical therapy services, occupational therapy services, radiology services (including magnetic resonance imaging, computerized axial tomography scans and ultrasound services), radiation therapy services and supplies, and the provision of durable medical equipment and supplies, parenteral and enteral nutrients, equipment and supplies, prosthetics, orthotics and prosthetic devices and supplies, and outpatient prescription drugs. The Stark Law defines a financial relationship to include: (1) a physician&#8217;s ownership or investment interest in an entity and (2) a compensation relationship between a physician and an entity. Under the Stark Law, financial relationships include both direct and indirect relationships. 

Physicians refer patients to us for several Stark Law designated health services, including home health services, inpatient and outpatient hospital services and physical therapy services. We have compensation arrangements with some of these physicians or their professional practices in the form of medical director and consulting agreements. We also have operations owned by joint ventures in which physicians have an investment interest. In addition, other physicians who refer patients to our agencies and facilities may own shares of our stock. As a result of these relationships, we could be deemed to have a financial relationship with physicians who refer patients to 

our facilities and agencies for designated health services. If so, the Stark Law would prohibit the physicians from making those referrals and would prohibit us from billing for the services unless a Stark Law exception applies. 

The Stark Law contains exceptions for certain physician ownership or investment interests and physician compensation arrangements. If an investment relationship or compensation agreement between a physician, or a physician&#8217;s immediate family member, and the subject entity satisfies all requirements for a Stark Law exception, the Stark Law will not prohibit the physician from referring patients to the entity for designated health services. The exceptions for a physician investment relationship include ownership in an entire hospital and ownership in rural providers. The exceptions for compensation arrangements cover employment relationships, personal services contracts and space and equipment leases, among others. We believe our physician investment relationships and compensation arrangements with referring physicians meet the requirements as exceptions under the Stark Law and that our operations comply with the Stark Law. 

The Stark Law also includes an exception for a physician&#8217;s ownership or investment interest in certain entities through the ownership of stock that is listed on the New York Stock Exchange or NASDAQ. If the ownership meets certain other requirements, the Stark Law will not apply to prohibit the physician from referring to the entity for designated health services. For example, this Stark Law exception requires that the entity issuing the stock have at least $75.0 million in stockholders&#8217; equity at the end of its most recent fiscal year or on average during the previous three fiscal years. As of December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , we have in excess of $75.0 million in stockholders&#8217; equity. 

If an entity violates the Stark Law, it could be subject to civil penalties of up to $15,000 per prohibited claim and up to $100,000 for knowingly entering into certain prohibited referral schemes. The entity also may be excluded from participating in federal health care programs (including Medicare and Medicaid). There are no criminal penalties for violations of Stark Law. If the Stark Law was found to apply to our relationships with referring physicians and those relationships did not meet the requirement of an exception under the Stark Law, we would be required to restructure these relationships or refuse to accept referrals for designated health services from these physicians. If we were found to have submitted claims to Medicare or Medicaid for services provided pursuant to a referral prohibited by the Stark Law, we would be required to repay any amounts we received from Medicare for those services and could be subject to civil monetary penalties. Further, we could be excluded from participating in Medicare and Medicaid. If we were required to repay any amounts to Medicare, subjected to fines, or excluded from the Medicare and Medicaid Programs, our business and financial condition would be harmed significantly. 

Many states have physician relationship and referral statutes that are similar to the Stark Law. Some of these laws generally apply without regard to whether the payor is a governmental body (such as Medicare) or a commercial party (such as an insurance company). While we believe that our operations are structured to comply with applicable state laws with respect to physician relationships and referrals, any finding that we are not in compliance with these state laws could require us to change our operations or could subject us to penalties. This, in turn, could have a significantly negative impact on our operations. 

False Claims 

The submission of claims to a federal or state health care program for items and services that are &#8220;not provided as claimed&#8221; may lead to the imposition of civil monetary penalties, criminal fines and imprisonment and/or exclusion from participation in state and federally funded health care programs, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs, under false claims statutes such as the federal False Claims Act. Under the federal False Claims Act, actions against a provider can be initiated by the federal government or by a private party on behalf of the federal government. These private parties are often referred to as qui tam relators, and relators are entitled to share in any amounts recovered by the government. Both direct enforcement activity by the government and qui tam actions have increased significantly in recent years, increasing the risk that a health care company like us will have to defend a false claims action, pay fines or be excluded from the Medicare and Medicaid programs as a result of an investigation. Many states have enacted similar laws providing for the imposition of civil and criminal penalties for the filing of fraudulent claims. While we operate our business to avoid exposure under the federal False Claims Act and similar state laws, because of the complexity of the government regulations applicable to our industry, we cannot guarantee that we will not be the subject of an action under the federal False Claims Act or similar state law. 

Anti-fraud Provisions of the HIPAA 

In an effort to combat health care fraud, Congress included several anti-fraud measures in HIPAA. Among other things, HIPAA broadened the scope of certain fraud and abuse laws, extended criminal penalties for Medicare and Medicaid fraud to other federal health care programs and expanded the authority of the OIG to exclude persons and entities from participating in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. HIPAA also extended the Medicare and Medicaid civil monetary penalty provisions to other federal health care programs, increased the amounts of civil monetary penalties and established a criminal health care fraud statute. 

Federal health care offenses under HIPAA include health care fraud and making false statements relating to health care matters. Under HIPAA, among other things, any person or entity that knowingly and willfully defrauds or attempts to defraud a health care benefit program is subject to a fine, imprisonment or both. Also under HIPAA, any person or entity that knowingly and willfully falsifies or conceals or covers up a material fact or makes any materially false or fraudulent statements in connection with the delivery of or 

payment of health care services by a health care benefit plan is subject to a fine, imprisonment or both. HIPAA applies not only to governmental plans but also to private payors. 

Administrative Simplification Provisions of HIPAA 

HHS&#8217;s final regulations governing electronic transactions involving health information are part of the administrative simplification provisions of HIPAA, commonly referred to as the Transaction Standards rule. The rule establishes standards for eight of the most common health care transactions by reference to technical standards promulgated by recognized standards publishing organizations. Under the rule, any party transmitting or receiving health transactions electronically must send and receive data in a single format, rather than the large number of different data formats currently used. This rule applies to us in connection with submitting and processing health claims, and also applies to many of our payors and to our relationships with those payors. We believe that our operations materially comply with the Transaction Standards rule. 

These regulatory requirements impose significant administrative and financial obligations on companies like us that use or disclose electronic health information. We have modified our existing HIPAA privacy and security policies and procedures to comply with the HIPAA regulations. 

Civil Monetary Penalties 

The Secretary of HHS may impose civil monetary penalties on any person or entity that presents, or causes to be presented, certain ineligible claims for medical items or services. The severity of penalties varies depending on the offense, from $2,000 to $50,000 per violation, plus treble damages for the amount at issue and may include exclusion from federal health care programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. 

HHS can also impose penalties on a person or entity who offers inducements to beneficiaries for program services, who violates rules regarding the assignment of payments, or who knowingly gives false or misleading information that could reasonably influence the discharge of patients from a hospital. Persons who have been excluded from a federal health care program and who retain ownership in a participating entity and persons who contract with excluded persons may be penalized. 

HHS can also impose penalties for false or fraudulent claims and those that include services not provided as claimed. In addition, HHS may impose penalties on claims: 

&#8226; 

for physician services that the person or entity knew or should have known were rendered by a person who was unlicensed, or by a person who misrepresented either their qualifications in obtaining their license, or their certification in a medical specialty; 

&#8226; 

for services furnished by a person who was, at the time the claim was made, excluded from the program to which the claim was made; or 

&#8226; 

that show a pattern of medically unnecessary items or services. 

Penalties also are applicable in certain other cases, including violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, payments to limit certain patient services and improper execution of statements of medical necessity. 

Environmental, Health and Safety Laws 

We are subject to federal, state and local regulations governing the storage, use and disposal of materials and waste products. Although we believe that our safety procedures for storing, handling and disposing of these hazardous materials comply with the standards prescribed by law and regulation, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from those hazardous materials. In the event of an accident, we could be held liable for any damages that result and any liability could exceed the limits or fall outside the coverage of our insurance. We may not be able to maintain insurance on acceptable terms, or at all. We could incur significant costs and the diversion of our management&#8217;s attention to comply with current or future environmental laws and regulations. We are not aware of any violations related to compliance with environmental, health and safety laws through 2015 . 

Licensing 

Our agencies and facilities are subject to state and local licensing regulations ranging from the adequacy of medical care to compliance with building codes and environmental protection laws. To assure continued compliance with these various regulations, governmental and other authorities periodically inspect our agencies and facilities. Additionally, health care professionals at our agencies and facilities are required to be individually licensed or certified under applicable state law. We operate our business to ensure that our employees and agents possess all necessary licenses and certifications. 

The institutional pharmacy operations within our facility-based services segment are also subject to regulation by the various states in which we conduct the pharmacy business, as well as by the federal government. The pharmacies are regulated under the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, which are administered by the United States Food and Drug Administration. 

Under the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970, administered by the United States Drug Enforcement Administration, as a dispenser of controlled substances, our pharmacy operations must register with the Drug Enforcement Administration, file reports of inventories and transactions and provide adequate security measures. Failure to comply with such requirements could result in civil or criminal penalties. We are not aware of any violations of applicable laws relating to our institutional pharmacy operations through December 31, 2015 . 

Certificate of Need and Permit of Approval Laws 

In addition to state licensing laws, some states require a provider to obtain a certificate of need or permit of approval prior to establishing, constructing, acquiring or expanding certain health services, operations or facilities. In these states, approvals are required for capital expenditures exceeding certain amounts that involve certain facilities or services, including home nursing agencies. The certificate of need or permit of approval issued by the state determines the service areas for the applicable agency or program. The following U.S. jurisdictions require certificates of need or permits of approval for home nursing agencies: Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Georgia, Hawaii, Kentucky, Maryland, Mississippi, Montana, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Vermont, Washington, West Virginia and the District of Columbia. In addition, the state of Louisiana continues to have a moratorium on the issuance of new licenses for home nursing agencies that we expect to remain in effect for 2016 . 

State certificate of need and permit of approval laws generally provide that, prior to the addition of new capacity, the construction of new facilities or the introduction of new services, a designated state health planning agency must determine that a need exists for those beds, facilities or services. The process is intended to promote comprehensive health care planning, assist in providing high quality health care at the lowest possible cost and avoid unnecessary duplication by ensuring that only needed health care facilities and operations will be built and opened. 

Accreditations 

The Joint Commission is a nationwide commission that establishes standards relating to the physical plant, administration, quality of patient care and operation of medical staffs of health care organizations. Currently, Joint Commission accreditation of home nursing and hospice agencies is voluntary. However, some managed care organizations use Joint Commission accreditation as a credentialing standard for regional and state contracts. As of December 31, 2015 , the Joint Commission had accredited 268 of our 283 &#32;home health agencies and 34 of our 56 &#32;hospice agencies. Those not yet accredited are working towards achieving this accreditation. As we acquire companies, we apply for accreditation 12 to 18 months after completing the acquisition. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015 , we had 10,922 employees, of which 6,835 were full-time. None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationships with our employees and independent contractors to be good. 

Insurance 

We are subject to claims and legal actions in the ordinary course of our business. To cover claims that may arise, we maintain commercial insurance for healthcare professional liability, general liability, automobile liability, employed lawyers liability, fiduciary liability, information security and privacy liabilities, and workers&#8217; compensation/employer&#8217;s liability in amounts that we believe are appropriate and sufficient for our operations. We maintain claims-made healthcare professional liability and occurrence based general liability insurance that provides primary limits of $1.0 million per incident/ occurrence and $3.0 million in annual aggregate amounts. We maintain workers&#8217; compensation insurance that meets state statutory requirements and provides a primary employer liability limit of $1.0 million to cover claims that may arise in the states in which we operate, excluding Ohio and Washington. Coverage for workers compensation matters within Ohio and Washington is procured from each state's specific mandated programs and not through third party insurance payors. Under our workers&#8217; compensation insurance policies, the Company maintains a deductible of the first $0.5 million in workers compensation liability. We maintain automobile liability insurance for all owned, hired and non-owned autos with a primary limit of $1.0 million. In addition, we currently maintain multiple layers of umbrella coverage in the aggregate amount of $40.0 million that provides excess coverage for healthcare professional liability, general liability, automobile liability and employer&#8217;s liability. We also maintain directors' and officers&#8217; liability insurance in the aggregate amount of $65.0 million. The cost and availability of insurance coverage has varied widely in recent years. While we believe that our insurance policies and coverage are adequate for a business enterprise of our type, we cannot guarantee that our insurance coverage is sufficient to cover all future claims or that it will continue to be available in adequate amounts or at a reasonable cost.
