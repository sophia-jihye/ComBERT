 Item 1. Business 

&#160; 

Globalstar, Inc. (&#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us&#8221; or the "Company&#8221;) provides Mobile Satellite Services (&#8220;MSS&#8221;) including voice and data communications services globally via satellite. By providing wireless communications services in areas not served or underserved by terrestrial wireless and wireline networks and in circumstances where terrestrial networks are not operational due to natural or man-made disasters, we seek to meet our customers' increasing desire for connectivity. We offer voice and data communication services over our network of in-orbit satellites and our active ground stations (or &#8220;gateways&#8221;), which we refer to collectively as the Globalstar System. 

We currently provide the following communications services via satellite. These services are available only with equipment designed to work on our network: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

two-way voice communication and data transmissions (&#8220;Duplex&#8221;) using mobile or fixed devices; and 

&#8226; 

one-way data transmissions ("Simplex") using a mobile or fixed device that transmits its location and other information to a central monitoring station, which includes certain SPOT and Simplex products. 

Recent Events 

Second-Generation Ground Infrastructure Update 

With support from Hughes Network Systems, LLC ("Hughes"), our technical team has successfully completed the deployment of our second-generation Radio Access Network ("RAN") in all gateways located in the United States, Canada and France. The RAN installations at our Brazilian gateways are scheduled for mid-2016 with over-the-air testing planned in the third quarter of 2016. To enhance our second-generation coverage in the Caribbean, we plan to deploy a RAN at our gateway in Puerto Rico by the end of the first quarter of 2016. 

We are nearing completion of the second-generation ground system upgrades. Site acceptance of the core network equipment at one of our gateways in Canada started in January 2016 and final configuration acceptance testing has been completed. In March 2016, we expect to complete the final production acceptance testing, including roaming, short message service and multimedia message service, and have hardware at our North American gateways installed and ready for service. 

These second-generation upgrades allow us to develop smaller and less expensive mass market products with significantly higher data speeds as compared to our first-generation products. 

Regulatory Reform for Terrestrial Spectrum Authority 

&#160; 

In November 2013, the Federal Communications Commission (the "FCC") proposed rules which, if adopted, would enable us to offer low power terrestrial broadband services over a portion of our licensed MSS spectrum. We have termed these services Terrestrial Low Power Service ("TLPS"). We believe TLPS represents a differentiated, premium, and immediate solution to existing Wi-Fi congestion. During 2015, we announced the successful results of two TLPS deployments, where we demonstrated a material increase in user throughput and network levels. The deployments also provided additional data confirming the successful coexistence of TLPS with other existing services. With these real world deployments of our TLPS operations, we have shown the FCC the dramatic consumer benefits that are achievable, and we anticipate that the FCC will take final action in this proceeding in the near future. The proposed rules would substantially revise the gating criteria for terrestrial use of our spectrum and would allow us to provide TLPS over our licensed spectrum together with the non-exclusive use of adjacent unlicensed spectrum. If the FCC takes final action to adopt these proposed rules, we plan to establish one or more partnerships to deploy commercial service promptly as well as to seek similar terrestrial authority in certain international jurisdictions. 

SPOT Satellite Devices Achieve 4,000 th &#32;Rescue 

In December 2015, we announced that our SPOT family of products had initiated the 4,000th rescue, proving how essential our technology is to saving lives. Currently, we are receiving almost two SOS messages per day that result in life-saving rescues globally. SPOT delivers affordable location-based messaging and life-saving emergency notification technology to hundreds of thousands of users, completely independent of cellular coverage. 

Next Generation Technology Agreement with Yippy, Inc. 

On December 17, 2015, we announced a new agreement with Yippy Inc., which allows us to leverage the Yippy EASE 360 platform and proprietary data compression, optimization and security software. Starting in 2016, our subscribers will have access to Yippy's industry leading software platform to provide a broadband-like data experience to our existing and prospective subscribers. This service will be available over both our first and second-generation products. Yippy will also have the ability to resell our services to prospective customers who need to maintain efficient, secure and often critical business communications. 

Overview 

&#160; 

We have integrated our second-generation satellites with our first-generation satellites to form our second-generation constellation of Low Earth Orbit (&#8220;LEO&#8221;) satellites. The restoration of our constellation&#8217;s Duplex capabilities was complete in August 2013 forming the world's most modern satellite network. 

This restoration of Duplex capabilities resulted in a substantial increase in service levels, making our products and services more desirable to existing and potential customers. We are gaining new customers and winning back former customers, which contributes to increases in Duplex service revenue. We offer a range of price-competitive products to the industrial, governmental and consumer markets. Due to the unique design of the Globalstar System (and based on customer input), we believe that we offer the best voice quality among our peer group. 

&#160; 

We designed our second-generation satellites to last twice as long in space, have 40% greater capacity and be built at a significantly lower cost compared to our first-generation satellites. We achieved this longer life by increasing the solar array and battery capacity, using a larger fuel tank, adding redundancy for key satellite equipment, and improving radiation specifications and additional lot level testing for all susceptible electronic components, in order to account for the accumulated dosage of radiation encountered during a 15-year mission at the operational altitude of the satellites. The second-generation satellites use passive S-band antennas on the body of the spacecraft providing additional shielding for the active amplifiers which are located inside the spacecraft, unlike the first-generation amplifiers that were located on the outside as part of the active antenna array. Each satellite has a high degree of on-board subsystem redundancy, an on-board fault detection system and isolation and recovery for safe and quick risk mitigation. 

We define a successful level of service for our customers as measured by their ability to make uninterrupted calls of average duration for a system-wide average number of minutes per month. Our goal is to provide service levels and call success rates equal to or better than our MSS competitors so our products and services are attractive to potential customers. We define voice quality as the ability to easily hear, recognize and understand callers with imperceptible delay in the transmission. Due to the unique design of the Globalstar System, by this measure our system outperforms geostationary (&#8220;GEO&#8221;) satellites used by some of our 

competitors. Due to the difference in signal travel distance, GEO satellite signals must travel approximately 42,000 additional nautical miles, which introduces considerable delay and signal degradation to GEO calls. For our competitors using cross-linked satellite architectures, which require multiple inter-satellite connections to complete a call, signal degradation and delay can result in compromised call quality as compared to that experienced over the Globalstar System. 

&#160; 

We also compete aggressively on price. Our MSS handsets are priced lower than those of our main MSS competitors, providing access to MSS services to a broader range of subscribers. We expect to retain our position as the low cost, high quality leader in the MSS industry. 

&#160; 

Our satellite communications business, by providing critical mobile communications to our subscribers, serves principally the following markets: recreation and personal; government; public safety and disaster relief; oil and gas; maritime and fishing; natural resources, mining and forestry; construction; utilities; and transportation. 

&#160; 

At December 31, 2015, we served approximately 688,000 &#32;subscribers. We increased our net subscribers by 8% &#32;from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015. We count "subscribers" based on the number of devices that are subject to agreements which entitle them to use our voice or data communications services rather than the number of persons or entities who own or lease those devices. 

&#160; 

We designed our second-generation constellation to support our current lineup of Duplex, SPOT and Simplex products. With the improvement in both coverage and service quality resulting from the deployment of our second-generation constellation and with the release of new product and service offerings, we anticipate further expansion of our subscriber base and increases in our average revenue per user, or &#8220;ARPU.&#8221; 

&#160; 

Our products and services are sold through a variety of independent agents, dealers and resellers, and independent gateway operators (&#8220;IGOs&#8221;). We have distribution relationships with a number of "Big Box" and online retailers and other similar distribution channels which expands the diversification of our distribution channels. 

&#160; 

Duplex Two-Way Voice and Data Products 

&#160; 

Mobile Voice and Data Satellite Communications Services and Equipment 

&#160; 

We provide mobile voice and data services to a wide variety of commercial, government and recreational customers for remote business continuity, recreational, emergency response and other applications. Subscribers under these plans typically pay an initial activation fee to an agent or dealer or to us, a monthly usage fee to us that entitles the customer to a fixed or unlimited number of minutes, and fees for additional services such as voicemail, call forwarding, short messaging, email, data compression and internet access. Extra fees may also apply for non-voice services, roaming and long-distance. We regularly monitor our service offerings in accordance with customer demands and market changes and offer pricing plans such as bundled minutes, annual plans and unlimited plans. 

We offer our services for use only with equipment designed to work on our network, which users generally purchase in conjunction with an initial service plan. We offer the GSP-1700 phone, which includes a user-friendly color LCD screen and a variety of accessories. The phone design represents a significant improvement over earlier-generation equipment that we believe facilitates increased adoption by users. We also believe that the GSP-1700 is among the smallest, lightest and least-expensive satellite phones available. We are the only MSS provider using Qualcomm Incorporated's ("Qualcomm") patented CDMA technology that we believe provides superior voice quality when compared to competitive handsets. 

In June 2014, we announced the release of a new voice and data solution, Sat-Fi. With Sat-Fi, our customers can use their current smartphones, tablets and laptops to send and receive communications via the Globalstar satellite system when traveling beyond cellular service, achieving a level of seamless connectivity not offered before. We believe Sat-Fi is superior to other competitors' products, providing the fastest, most affordable, mobile satellite data speeds (4x faster than our primary competitor) and the clearest voice communications in the MSS industry. Through a convenient smartphone app which enables connectivity between any Wi-Fi-enabled device and the Sat-Fi satellite hot spot, subscribers can easily send and receive email and SMS text messages and make voice calls from their own device any time they are in range of a Sat-Fi device. We believe Sat-Fi represents a major step forward in our desire to integrate seamlessly our mobile satellite capabilities into the communications services that people use on a daily basis. With future enhancements, customers will not necessarily know, nor will they care, when they are communicating via the Globalstar System, given our superior voice quality and low-priced service plans. 

In September 2014, we released our newest data solution, the Globalstar 9600&#8482;. With the 9600, our customers can use a convenient app to pair seamlessly with their existing satellite phone and smartphone to send and receive email over the Globalstar 

System. This affordable data hotspot is ideal for remote workforces in industries such as energy and construction to communicate via email, send status reports, download local weather and send pictures. Our marine customers also benefit from the ease of use and the ability to affordably send data and make voice calls beyond cellular. 

&#160; 

Fixed Voice and Data Satellite Communications Services and Equipment 

&#160; 

We provide fixed voice and data services in rural villages, at remote industrial, commercial and residential sites and on ships at sea, among other places, primarily with our GSP-2900 fixed phone. Fixed voice and data satellite communications services are in many cases an attractive alternative to mobile satellite communications services in environments where multiple users will access the service within a defined geographic area and cellular or ground phone service is not available. Our fixed units also may be mounted on vehicles, barges and construction equipment and benefit from the ability to have higher gain antennas. Our fixed voice and data service plans are similar to our mobile voice and data plans and offer similar flexibility. In addition to offering monthly service plans, our fixed phones can be configured as pay phones installed at a central location, for example, in a rural village. 

&#160; 

Satellite Data Modem Services and Equipment 

&#160; 

In addition to data utilization through fixed and mobile services described above, we offer data-only services through Duplex devices that have two-way transmission capabilities. Duplex asset-tracking applications enable customers to control directly their remote assets and perform complex monitoring activities. We offer asynchronous and packet data service in all of our Duplex territories. Customers can use our products to access the internet, corporate virtual private networks and other customer specific data centers. Our satellite data modems can be activated under any of our current pricing plans. Customers can access satellite data modems in every Duplex region we serve. We provide store-and-forward capabilities to customers who do not require real-time transmission and reception of data. Additionally, we offer a data acceleration and compression service to the satellite data modem market. This service increases web-browsing, email and other data transmission speeds without any special equipment or hardware. 

&#160; 

Direct Sales, Dealers and Resellers 

&#160; 

Our sales group is responsible for conducting direct sales with key accounts and for managing indirect agent, dealer and reseller relationships in assigned territories in the countries in which we operate. 

&#160; 

The reseller channel for Duplex equipment and service is comprised primarily of communications equipment retailers and commercial communications equipment rental companies that retain and bill clients directly, outside of our billing system. Many of our resellers specialize in niche vertical markets where high-use customers are concentrated. We have sales arrangements with major resellers to market our services, including some value added resellers that integrate our products into their proprietary end products or applications. 

&#160; 

Our typical dealer is a communications services business-to-business equipment retailer. We offer competitive service and equipment commissions to our network of dealers to encourage sales. 

&#160; 

In addition to sales through our distribution managers, agents, dealers and resellers, customers can place orders through our existing sales force and through our direct e-commerce website. 

&#160; 

SPOT Consumer Retail Products 

&#160; 

The SPOT product family has now initiated over 4,000 rescues since its launch in 2007. Averaging nearly two rescues per day, SPOT delivers affordable and reliable satellite-based connectivity and real-time GPS tracking to hundreds of thousands of users, completely independent of cellular coverage. We are not aware of any other competitive offering that can match the life-saving record of our SPOT family of products. As we continue to innovate and grow the SPOT family of products, we are committed to providing affordable life-saving products to an expanding target market of millions of people globally. 

We have differentiated ourselves from other MSS providers by offering affordable, high utility mobile satellite products that appeal to the mainstream consumer market. With the 2009 acquisition of satellite asset tracking and consumer messaging products manufacturer Axonn LLC (&#8220;Axonn&#8221;), we believe we are the only vertically integrated mobile satellite company, which results in decreased pre-production costs, quality assurance and shorter time to market for our retail consumer products. 

&#160; 

SPOT Satellite GPS Messenger 

&#160; 

We began commercial sales of the first SPOT products and services when we introduced the SPOT Personal Tracker in 2007. In 2009, we introduced an updated version of this product, the SPOT Satellite GPS Messenger ("SPOT 2"). In September 2013, we introduced SPOT Gen3, the current generation of the SPOT Satellite GPS Messenger. SPOT Gen3 offers enhanced functionality with more tracking features, improved battery performance and more power options, including rechargeable and USB direct line power. &#32; 

&#160; 

We have targeted our SPOT Gen3 to recreational and commercial markets that require personal tracking, emergency location and messaging solutions that operate beyond the reach of terrestrial wireless and wireline coverage. Using our network and web-based mapping software, this device provides consumers with the ability to trace a path geographically or map the location of individuals or equipment. The product also enables users to transmit messages to a specific preprogrammed email address, phone or data device, including a request for assistance and an &#8220;SOS&#8221; message in the event of an emergency. 

&#160; 

SPOT Satellite GPS Messenger products and services are available virtually everywhere through our product distribution channels and through our direct e-commerce website. 

&#160; 

SPOT Global Phone 

&#160; 

In May 2013, we introduced SPOT Global Phone to the consumer mass market. This product leverages our retailer distribution channels and SPOT brand name. We include the related service and subscriber equipment revenue generated from this product in our Duplex business. 

&#160; 

SPOT Trace 

&#160; 

In November 2013, we introduced SPOT Trace, a cost effective anti-theft and asset tracking device. SPOT Trace ensures cars, motorcycles, boats, ATVs, snowmobiles and other valuable assets are where they need to be, notifying owners via email or text when movement is detected anytime, using 100% satellite technology to provide location-based messaging and emergency notification for on or off the grid communications. 

Product Distribution 

&#160; 

We distribute and sell our SPOT products through a variety of distribution channels. We have distribution relationships with a number of "Big Box" retailers and other similar distribution channels including Bass Pro Shops, Big Rock Sports, Cabela's, Fry's Electronics, Gander Mountain, REI, Sportsman's Warehouse and West Marine. We also sell SPOT products and services directly using our existing sales force and through our direct e-commerce website, www.findmespot.com, as well as through certain of our IGOs. 

&#160; 

Commercial Simplex One-Way Transmission Products 

&#160; 

Simplex service is a one-way data service from a commercial Simplex device over the Globalstar System that can be used to track and monitor assets. Our subscribers currently use our Simplex devices to track cargo containers and rail cars; to monitor utility meters; and to monitor oil and gas assets, as well as a host of other applications. At the heart of the Simplex service is a demodulator and RF interface, called an appliqu&#233;, which is located at a gateway and an application server located in our facilities. The appliqu&#233;-equipped gateways provide coverage over vast areas of the globe. The small size of the devices makes them attractive for use in tracking asset shipments, monitoring unattended remote assets, trailer tracking and mobile security. Current users include various governmental agencies, including the Federal Emergency Management Agency (&#8220;FEMA&#8221;), the U.S. Army, the U.S. Air Force, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (&#8220;NOAA&#8221;), the U.S. Forest Service and British Ministry of Defense, as well as other organizations, including BP, Shell and The Salvation Army. 

&#160; 

We designed our Simplex service to address the market for a small and cost-effective solution for sending data, such as geographic coordinates, from assets or individuals in remote locations to a central monitoring station. Customers are able to realize an efficiency advantage from tracking assets on a single global system as compared to several regional systems. 

&#160; 

We offer small Satellite Transmitters, such as the STX-2 and STX-3, which enable an integrator&#8217;s products to access our Simplex network. We also offer complete products that utilize these transmitters. Our Simplex units, including the enterprise products MMT and SMARTONE, are used worldwide by industrial, commercial and government customers. These products provide cost-effective, low power, ultra-reliable, secure monitoring that help solve a variety of security applications and asset tracking challenges. 

&#160; 

The reseller channel for Simplex equipment and service is comprised primarily of communications equipment retailers and commercial communications equipment rental companies that retain and bill clients directly, outside of our billing system. Many of our resellers specialize in niche vertical markets where high-use customers are concentrated. We have sales arrangements with major resellers to market our services, including some value added resellers that integrate our STX-2, or our products based on it, into their proprietary solutions designed to meet certain specialized niche market applications. 

&#160; 

Independent Gateway Operators 

&#160; 

Our wholesale operations encompass primarily bulk sales of wholesale minutes to IGOs around the globe. IGOs maintain their own subscriber bases that are mostly exclusive to us and promote their own service plans. The IGO system allows us to expand in regions that hold significant growth potential but are harder to serve without sufficient operational scale or where local regulatory requirements do not permit us to operate directly. 

&#160; 

Currently, 12 of the 25 gateways in our network are owned and operated by unaffiliated companies, some of whom operate more than one gateway. Except for the gateway in Nigeria, in which we hold a 30% equity interest, and Globalstar Asia Pacific, our joint venture in South Korea in which we hold a 49% equity interest, we have no financial interest in these IGOs and conduct business with them through arms&#8217; length contracts for wholesale minutes of service. Some of these IGOs have been unable to grow their businesses adequately due in part to limited resources and the prior inability of our constellation to provide reliable Duplex service. 

&#160; 

Set forth below is a list of IGOs as of February 22, 2016 :

Other Services 

&#160; 

We also provide engineering services to assist our commercial and government customers in developing new applications related to our system and to engineer and install new gateways that use our system. These services include hardware and software designs to develop specific applications operating over our network, as well as, the installation of gateways and antennas. 

&#160; 

Our Spectrum and Regulatory Structure 

&#160; 

We have access to a world-wide allocation of radio frequency spectrum through the international radio frequency tables administered by the International Telecommunications Union (&#8220;ITU&#8221;). We believe access to this global spectrum enables us to design satellites, networks and terrestrial infrastructure enhancements more cost effectively because the products and services can be deployed and sold worldwide. In addition, this broad spectrum assignment enhances our ability to capitalize on existing and emerging wireless and broadband applications. 

&#160; 

First-Generation Constellation 

&#160; 

In the United States, the FCC has authorized us to operate our first-generation satellites in 25.225 MHz of radio spectrum comprising two blocks of non-contiguous radio frequencies in the 1.6/2.4 GHz band commonly referred to as the "Big LEO" 

Spectrum Band. Specifically, the FCC has authorized us to operate between 1610-1618.725 MHz for &#8220;Uplink&#8221; communications from mobile earth terminals to our satellites and between 2483.5-2500 MHz for &#8220;Downlink&#8221; communications from our satellites to our mobile earth terminals. The FCC has also authorized us to operate our four domestic gateways with our first-generation satellites in the 5091-5250 and 6875-7055 MHz bands. 

&#160; 

Three of our subsidiaries hold our FCC licenses. Globalstar Licensee LLC holds our MSS license. GUSA Licensee LLC (&#8220;GUSA&#8221;) is authorized by the FCC to distribute mobile and fixed subscriber terminals and to operate gateways in the United States. GUSA holds the licenses for our gateways in Texas, Florida and Alaska. Another subsidiary, GCL Licensee LLC (&#8220;GCL&#8221;), holds an FCC license to operate a gateway in Puerto Rico. GCL is also subject to regulation by the Puerto Rican regulatory agency. 

Our former Non-Geostationary Satellite Orbit (&#8220;NGSO&#8221;) satellite constellation license issued by the FCC was valid until April 2013. We filed an application to modify and extend this license. On September 18, 2014 the Satellite Division of the FCC's International Bureau granted the application of Globalstar Licensee LLC to modify its authorization for "Big LEO" non-geostationary orbit MSS space stations by extending the 15-year license term by approximately 11.5 years through October 4, 2024. This license applies only to our continued use of our first-generation satellites. 

&#160; 

Second-Generation Constellation 

&#160; 

We licensed and registered our second-generation satellites in France. In October 2010, the French Ministry for the Economy, Industry and Employment authorized our wholly owned subsidiary, Globalstar Europe SARL, now Globalstar Europe SAS (&#8220;Globalstar Europe&#8221;), to operate our second-generation satellites. In November 2010, ARCEP, the French independent administrative authority of post and electronic communications regulations, granted a license to Globalstar Europe to provide mobile satellite service. In August 2011, the French Ministry in charge of space operations issued us final authorization and has undertaken the registration of our second-generation satellites with the United Nations as provided under the Convention on Registration of Objects Launched into Outer Space. In accordance with this authorization to operate the second-generation satellites, in early 2014, we completed the enhancements to the existing gateway operations in Aussaguel, France to include satellite operations and control functions. We now have redundant satellite operation control facilities in Milpitas, California and Aussaguel, France. 

&#160; 

The French National Frequencies Agency (&#8220;ANFR&#8221;) is representing us before the ITU for purposes of receiving assignments of orbital positions and conducting international coordination efforts to address any interference concerns. ANFR submitted the technical papers to the ITU on our behalf in July 2009. As with the first-generation constellation, the ITU will require us to coordinate our spectrum assignments with other companies that use any portion of our spectrum bands. We cannot predict how long the coordination process will take; however, we are able to use the frequencies during the coordination process in accordance with our national licenses. 

&#160; 

In addition to having completed the French licensing and registration of our second-generation satellites, in March 2011 we obtained all authorizations necessary from the FCC to operate our domestic gateways with our second-generation satellites. 

&#160; 

Potential Terrestrial Use of Globalstar Spectrum 

&#160; 

In February 2003, the FCC adopted rules that permit satellite service providers such as Globalstar to establish terrestrial networks utilizing the ancillary terrestrial component (&#8220;ATC&#8221;) of their licensed spectrum. ATC authorization enables the integration of a satellite-based service with terrestrial wireless services, resulting in a hybrid MSS/ATC network designed to provide advanced services and broad coverage throughout the United States. An ATC deployment could extend our services to urban areas and inside buildings where satellite services are currently not available, as well as to rural and remote areas that lack terrestrial wireless services. 

&#160; 

In order to establish an ATC network, a satellite service provider must first meet certain specified requirements commonly known as the &#8220;gating criteria.&#8221; Currently, these criteria would require us to provide continuous coverage over the United States and have an in-orbit spare satellite. Additionally, ATC services must be complementary or ancillary to MSS in an "integrated service offering," which can be achieved by using "dual-mode" devices capable of transmitting and receiving mobile satellite and ATC signals, or providing &#8220;other evidence&#8221; that the satellite service provider meets the requirement. Further, user subscriptions that include ATC services must also include MSS. Because of these numerous and onerous requirements, no substantial ATC services have ever been established. 

&#160; 

In July 2010, the FCC instituted a rulemaking proceeding and notice of inquiry to consider whether certain gating criteria should be revised or eliminated so as to permit satellite operators to exercise greater flexibility in utilizing ATC. Interested parties, including Globalstar, filed comments in these proceedings in September 2010, proposing to eliminate, or substantially modify the existing gating criteria. 

On November 13, 2012, we filed a petition for rulemaking with the FCC, requesting the substantial revision and/or elimination of the gating criteria for ATC services as well as regulatory flexibility to offer terrestrial wireless services, including mobile broadband services over our licensed "Big LEO" spectrum allocation. 

&#160; 

In November 2013, the FCC proposed rules, which, if adopted, would enable us to offer low-power ATC services such as TLPS over a portion of our licensed MSS spectrum. We anticipate that the FCC will take final action in this proceeding in the near future. The proposed rules would substantially eliminate the gating criteria as applied to low-power ATC services and would allow us to provide TLPS over our licensed spectrum together with the use of the adjacent unlicensed spectrum. If the FCC adopts these proposed rules, we plan to establish one or more partnerships to deploy commercial service promptly as well as to seek similar terrestrial authority in certain international jurisdictions. 

National Regulation of Service Providers 

&#160; 

In order to operate gateways, applicable laws and regulations require the IGOs and our affiliates in each country to obtain a license or licenses from that country's telecommunications regulatory authority. In addition, the gateway operator must enter into appropriate interconnection and financial settlement agreements with local and interexchange telecommunications providers. All gateways operated by us and the IGOs are licensed. 

&#160; 

Our subscriber equipment generally must be type certified in countries in which it is sold or leased. The manufacturers of the equipment and our affiliates or IGOs are jointly responsible for securing type certification. We have received type certification in multiple countries for each of our products. &#160; 

&#160; 

Ground Network 

&#160; 

Our satellites communicate with a network of 25 gateways, each of which serves an area of approximately 700,000 to 1,000,000 square miles. The design of our orbital planes ensures that generally at least one satellite is visible from any point on the earth's surface between 70&#176; north latitude and 70&#176; south latitude. A gateway must be within line-of-sight of a satellite and the satellite must be within line-of-sight of the subscriber to provide services. We have positioned our gateways to cover most of the world's land and population. We own 13 of these gateways and the rest are owned by IGOs. In addition, we have spare parts in storage, including antennas and gateway electronic equipment, including additional gateways in storage. 

&#160; 

Each of our gateways has multiple antennas that communicate with our satellites and pass calls seamlessly between antenna beams and satellites as the satellites traverse the gateways, thereby reflecting the signals from our users' terminals to our gateways. Once a satellite acquires a signal from an end-user, the Globalstar System authenticates the user and establishes the voice or data channel to complete the call to the public switched telephone network, to a cellular or another wireless network or to the internet (for a data call including Simplex). 

&#160; 

We believe that our terrestrial gateways provide a number of advantages over the in-orbit switching used by our main competitor, including better call quality, reduced call latency and convenient regionalized local phone numbers for inbound and outbound calling. We also believe that our network's design enables faster and more cost-effective system maintenance and upgrades because the system's software and much of its hardware are located on the ground. Our multiple gateways allow us to reconfigure our system quickly to extend another gateway's coverage to make up some or all of the coverage of a disabled gateway or to handle increased call capacity resulting from surges in demand. 

&#160; 

Our network uses Qualcomm's patented CDMA technology to permit diversity combining of the strongest available signals. Patented receivers in our handsets track the pilot channel or signaling channel as well as three additional communications channels simultaneously. Compared to other satellite and network architectures, we offer superior call clarity with virtually no discernible delay. Our system architecture provides full frequency re-use. This maximizes diversity (which maximizes quality) and capacity as we can reuse the assigned spectrum in every satellite beam in every satellite. Our network also works with internet protocol (&#8220;IP&#8221;) data for reliable transmission of IP messages. 

&#160; 

Although our network is currently CDMA-based, it is configured so that it can also support one or more other air interfaces that we may select in the future. For example, we have developed a non-Qualcomm proprietary CDMA technology for our SPOT and Simplex services. Because our satellites are essentially "mirrors in the sky," and all of our network's switches and hardware are located on the ground, we can easily and relatively inexpensively modify our ground hardware and software to use other wave forms to meet customer demands for new and innovative services and products. 

Next-Generation Gateways and Other Ground Facilities 

&#160; 

We have a contract with Hughes under which Hughes will design, supply and implement the RAN ground network equipment and software upgrades for installation at a number of our satellite gateway ground stations and satellite interface chips to be used in our various next-generation devices. These upgrades will be part of our next-generation ground network. 

&#160; 

We also have a contract with Ericsson, Inc. (&#8220;Ericsson&#8221;) to develop and implement a ground interface, or core network, system that will be installed at our satellite gateway ground stations. The core network system is wireless network and landline compatible and will link our radio access network to the public-switched telephone network (&#8220;PSTN&#8221;) and/or Internet. This new core network system is part of our next-generation ground network. 

&#160; 

Our second-generation constellation, when combined with our next-generation ground network, is designed to provide our customers with enhanced future services featuring increased data speeds of up to 256 kbps in a flexible Internet protocol multimedia subsystem (&#8220;IMS&#8221;) configuration. We will be able to support multiple products and services, including multicasting; advanced messaging capabilities such as Multimedia Messaging Service (&#8220;MMS&#8221;); geo-location services; multi-band and multi-mode handsets; and data devices with GPS integration. 

&#160; 

We own and operate gateways in the United States, Canada, Venezuela, Puerto Rico, France, Brazil, Singapore and Botswana. 

&#160; 

Industry 

&#160; 

We compete in the MSS sector of the global communications industry. MSS operators provide voice and data services using a network of one or more satellites and associated ground facilities. Mobile satellite services are usually complementary to, and interconnected with, other forms of terrestrial communications services and infrastructure and are intended to respond to users' desires for connectivity at all times and locations. Customers typically use satellite voice and data communications in situations where existing terrestrial wireline and wireless communications networks are impaired or do not exist. 

&#160; 

Worldwide, government organizations, military, natural disaster aid associations, event-driven response agencies and corporate security teams depend on mobile and fixed voice and data communications services on a regular basis. Global businesses with global operations require communications services when operating in remote locations around the world. MSS users span the forestry, maritime, government, oil and gas, mining, leisure, emergency services, construction and transportation sectors, among others. 

&#160; 

Over the past two decades, the global MSS market has experienced significant growth. Increasingly, better-tailored, improved-technology products and services are creating new channels of demand for mobile satellite services. Growth in demand for mobile satellite voice services is driven by the declining cost of these services, the diminishing size and lower costs of the handsets, as well as, heightened demand by governments, businesses and individuals for ubiquitous global voice and data coverage. Growth in mobile satellite data services is driven by the rollout of new applications requiring higher bandwidth, as well as low cost data collection and asset tracking devices and technological improvements permitting integration of mobile satellite services over smartphones and other Wi-Fi enabled devices. 

&#160; 

Communications industry sectors that are relevant to our business include: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

MSS, which provide customers with connectivity to mobile and fixed devices using a network of satellites and ground facilities; 

&#8226; 

fixed satellite services, which use geostationary satellites to provide customers with voice and broadband communications links between fixed points on the earth's surface; and 

&#8226; 

terrestrial services, which use a terrestrial network to provide wireless or wireline connectivity and are complementary to satellite services. 

Within the major satellite sectors, fixed and MSS operators differ significantly from each other. Fixed satellite services providers, such as Intelsat Ltd., Eutelsat Communications and SES S.A., and aperture terminal companies, such as Hughes and Gilat Satellite Networks, are characterized by large, often stationary or "fixed," ground terminals that send and receive high-bandwidth signals to and from the satellite network for video and high speed data customers and international telephone markets. On the other hand, MSS providers, such as Globalstar, Inmarsat PLC (&#8220;Inmarsat&#8221;) and Iridium Communications Inc. (&#8220;Iridium&#8221;), focus more on voice and data services (including data services which track the location of remote assets such as shipping containers), where mobility or small sized terminals are essential. As mobile satellite terminals begin to offer higher bandwidth to support a wider range of applications, we expect MSS operators will increasingly compete with fixed satellite services operators. 

&#160; 

LEO systems reduce transmission delay compared to a geosynchronous system due to the shorter distance signals have to travel. In addition, LEO systems are less prone to signal blockage and, consequently, we believe provide a better overall quality of service. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

The global communications industry is highly competitive. We currently face substantial competition from other service providers that offer a range of mobile and fixed communications options. Our most direct competition comes from other global MSS providers. Our two largest global competitors are Inmarsat and Iridium. We compete primarily on the basis of coverage, quality, portability and pricing of services and products. 

&#160; 

Inmarsat owns and operates a fleet of geostationary satellites. Due to its multiple-satellite geostationary system, Inmarsat's coverage area extends to and covers most bodies of water more completely than we do. Accordingly, Inmarsat is the leading provider of satellite communications services to the maritime sector. Inmarsat also offers global land-based and aeronautical communications services. We compete with Inmarsat in several key areas, particularly in our maritime markets. Inmarsat markets mobile handsets designed to compete with both Iridium&#8217;s mobile handset service and our GSP-1700 handset service. 

&#160; 

Iridium owns and operates a fleet of low earth orbit satellites. Iridium provides voice and data communications to businesses, United States and foreign governments, non-governmental organizations and consumers. Iridium markets products and services that are similar to those marketed by us. 

&#160; 

We compete with regional mobile satellite communications services in several markets. In these cases, our competitors serve customers who require regional, not global, mobile voice and data services, so our competitors present a viable alternative to our services. All of these competitors operate geostationary satellites. Our principal regional MSS competitor is Thuraya in the Middle East and Africa. 

&#160; 

In some of our markets, such as rural telephony, we compete directly or indirectly with very small aperture terminal (&#8220;VSAT&#8221;) operators that offer communications services through private networks using very small aperture terminals or hybrid systems to target business users. VSAT operators have become increasingly competitive due to technological advances that have resulted in smaller, more flexible and cheaper terminals. 

&#160; 

We compete indirectly with terrestrial wireline (&#8220;landline&#8221;) and wireless communications networks. We provide service in areas that are inadequately covered by these ground systems. To the extent that terrestrial communications companies invest in underdeveloped areas, we will face increased competition in those areas. 

&#160; 

Our SPOT products compete indirectly with Personal Locator Beacons (&#8220;PLB&#8221;s). A variety of manufacturers offer PLBs to an industry specification. 

&#160; 

Our industry has significant barriers to entry, including the cost and difficulty associated with obtaining spectrum licenses and successfully building and launching a satellite network. In addition to cost, there is a significant amount of lead-time associated with obtaining the required licenses, designing and building the satellite constellation and synchronizing the network technology. We will continue to face competition from Inmarsat and Iridium and other businesses that have developed global mobile satellite communications services. 

&#160; 

United States International Traffic in Arms Regulations and Other Trade Restrictions 

The United States International Traffic in Arms regulations under the United States Arms Export Control Act authorize the President of the United States to control the export and import of articles and services that can be used in the production of arms. The President has delegated this authority to the U.S. Department of State, Directorate of Defense Trade Controls. Among other things, these regulations limit the ability to export certain articles and related technical data to certain nations. Some information involved in the performance of our operations falls within the scope of these regulations. As a result, we may have to obtain an export authorization or restrict access to that information by international companies that are our vendors or service providers. We have received and expect to continue to receive export licenses for our telemetry and control equipment located outside the United States. We also are subject to restrictions related to transactions with persons subject to Unites States or foreign sanctions. These regulations limit our ability to offer services and equipment in certain areas. 

&#160; 

Environmental Matters 

&#160; 

We are subject to various laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and human health and safety (including those governing the management, storage and disposal of hazardous materials). Some of our operations require continuous power supply. As a result, current and historical operations at our ground facilities, including our gateways, include storing fuel and batteries, which may contain hazardous materials, to power back-up generators. As an owner or operator of property and in connection with our current and historical operations, we could incur significant costs, including cleanup costs, fines, sanctions and third-party claims, as a result of violations of or in connection with liabilities under environmental laws and regulations. 

&#160; 

Customers 

&#160; 

The specialized needs of our global customers span many markets. Our system is able to offer our customers cost-effective communications solutions in areas unserved or underserved by existing telecommunications infrastructures. Although traditional users of wireless telephony and broadband data services have access to these services in developed locations, our targeted customers often operate, travel to or live in remote regions or regions with under-developed telecommunications infrastructure where these services are not readily available or are not provided on a reliable basis. 

&#160; 

Our top revenue generating markets in the United States and Canada are government (including federal, state and local agencies), public safety and disaster relief, recreation and personal and telecommunications. We also serve customers in the maritime and fishing, oil and gas, natural resources (mining and forestry), construction, utilities and transportation markets. 

&#160; 

No one customer was responsible for more than 10% of our revenue in 2015, 2014, or 2013. 

&#160; 

Foreign Operations 

&#160; 

We supply services and products to a number of foreign customers. Although most of our sales are denominated in U.S. dollars, we are exposed to currency risk for sales in Canada, Europe, Brazil and other countries. In 2015, approximately 35% &#32;of our sales were generated in foreign countries, which generally are denominated in local currencies. See Note 12: Geographic Information in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding revenue by country. For more information about our exposure to risks related to foreign locations, see Item 1A: Risk Factors - We face special risks by doing business in developing markets, including currency and expropriation risks, which could increase our costs or reduce our revenues in these areas. 

&#160; 

Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

We hold various U.S. and foreign patents and patents pending that expire between 2016 and 2032. These patents cover many aspects of our satellite system, our global network and our user terminals. In recent years, we have reduced our foreign filings and allowed some previously-granted foreign patents to lapse based on (a) the significance of the patent, (b) our assessment of the likelihood that someone would infringe in the foreign country, and (c) the probability that we could or would enforce the patent in light of the expense of filing and maintaining the foreign patent which, in some countries, is quite substantial. We continue to maintain all of the patents in the United States, Canada and Europe which we believe are important to our business. Our intellectual property is pledged as security for our obligations under our senior secured credit facility agreement (the &#8220;Facility Agreement&#8221;). 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, we had 325 employees, 19 of whom were located in Brazil and subject to collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good. 

&#160; 

Seasonality 

&#160; 

Usage on the network and, to some extent, sales are subject to seasonal and situational changes. April through October are typically our peak months for service revenues and equipment sales. We also experience event-driven revenue fluctuations in our business. Most notably, emergencies, natural disasters and other sizable projects where satellite-based communications devices are the only solution may generate an increase in revenue. In the consumer area, SPOT devices are subject to outdoor and leisure activity opportunities, as well as our promotional efforts. 

Services and Equipment 

&#160; 

Sales of services accounted for approximately 82% , 78% &#32;and 78% &#32;of our total revenues for 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. We also sell the related voice and data equipment to our customers, which accounted for approximately 18% , 22% &#32;and 22% &#32;of our total revenues for 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. 

&#160;
