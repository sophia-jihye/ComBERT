 ITEM 1. BUSINESS &#160;

We are a Nevada corporation incorporated on August 30, 2006, under the name Gateway Certifications, Inc. On Novermber 16, 2009, our corporate name was changed to American Jianye Greentech Holdings, Ltd. and on February 13, 2014, our corporate name was changed to AJ Greentech Holdings, Ltd.

From November 2009 until October, 2013, through our China subsidiaries, we were engaged in design, marketing and distributing of alcohol base clean fuel which are designed to use less fossil fuel and have less pollution than traditional fuel. 

&#160; 

On October 31, 2013, pursuant to agreements with one of our former directors, we transferred the stock in our China subsidiaries to the former director in exchange for cancellation of debt totaling $240,000. As a result of the transfer of the subsidiaries, we were no longer engaged in the China clean fuel business. We transferred the stock of the China subsidiaries because we felt that, it not our best interest to continue China clean fuel business as a result of our decreasing revenue, continued losses and inability to raise capital for our business.

&#160; 

On October 31, 2013, Chu Li An acquired, for nominal consideration, 8,000,000 shares of common stock from the director who acquired the subsidiaries and 12,778,399 shares of common stock from The Chairman, who was also a director.

&#160; 

On November 18, 2013, we entered into agreement pursuant to which we issued to Chu Li An and her BVI company, our sole director and chief executive officer, 180,000,000 shares of common stock, in consideration of the cancellation of debt due to Chu Li An in the amount of $180,000.

On November 30, 2013, the company entered into an agreement to acquire all of the issued and outstanding stock of Jin Chih International, Ltd., a Taiwan corporation, from its sole owner Chu Li An &#160; for five million shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock. As of December 31, 2015, the stock has not been issued.

&#160;

As a result of the above transactions, we carry out the electronic products and general cargo trading and related consulting service business through our subsidiary named Jin Chih International, Ltd in Taiwan. We still plan to focus on providing greentech products outside of China in future. Even though the company has disposed China branches, the company's new management will continue to expand the current green energy and technology business in the United States and globally, at the same time to explore many other green and renewable energy such as solar, wind power, sea power by signing licensing agreement or joint venture with other research institutes.

&#160;

The new management is in negotiation with an established solar company to co-develop solar farm project in US, solar energy is by using Photovoltaic generating means to use the photovoltaic effect in the semiconducting material of Solar cells to straightly transfer the radiation to energy. Solar cell, the key-point, will form a large area of solar component after series connected and to collocate with power controller and inverter, finally, the photovoltaic power system formed. 

By looking into the huge potential of the biomass to renewable energy, the new management is also in negotiation other US firms to co-develop biomass project in US, Biomass energy means to store solar energy in the biomass by the form of chemical energy. It could straightly or indirectly comes from photosynthesis of green plants, and could transfer into normal solid-state, liquid-state and gaseous state fuel. Biomass power is renewable energy that inexhaustible, and also the only one kind Carbon source could relive. According to the different resources, the available biomass could be divided into 5 kinds of resources: forest resources, agricultural resources, sewage and industrial organic wastewater, urban solid waste, and animal wastes. The most promising one is generated by the main fuel of straw. The calorific value of straw is equal to half of the Standard Calomel Electrode, and the average sulfur only 3/8%. So, the CO2 emission in the process during generating and will reach the carbon neutral with the CO2 inhalation during biomass renewing. That results in zero discharge that could mitigate the global warming problems, and is the potential key-point to solve it.
