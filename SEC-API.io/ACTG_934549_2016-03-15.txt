Patent Licensing and Enforcement Business 

Our operating subsidiaries invest in, license and enforce patented technologies. Our operating subsidiaries partner with inventors and patent owners, applying our legal and technology expertise to patent assets to unlock the financial value in their patented inventions. We are an intermediary in the patent marketplace, bridging the gap between invention and application, facilitating efficiency and delivering monetary rewards to patent owners. 

Our operating subsidiaries generate revenues and related cash flows from the granting of intellectual property rights for the use of patented technologies that our operating subsidiaries control or own. Our operating subsidiaries assist patent owners with the prosecution and development of their patent portfolios, the protection of their patented inventions from unauthorized use, the generation of licensing revenue from users of their patented technologies and, where necessary, with the enforcement against unauthorized users of their patented technologies through the filing of patent infringement litigation. 

Refer to the section entitled &#8220;Patented Technologies&#8221; below for a partial summary of patent portfolios owned or controlled by certain of our operating subsidiaries. 

Patents are an important asset class worldwide. Due to legislative and regulatory changes, licensing and enforcing patents has become increasingly difficult for patent holders, necessitating an experienced, well-capitalized, licensing partner. We focus solely on the patent marketplace, and have emerged as a leading outsource patent licensing and enforcement company for patent owners that have made the important choice to outsource their patent licensing and enforcement activities. 

We are a leader in patent licensing and enforcement and our operating subsidiaries have established a proven track record of licensing success with more than 1,490 &#32;license agreements executed to date. On a consolidated basis, to date, we have generated revenues from 185 &#32;patent portfolio licensing and enforcement programs. Our professional staff includes in-house patent attorneys, licensing executives, engineers and business development executives. 

We partner with the disenfranchised patent owner, including individual inventors, universities, and large multi-national corporations in the technology, medical technology, energy, and industrial sectors. A disenfranchised patent owner owns patents that are being infringed by third-parties in connection with the design, manufacture, use, or distribution of products and/or services, but is not receiving fair compensation for the unauthorized use of his or her patented inventions by those third-parties. We strive to reward inventors and patent owners for their creative technological contributions. We also partner with patent owners, including individual inventors, universities, and domestic and multi-national corporations who may have limited internal resources and/or expertise to effectively address the unauthorized use of their patented technologies, and those that are seeking to effectively and efficiently monetize their portfolio of patented technologies on an outsourced basis. In a typical arrangement, our operating subsidiary will partner with a patent portfolio owner, acquiring rights in the patent portfolio or acquiring the patent portfolio outright, and in exchange, the original patent portfolio owner receives (i) a percentage of our operating subsidiary&#8217;s net recoveries from the licensing and enforcement of the patent portfolio, which we refer to as our Partnering Model, or (ii) an upfront payment for the purchase of the patent portfolio rights or the patent portfolio, which we refer to as our Purchasing Model, or (iii) a combination of the two, which we refer to as our Hybrid Partnering Model. 

Under U.S. law, a patent owner has the right to exclude others from making, selling or using their patented invention. A third-party infringes a patent by making, offering for sale, selling, or using a patented invention without a license from the patent owner. Unfortunately, in the majority of cases, infringers are generally unwilling, at least initially, to negotiate or pay reasonable license fees for their unauthorized use of third-party patents and will typically fight any allegations of patent infringement. Inventors and/or patent holders without sufficient legal, financial and/or expert technical resources to bring and continue the pursuit of costly and complex patent infringement actions are often blatantly ignored. 

&#32;4 

As a result of the common reluctance of patent infringers to negotiate and ultimately take a patent license for the use of patented technologies without at least the threat of legal action, patent licensing and enforcement often begins with the filing of patent enforcement litigation. However, most patent infringement litigation settles out of court at amounts that are related to the strength of the patent and the value of the invention in the infringer&#8217;s products or services. We execute agreements that grant rights in our patents to users of our patented technologies. Our agreements can be negotiated without the filing of patent litigation, or negotiated in the shadow of ongoing patent litigation, depending on the specific facts and circumstances. 

Patents are a complex and highly technical subject area. Our professionals actively seek to identify high-quality but undervalued patent portfolios in a variety of industries. We combine our legal expertise, technology expertise, and our extensive knowledge of, and experience in, the patent licensing ecosystem, to continually uncover important patent assets and bring needed proficiency to patent licensing and enforcement. 

Our partnership with patent owners is the cornerstone of our operating subsidiaries&#8217; corporate strategy. We assume all responsibility for advancing operational expenses while pursuing a patent licensing and enforcement program, and then share net licensing revenue with our patent partners as that program matures, on a pre-arranged and negotiated basis. We may also provide upfront capital to the patent owner as an advance against future licensing revenue. We are a principal in the licensing and enforcement effort, with our operating subsidiaries obtaining control of the rights in the patent portfolio, or control of the patent portfolio outright. 

Business Model and Strategy - Overview 

We have the flexibility to structure arrangements in a number of ways to address the needs and specific sets of circumstances presented by each of our unique patent partners, examples of which include the following: 

Partnering Model : 

&#8226; 

50/50 net profit sharing of revenue after legal costs and other licensing and enforcement costs. Profit sharing percentages can vary. 

&#8226; 

Typical partners include major corporations, research labs and universities and individual inventors. 

&#8226; 

Upon return of advanced costs, net profit revenue share with patent partner commences. 

Hybrid Partnering Model : 

&#8226; 

Hybrid Partnership with up-front capital infusion to our patent partners as an advance on future licensing revenue streams. 

&#8226; 

Increases our total addressable market providing an advantage over competitors. 

&#8226; 

Typical partners include major corporations seeking to effectively and efficiently monetize their patent portfolios. 

&#8226; 

We maintain at least a 100% preferred rate of return until all deployed capital is returned. 

&#8226; 

Upon return of capital infusion, net profit revenue share with patent partner commences. 

Purchasing Model : 

&#8226; 

We invest in 100% of the patents for 100% of the profits, with no backed participation for the patent owner. 

&#8226; 

Typical partners include distressed corporations and other corporations with limited success controlled by venture capitalists. 

&#32;5 

Key Elements of Business Strategy 

Patent licensing and enforcement can be an effective and efficient way to maximize the profit potential of a patent. A patent license agreement grants a third-party user of an invention specific patent rights to the patented invention in exchange for patent license fees. Patent licensing is especially suitable for patents that are owned by the patent-disenfranchised. Patent disenfranchised owners of patents are those that have not successfully converted their patented invention into a profitable product or service, and therefore, are not generating revenues from their patented inventions. The patent-disenfranchised, for example, include owners of the following categories of patented inventions: 

&#8226; 

Inventions that were so far ahead of the technology curve that there is no existing ecosystem to support the patented products or services at the time they are introduced to market; 

&#8226; 

Inventions that can only be deployed in very capital-intensive industries, such as semiconductor fabrication, energy, or medical sectors, but whose owners do not have sufficient amounts of capital to deploy; and 

&#8226; 

Inventions that, for one reason or another, including the shifting of cost-effective manufacturing overseas, are no longer being practiced by the patent owner. 

Our patent licensing business provides patent holders with an opportunity to generate income from their patented inventions being practiced by third-parties without authorization. Our patent licensing and enforcement business strategy, conducted solely by our operating subsidiaries, includes three fundamental elements, as follows: 

&#8226; 

Patent Discovery &#32;- Discover potentially valuable patents or patent portfolios. 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

Assessment of Economic Value - &#32;Work internally and with external experts to evaluate the use of the patented invention(s) in the relevant marketplace and assess a patents or patent portfolios&#8217; expected economic value. 

&#8226; 

Licensing and Enforcement &#32;- For unauthorized users of the patented invention, enter into license negotiations and, if necessary, litigation to monetize the patent based on its assessed value. 

Patent Discovery. The patent process breeds, encourages and sustains innovation and invention by granting a limited monopoly to the inventor in exchange for sharing the invention with the public. Certain technologies, including several of the technologies controlled by our operating subsidiaries, some of which are summarized below, become core technologies in the way products and services are manufactured, sold or delivered by companies across a wide array of industries. Our operating subsidiaries identify core, patented technologies that have been or are anticipated to be widely adopted by third-parties in connection with the manufacture, sale or use of products and services. Patent discovery occurs when we reach out to patent holders who may be disenfranchised, or when patent holders approach us seeking assistance with the monetization and enforcement of their patent portfolios. 

Assessment of Economic Value. Subsequent to the patent discovery process, our executives work internally and/or with external industry experts in the specific technology field, to evaluate the patented invention and its adoption and implementation in the marketplace. There are several key factors to consider when analyzing a patent and determining a patent&#8217;s value: (1) Infringement, (2) Validity and (3) Enforceability. 

&#8226; 

Infringement . To determine infringement, we must first identify third-parties that are practicing the invention(s) covered by the patent without obtaining permission from the patent owner to do so. A key tool in determining whether or not a company is infringing a patent is a claim chart. A claim chart demonstrates how the manufacture, sale, or use of an existing product compares against the claims of the patent. 

&#8226; 

Invalidity. &#32;The three main factors analyzed to determine invalidity are (1) anticipation, (2) obviousness, and (3) the existence of non-patentable subject matter. 

&#9702; 

Anticipation occurs when the claims of the patent are entirely revealed within a single piece of prior art. &#8220;Prior art&#8221; is a technical term that generally refers to an invention that existed prior to the grant of the patent being analyzed. 

&#9702; 

Even if the claims of the patent are not entirely revealed within a single piece of prior art, the patent may still be invalid if determined to be &#8220;obvious&#8221; under the law. &#8220;Obvious&#8221; essentially means that the 

&#32;6 

differences between prior art and the patented invention are so slight such that they would have been obvious at the time of invention to one who is skilled in the subject matter being patented. 

&#9702; 

Even if the patent lacks anticipation and obviousness, it may still be invalid if its subject matter is un-patentable by law. Un-patentable subject matter includes naturally occurring things, abstract concepts, or algorithms that perform an ordinary function. 

&#8226; 

Enforceability . A myriad of factors are analyzed to determine whether or not a patent is enforceable, including whether or not there has been patent misuse, or whether or not there are antitrust violations associated with the patent. Due to the inherently complex nature of patent law, only a court or specific administrative body, such as the International Trade Commission, can make a decision whether a patent is infringed, valid and enforceable; however, we employ our wealth of expertise to make the best assessment possible given a specific fact pattern and set of circumstances. 

We estimate a patent&#8217;s economic value by evaluating the expected value of the license revenue stream based on past, present and future revenue of infringing products or services, and the risk that a court will disagree with our infringement, validity or enforcement assessments of the patent. 

The processes and procedures employed in connection with the evaluation of a specific patent portfolio for future investment, licensing and enforcement are tailored and unique to each specific situation and can vary widely based on the specific facts and circumstances of a specific patent portfolio, such as the related technology, related industry and certain other factors. Some of the key components of our processes and procedures may include: 

&#8226; 

Utilizing our staff of in-house business development executives, patent attorneys, patent licensing executives, and technology engineers to conduct our tailored patent investment and evaluation processes and procedures. We may also leverage the expertise of external specialists and technology consultants. 

&#8226; 

Identifying emerging growth areas where patented technologies will play a vital role in connection with the manufacture or sale of products and services. 

&#8226; 

Identifying core, patented technologies that have been or are anticipated to be widely adopted by third-parties in connection with the manufacture or sale of products and services. 

&#8226; 

Considering the impact of subtleties in the language of a patent, recorded interactions with the patent office, evaluating prior art and literature and considering the impact on the potential licensing and enforcement revenue that can be derived from a patent or patent portfolio. 

&#8226; 

Evaluating the strength of a patent portfolio, including consideration of the types of claims and the number of claims potentially infringed by third-parties, and the results of any prior art searches or analysis, before the decision is made to allocate resources to a patent portfolio investment or an effective licensing and enforcement effort. 

&#8226; 

Identifying and considering potential problem areas, if any, and determining whether potential problem areas can be overcome prior to acquiring a patent portfolio or launching an effective licensing program. 

&#8226; 

Identifying potential infringers, industries within which the potential infringers exist, longevity of the patented technology, and a variety of other factors that directly impact the magnitude and potential success of a licensing and enforcement program. 

Licensing and Enforcement . The final step in the patent licensing and enforcement process is to monetize the patent by securing license agreements based on the patents estimated value. While we prefer to convince unauthorized users of our patented inventions of the value of the patented invention and secure a license agreement in a non-litigious manner, many infringers refuse to take such licenses even when confronted with substantial and persuasive evidence of infringement, validity, enforceability and significant economic value. As a result, often we must resort to litigation to demonstrate and prove infringement and ultimately induce infringers to take a license. We have found it effective to negotiate licenses concurrently with litigation due to the fact that litigation necessitates and facilitates an information exchange that helps both sides assess the value of a patent and make informed decisions. Also, litigation eventually leads to a court&#8217;s judgment. When a court agrees with our assessment of a patent, this judgment stops recalcitrant infringers from indefinitely profiting from the patent they are infringing. 

Our operating subsidiaries engage highly competent and experienced patent lawyers to prosecute their patent portfolio litigation. It is imperative to be persistent and patient throughout the litigation process as it typically takes 18-36 months from the filing date of a lawsuit to yield a license agreement from a potential licensee. Often, it takes longer to secure a final court judgment. 

&#32;7 

Patent license negotiations and litigation initiated by our operating subsidiaries usually lead to serious and thoughtful discussions with the unauthorized users of the patented inventions. The result can be quite favorable with the user being granted rights under the patents for the patented invention in its products and services in exchange for financial remuneration. This remuneration is typically shared between our operating subsidiary and the patent holder. 

&#160; 

Patent Prosecution. Concurrent with our patent litigation and licensing negotiation activities, we often assist patent holders with the acquisition of additional rights associated with their inventions both in the United States and across the globe. This is referred to as &#8220;continued prosecution,&#8221; and is done to further define the boundaries of an invention. It can also be effective to correct technical deficiencies discovered within a patent that may have been identified in the negotiation and litigation process. These deficiencies, if not appropriately addressed, can limit the value of patents that are otherwise infringed, valid, enforceable. 

Our specialists, along with third-party experts that we engage, are trained and skilled in the areas of patent discovery, assessment of a patent or patent portfolios expected economic value, acquiring additional patent rights via continued patent prosecution, and patent licensing and enforcement. In applying our legal and technology expertise to high quality patent assets, we bridge the gap between invention and application, facilitating efficiency and delivering monetary rewards to the patent disenfranchised and other patent owners with whom we partner.
