(b) Financial Information about Industry Segments

While selling children&#8217;s books is our only line of business, we sell them through two divisions:

&#183;

The UBAM consultants also distribute these titles to school and public libraries.

Products

&#160;

As the sole United States trade publisher of the Usborne line of books, we offer over 2,000 different titles. Many are interactive in nature, including our Touchy-Feely board books, activity and flashcards, adventure and search books, art books, sticker books and foreign language books. The majority of the titles published by Kane Miller Book Publishers originally were published in other countries in their native languages.

We have a broad line of &#8216;internet-linked&#8217; books which allow readers to expand their educational experience by referring them to relevant non-Usborne websites. Our books include science and math titles, as well as chapter books and novels. We continually introduce new titles across all lines of our products.

UBAM markets the books through commissioned consultants using a combination of direct sales, home parties, book fairs and the internet. The division had approximately 19,600 consultants in 50 states at February 29, 2016.

EDC Publishing markets through commissioned trade representatives who call on book, toy, and specialty stores along with other retail outlets. We also do in-house marketing by telephone to these customers and potential customers. This division markets to approximately 5,000 book, toy and specialty stores. Significant orders, totaling 22% of the Publishing division&#8217;s net sales, have been received from major book chains.

Key Customers

No customer represents more than 10% of our net sales.

Seasonality

Sales for both divisions are greatest during the fall due to the holiday season.

Competition

While we have the exclusive U.S. rights to sell Usborne Books, we face competition for UBAM from several other larger direct selling companies - for sales and consultants. Our school and library market faces competition from Scholastic Books for the book fair market.

EDC Publishing faces competition from large U.S. and international publishing companies.

Employees

As of April 1, 2016, 150 full-time employees worked at our Tulsa and San Diego facilities; almost 60% of those are in the distribution warehouse. We believe our relations with our employees are good.

Company Reports

Our annual and quarterly reports (Forms 10-K and 10-Q), current Form 8-K reports and amendments to those reports filed with the SEC are available for download from the Investor Relations portion of our website at www.edcpub.com .
