 Item 1. Business. 

&#160; 

Overview 

&#160;

Magnolia Solar Corporation, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Magnolia Solar, Inc., is principally engaged in the development and commercialization of its nanotechnology-based, high-efficiency, thin-film technology that can be deposited on a variety of substrates, including glass and flexible structures. This technology has the potential to capture a larger part of the solar spectrum to produce high-efficiency solar cells, and incorporates a unique nanostructure-based antireflection coating technology to possibly further increase the solar cell's performance. If these goals are met, there is the potential of significantly reducing the cost per watt.

&#160;

Our research and development effort is located at the Albany Nanotech Center of the College of Nanoscale Science and Engineering (CNSE) in Albany. We are also part of the Photovoltaic Manufacturing Initiative (PVMI) funded by the U.S. Department of Energy under the Sun Shot program. In addition, the State of New York and the New York State Energy Research and Development Agency (NYSERDA) have invested approximately $100 million to build a new facility for the Photovoltaic Manufacturing Initiative next generation Copper Indium Selenide (CIGS) based manufacturing process development. Due to our membership in PVMI, we also have access for our research and development activity to the CNSE&#8217;s Solar Energy Development Center in Halfmoon, New York. This is a 100 kilowatt prototyping facility which we believe is ideal for our development effort. We believe that our use of this facility for development presently eliminates the capital needed to develop a dedicated facility to refine, evaluate, and finalize our technology program.

&#160;

We are a development stage company and to date have not generated material revenues or earnings as a result of our activities.

&#160;

&#160;

Recent Developments 

&#160;

On January 29, 2016, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the &#8220;Merger Agreement&#8221;) with Ecoark, Inc., a Delaware corporation that we refer to as &#8220;Ecoark&#8221;. The Merger Agreement provides, among other things, for the acquisition of Ecoark by the Company in a share for share exchange pursuant to which it is contemplated that, immediately following the closing, Ecoark shareholders will own approximately 95% of the outstanding share of the Company (the &#8220;Merger&#8221;). The Company filed a preliminary 14A Proxy Statement informing its shareholders of the Company&#8217;s intent to hold a shareholder meeting to vote on certain proposals to amend the Articles of Incorporation to increase of the authorized shares of common stock to 100,000,000 shares, to effect the creation of 5,000,000 shares of &#34;blank check&#34; preferred stock, to approve a reverse stock split of the common stock 1 for 250, and to change the name of the corporation to &#8220;Ecoark Holdings Inc.&#8221; Subject to the approval of the Company&#8217;s shareholders, it is anticipated that the Merger will be completed in March 2016. Under a January 29, 2016 agreement with the holders of various convertible notes that were past due, the maturity date of all such notes were extended to June 30, 2016 and the notes will convert to equity when the Merger is completed. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will successfully complete and disseminate the proxy statement or that the proposals therein will be approved by the shareholders. Furthermore, no assurances can be made that the Merger will be completed, as anticipated. In addition, if the Merger does not close, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in reaching a satisfactory agreement with holders of the notes or that we will reach an agreement to further extend the notes or convert them into equity.

&#160;

Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Ecoark will merge with and into a subsidiary of the Company created for the sole purpose of effectuating this Merger (the &#8220;Merger Sub&#8221;). Ecoark will be the surviving entity (the &#8220;Surviving Corporation&#8221;). As a result of the Merger, the separate corporate existence of the Merger Sub shall cease. We refer to this transaction as the Merger. Thus, upon the closing of the Merger Agreement, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, all of the property, rights, privileges, immunities, powers, and franchises of the Merger Sub and Ecoark shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities, and duties of the Merger Sub and Ecoark shall become the debts, liabilities, and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

&#160;

The Merger will have no effect on the market for the tradability of the shares of common stock of MSC, though the current ticker symbol for its shares is expected to be changed if and when its stockholders approve the change in its name. The Merger Agreement was filed as an exhibit to our Current Report on Form 8-K with the SEC on February 4, 2016 and is incorporated by reference herein.

&#160;

MSC and Ecoark expect to complete the Merger in the first quarter of 2016. However, the Merger is subject to certain approvals, and certain other conditions. As a result, it is possible that factors outside our control could result in the Merger being completed at a later time, or not at all.

&#160;

Corporate History 

&#160;

We were incorporated as a Nevada corporation on November 19, 2007 with a mission of becoming a leading resource for an individual or family&#8217;s relocation/moving needs. On December 31, 2009, we entered into an Agreement of Merger and Plan of Reorganization with Magnolia Solar, Inc., a privately-held Delaware corporation (&#8220;Magnolia Solar&#8221;), and Magnolia Solar Acquisition Corp., our wholly-owned Delaware subsidiary (&#8220;Acquisition Sub&#8221;). Upon the closing of the transaction, Acquisition Sub merged with and into Magnolia Solar, and Magnolia Solar, as the surviving corporation, became our wholly-owned subsidiary (the &#8220;Reverse Merger&#8221;). Immediately following the Reverse Merger we transferred all of our pre-Reverse Merger assets and liabilities to our wholly-owned subsidiary Mobilis Relocation Services Holdings, Inc. (&#8220;SplitCo&#8221;). Thereafter, we transferred all of the outstanding capital stock of SplitCo to certain of our stockholders in exchange for the cancellation of 1,500,000 shares of our common stock (the &#8220;Split-Off&#8221;) and we filed a Certificate of Change to our Articles of Incorporation in order to affect a forward split of the number of authorized shares of common stock which we are authorized to issue, and of our issued and outstanding shares in a ratio of 1.3157895:1 (the &#8220;Forward Split&#8221;). In connection with the merger, our name was changed from &#8220;Mobilis Relocation Services Inc.&#8221; to &#8220;Magnolia Solar Corporation&#8221; (the &#8220;Name Change&#8221;). Following the Reverse Merger, Split-Off, Forward Split and Name Change, we discontinued our former business and succeeded to the business of Magnolia Solar as our sole line of business.

&#160;

Description of Business 

&#160;

Our mission is to commercialize our nanotechnology-based, high efficiency, thin film solar cell technology that can be deposited on glass and other flexible substrates to convert sun&#8217;s energy to electricity. This photovoltaic (PV) technology has the ability to capture a larger part of the solar spectrum to produce high efficiency solar cells, and incorporates a unique nanostructure-based antireflection coating technology to further increase the solar cell&#8217;s efficiency thereby reducing the cost per watt.

&#160;

&#160; &#9679; We have been issued five patents. In addition, we have filed several patents to protect our intellectual property and are adding key technical personnel to validate and commercialize these solar cell technologies. Our goal is to increase our solar cells&#8217; efficiency from the present thin film solar cell efficiency of about 11%-13% to those rivaling efficiencies of crystalline photovoltaic cells in a commercial environment at a cost potentially reaching $0.50 per watt. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Our technology development is in part supported by various government grants and we have received the following awards to advance the development of our technology: &#160;

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; We received our first purchase order for a $1 million award from the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (&#8220;NYSERDA&#8221;) for the development of advanced thin-film solar cells using our technology, in partnership with the College of Nanoscale Science and Engineering (&#8220;CNSE&#8221;) at the University of Albany. This work successfully transitioned from the first phase to the next phase and the work on this contract is ongoing at present; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; We were awarded a contract from the National Aeronautical and Space Administration (NASA) for the development of a quantum-well waveguide technology for solar cell. The work on the NASA contract has been completed. The amount of the award was $99,999; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; We were awarded a Phase I Small Business Innovation Research / Small Business Technology Transfer (SBIR/STTR) contract from the U.S. Air Force to study the development of flexible, lightweight, ultra-high efficiency solar cells. The Phase I contract was for $99,999. Following the work for this contract which demonstrated our approach to simultaneously increase the current and voltage output of photovoltaic devices for space power applications, the U.S. Air Force has extended the contract to Phase II of the SBIR/STTR to demonstrate the technology. The amount of the Phase II award is $750,000 and the work on this contract has been completed; &#160;

&#160; &#9679; We received a second Phase I award from the U.S. Air Force to develop ultra-high efficiency, single junction quantum dot solar cells that can potentially match the efficiency of multiple junction solar cells at significantly lower costs. The contract amount was $99,999. Following the work on this contract demonstrating our approach to ultra-high efficiency, thin-film solar cells, the U.S. Air Force awarded Magnolia Solar a second Phase II STTR contract to demonstrate the technology. The amount of the Phase II award is $750,000 and work on this contract has been completed. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; We received an innovative product development contract from NYSERDA. The baseline program award is $250,000. The goal of this contract is to improve the performance of thin film solar cells by incorporating advanced light trapping techniques and nanostructured optical coatings. Work on this contract has been completed. &#160;

In addition to these developmental activities, we also benefit from the critical technologies being developed by Magnolia Optical Technologies, Inc. (&#8220;Magnolia Optical&#8221;), a company controlled by our two executive officers and directors, Ashok Sood and Yash Puri. Magnolia Optical has been at the forefront of pioneering the development of thin film, optical, and advanced solar cell technologies for high efficiency solar cells using nano-materials and technologies to use Ultraviolet, Visible and Infrared part of the electromagnetic spectrum for imaging sensors and solar cell applications for Defense and Terrestrial Application. Magnolia Optical Technologies, Inc., a Delaware Corporation, has been in business since May 2000 and is a government-approved contractor for advanced technology developments. Magnolia Optical has, to date, received over $13 million of funding support from Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and other Department of Defense (DOD) agencies, NASA and NSF to fund the development of the advanced nanostructure-based technologies for optical and solar cell applications.

&#160;

We currently license our core technology under development from Magnolia Optical. Under the license, we have been granted an exclusive, fully paid, royalty free, worldwide license to use the intellectual property of Magnolia Optical relating to the design and fabrication of thin-film solar photovoltaic solar cells for the manufacture and sale of thin-film photovoltaic solar cell products and services. In consideration for the license grant, Magnolia Optical shareholders received, after giving effect to the Reverse Merger and Forward Split, 7,130,000 shares of our common stock. The license has an initial term of ten years ending April 30, 2018 and shall automatically continue in effect thereafter unless terminated by either party. The license may be terminated for cause by either party.

&#160;

Magnolia Technology 

&#160;

We have developed thin-film photovoltaic technology that includes the use of nanotechnology-based components to substantially enhance solar cell efficiency. This technology utilizes higher absorption of the solar spectrum to produce high-efficiency solar cells. Our goal is to increase solar cell efficiency while using lower cost processes to minimize future production costs, with a goal of reaching less than one dollar per watt. We plan to use low-cost substrates for solar cell fabrication that are substantially cheaper than conventional silicon substrates. We plan to use either glass or polymer-based flexible substrates that are low cost and are available in large sizes, thereby bringing down the cost of thin film solar cells compared to those with silicon substrates.

&#160;

We have filed a series of U.S. utility and provisional patent applications. The utility patent applications claim the benefits of previously filed provisional applications. The utility and provisional patent applications filed over the past year detail a number of photovoltaic solar cell device designs and methods of manufacturing. The technologies related to these patent filings address the fundamental performance limitations in existing thin-film solar cells. The engineering employed in our patent-pending technology is designed to increase the photovoltaic operating voltage while capturing a larger part of the solar spectrum, and the unique nanostructure-based optical coatings minimize reflection losses which enhances the light trapping within the photovoltaic devices. These technologies result in higher solar electric conversion efficiency by increasing both the voltage and current output of thin-film solar cells.

&#160;

&#160;

Government funding of some of our research and development efforts imposed certain restrictions on our ability to commercialize results and could grant commercialization rights to the government. In some funding awards, the government is entitled to intellectual property rights arising from the related research. Such rights include a nonexclusive, nontransferable, irrevocable, paid-up license to practice or have practiced each subject invention developed under an award throughout the world by or on behalf of the government. Other rights include the right to require us to grant a license to the developed technology or products to a third party or, in some cases, if we refuse, the government may grant the license itself, if the government determines that action is necessary because we fail to achieve practical application of the technology, because action is necessary to alleviate health or safety needs, to meet requirements of federal regulations, or to give the United States industry preference. Accepting government funding can also require that manufacturing of products developed with federal funding be conducted in the United States.

&#160;

Industry Overview and Market Opportunity 

&#160;

Solar electric power or photovoltaic (PV) technology is the conversion of sunlight directly into electricity. The solar cells available today use semiconducting materials (similar to those used in computer chips and flat panel displays) such as silicon. These cells are the basic building blocks of complete systems. To provide useful amounts of power, the cells are wired together in varying numbers to create solar modules (also called solar panels).

&#160;

A typical rooftop residential system may have one or two dozen modules. PV converts sunlight into electricity, with no moving parts, consuming no fuel, and creating no pollution. It is a distributed energy resource that can improve grid reliability, lower distribution and transmission costs, and be sited at the point of use with minimal or no environmental impact. In 2012, the worldwide solar PV module production was slightly below 30 GW. About 85% of these are made from silicon.

&#160;

Solar Cell Technology Overview 

&#160;

The solar market consists of two major technology segments-crystalline silicon solar cells and thin film solar cells. This section provides a brief overview of the crystalline silicon solar cells and thin film solar cells on the market today.

&#160;

Crystalline Silicon Solar Cells 

&#160;

The solar photovoltaic market is dominated by the crystalline silicon (c-Si) technology that was developed in the '60s for the space race and then converted for commercial use during the energy crunch of the '70s. Today, about 85 percent of solar cells and solar panels are made with silicon wafers. There are several different types of silicon that are being used in solar cell and panel production including:

&#160;

&#160; &#9679; Single crystal silicon &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Poly-crystalline cells &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Ribbon silicon cells &#160;

One of the serious limitations faced by manufacturers of crystalline silicon based solar cells is the shortage of raw silicon material. These companies are competing against microprocessor and electronic circuit device manufacturer for silicon wafers. Even though there are efforts underway to expand the silicon output, it does appear that it will be many years before enough capacity is in place for supply to match demand in the marketplace. At the commercial level, the silicon solar cell&#8217;s quality depends on the efficiency which ranges from 15 to 17 percent with higher performance obtained by using higher quality crystalline silicon.

&#160;

Thin Film Solar Cells 

&#160;

Thin film solar cells are gaining popularity owing to their ability to minimize the usage of semiconductor materials and thus potentially lower the cost of photovoltaic modules. There are several different thin film technologies that are under development for both the military satellite market and the terrestrial market. The varieties of thin film solar technologies undergoing commercialization include:

&#160;

&#160; &#9679; CIGS cells &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; CdTe/CdS cells &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Amorphous-silicon thin film solar cells &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Multi-junction GaAs cells for space power applications &#160;

There are second-generation, thin-film technologies that are under development that can provide higher solar cell efficiency. Thin-film solar cell technologies have steadily gained market share from the incumbent crystalline silicon producers owing to low manufacturing cost.

&#160;

&#160;

Magnolia Solar Cell and Anti-Reflection Coating Approach 

&#160;

Energetic radiation from the sun, reaching the Earth&#8217;s surface, includes ultra-violet, infrared and visible light. Our thin film solar cell design is being designed to enhance absorption in the UV spectrum and will be able to provide electricity more efficiently in hazy weather and very hot days using IR energy. We are developing high-efficiency, thin-film solar cells employing nanostructured-based materials that can be used for producing high performance solar panels. Our proprietary technology incorporates nano-materials and technologies that were developed under sponsorship by NYSERDA, DARPA, NASA, and the US Department of Defense. We utilize a nanostructure-based approach in the development of high-efficiency thin film solar cells. Our technology is designed to permit absorption across a broad spectrum of light.

&#160;

Optical reflection losses limit the performance of a wide variety of photonic and photovoltaic devices. We have demonstrated nanostructured optical coatings that can reduce reflection losses and enhance the performance of solar cells. Nanostructured optical coatings can be applied to the top surface of semiconductor solar cells to reduce reflection losses over a wide range of wavelengths and incident angles. Anti-reflection (AR) coatings are an indispensable component of solar cell devices to reduce or suppress reflection losses, thus increasing the amount of light entering the solar cells device and enhancing the power conversion efficiency. We demonstrated antireflection coatings comprised of step-graded, nanostructured SiO2 have been shown to significantly increase the transmittance through the optical glass windows. Our double-sided, nanostructured SiO2 coatings outperform conventional MgF2 coatings, achieving average transmittance values in excess of 98% over a broad spectrum and wide range of incident angles. The demonstrated ultra-high broadband performance of nanostructured SiO2 anti-reflection coatings can benefit high performance single- and multi-junction solar cells.

&#160;

Light trapping can dramatically improve solar cell performance by increasing the optical path length of photons within the thin film absorber layers. To further enhance the performance of the thin film solar cell, the bottom contact should also reflect unabsorbed light back into the CIGS thin film solar cell. Internal reflectors and light trapping structures on the underside of a semiconductor structure can improve the performance of a variety of photovoltaic devices and thin-film solar cells. By incorporating a high-performance back reflector, unabsorbed photons can be recycled and scattered back into the active region of a solar cell device. We are developing a conductive omnidirectional back reflector employing nanostructured indium tin oxide (ITO). This is intended to diffuse the light as well, maximize the optical path length in the absorber layers.

&#160;

We are developing next generation nanostructure based CIGS thin film solar cells. Our cell design takes advantage of quantum structures such as quantum dots to enhance the solar cell efficiency beyond what is achievable today in CIGS thin film solar cells. Conventional solar cell modules are both heavy and rigid, typically employing fragile silicon wafers and thick panes of protective glass. While these panels are suitable for fixed installations on rooftops and fields, flexible photovoltaic modules can provide a mobile source of electrical power for a wide variety of emerging applications in both terrestrial and space environments. We are developing flexible solar cell technologies for mobile and portable power applications. Our goal is to demonstrate solar cell efficiency in flexible CIGS greater than 20 percent.

&#160;

Intellectual Property 

&#160;

Our success depends, in part, on our ability to maintain and protect our proprietary technology and to conduct our business without infringing on the proprietary rights of others. We rely primarily on a combination of patents and trade secrets, as well as associate and third party confidentiality agreements, to safeguard our intellectual property. Since January 2010 we have filed several patent applications to protect inventions arising from our research and development, and are currently pursuing patent applications in the U.S. Five patents have been issued by the United States Patent Office. These patents are listed below:

&#160;

Patent No. &#160; Title 8,865,506 &#160; Roll-to-roll solution process method for fabricating CIGS solar cells and system for the same 8,895,838 &#160; Multijunction solar cell employing extended heterojunction and step graded antireflection structures and methods for constructing the same 8,921,687 &#160; High efficiency quantum well waveguide solar cells and methods for constructing the same 8,969,711 &#160; Solar cell employing nanocrystalline superlattice material and amorphous structure and method of constructing the same 8,981,207 &#160; High efficiency quantum dot sensitized thin film solar cell with absorber layer &#160;

Our remaining patent applications and any future patent applications might not result in a patent being issued with the scope of the claims we seek, or at all, and any patents we may receive or have received may be challenged, invalidated, or declared unenforceable.

&#160;

With respect to proprietary know-how that is not patentable and processes for which patents are difficult to enforce, we rely on, among other things, trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to safeguard our interests. We believe that many elements of our PV technology involve proprietary know-how, technology, or data that are not covered by patents or patent applications, including technical processes, equipment designs, algorithms, and procedures. We have taken security measures to protect these elements. All of our research and development personnel have entered into confidentiality and proprietary information agreements with us. We also require our business partners to enter into confidentiality agreements before we disclose any sensitive aspects of our technology or business plans.

&#160;

We have not been subject to any material intellectual property claims.

&#160;

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

We are currently in the development stage and do not sell a finished product. Since our end product will provide an energy source to convert the renewable solar energy to electricity, we will face competition from all forms of renewable energy technologies, including wind, hydropower, geothermal, biomass, and tidal technologies, as well as from other approaches to convert sun light to electricity. There is intense competition in the renewable energy market, specifically in the solar photovoltaic sector. There are already many established companies that sell solar cells and modules. During 2015, we estimate that there were several hundred manufacturers of solar cells and modules with aggregate installed capacity exceeding global demand. This had the result of a significant drop in the prices of solar modules throughout the year. One of the principal drivers of competition is price per watt, which is a function of the underlying technology and production capacity. In addition, some sovereign nations actively support competitors located in those countries. This allows competitors from those countries to sometimes price finished products below their costs. While some countries are taking steps to offset these subsidies by imposing tariffs on imports, the global competition remains very intense. Success in this highly competitive environment will depend on attaining high efficiencies at low costs, without the use of sustained government subsidies.

&#160;

Customers 

&#160;

We are still in the development stage and do not presently have any customers. We have used samples of anti-reflection coatings for evaluation. We continue to pursue establishing relationships with various companies and explore collaborations with them. As we exit the development stage, which is expected to occur in 2016, and commence the production of our solar cells and/or anti-reflective coatings, we expect to target federal civilian and military agencies and commercial customers including large corporations, non-governmental organizations, universities and solar powered electric generating stations.

&#160;

Environmental, Health and Safety Regulations 

&#160;

We will use, generate and discharge toxic, volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals and wastes in our manufacturing activities. We are subject to a variety of federal, state and local governmental laws and regulations related to the purchase, storage, use and disposal of hazardous materials. We are also subject to occupational health and safety regulations designed to protect worker health and safety from injuries and adverse health effects from exposure to hazardous chemicals and working conditions. If we fail to comply with present or future environmental laws and regulations, we could be subject to fines, suspension of production or a cessation of operations. In addition, under some federal, state and local statutes and regulations, a governmental agency may seek recovery and response costs from operators of property where releases of hazardous substances have occurred or are ongoing, even if the operator was not responsible for the release or otherwise was not at fault.

&#160;

Any failure by us to control the use of, or to restrict adequately the discharge of, hazardous substances could subject us to substantial financial liabilities, operational interruptions and adverse publicity, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.

&#160;

Solar Energy Industry 

&#160;

We believe that economic and national security issues, technological advances, environmental regulations seeking to limit emissions by fossil fuel, air pollution regulations restricting the release of greenhouse gasses, aging electricity transmission infrastructure and depletion and limited supply of fossil fuels, has made reliance on traditional sources of fuel for generating electricity less attractive. Government policies, in the form of both regulation and incentives, have accelerated the adoption of solar technologies by businesses and consumers. For example, in the U.S., California now requires that 33% of the retail demand for electricity provided by utilities must be procured from renewable energy sources by 2020.

&#160;

Government Subsidies and Incentives 

&#160;

Various subsidies and tax incentive programs exist at the federal and state level to encourage the adoption of solar power including capital cost rebates, performance-based incentives, feed-in tariffs, tax credits and net metering. Capital cost rebates provide funds to customers based on the cost of size of a customer's solar power system. Performance-based incentives provide funding to a customer based on the energy produced by their solar system. Under a feed-in tariff subsidy, the government sets prices that regulated utilities are required to pay for renewable electricity generated by end-users. The prices are set above market rates and may be differentiated based on system size or application. Feed-in tariffs pay customers for solar power system generation based on kilowatt-hours produced, at a rate generally guaranteed for a period of time. Tax credits reduce a customer's taxes at the time the taxes are due. Under net metering programs, a customer can generate more energy than used, during which periods the electricity meter will spin backwards. During these periods, the customer &#8220;lends&#8221; electricity to the grid, retrieving an equal amount of power at a later time. Net metering programs enable end-users to sell excess solar electricity to their local utility in exchange for a credit against their utility bills. Net metering programs are usually combined with rebates, and do not provide cash payments if delivered solar electricity exceeds their utility bills. In addition, several states have adopted renewable portfolio standards, which mandate that a certain portion of electricity delivered to customers come from a set of eligible renewable energy resources. Under a renewable portfolio standard, the government requires regulated utilities to supply a portion of their total electricity in the form of renewable electricity. Some programs further specify that a portion of the renewable energy quota must be from solar electricity. Since we are still in the development stage, and our products are not yet ready to benefit from any of these programs.

&#160;

&#160;

Despite the benefits of solar power, there are also certain risks and challenges faced by solar power. Solar power is heavily dependent on government subsidies to promote acceptance by mass markets. We believe that the near-term growth in the solar energy industry depends significantly on the availability and size of these government subsidies and on the ability of the industry to reduce the cost of generating solar electricity. The market for solar energy products is, and will continue to be, heavily dependent on public policies that support growth of solar energy. There can be no assurances that such policies will continue. Decrease in the level of rebates, incentives or other governmental support for solar energy would have an adverse effect on our ability to sell our products.

&#160;

Employees 

&#160;

As of February 25, 2016, we had two part-time employees.
