Each outstanding share of Exelis common stock converted into the right to receive $16.625 in cash and 0.1025 of a share of Harris common stock. Upon closing, legacy Harris shareholders owned 84 percent of the combined company and legacy Exelis shareholders owned 16 percent. Based on the closing price of $79.22 per share of Harris common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on May 29, 2015, the date of the closing of the acquisition, the aggregate implied value of the consideration paid to former holders of Exelis common stock in connection with the acquisition was approximately $4.7 billion, including approximately $1.5 billion in Harris common stock and approximately $3.2 billion in cash (including cash paid in respect of share-based awards and net of cash acquired). The source of funds for such cash payment was cash on hand and third-party debt financing, including a combination of borrowings under our senior unsecured term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $1.3 billion and a portion of the proceeds from our issuance of debt securities in an aggregate principal amount of $2.4 billion. Our acquisition of Exelis created significantly greater scale, bringing together two engineering-driven companies that value technology leadership. Together, the two companies&#8217; complementary technologies and capabilities strengthened core franchises and provide new opportunities for innovation to solve customers&#8217; most complex challenges. Exelis had annual sales of $3.277 billion in calendar 2014. Our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report include operating results from Exelis operations following May 29, 2015. 

Divestiture of Composite Aerostructures Business . On April 8, 2016, we completed the divestiture of our composite aerostructures business (&#8220;Aerostructures&#8221;), which designed and manufactured technically advanced, lightweight composite aerospace assembly structures, sub-assemblies and components for defense and commercial industries. Aerostructures was not strategic to our business and was part of our Company as a result of our acquisition of Exelis in May 2015. The operating results of Aerostructures through the date of divestiture are reported as part of our Electronic Systems segment. 

Divestiture of Commercial Healthcare Solutions Operation . On July 1, 2015, we completed the divestiture of our commercial healthcare solutions operation (&#8220;HCS&#8221;).

Description of Business by Segment 

Communication Systems 

Communication Systems serves markets in tactical communications and defense and public safety networks. 

Tactical Communications: We are a leading global supplier of secure radio communications, tactical communication networks and embedded high-grade encryption solutions for a diverse portfolio of U.S. military and allied international forces and commercial customers. We design, develop and manufacture a comprehensive line of current and next-generation secure radio communications products and systems, with capabilities to operate across numerous radio frequency bands and using an extensive range of waveforms. Our radio systems are highly flexible, interoperable and capable of supporting diverse mission requirements. Most of our tactical radios are built on software-defined radio platforms that are reprogrammable to add features or software upgrades and also have the highest grade embedded encryption. Our product capabilities include secure transmission of voice, high-speed data and full-motion video, including streaming video to the tactical edge of the battlefield. Supporting virtually all military domains, our products include handheld, manpack and vehicular, fixed-site and airborne form factors. Together, our products create a highly mobile, secure, reliable networked battlefield environment that connects land, air and sea echelons and does not rely on a fixed infrastructure. This networking capability allows warfighters, for example, to remain connected with each other and their command structures and support organizations and to communicate information and maintain situational awareness of both friendly and opposing forces, which are critical to mission safety and success. Our radio systems have been widely deployed throughout all branches of the U.S. Department of Defense (&#8220;DoD&#8221;) and, in the international market, have been sold to more than 100 countries through our international distribution channels consisting of regional sales offices and a broad dealer network and have become the standard in many of those countries. 

Our next-generation radios include multiband, multi-mission, legacy-system compatible tactical radios, which address the full range of current mission and interoperability requirements and are fully upgradeable to address changing technical standards and mission requirements of the future. Advances in these radios include the support of wideband networking waveforms, extended frequency range and significant reductions in size and weight compared with previous generations. Wideband networking capability enables enhanced situational awareness through high-bandwidth applications such as streaming video, simultaneous voice and data feeds, collaborative chat and connectivity to secure networks. Our comprehensive line of current and next-generation radios includes the following: 

&#8226; 

Our widely deployed Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System (&#8220;SINCGARS&#8221;) family of backpack, vehicular-mounted, handheld and airborne radios currently used by U.S. and allied military forces &#8212; these Combat Net Radios, over 600,000 of which have been purchased and deployed worldwide, operate in the very high frequency band, have single-frequency and frequency-hopping modes, handle voice and data communications and are designed to be reliable, secure and easily maintained. 

&#8226; 

Our multiband manpack radio, the AN/PRC-117G, which is National Security Agency (&#8220;NSA&#8221;) Type-1-certified for narrowband communications, as well as for wideband communications using our Harris-developed Adaptive Networking Wideband Waveform for high bandwidth data operation and the U.S. military Joint Tactical Radio System (&#8220;JTRS&#8221;) Soldier Radio Waveform; 

&#8226; 

Our 2-channel vehicular radio system, the AN/VRC-118, which uses the DoD-developed Wideband Networking Waveform and was selected as the U.S. Army&#8217;s solution for its JTRS Mid-Tier Networking Vehicular Radio program; 

&#8226; 

Our multiband handheld radios, the AN/PRC-152, which is a widely fielded JTRS-approved software-defined handheld radio, and the AN/PRC-152A, which adds wideband, networked communications capability and supports both a full range of narrowband legacy waveforms and wideband networking waveforms in a handheld platform; 

&#8226;

&#8226; 

Our wideband rifleman team radio, the RF-330E, which is the commercially developed U.S. variant of our widely fielded international soldier personal radio; 

&#8226; 

Our wideband ground radio family for international customers, the RF-7850x, which covers all echelons of the battlefield with soldier handheld, vehicular and fixed-site radio products; 

&#8226; 

Our wideband high frequency manpack radio, the RF-7800H, which is a wideband-capable tactical high frequency radio available to customers worldwide; 

&#8226; 

Our single-channel airborne radios, which include the NSA Type-1-certified RF-300M-DL Small Secure Data Link multiband radio for integration in size, weight and power-constrained environments, as well as the ARC-201D and ARC-201E radios for DoD and international very high frequency network interoperability; and 

&#8226; 

Our multi-channel airborne radios, which include the RF-7850A for interoperability with our RF-7800 family of international ground radios, as well as a 2-channel airborne radio platform we provide to ViaSat, Inc. to be built into the KOR-24A multi-channel, Link-16 Small Tactical Terminal. 

&#32; 

Unlike many of our competitors operating on a government-funded programs-driven business model, we operate in this market principally on a &#8220;commercial&#8221; customer-driven business model. This means that we anticipate market needs, invest our internal research and development resources, build to our internal forecast and provide ready-to-ship, commercial off-the-shelf (&#8220;COTS&#8221;) products to customers, enabling us to bring products to market faster and adapt to changing customer requirements. The U.S. market is undergoing a modernization cycle driven by wideband technology, and we believe that demand in the international market is being driven not only by the transition to wideband capability, but also by the need for network system solutions. We believe our commercial business model that drives speed and innovation, coupled with the scale provided by our international presence, will continue to make us competitive in the global market. 

We have been investing to position ourselves for tactical radio modernization opportunities, including in our next-generation manpack and rifleman radio solutions for the JTRS Handheld, Manpack and Small Form Fit (&#8220;HMS&#8221;) program. Our investments also include incorporating the powerful Mobile User Objective System (&#8220;MUOS&#8221;) waveform for the DoD&#8217;s next-generation military satellite communication (&#8220;SATCOM&#8221;) system. We are embedding MUOS capability in our multi-channel manpack radio, as well as offering it as a separate, simple and fast software upgrade for our widely fielded single-channel multiband manpack radio, which we believe creates an opportunity for the DoD to transition its existing inventory of those radios to MUOS capability and quickly maximize the use of the satellite infrastructure. We also believe the demand to extend ground tactical networks to the air, combined with our ARC-201 SINCGARS airborne radios, creates opportunities for us in manned and unmanned airborne applications.

Electronic Systems 

Electronic Systems offers an extensive portfolio of solutions in electronic warfare, avionics, wireless technology, C4I and undersea systems, for aviation, defense and maritime applications. 

We design, develop, produce and sell electronic warfare solutions for airborne, maritime and ground applications to most U.S. military service branches and to classified customers and allied nations. Our electronic warfare capabilities include threat identification, electronic countermeasures, decoys and expendables, strategic and situational support, electronic attack, passive coastal defense, radar, counter-improvised explosive device (&#8220;IED&#8221;) and border surveillance. We have provided electronic warfare solutions for strategic and tactical fixed-wing and rotary aircraft such as the F/A-18, F-16, B1-B, B-52, C-130H, MH-60, MH-47 and CV-22 aircraft, and we also provide maritime electronic support measures (&#8220;ESM&#8221;) for surface and subsurface vessels. 

Examples of our airborne electronic warfare technology include sophisticated sensor fusion for multispectral situational awareness, as well as internal and podded self-protection and jamming capabilities. Examples of our maritime electronic warfare technology include ESM systems for situational awareness and threat detection, including emitter identification to support tactical decisions and indications of possible hostile intentions; integrated self-protection systems and decoys that operate at every layer of shipboard defense; and electronic attack capabilities to disrupt and deny enemy operations. An 

&#32; 

example of our ground electronic warfare technology is counter-radio controlled IED technology that protects ground forces in asymmetrical combat environments by continually scanning for threatening radio frequency signals and denying enemy use of these portions of the electromagnetic spectrum, without disrupting friendly signals and keeping lines of communication open. We also develop and supply state-of-the-art wireless voice and data products and solutions. 

We design and manufacture high-performance radar systems and signal intelligence systems for both domestic and international military customers. Our core radar capabilities include air defense radars, air traffic control (&#8220;ATC&#8221;) radars and airborne multifunction radars. Our advanced radar technologies support military and domestic operation missions in homeland security, law enforcement, search and rescue, disaster relief and environmental science. We provide electronic warfare and signals intelligence systems for reconnaissance and surveillance for electronic intelligence, ESM, electronic counter measures and signals intelligence applications. 

We develop advanced, custom solutions which provide our government and commercial customers with self-protection, data protection, enhanced communications and situational awareness. We specialize in satellite-based communication systems, ground electronic warfare systems, commercial wireless technologies, tagging, tracking and locating, and information assurance. To combat the anti-access/area denial (&#8220;A2/AD&#8221;) threat, we leverage an adaptive multi-platform approach to ensure that users can connect and share data globally without being constrained by terrain or distance. We integrate data devices into A2/AD-resilient architectures which provide a secure global backbone for C4ISR capabilities against sophisticated adversaries. 

We have decades of experience designing, testing and integrating advanced avionics equipment, electronics and software, including cockpit communications, digital maps, processors, sensors, data buses, fiber optics, microelectronics and conformal wideband antennas. We are a supplier of avionics systems and products on a variety of aircraft platforms, including the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter (&#8220;F-35&#8221;) and the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet. For F-35 and F/A-18E/F Super Hornet aircraft, we provide high-performance, advanced avionics such as high-speed fiber optic networking and switching, intra-flight data links, image processing, digital map software and other electronic components, including Multifunction Advanced Data Link communication subsystems primarily intended for stealth platform air-to-air communications with other network nodes without revealing positions. Our advanced antenna technologies provide communication, navigation, direction-finding and electronic warfare capabilities for military aircraft. 

We design and produce aircraft carriage and release equipment and weapons interface systems for fighter jets, surveillance aircraft and unmanned aerial vehicles for the U.S. military and allied forces. Our carriage and release technology provides capabilities necessary for aircraft to successfully deliver mission payloads and support a variety of aircraft stores, including weapons, sonobuoys, electronics pods, fuel tanks and even unmanned vehicles. Our racks and launchers are components on aircraft including the F-35, F-22 Raptor, F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, F-15E Strike Eagle, F-16 Fighting Falcon, P-8A Poseidon and MQ-9 Reaper. In addition to current pyrotechnic release technology, we have developed next-generation pneumatic and electronically actuated release systems. Our control electronics provide aircraft with the ability to communicate directly with smart and precision-guidance payloads and create compatibility between a wide range of stores and platforms. 

We provide C4I solutions based on our major technology capabilities that include advanced ground control systems; SATCOM terminals for highly mobile, man-portable tactical, strategic fixed-site ground installation and shipboard receiver applications; and integrated battlefield management systems. Our SATCOM terminals connect forces with communication satellites to deliver mission-critical data, including high-resolution imagery and video requiring enormous bandwidth, securely and reliably to any platform. As an example, under the U.S. Army Modernization of Enterprise Terminals (&#8220;MET&#8221;) program, we developed, next-generation large satellite earth stations to provide the worldwide backbone for high-priority military communications and missile defense systems and to support IP and Dedicated Circuit Connectivity within the Global Information Grid, providing critical reach-back capability for the warfighter. We also provide integrated battlefield management systems for U.S. and allied military forces that integrate data from a variety of platforms and sensors in order to support planning and execution of operations, including terrain analysis, route management and global distribution of tactical and operational information, and to help military forces digitize their operations, providing a continuous, real-time platform for situational awareness and staff functions, including hostile and blue force tracking, radio communications, planning, personnel, intelligence, local weather and other data. 

We supply to the U.S. Navy and allied navies a broad range of undersea warfare systems for maritime platforms and environments, including mine sweeping systems, shipboard command and control systems, anti-submarine warfare sonar systems, data link systems, submarine flank and passive towed arrays, and acoustic sensors for military and commercial uses. We produce influence and mechanical mine sweeping systems and mine countermeasures that detect and neutralize subsurface threats to military and commercial maritime vessels. For example, our minesweeping technologies identify and safely detonate acoustic, magnetic and multiple influence sea mines to enable naval operations and keep commercial vessels safe. Our transducer arrays used in sonar and acoustic systems support navigation and situational awareness, through search, detection, tracking and classification of targets, as well as capabilities for anti-submarine and torpedo self-defense. 

As noted above, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, we completed the divestiture of Aerostructures.

Revenue and Operating Income: Revenue for our Critical Networks segment in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $2.233 billion , $1.680 billion &#32;and $1.786 billion , respectively. Segment operating income (loss) in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $(106) million , $131 million &#32;and $198 million , respectively. The percentage of our revenue contributed by this segment in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 was 30 percent , 33 percent &#32;and 36 percent , respectively. The percentages of this segment&#8217;s revenue under contracts directly with end customers and under contracts with prime contractors in fiscal 2016 were approximately 88 percent and 12 percent, respectively. In fiscal 2016, this segment had a diverse portfolio of over 500 programs. Some of this segment&#8217;s more significant programs in fiscal 2016 included FTI, ADS-B, SCNS and various classified programs. The percentages of this segment&#8217;s revenue in fiscal 2016 represented by this segment&#8217;s largest program by revenue and ten largest programs by revenue were approximately 12 percent and 42 percent, respectively. The percentage of this segment&#8217;s revenue in fiscal 2016 that was derived outside of the U.S. was 17 percent. The percentage of this segment&#8217;s revenue in fiscal 2016 that was derived from sales to U.S. Government customers, including foreign military sales funded through the U.S. Government, whether directly or through prime contractors, was approximately 78 percent . For a general description of our U.S. Government contracts and subcontracts, including a discussion of revenue generated thereunder and of cost-reimbursable versus fixed-price contracts, see &#8220;Item 1. Business - Principal Customers; Government Contracts&#8221; of this Report. 

In general, this segment&#8217;s domestic products are sold and serviced directly to customers through its sales organization and through established distribution channels. Internationally, this segment markets and sells its products and services through regional sales offices and established distribution channels. For a general description of our international business, see &#8220;Item 1. Business - International Business&#8221; of this Report. 

For a discussion of certain risks affecting this segment, including risks relating to our U.S. Government contracts and subcontracts, see &#8220;Item 1. Business - Principal Customers; Government Contracts,&#8221; &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8221; and &#8220;Item 3. Legal Proceedings&#8221; of this Report. 

International Business 

Revenue from products and services exported from the U.S., including foreign military sales, or manufactured or rendered abroad in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $1.6 billion (22 percent of our revenue), $1.6 billion (31 percent of our revenue) and $1.5 billion (30 percent of our revenue), respectively. Most of our international sales were derived from our Communication Systems and Critical Networks segments. Direct export sales are primarily denominated in U.S. Dollars, whereas sales from foreign subsidiaries are generally denominated in the local currency of the subsidiary. Financial information regarding our domestic and international operations is contained in Note 24: Business Segments &#32;in the Notes and is incorporated herein by reference. 

The majority of our international marketing activities are conducted through subsidiaries which operate in Canada, Europe, the Middle East, Central and South America, Africa and Asia. We have also established international marketing organizations and several regional sales offices. For further information regarding our international subsidiaries, see Exhibit 21 of this Report. 

We utilize indirect sales channels, including dealers, distributors and sales representatives, in the marketing and sale of some lines of products and equipment, both domestically and internationally. These independent representatives may buy for resale or, in some cases, solicit orders from commercial or government customers for direct sales by us. Prices to the ultimate customer in many instances may be recommended or established by the independent representative and may be above or below our list prices. Our dealers and distributors generally receive a discount from our list prices and may mark up those prices in setting the final sales prices paid by the customer. The percentages of our total revenue and international revenue represented by revenue from indirect sales channels in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 were approximately 12 percent and 46 percent; 16 percent and 44 percent; and 13 percent and 40 percent, respectively. 

Fiscal 2016 &#32;international revenue came from a large number of countries, and no single foreign country accounted for more than 5 percent of our total revenue. Some of our exports are paid for by letters of credit, with the balance carried either on an open account or installment note basis. Advance payments, progress payments or other similar payments received prior to or upon shipment often cover most of the related costs incurred. Significant foreign government contracts generally require us to provide performance guarantees. In order to stay competitive in international markets, we also sometimes enter into offset agreements or recourse or vendor financing arrangements to facilitate sales to certain customers. 

The particular economic, social and political conditions for business conducted outside the U.S. differ from those encountered by domestic businesses. We believe that the overall business risk for our international business as a whole is somewhat greater than that faced by our domestic businesses as a whole. A description of the types of risks to which we are subject in our international business is contained in &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8221; of this Report. In our opinion, these risks are 

&#32; 

partially mitigated by the diversification of our international business and the protection provided by letters of credit and advance payments, progress payments and other similar payments. 

Competition 

We operate in highly competitive markets that are sensitive to technological advances. Many of our competitors in each of our markets are larger than we are and can maintain higher levels of expenditures for research and development. In each of our markets, we concentrate on the opportunities that we believe are compatible with our resources, overall technological capabilities and objectives. Principal competitive factors in these markets are product quality and reliability; technological capabilities; service; past performance; ability to develop and implement complex, integrated solutions; ability to meet delivery schedules; the effectiveness of third-party sales channels in international markets; and cost-effectiveness. We frequently &#8220;partner&#8221; or are involved in subcontracting and teaming relationships with companies that are, from time to time, competitors on other programs. 

In the Communication Systems segment, principal competitors include Aselsan A.S., Elbit Systems Ltd., General Dynamics Corporation, L-3 Communications Holdings, Inc., Motorola Solutions, Inc., Rockwell Collins, Inc., Raytheon Company, Rohde &#38; Schwarz Group, Selex ES (a Finmeccanica Group company) and Thales Group.

In the Critical Networks segment, principal competitors include AT&#38;T Inc., BAE Systems plc, The Boeing Company, CACI International, Inc., Computer Sciences Corporation, CSRA Inc., Engility Holdings, Inc., General Dynamics Corporation, Global Eagle Entertainment Inc., Leidos Holdings, Inc., Lockheed Martin Corporation, ManTech International Corporation, Northrop Grumman Corporation, Raytheon Company, RigNet, Inc. and Speedcast International Limited. 

Principal Customers; Government Contracts 

The percentage of our revenue that was derived from sales to U.S. Government customers, including foreign military sales funded through the U.S. Government, whether directly or through prime contractors, in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 was approximately 76 percent, 64 percent and 67 percent, respectively. No other customer accounted for more than 5 percent of our revenue in fiscal 2016 . Additional information regarding customers for each of our segments is provided under &#8220;Item 1. Business &#8212; Description of Business by Segment&#8221; of this Report. Our U.S. Government sales are predominantly derived from contracts with agencies of, and prime contractors to, the U.S. Government. Most of the sales in our Space and Intelligence Systems segment, our Electronic Systems segment and, with respect to U.S. Government programs in our Critical Networks segment, are made directly or indirectly to the U.S. Government under contracts or subcontracts containing standard government contract clauses providing for redetermination of profits, if applicable, and for termination for the convenience of the U.S. Government or for default based on performance. 

Our U.S. Government contracts and subcontracts include both cost-reimbursable and fixed-price contracts. Government-wide Acquisition Contracts (&#8220;GWACs&#8221;) and multi-vendor IDIQ contracts, which can include task orders for each contract type, require us to compete both for the initial contract and then for individual task or delivery orders under such contracts. 

Our U.S. Government cost-reimbursable contracts provide for the reimbursement of allowable costs plus payment of a fee and fall into three basic types: (i) cost-plus fixed-fee contracts, which provide for payment of a fixed fee irrespective of the final cost of performance; (ii) cost-plus incentive-fee contracts, which provide for payment of a fee that may increase or decrease, within specified limits, based on actual results compared with contractual targets relating to factors such as cost, performance and delivery schedule; and (iii) cost-plus award-fee contracts, which provide for payment of an award fee determined at the customer&#8217;s discretion based on our performance against pre-established performance criteria. Under our U.S. Government cost-reimbursable contracts, we are reimbursed periodically for allowable costs and are paid a portion of the fee based on contract progress. Some overhead costs have been made partially or wholly unallowable for reimbursement by statute or regulation. Examples are certain merger and acquisition costs, lobbying costs, charitable contributions, interest expense and certain litigation defense costs. 

Our U.S. Government fixed-price contracts are either firm fixed-price contracts or fixed-price incentive contracts. Under our U.S. Government firm fixed-price contracts, we agree to perform a specific scope of work for a fixed price and, as a result, benefit from cost savings and carry the burden of cost overruns. Under our U.S. Government fixed-price incentive contracts, we share with the U.S. Government both savings accrued for performance at less than target cost as well as costs incurred in excess of target cost up to a negotiated ceiling price, which is higher than the target cost, but carry the entire burden of costs exceeding 

&#32; 

the negotiated ceiling price. Accordingly, under such incentive contracts, profit may also be adjusted up or down depending on whether specified performance objectives are met. Under our U.S. Government firm fixed-price and fixed-price incentive contracts, we generally receive either milestone payments equaling 100 percent of the contract price or monthly progress payments from the U.S. Government in amounts equaling 80 percent of costs incurred under the contract. The remaining amounts, including profits or incentive fees, are billed upon delivery and final acceptance of end items and deliverables under the contract. Our production contracts are mainly fixed-price contracts, and development contracts are generally cost-reimbursable contracts. 

As stated above, U.S. Government contracts are terminable for the convenience of the U.S. Government, as well as for default based on performance. Companies supplying goods and services to the U.S. Government are dependent on Congressional appropriations and administrative allotment of funds and may be affected by changes in U.S. Government policies resulting from various military, political, economic and international developments. Long-term U.S. Government contracts and related orders are subject to cancellation if appropriations for subsequent performance periods become unavailable. Under contracts terminable for the convenience of the U.S. Government, a contractor is entitled to receive payments for its allowable costs and, in general, the proportionate share of fees or earnings for the work done. Contracts that are terminable for default generally provide that the U.S. Government pays only for the work it has accepted and may require the contractor to pay for the incremental cost of re-procurement and may hold the contractor liable for damages. In many cases, there is also uncertainty relating to the complexity of designs, necessity for design improvements and difficulty in forecasting costs and schedules when bidding on developmental and highly sophisticated technical work. Under many U.S. Government contracts, we are required to maintain facility and personnel security clearances complying with DoD and other Federal agency requirements. For further discussion of risks relating to U.S. Government contracts, see &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8221; and &#8220;Item 3. Legal Proceedings&#8221; of this Report. 

Funded and Unfunded Backlog 

Our total Company-wide funded and unfunded backlog in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 was approximately $10.8 billion, $12.2 billion and $7.2 billion, respectively. The funded portion of this backlog in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 was approximately $5.1 billion, $5.3 billion and $3.0 billion, respectively. The determination of backlog involves substantial estimating, particularly with respect to customer requirements contracts and development and production contracts of a cost-reimbursable or incentive nature. The level of order activity related to U.S. Government programs can be affected by timing of U.S. Government funding authorizations and project evaluation cycles. Year-over-year comparisons could, at times, be impacted by these factors, among others. 

We define funded backlog as unfilled firm orders for products and services for which funding has been authorized and, in the case of U.S. Government agencies, appropriated. We define unfunded backlog as primarily unfilled firm contract value for which funding has not yet been authorized or, in the case of U.S. Government agencies, appropriated, including the value of contract options in cases of material contracts that have options we believe are probable of being exercised, as well as the most probable value of material sole-source IDIQ contracts awarded for a specific limited purpose. In fiscal 2017 , we expect to convert to revenue approximately 68 percent of our total funded backlog as of July 1, 2016 . However, we can give no assurance of such fulfillment or that our funded backlog will become revenue in any particular period, if at all.

Research and Development 

Company-sponsored research and development costs, which included research and development for commercial products and services and independent research and development related to government products and services, as well as concept formulation studies and technology development that occurs on bid and proposal efforts, in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 were approximately $309 million, $277 million and $264 million, respectively. A portion of our independent research and development costs are allocated among contracts and programs in process under U.S. Government contractual arrangements. Company-sponsored research and development costs not otherwise allocable are charged to expense when incurred. Company-sponsored research is directed to the development of new products and services and to building technological capability in various markets. 

Customer-sponsored research and development costs are incurred pursuant to contractual arrangements, principally U.S. Government-sponsored contracts requiring us to provide a product or service meeting certain defined performance or other specifications (such as designs). This research helps strengthen and broaden our technical capabilities. Customer-sponsored research costs are accounted for principally by the cost-to-cost percentage-of-completion method and included in our revenue and cost of product sales and services. 

As of July 1, 2016 , we employed approximately 9,000 &#32;engineers and scientists and are continuing efforts to make the technologies developed in any of our business segments available for all other business segments. 

&#32; 

Patents and Other Intellectual Property 

We consider our patents and other intellectual property, in the aggregate, to constitute an important asset. We own a large portfolio of patents, trade secrets, know-how, confidential information, trademarks, copyrights and other intellectual property, and we routinely apply for new patents, trademarks and copyrights. We also license intellectual property to and from third parties. As of July 1, 2016 , we held approximately 1,900 U.S. patents and 1,700 foreign patents, and had approximately 200 U.S. patent applications pending and 600 foreign patent applications pending. Unpatented research, development and engineering skills also make an important contribution to our business. Although our intellectual property rights in the aggregate are important to our business and the operations of our business segments, we do not consider our business or any business segment to be materially dependent on any single patent, license or other intellectual property right, or any group of related patents, licenses or other intellectual property rights. We are engaged in a proactive patent licensing program and have entered into a number of licenses and cross-license agreements, some of which generate royalty income. Although existing license agreements have generated income in past years and may do so in the future, there can be no assurances we will enter into additional income-producing license agreements. From time to time we engage in litigation to protect our patents and other intellectual property. Any of our patents, trade secrets, trademarks, copyrights and other proprietary rights could be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or may not provide competitive advantages. For further discussion of risks relating to intellectual property, see &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8221; of this Report. With regard to certain patents, the U.S. Government has an irrevocable, non-exclusive, royalty-free license, pursuant to which the U.S. Government may use or authorize others to use the inventions covered by such patents. Pursuant to similar arrangements, the U.S. Government may consent to our use of inventions covered by patents owned by other persons. Numerous trademarks used on or in connection with our products are also considered to be a valuable asset. 

Environmental and Other Regulations 

Our facilities and operations are subject to numerous domestic and international laws and regulations designed to protect the environment, particularly with regard to wastes and emissions. The applicable environmental laws and regulations are common within the industries and markets in which we operate and serve. We believe that we have complied with these requirements and that such compliance has not had a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. We have installed waste treatment facilities and pollution control equipment to satisfy legal requirements and to achieve our waste minimization and prevention goals. A portion of our environmental expenditures relates to historic discontinued operations (other than CIS and Broadcast Communications) for which we have retained certain environmental liabilities. We did not spend material amounts on environmental-related capital projects in fiscal 2016 , 2015 &#32;or 2014 . Based on currently available information, we do not expect capital expenditures in fiscal 2017 or over the next several years to protect the environment and to comply with current environmental laws and regulations, as well as to comply with current and pending climate control legislation, regulation, treaties and accords, to be material or to have a material impact on our competitive position or financial condition, but we can give no assurance that such expenditures will not exceed current expectations, and such expenditures may increase in future years. If future treaties, laws and regulations contain more stringent requirements than presently anticipated, actual expenditures may be higher than our present estimates of those expenditures. 

Additional information regarding environmental and regulatory matters is set forth in &#8220;Item 3. Legal Proceedings&#8221; of this Report and in Note 1: Significant Accounting Policies &#32;and Note 25: Legal Proceedings and Contingencies &#32;in the Notes. 

Electronic products are subject to governmental environmental regulation in a number of jurisdictions, such as domestic and international requirements requiring end-of-life management and/or restricting materials in products delivered to customers, including the European Union&#8217;s Directive 2012/19/EU on Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment and Directive 2011/65/EU on the Restriction of the use of certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment (&#8220;RoHS&#8221;), as amended. Other jurisdictions have adopted similar legislation. Such requirements typically are not applicable to most equipment produced by our Communication Systems, Space and Intelligence Systems and Electronic Systems segments. We believe that we have complied with such rules and regulations, where applicable, with respect to our existing products sold into such jurisdictions. We intend to comply with such rules and regulations with respect to our future products. 

Wireless communications, whether radio, satellite or telecommunications, are also subject to governmental regulation. Equipment produced in our Communication Systems and Critical Networks segments, in particular, is subject to domestic and international requirements to avoid interference among users of radio and television frequencies and to permit interconnection of telecommunications equipment. Additionally, we hold licenses for our managed satellite and terrestrial communications solutions market for very small aperture terminals and satellite earth stations, which authorize operation of networks and teleports. We are also required to comply with technical operating and licensing requirements that pertain to our wireless licenses and operations. We believe that we have complied with such rules and regulations and licenses with respect to our existing products and services, and we intend to comply with such rules and regulations and licenses with respect to our future products and services. Governmental reallocation of the frequency spectrum also could impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

&#32; 

Raw Materials and Supplies 

Because of the diversity of our products and services, as well as the wide geographic dispersion of our facilities, we use numerous sources for the wide array of raw materials, such as electronic components, printed circuit boards, metals and plastics, needed for our operations and for our products. We are dependent on suppliers and subcontractors for a large number of components and subsystems and the ability of our suppliers and subcontractors to adhere to customer or regulatory materials restrictions and to meet performance and quality specifications and delivery schedules. In some instances, we are dependent on one or a few sources, either because of the specialized nature of a particular item or because of local content preference requirements pursuant to which we operate on a given project. Although we have been affected by financial and performance issues of some of our suppliers and subcontractors, we have not been materially adversely affected by the inability to obtain raw materials or products. On occasion, we have experienced component shortages from vendors as a result of natural disasters, or the RoHS environmental regulations in the European Union or similar regulations in other jurisdictions. These events or regulations may cause a spike in demand for certain electronic components, such as lead-free components, resulting in industry-wide supply chain shortages. As of July 1, 2016 , these component shortages have not had a material adverse effect on our business. For further discussion of risks relating to subcontractors and suppliers, see &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8221; of this Report. 

Seasonality 

We do not consider any material portion of our business to be seasonal. Various factors can affect the distribution of our revenue between accounting periods, including the timing of contract awards and the timing and availability of U.S. Government funding, as well as the timing of product deliveries and customer acceptance. 

Employees 

We had approximately 21,000 &#32;employees at the end of fiscal 2016 . Approximately 93 percent of our employees as of the end of fiscal 2016 &#32;were located in the U.S. A significant number of our employees possess a U.S. Government security clearance. We also utilize a number of independent contractors. Approximately 850, or approximately 4 percent, of our U.S. employees are working under collective bargaining agreements with labor unions and worker representatives. These collective bargaining agreements will be renegotiated at various times over the next three years as they expire. Exelis and its predecessors have historically renegotiated these agreements without significant disruption to operating activities. For certain international subsidiaries, our employees are represented by workers&#8217; councils or statutory labor unions. In general, we believe that our relations with our employees are good.
