Industry Overview 

We manufacture engineered components that are sold to a variety of industries including recreational transportation (including boats), postal, office and institutional furniture, cabinetry, tool storage, healthcare, gas stations and vending equipment. We continuously seek to diversify into new markets and identify new applications and features for our products, which we believe provide a greater potential for higher rates of earnings growth as well as diversification of risk. See also Item 6 &#8211; &#8220;Selected Financial Data&#8221; and Item 7 &#8211; &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.&#8221; 

Business Segments 

We currently have two operating business segments &#8211; Security Products and Marine Components. For additional information regarding our segments, see &#8220;Part II &#8211; Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; and Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Manufacturing, Operations and Products 

Security Products . &#160; Our Security Products segment manufactures mechanical and electronic cabinet locks and other locking mechanisms used in a variety of applications including ignition systems, mailboxes, file cabinets, desk drawers, tool storage cabinets, vending and gaming machines, high security medical cabinetry, electronic circuit panels, storage compartments and gas station security. Our Security Products segment has one manufacturing facility in Mauldin, South Carolina and one in Grayslake, Illinois shared with Marine Components. We believe we are a North American market leader in the manufacture and sale of cabinet locks and other locking mechanisms. These products include: 

&#160;

&#183; 

disc tumbler locks which provide moderate security and generally represent the lowest cost lock to produce; 

&#160;

&#183; 

pin tumbler locking mechanisms which are more costly to produce and are used in applications requiring higher levels of security, including KeSet &#174; and System 64 &#174; (which each allow the user to change the keying on a single lock 64 times without removing the lock from its enclosure) TuBar &#174; and Turbine &#8482; ; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

our innovative CompX eLock &#174; and StealthLock &#174; electronic locks which provide stand-alone or networked security and audit trail capability for drug storage and other valuables through the use of a proximity card, magnetic stripe or keypad credentials.

A substantial portion of our Security Products&#8217; s ales consist of products with specialized adaptations to an individual customer&#8217;s specifications, some of which are listed above. We also have a standardized product line suitable for many customers, which is offered through a North American distribution network to locksmith and smaller original equipment manufacturer distributors via our STOCK LOCKS &#174; distribution program. 

Marine Components . &#160; Our Marine Components segment manufactures and distributes stainless steel exhaust components, gauges, throttle controls, trim tabs, hardware and accessories primarily for performance and ski/wakeboard boats. Our Marine Components segment has a facility in Neenah, Wisconsin and a facility in Grayslake, Illinois shared with Security Products. Our specialty Marine Component products are high precision components designed to operate within tight tolerances in the highly demanding marine environment. These products include: 

&#160;

&#183; 

original equipment and aftermarket stainless steel exhaust headers, exhaust pipes, mufflers and other exhaust components; 

&#160;

&#183; 

high performance gauges such as GPS speedometers and tachometers; 

&#160;

&#183; 

mechanical and electronic controls and throttles; 

&#160;

&#183; 

steering wheels and other billet aluminum accessories; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

dash panels, LED lighting, wire harnesses and other accessories. 

For information regarding our three manufacturing and other facilities, see &#8220;Item 2 &#8211; Properties,&#8221; including information regarding leased and distribution-only facilities. 

&#160;

Raw Materials 

Our primary raw materials are: 

&#160;

&#183; 

zinc and brass (used in the Security Products segment for the manufacture of locking mechanisms); and 

&#160;

&#183; 

stainless steel (used primarily in the Marine Components segment for the manufacture of exhaust headers and pipes), aluminum (used for the manufacture of throttles and trim tabs), and other components. 

These raw materials are purchased from several suppliers, are readily available from numerous sources and accounted for approximately 10% of our total cost of sales for 2015. Total material costs, including purchased components, represented approximately 48% of our cost of sales in 2015.

We occasionally enter into short-term commodity-related raw material supply arrangements to mitigate the impact of future increases in commodity-related raw material costs. These arrangements generally provide for stated unit prices based upon specified purchase volumes, which help us to stabilize our commodity-related raw material costs to a certain extent. We periodically enter into such arrangements for zinc and brass. Following a general softening of commodity metal markets during 2015, we expect commodity-related raw material prices to remain relatively stable during 2016; however, these raw materials purchased on the spot market are sometimes subject to unanticipated and sudden price increases. We generally seek to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in these raw material costs on our margins through improvements in production efficiencies or other operating cost reductions. In the event we are unable to offset raw material cost increases with other cost reductions, it may be difficult to recover those cost increases through increased product selling prices or raw material surcharges due to the competitive nature of the markets served by our products. Consequently, overall operating margins can be affected by commodity-related raw material cost pressures. Commodity market prices are cyclical, reflecting overall economic trends, specific developments in consuming industries and speculative investor activities. 

Patents and Trademarks 

We hold a number of patents relating to our component products, certain of which we believe to be important to us and our continuing business activity. Patents generally have a term of 20 years, and our patents have

Sales, Marketing and Distribution . 

A majority of our component sales are direct to large OEM customers through our factory-based sales and marketing professionals supported by engineers working in concert with field salespeople and independent manufacturer&#8217;s representatives. We select manufacturer&#8217;s representatives based on special skills in certain markets or relationships with current or potential customers. 

In addition to sales to large OEM customers, a substantial portion of our Security Products sales are made through distributors. We have a significant North American market share of cabinet lock security product sales as a result of the locksmith distribution channel. We support our locksmith distributor sales with a line of standardized products used by the largest segments of the marketplace. These products are packaged and merchandised for easy availability and handling by distributors and end users. 

In 2015, our ten largest customers, all customers of our Security Products segment, accounted for approximately 48% of our total sales. United States Postal Service and Harley Davidson accounted for approximately 13% and 12%, respectively, of total sales for the year ended December 31, 2015. Overall, our customer base is diverse and the loss of any single customer would not in itself have a material adverse effect on our operations. 

Competition 

The markets in which we participate are highly competitive. We compete primarily on the basis of product design, including space utilization and aesthetic factors, product quality and durability, price, on-time delivery, service and technical support. We focus our efforts on the middle and high-end segments of the market, where product design, quality, durability and service are valued by the customer. Our Security Products segment competes against a number of domestic and foreign manufacturers. Our Marine Components segment competes with small domestic manufacturers and is minimally affected by foreign competitors. 

Regulatory and Environmental Matters 

Our operations are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the use, storage, handling, generation, transportation, treatment, emission, discharge, disposal, remediation of and exposure to hazardous and non-hazardous substances, materials and wastes (&#8220;Environmental Laws&#8221;). Our operations also are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to worker health and safety. We believe we are in substantial compliance with all such laws and regulations. To date, the costs of maintaining compliance with such laws and regulations have not significantly impacted our results. We currently do not anticipate any significant costs or expenses relating to such matters; however, it is possible future laws and regulations may require us to incur significant additional expenditures.
