 Item 1. Business &#160;

Introduction 

&#160;

We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on January 7, 2008. Since inception, our primary business purpose has been to stockpile indium, a specialty metal that is being increasingly used as a raw material in a wide variety of consumer electronics manufacturing applications. As of December 31, 2014, we sold all of the indium from our stockpile. As a result, we are no longer in the business of purchasing and selling indium. We have begun evaluating strategic options including the acquisition of a new line of business or the sale or full liquidation of the Company. In connection therewith, we have engaged one of our directors to assist in identifying, evaluating and negotiating strategic transactions and have agreed to pay that director $50 thousand in 2016 for these services. However, there can be no assurance that we will enter into any such transaction, and if so, on terms favorable to us.

&#160;

In December 2014, we repurchased 6,678,358 shares of our common stock (representing 78% of our then issued and outstanding shares of common stock) in a tender offer (the Tender Offer) for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $16.1 million, or $2.41 per share. Shares not purchased in the Tender Offer because of proration or conditional tenders were returned to the tendering stockholders. Shares having an aggregate purchase price of more than approximately $16.1 million were properly tendered and not properly withdrawn. There were 1,883,639 shares of our common stock outstanding after the Tender Offer. During the third quarter of 2015, our board of directors (Board) approved a program to repurchase up to $650 thousand in shares of our common stock. In connection therewith, we repurchased 139,070 shares of our common stock in September 2015 for approximately $0.2 million, or $1.40 per share. At December 31, 2015, 1,744,569 shares of our common stock were outstanding.

&#160;

In December 2015, our Board approved a cash distribution to stockholders in the amount of $1.75 per common share (or approximately $3.05 million). The distribution was a return of capital for tax purposes. The aggregate cash distribution was recorded against additional paid-in capital for accounting purposes.

&#160;

At December 31, 2015, we had approximately $1.0 million in cash and cash equivalents. Our annual cash operating expenses are estimated to be approximately $0.4 million in 2016 while we review our strategic options. Accordingly, we believe that we have sufficient funds to sustain operations for at least the next two years.

&#160;

In 2015, management services were provided under an arrangement with Nano-Cap Advisors LLC (Nano) in which Ailon Z. Grushkin, Chairman of our Board, President and Chief Executive Officer is the sole shareholder. Under the arrangement, which was approved by our Board, we agreed to pay Nano $90 thousand in 2015 to provide management services and office space. During the first quarter of 2016, we entered into an agreement with Nano to continue to provide such services in 2016 for a fee of $70 thousand.

&#160;

We are not legally prohibited from pursuing other business strategies pursuant to our certificate of incorporation, as amended, or any other corporate document. We will promptly notify stockholders of any modifications to our stated business plan. Our operations have been limited to purchasing, stockpiling, lending or leasing the metal indium. As of December 31, 2014, we sold our entire indium stockpile. We have begun evaluating strategic options including the merger or acquisition of a new line of business or the sale or full liquidation of the Company, which would require approval of our Board and will require stockholder approval.

&#160;

Employees 

&#160;

We have no full-time employees. Our Chief Executive Officer and President provides services to us on a part time basis under an agreement with Nano. Our Chief Financial Officer is a part-time employee and our administrative assistant is a part-time independent contractor. Prior to 2015, our Chief Executive Officer, President and Chief Operating Officer provided services to us through Specialty Metals Group Advisors LLP (&#8220;the Former Manager&#8221;).
