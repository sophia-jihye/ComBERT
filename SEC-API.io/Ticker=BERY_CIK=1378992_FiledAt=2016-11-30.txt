 Item 1. BUSINESS

(In millions of dollars, except as otherwise noted)

&#160;

General

&#160;

Berry Plastics Group, Inc. ("Berry," "we," or the "Company") is a leading provider of value-added plastic consumer packaging, nonwoven specialty materials and engineered materials with a track record of delivering high-quality customized solutions to our customers. Representative examples of our products include closures, prescription vials, specialty films, adhesives, nonwovens, drink cups, containers, and bottles. We sell our products predominantly into stable, consumer-oriented end-markets, such as healthcare, personal care, and food and beverage.

&#160;

Our customers consist of a diverse mix of leading global, national, mid-sized regional and local specialty businesses. The size and scope of our customer network allows us to introduce new products we develop or acquire to a vast audience that is familiar with our business. In fiscal 2016, no single customer represented more than 5% of net sales and our top ten customers represented 19% of net sales. We believe our manufacturing processes and our ability to leverage our scale to reduce expenses positions us as a low-cost manufacturer relative to our competitors.

&#160;

In November 2015, the Company reorganized into three operating segments: Health, Hygiene &#38; Specialties, Consumer Packaging, and Engineered Materials. The new structure is designed to align us with our customers, provide improved service, drive future growth and to facilitate future cost saving synergies. The Consumer Packaging segment primarily consists of containers, foodservice items, closures, overcaps, bottles, prescription vials, tubes, and printed films. The Health, Hygiene &#38; Specialties segment primarily consists of nonwoven specialty materials used in hygiene, infection prevention, personal care, industrial, construction, and filtration applications. The Company included 100% of the acquired Avintiv business in the Health, Hygiene &#38; Specialties segment in order to maintain management continuity and limit business integration risk. The Engineered Materials segment primarily consists of pipeline corrosion protection solutions, tapes and adhesives, polyethylene based film products, can liners, and specialty coated and laminated products. The Company has recast all prior period amounts to conform to this new reporting structure. Additional financial information about our business segments is provided in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements," which are included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.

&#160;

Recent Acquisitions

&#160;

AVINTIV Inc.

&#160;

In October 2015, the Company acquired 100% of the capital stock of AVINTIV Inc. ("Avintiv") for a purchase price of $2.26 billion, net of cash acquired. Avintiv was one of the world's leading developers, producers, and marketers of nonwoven specialty materials used in hygiene, infection prevention, personal care, industrial, construction, and filtration applications. With 23 locations in 14 countries, an employee base of over 4,500 people as of the acquisition date, the broadest range of process technologies in the nonwoven industry, and strategically located manufacturing facilities, Avintiv was positioned as a global supplier to many of the same leading consumer and industrial product manufacturers as Berry's existing business. To finance the purchase, the Company issued $400 million aggregate principal amount of 6.0% second priority senior secured notes due 2022 and entered into an incremental assumption agreement to increase the commitments under the Company's existing term loan credit agreement by $2.1 billion due 2022. The results of Avintiv have been included in the consolidated results of the Company since the date of the acquisition.

Provid&#234;ncia Non-Controlling Interest

&#160;

At the time of our Avintiv acquisition, Avintiv owned a 71.25% controlling interest in Provid&#234;ncia, their Brazilian subsidiary. In the January 2, 2016 quarter, the Company acquired the remaining 28.75% non-controlling ownership interest of Provid&#234;ncia for $66 million. As a result of this transaction, Provid&#234;ncia became a wholly-owned subsidiary and the Company recorded $3 million to Additional paid-in capital.

&#160;

AEP Industries Inc.

&#160;

In August, 2016, the Company entered into a definitive merger agreement to acquire all of the outstanding shares of AEP Industries Inc. ("AEP") in a cash and stock merger transaction (the "AEP Transaction") for an estimated aggregate consideration to stockholders of AEP of approximately $294 million in cash and 6.7 million shares of common stock of the Company. An all-cash transaction would imply a purchase price of approximately $735 million, including the assumption of approximately $147 million of net debt as of July 31, 2016. AEP manufactures and markets an extensive and diverse line of polyethylene and polyvinyl chloride flexible plastic packaging products with consumer, industrial, and agricultural applications. AEP's flexible plastic packaging films are used in the packaging, transportation, beverage, food, automotive, pharmaceutical, chemical, electronics, and textile industries. Consummation of the merger is subject to customary regulatory approvals and approval by AEP stockholders. AEP reported $1.1 billion of net sales for its fiscal year ended October 31, 2015, and will be operated within the Engineered Materials segment upon completion of the transaction. The Company expects to realize annual cost synergies of approximately $50 million from the AEP Transaction.

&#160;

Recent Developments

Term Loans

In June 2016, the Company entered into an incremental assumption agreement and amendment to lower the interest rates under certain of the existing term loans. The term loan maturing in January 2021 bears interest at LIBOR plus 2.50% per annum with a LIBOR floor of 1.00%. The term loan maturing in October 2022 bears interest at LIBOR plus 2.75% per annum with a LIBOR floor of 1.00%. Additionally, if the Company is able to achieve a net first lien secured leverage ratio below 3.0 to 1.0, the interest rate on the term loan maturing in October 2022 will be reduced to LIBOR plus 2.50%. All other terms remain unchanged. The term loans are considered to be a loan syndication and as a result, a portion of the existing term loans were modified and a portion were considered to be extinguished. The Company recorded $4 million to loss on debt extinguishment, reflecting the write-off of deferred financing fees and debt discounts, net of amortization associated with the portion of the debt that was considered extinguished. The Company also capitalized an incremental $2 million of debt discount related to this assumption agreement.

Marketing, Sales, and Competition

&#160;

We reach our large and diversified customer base through a direct sales force of dedicated professionals and the strategic use of distributors. Our sales, production and support staff meet with customers to understand their needs and improve our product offerings and services. Our scale enables us to dedicate certain sales and marketing efforts to particular products or customers, when applicable, which enables us to develop expertise that we believe is valued by our customers. In addition, because we serve common customers across segments, we have the ability to efficiently utilize our sales and marketing resources to minimize costs.

&#160;

The major markets in which the Company sells its products are highly competitive. Areas of competition include service, innovation, quality, and price. This competition is significant as to both the size and the number of competing firms. Competitors include but are not limited to Silgan, Aptar, Reynolds, Intertape, 3M, Clopay, Tredegar, Bemis, Avgol, and Fitesa.

&#160;

Research, Product Development and Design

&#160;

We believe our technology base and research and development support are among the best in the industries we serve. Many of our customers work in partnership with our technical representatives to develop new, more competitive products. Our design professionals work directly with our customers to develop new styles and use computer-generated graphics to enable our customers to visualize the finished product. Expenditures for research and development activities were $48 million, $33 million, and $32 million in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

&#160;

Raw Materials

&#160;

Our primary raw material is plastic resin. In addition, we use butyl rubber, tackifying resins, chemicals and adhesives, paper and packaging materials, linerboard, rayon, polyester fiber, and foil, in various manufacturing processes. These raw materials are available from multiple sources and in general we purchase from a variety of global suppliers. In certain regions we may source specific raw materials from a limited number of suppliers or on a sole-source basis. While temporary shortages of raw materials can occur, we expect to continue to successfully manage raw material supplies without significant supply interruptions.

Employees

&#160;

As of the end of the 2016 fiscal year, we employed approximately 21,000 employees with approximately 20% of those employees being covered by collective bargaining agreements. The collective bargaining agreements covering a majority of these employees renew annually and as a result, are due for renegotiation in fiscal 2017. Our relations with employees under collective bargaining agreements remain satisfactory and there have been no significant work stoppages or other labor disputes during the past three years.

&#160;

Patents, Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property

&#160;

We customarily seek patent and trademark protection for our products and brands while seeking to protect our proprietary know-how. While important to our business in the aggregate, sales of any one individually patented product are not considered material to any specific segment or the consolidated results.

&#160;

Environmental Matters and Government Regulation

&#160;

Our past and present operations and our past and present ownership and operations of real property are subject to extensive and changing federal, state, local, and foreign environmental laws and regulations pertaining to the discharge of materials into the environment, handling and disposition of waste, and cleanup of contaminated soil and ground water, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations. However, we cannot predict with any certainty that we will not in the future incur liability with respect to noncompliance with environmental laws and regulations, contamination of sites formerly or currently owned or operated by us (including contamination caused by prior owners and operators of such sites) or the off-site disposal of regulated materials, which could be material.

&#160;

We may from time to time be required to conduct remediation of releases of regulated materials at our owned or operated facilities. None of our pending remediation projects are expected to result in material costs. Like any manufacturer, we are also subject to the possibility that we may receive notices of potential liability in connection with materials that were sent to third-party recycling, treatment, and/or disposal facilities under the Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended ("CERCLA"), and comparable state statutes, which impose liability for investigation and remediation of contamination without regard to fault or the legality of the conduct that contributed to the contamination, and for damages to natural resources. Liability under CERCLA is retroactive, and, under certain circumstances, liability for the entire cost of a cleanup can be imposed on any responsible party. We are not aware that any such notices are currently pending which are expected to result in material costs.

&#160;

The Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") regulates the material content of direct-contact food and drug packages, including certain packages we manufacture pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act. Certain of our products are also regulated by the Consumer Product Safety Commission ("CPSC") pursuant to various federal laws, including the Consumer Product Safety Act and the Poison Prevention Packaging Act. Both the FDA and the CPSC can require the manufacturer of defective products to repurchase or recall such products and may also impose fines or penalties on the manufacturer. Similar laws exist in some states, cities and other countries in which we sell our products. In addition, laws exist in certain states restricting the sale of packaging with certain levels of heavy metals, imposing fines and penalties for noncompliance. Although we believe that we use FDA approved resins and pigments in our products that directly contact food and drug products, and we believe our products are in material compliance with all applicable requirements, we remain subject to the risk that our products could be found not to be in compliance with such requirements.

&#160;

The plastics industry, including us, is subject to existing and potential federal, state, local and foreign legislation designed to reduce solid waste by requiring, among other things, plastics to be degradable in landfills, minimum levels of recycled content, various recycling requirements, disposal fees, and limits on the use of plastic products. In particular, certain states have enacted legislation requiring products packaged in plastic containers to comply with standards intended to encourage recycling and increased use of recycled materials. In addition, various consumer and special interest groups have lobbied from time to time for the implementation of these and other similar measures. We believe that the legislation promulgated to date and such initiatives to date have not had a material adverse effect on us. There can be no assurance that any such future legislative or regulatory efforts or future initiatives would not have a material adverse effect on us.
