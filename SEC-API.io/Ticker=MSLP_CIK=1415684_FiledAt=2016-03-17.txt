As used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the terms &#147;Company,&#148; &#147;we,&#148; &#147;our,&#148; &#147;MusclePharm&#148; or &#147;MP&#148; refer to MusclePharm Corporation and its predecessors, subsidiaries and affiliates, unless the context indicates otherwise. 

Products and Distribution 

We focus the MusclePharm Brand product portfolio for athlete&#146;s and active lifestyle use. We market our branded products in multiple performance and active lifestyle distribution channels that reach athletes of many types and demographics. Our goal is to serve the needs of all types of athletes, while fueling the engine of sport for all ages and genders. Our portfolio of brands targets every type of fitness enthusiast, from professional, combat sport, weight training, bodybuilding, running, basketball, soccer, cross fit, golf, tennis, volleyball and other active lifestyle activities. 

&#160;

We place considerable emphasis on transparency, high-quality ingredients, innovation and science with our ingredients. Products are placed through rigorous 3 rd party independent testing to ensure safe, quality ingredients that support an athletic lifestyle. Tests performed on products include: banned substance testing and protein verification. 

MusclePharm &#174; Sport Series &#150; Scientifically-advanced, performance-driven supplements that cover the needs of athletes including their workout needs. This line of independent-tested products help fuel athletes safely by increasing strength, endurance, hydration, recovery, and overall athletic performance. MusclePharm Hybrid Series products like Assault, Amino1 and Combat Protein Powder contain ingredients that are designed to deliver performance. MusclePharm Core products, such as BCAA 3:1:2, CLA Core and Fish Oil, are designed to meet the day-in and day-out demands of athletes. 

FitMiss &#174; &#160;&#150; Designed and formulated specifically for the active woman&#146;s lifestyle utilizing ingredients that covers the range of busy women&#146;s needs including weight loss, multi-vitamins, protein shakes, detox, skin care, and pre-workout energy mixes. 

Sales and Marketing 

Our core marketing strategy is to brand MusclePharm as the &#147;must have&#148; fitness brand for workout enthusiasts and elite athletes. We seek to be known as The Athletes Company &#174; , run by athletes who create their products for other athletes both professional and enthusiast. We believe that our marketing strategy of sports endorsements and sponsorships coupled with product sampling with our retail partners is an optimal strategy to increase sales. 

The MusclePharm brands are marketed across major global retail distribution channels &#150; Specialty, International and Food, Drug, and Mass (FDM). Our three largest customers each accounted for more than 10% of our 2015 net revenue. For further information concerning our customer concentration, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Specialty Market: This channel is comprised of brick-and-mortar sales and e-commerce. Due to high competition within this market, we continually seek to respond to customer trends and shifts by adjusting the mix of existing product offerings, developing new innovative products and influencing preferences by extensive and strategic marketing. 

International: We intend to focus on growing our international presence by continuing to offer new products, as well as improving the supply cycles and opening new distribution centers in select regions of the world to reduce tariffs, taxes and fees, as well as shipping time. Our principal international markets are Europe, the Middle East, Asia and South America. 

During 2014, we established a subsidiary in Ireland to primarily market and distribute in the EU. During 2015, we established a subsidiary in Australia to market and distribute in Australia, New Zealand and the surrounding region. 

FDM (Food, Drug, and Mass): This is a relatively new sales channel for MusclePharm that we intend to continue to grow by distribution expansion. We utilize the assistance of brokers to sell into this channel.

We previously have announced that we are exploring the sale of BioZone; accordingly, we have presented BioZone separately from our major sales channels. Our advertising and promotions consist primarily of athletic endorsements and sponsorships, which includes both cash and stock-based compensation, promotional giveaways, trade show events, FDM distribution costs, and digital, print and media advertising. In connection with our restructuring plan commenced during the third quarter of 2015, we have begun negotiating or terminating a number of contracts with endorsers in a strategic shift away from such costly arrangements, and toward more cost effective brand partnerships as well as grass-roots marketing and advertising efforts. 

We believe that influential brand partners such as MMA Team &#150; Team Elevation, Olympian Jordan Burroughs, and other professional athletes help boost brand credibility by exposing our brand to millions of potential customers. 

We believe that, along with our innovative products, providing superior, relevant and memorable brand experience drives our success. Our websites, including musclepharm.com, Arnold.com, fitmiss.com, and mpssi.com also provide additional educational information to consumers, customers, and healthcare professionals. 

As noted above, we market our products globally. The following table sets forth revenue, net by customer geographic area based off shipping address (in thousands):

&#160; Charitable Youth Sports Program 

In March 2014, the Board of Directors of the Company approved and the Company established a charitable youth sports grant program (the &#147;Program&#148;) pursuant to which the Company will donate product, equipment and cash to organizations such as schools, sports teams and training facilities. The Company had tentatively established an annual budget of approximately $250,000 for the Program. The primary intent of the Program was to build MusclePharm brand awareness with youth athletes. The Company&#146;s other business purposes in establishing the Program was to help needy organizations achieve their goals, promote the Company&#146;s brand, help athletes 

&#160;

develop stronger and better skills and to build the reputation of the Company as a contributor to the community. A committee formerly consisting of the Company&#146;s former President, former Director of Team Development, and former Chief Operating Officer oversaw the Program. In 2014, the Company made an initial grant in the amount of approximately $250,000 to Arvada West High School and similar charitable contributions to other charitable sports organizations of approximately $30,000. The Company&#146;s former Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Brad Pyatt, is a graduate of Arvada West High School and serves as a volunteer football coach. The Company did not make a charitable grant to Arvada West High School during 2015. The Company did make charitable grants to other youth sports organizations during 2015 totaling approximately $278,000. We expect this amount to decrease substantially in 2016 and any future grant will be approved by the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. 

Product Research, Development and Quality Control 

Science, product research and innovation are key factors to our success. Customers&#146; belief in the science and safety of our products is critical. Continued innovation in delivery techniques and ingredients, new product line extensions for existing products and new product offerings are important in order to create new market opportunities, meet consumer demand and strengthen consumer relationships. To support our research and development efforts, we invest in formulation, processing and packaging development, perform product quality and stability studies, complete product efficacy and safety studies, and conduct consumer market research to sample consumer opinions on product concepts, design, packaging, advertising and marketing campaigns. 

MusclePharm&#146;s lines of supplements are developed through a six-stage research process that utilizes the expertise of nutritional scientists, doctors and universities and strives to assure that each promote quality and safety for our customers. 

MusclePharm is committed to science and sport being equal in our product development. We believe real-world applications are essential. The MP Sports Science Institute in Denver, Colorado is a state-of-the-art, 30,000 square-foot training and performance facility&#151;the only professional facility in the world to use the ultrasound, Omega Wave, DEXA and Keiser performance equipment to gather cutting-edge feedback about our formulations. In addition, in our clinic, we can perform bone scans, blood work and ultrasounds to determine body composition as well as muscle and fat evaluations. Feedback and testing data helps our team strive to improve our products and allows MusclePharm to continue to be innovative. Active athlete testing also allows us to fine tune dosages, ensure proper ingredient combinations, and implement consumer safety measures. 

Our quality control team follows detailed and supplier selection and certification processes, validation of raw material verification processes, analytical testing, process audits, and other quality control procedures. The quality management systems we employ also include a professionally equipped and staffed laboratory enabling finished goods testing for compliance to our specifications. Our products are also subject to extensive shelf life stability testing. We also use third party laboratories to routinely evaluate our internal testing processes and to supplement our internal testing procedures and capabilities. 

We qualify ingredients, suppliers and facilities by performing site assessments and conducting on-going performance and process reviews. Dedicated quality teams regularly audit and assess manufacturing facilities for compliance Good Manufacturing Practices (&#147;GMPs&#148;), as regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (&#147;FDA&#148;) to ensure our compliance with all MusclePharm, regulatory and certification standards and requirements. To ensure overall consistency, our quality assurance team adheres to strict written procedures. From the raw ingredient stage to finished product stage, we monitor and perform quality control checks. Before distributing our products, we place our products under quarantine to test for environmental contaminants and verify that the finished product meets label claims. Once a product has successfully passed quality assurance testing and conforms to specifications for identity, purity, strength and composition, we then conduct testing with third-party laboratories for added label claim verification. Multi-level practices are part of our product development process to ensure athletes and our consumers receive what we believe to be the most scientifically-

&#160;

innovative and safe supplements on the market. Post-distribution, we have standard operating procedures in place for investigating and documenting any adverse events or product quality complaints. 

We are committed to the process of having all of our products certified to be banned-substance-free before they are available to our athletes and consumers. We complete third party analytical testing on our products through Eurofins. We also have engaged an independent lab to validate our quality processes and conduct banned-substance testing on every branded MusclePharm product. 

Manufacturing and Distribution 

We have a strategic working relationship with multiple contract manufacturers. Currently, the majority of our products are produced by third party powder and capsule manufacturing facilities located in Tennessee, New York, Utah and our subsidiary, BioZone, in California. Certain of our vendors supply in excess of 10% of our products. In particular, one of our third-party suppliers, Capstone, was responsible for 59% of our manufacturing spend in 2015. We have undertaken an evaluation of our agreements with Capstone, and at this time cannot anticipate whether Capstone will continue to be a principal vendor to us. See Note 2 to the consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of these vendors. Once a product is manufactured, it is sent to one of our distribution centers. Our main distribution center is located in Spring Hill, Tennessee, and we have a second distribution center in Pittsburg, California. We also utilize contract manufacturers to ship products directly to our customers. All of our manufacturing and distribution facilities are designed and operated to meet the current GMPs as promulgated by the FDA. 

Our manufacturing process generally consists of the following operations: (i) qualifying ingredients for products, (ii) testing of all raw ingredients, (iii) measuring ingredients for inclusion in production, (iv) granulating, blending and grinding ingredients into a mixture with a homogeneous consistency, (v) encapsulating or filling the blended mixture into the appropriate dosage form using either automatic or semiautomatic equipment, and (vi) testing finished products prior to distribution. 

We maintain and operate a system that integrates with distribution, warehousing and quality control, providing real-time lot and quality tracking of raw materials, work in progress and finished goods. 

We employ a supply chain staff that works with sales, marketing, product development and quality control personnel to create our products. 

Our Competitors 

The nutritional supplements market is very competitive and the range of products is diverse. Competitors use price, shelf space and store placement, brand and product recognition, new product introductions and raw materials to create market share. 

Our range of competitors includes numerous nutritional supplement companies that are highly fragmented in terms of geographic market coverage, distribution channels and product categories. In addition, large pharmaceutical companies and packaged food and beverage companies compete with us in the nutritional supplement market. Many of these companies have greater financial and distribution resources available to them than MusclePharm and many of these companies compete through vertical integration. Private label entities have gained a foothold in many nutrition categories and also are direct competitors. A few of these are private label entities have become market leaders. Our principal competitors are Optimum Nutrition, Inc., Cellucor, and Quest Nutrition, LLC. 

In this industry, most of the companies are privately held. With respect to retailer sales, we cannot fully gauge their sizes and our relative ranking. We believe that retailers look to partner with suppliers who demonstrate brand awareness, market intelligence, customer service and science. We believe we are competitive in all of these areas. 

&#160;

Government Regulation 

The formulation, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, advertising, distribution and sale of each of our major product groups are subject to regulation by one or more governmental agencies. The most active of these is the FDA, which regulates our products under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (&#147;FDCA&#148;) and regulations promulgated thereunder. The FDCA defines the terms &#147;food&#148; and &#147;dietary supplement&#148; and sets forth various conditions that, unless complied with, may constitute adulteration or misbranding of such products. The FDCA has been adjusted several times with respect to dietary supplements, most recently by the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990 (the &#147;NLEA&#148;) and the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994. 

FDA regulations relating specifically to foods and dietary supplements for human use are set forth in Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations. These regulations include basic labeling requirements for both foods and dietary supplements. Additionally, FDA regulations require us to meet relevant good manufacturing practice regulations for the preparation, packaging and storage of our food and dietary supplements. 

Our business practices and products are also regulated by the Federal Trade Commission (&#147;FTC&#148;), the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the United States Department of Agriculture (&#147;USDA&#148;) and the Environmental Protection Agency. Our activities, including our direct selling distribution activities, are also regulated by various agencies of the states, localities and foreign countries in which our products are sold. 

In foreign markets, prior to commencing operations and prior to making or permitting sales of our products in the market, we may be required to obtain an approval, license or certification from the country&#146;s ministry of health or comparable agency. Prior to entering a new market in which a formal approval, license or certificate is required, we work extensively with local consultants and authorities in order to obtain the requisite approvals. We must also comply with product labeling and packaging regulations that vary from country to country. Our failure to comply with these regulations can result in a product being removed from sale in a particular market, either temporarily or permanently. 

Intellectual Property 

We regard our trademarks and other proprietary rights as valuable assets and believe that protecting our key trademarks is crucial to the continued successful implementation of our business strategy of building strong brand name recognition. Since we regard our intellectual property as a crucial element of our business with significant value in the marketing of our products, our policy is to pursue registrations for our trademarks associated with our products. 

We have over 140 trademark applications in the United States, 51 of which are currently registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office for our MusclePharm brands and certain of our products and slogans. 

We also have filed for protection of various marks throughout the world and are committed to a significant long-term strategy to build and protect the MusclePharm brand globally. We have applied for the &#147;MusclePharm&#148; mark in 18 countries, including the United States. The mark has been granted final trademark registration in 16 of those countries. 

Seasonality 

Our business does not typically experience seasonal variations but revenue may fluctuate based upon promotions. During 2015, revenue fluctuated mainly due to issues in supply chain, which limited availability of inventory. Additionally, we experienced periods of mis-match of inventory on hand relative to customer sales orders. 

&#160;

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015, we had 248 total employees, of which 153 were full time. None of the employees are represented by a union. Management considers its relations with our employees to be good and to have been maintained in a normal and customary manner.
