 Item 1. Business. 

Overview

Targa Resources Corp. (NYSE: TRGP) is a publicly traded Delaware corporation formed in October 2005. As of December 31, 2015, Targa does not directly own any operating assets; our main source of future revenue therefore is from general and limited partner interests, including incentive distribution rights (&#8220;IDRs&#8221;), in the Partnership, a Delaware limited partnership (NYSE: NGLS), that is a leading provider of midstream natural gas and natural gas liquid services in the United States. The Partnership is engaged in the business of gathering, compressing, treating, processing and selling natural gas and storing, fractionating, treating, transporting, terminaling and selling NGLs, NGL products, and gathering, storing and terminaling crude oil and refined petroleum products.

On February 17, 2016, TRC completed the previously announced transactions contemplated by the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the &#8220;TRC/TRP Merger Agreement&#8221; or &#8220;Buy-in Transaction&#8221;), dated November 2, 2015, by and among TRC, TRP, the general partner of TRP and Spartan Merger Sub LLC, a subsidiary of TRC (&#8220;Merger Sub&#8221;) pursuant to which TRC acquired indirectly all of the outstanding TRP common units that TRC and its subsidiaries did not already own. Upon the terms and conditions set forth in the TRC/TRP Merger Agreement, Merger Sub merged with and into TRP (the &#8220;TRC/TRP Merger&#8221;), with TRP continuing as the surviving entity and as a subsidiary of TRC. As a result of the TRC/TRP Merger, TRC owns all of the outstanding TRP common units.

At the effective time of the TRC/TRP Merger, each outstanding TRP common unit not owned by TRC or its subsidiaries was converted into the right to receive 0.62 shares of our common stock. No fractional shares were issued in the TRC/TRP Merger, and TRP common unitholders instead received cash in lieu of fractional shares.

&#160;

We believe that the TRC/TRP Merger provides immediate and long-term benefits to our investors, and best positions us to successfully manage through the current commodity price environment and for long-term success. Some of the benefits of the TRC/TRP Merger include: improved coverage and credit profile, simplified structure and lower cost of capital, resulting in a stronger long-term growth outlook.

Pursuant to the TRC/TRP Merger Agreement, TRC has agreed to cause the TRP common units to be delisted from the New York Stock Exchange (&#8220;NYSE&#8221;) and deregistered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;). As a result of the completion of the TRC/TRP Merger, the TRP common units are no longer publicly traded. The 9.00% Series A Fixed-to-Floating Rate Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Units (the &#8220;Preferred Units&#8221;) remain outstanding as limited partner interests in TRP and continue to trade on the NYSE under the symbol &#8220;NGLS PRA.&#8221;

As we control the Partnership and continue to control it after the TRC/TRP Merger, the changes in our ownership interest in the Partnership will be accounted for as an equity transaction and no gain or loss will be recognized in our consolidated statements of income resulting from the TRC/TRP Merger. In addition, the tax effects of the TRC/TRP Merger will be reported as adjustments to our additional paid-in capital.

Financial Presentation

One of our indirect subsidiaries is the sole general partner of the Partnership. Because we control the general partner, under generally accepted accounting principles we must reflect our ownership interest in the Partnership on a consolidated basis. Accordingly, the Partnership&#8217;s financial results are included in our consolidated financial statements even though the distribution or transfer of Partnership assets are limited by the terms of the partnership agreement, as well as restrictive covenants in the Partnership&#8217;s lending agreements. The limited partner interests in the Partnership not owned by us on certain dates are reflected in our results of operations as net income attributable to noncontrolling interests. Throughout this Annual Report, we make a distinction where relevant between financial results and disclosures applicable to the Partnership versus those applicable to us as a standalone parent including our non-Partnership subsidiaries (&#8220;Non-Partnership&#8221;). In addition, we provide condensed Targa only financial statements as required by the SEC.

&#160;

The Partnership files its own separate Annual Report. The financial results presented in our consolidated financial statements will differ from the financial statements of the Partnership primarily due to the effects of:

&#160;

&#183; our separate debt obligations; 

&#183; federal income taxes; 

&#183; certain retained general and administrative costs applicable to us as a public company; 

&#183; certain administrative assets and liabilities incumbent as a provider of operational and support services to the Partnership; 

&#183; certain non-operating assets and liabilities that we retained; 

&#183; Partnership distributions and earnings allocable to third-party common and preferred unitholders which are included in non-controlling interest in our statements; and 

&#183; Partnership distributions applicable to our General Partner interest, IDRs and investment in Partnership common units. While these are eliminated when preparing our consolidated financial statements, they nonetheless are the primary source of cash flow that supports the payment of dividends to our stockholders. 

Overview of the Business of Targa Resources Corp.

Our primary business objective is to increase our cash available for dividends to our stockholders by assisting the Partnership in executing its business strategy. We may potentially facilitate the Partnership&#8217;s growth through various forms of financial support, including, but not limited to, making loans, making capital contributions in exchange for yielding or non-yielding equity interests or providing other financial support to the Partnership to support its ability to make distributions. In addition, we may potentially acquire assets that could be candidates for acquisition by us or the Partnership, potentially after operational or commercial improvement or further development.

At February 1, 2016, our interests in the Partnership consist of the following:

&#183; a 2% general partner interest, which we hold through our 100% ownership interest in the general partner; 

&#183; all of the outstanding IDRs; and 

&#183; 16,309,594 of the 184,899,602 outstanding common units of the Partnership, representing an 8.8% interest in the outstanding common units of the Partnership. 

&#183; a special general partnership interest (the &#8220;Special GP Interest&#8221;) representing retained tax benefits related to the contribution to TRP by TRC of the general partner interest in TPL acquired in the merger where Targa GP Merger Sub LLC merged with and into ATLS, with ATLS continuing as the surviving entity and as a subsidiary of Targa (&#8220;ATLS merger&#8221;). 

As a result of the TRC/TRP Merger, which was completed on February 17, 2016, we own all of the outstanding TRP common units.

Our cash flows are generated from the cash distributions we receive from the Partnership. After payment of preferred distributions to the preferred unitholders, the Partnership is required to distribute all available cash at the end of each quarter after establishing reserves to provide for the proper conduct of its business or to provide for future distributions. Our ownership of the general partner interest entitles us to receive 2% of all cash distributed in a quarter.

Our ownership of the IDRs of the Partnership entitles us to receive:

&#183; 13% of all cash distributed in a quarter after $0.3881 has been distributed in respect of each common unit of the Partnership for that quarter; 

&#183; 23% of all cash distributed in a quarter after $0.4219 has been distributed in respect of each common unit of the Partnership for that quarter; and 

&#160;

&#183; 48% of all cash distributed in a quarter after $0.50625 has been distributed in respect of each common unit of the Partnership for that quarter. 

Our ownership of all of the Partnership common units as of February 17, 2016 entitles us to receive all of the quarterly declared distributions that are paid to common unitholders.

The Partnership Agreement between the Partnership and us governs our relationship regarding certain reimbursement and indemnification matters. So long as our only cash generating assets are our interests in the Partnership, we will continue to allocate to the Partnership substantially all of our general and administrative costs other than our direct costs of being a reporting company. See &#8220;Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence.&#8221;

We employ approximately 1,870 people. See &#8220;Employees.&#8221; The Partnership does not have any employees to carry out its operations.

Overview of the Business of the Partnership

Targa Resources Partners LP (NYSE:NGLS) is a Delaware limited partnership formed in October 2006 by us to own, operate, acquire and develop a diversified portfolio of complementary midstream energy assets. The Partnership is a leading provider of midstream natural gas and NGL services in the United States, with a growing presence in crude oil gathering and petroleum terminaling.

The Partnership is engaged in the business of:

&#183; gathering, compressing, treating, processing and selling natural gas; 

&#183; storing, fractionating, treating, transporting and selling NGLs and NGL products, including services to LPG exporters; 

&#183; gathering, storing and terminaling crude oil; and 

&#183; storing, terminaling and selling refined petroleum products. 

To provide these services, the Partnership operates in two primary divisions: (i) Gathering and Processing, consisting of two reportable segments&#8212;(a) Field Gathering and Processing and (b) Coastal Gathering and Processing; and (ii) Logistics and Marketing (also referred to as the Partnership&#8217;s Downstream Business), consisting of two reportable segments&#8212;(a) Logistics Assets and (b) Marketing and Distribution. For a detailed description of these businesses, please see &#8220;&#8212;The Partnership&#8217;s Business Operations.&#8221;

The Partnership&#8217;s midstream natural gas and NGL services footprint was initially established through several acquisitions from us, totaling $3.1 billion, that occurred from 2007 through 2010, and was expanded through third-party acquisitions including the Partnership&#8217;s 2012 acquisition of Saddle Butte Pipeline LLC&#8217;s crude oil pipeline and terminal system and natural gas gathering and processing operations in North Dakota and the Partnership&#8217;s 2015 acquisition of Atlas Pipeline Partners, L.P. (&#8220;APL&#8221;). In these transactions the Partnership acquired (1) natural gas gathering, processing and treating assets in North Texas, West Texas, South Texas, Oklahoma, North Dakota, New Mexico and the Louisiana Gulf Coast, (2) crude oil gathering and terminal assets in North Dakota and (3) NGL assets consisting of fractionation, transport, storage and terminaling facilities, low sulfur natural gasoline treating facilities (&#8220;LSNG&#8221;), pipeline transportation and distribution assets, propane storage and truck terminals primarily located near Houston, Texas and in Lake Charles, Louisiana.

Since the completion of the final acquisitions from us in 2010 and with the 2015 acquisition of APL, the Partnership has grown substantially, with large increases in a number of metrics as of year-end 2015, including its total assets (313%), adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (&#8220;EBITDA&#8221;) (201%), distributable cash flow (214%) and distributions per common unit to its common unitholders (51%). The expansion of the Partnership&#8217;s business has been fueled by a combination of major organic growth investments in the Partnership&#8217;s businesses and acquisitions.

&#160;

Organic Growth Projects

The Partnership continues to invest significant capital to expand through organic growth projects. The Partnership has invested approximately $3.3 billion in growth capital expenditures since 2007, including approximately $0.7 billion in 2015. These expansion investments were distributed across its businesses, with 52% related to Logistics and Marketing and 48% to Gathering and Processing. The Partnership will continue to invest in both large and small organic growth projects in 2016, including the current fractionation expansion of its 88% owned Cedar Bayou Fractionator (&#8220;CBF&#8221;) in Mont Belvieu, Texas. The Partnership expects that the amount of capital expenditures will be less than previous years due to current market conditions, and the reduced level of drilling activity around its areas of operations. Depending on the ultimate level of industry activity, the Partnership currently estimates that it will invest $525 million or less in growth capital expenditures for announced projects in 2016.

Atlas Mergers

On February 27, 2015, Targa completed the acquisition of Atlas Energy LP (&#8220;ATLS&#8221;), a Delaware limited partnership and the Partnership completed the acquisition of APL, a Delaware limited partnership (the &#8220;Atlas mergers&#8221;). In connection with the Atlas mergers, APL changed its name to &#8220;Targa Pipeline Partners LP,&#8221; which we refer to as TPL, and ATLS changed its name to &#8220;Targa Energy LP.&#8221;

TPL is a provider of natural gas gathering, processing and treating services primarily in the Anadarko, Arkoma and Permian Basins located in the southwestern and mid-continent regions of the United States and in the Eagle Ford Shale play in south Texas. The Atlas mergers add TPL&#8217;s Woodford/South Central Oklahoma Oil Province (&#8220;SCOOP&#8221;), Mississippi Lime, Eagle Ford and additional Permian assets to the Partnership&#8217;s existing operations. In total, TPL adds 2,053 MMcf/d of processing capacity and 12,220 miles of additional pipeline. The results of TPL are reported in our Field Gathering and Processing segment.

Pursuant to the amendment to TRP&#8217;s partnership agreement entered into in by TRP&#8217;s general partner in conjunction with the Atlas mergers (the &#8220;IDR Giveback Agreement&#8221;), IDRs of $9.375 million were allocated to common unitholders for each quarter of 2015 commencing with the first quarter of 2015. The IDR Giveback Amendment covers sixteen quarters following the completion of the Atlas mergers on February 27, 2015 and resulted in reallocation of IDR payments to common unitholders at the following amounts - $9.375 million per quarter for 2015, and will result in reallocation of IDR payments to common unitholders in the amount of $6.25 million in the first quarter of 2016.

2015 Developments

Volatility of Commodity Prices

Fluctuations in energy prices can greatly affect production rates and investments by third parties in the development of new oil and natural gas reserves. Drilling and production activity generally decreases as crude oil and natural gas prices decrease below commercially acceptable levels. Prices of oil and natural gas have been historically volatile, and we expect this volatility to continue. The Partnership&#8217;s operations are affected by the level of crude, natural gas and NGL prices, the relationship between these prices and related reduced activity levels from the Partnership&#8217;s customers. The duration and magnitude of the decline in market prices cannot be predicted. 

Logistics Assets Segment Expansions

Cedar Bayou Fractionator Train 5

In July 2014, the Partnership approved construction of a 100 MBbl/d fractionator at CBF. The 100 MBbl/d expansion will be fully integrated with the Partnership&#8217;s existing Gulf Coast NGL storage, terminaling and delivery infrastructure, which includes an extensive network of connections to key petrochemical and industrial customers as well as the Partnership&#8217;s LPG export terminal at Galena Park on the Houston Ship Channel. Construction has been underway and is continuing and the Partnership expects completion of construction in the second quarter of 2016. Construction of the expansion has proceeded without disruption to existing operations, and we estimate that total growth capital expenditures net to our 88% interest for the expansion and the related infrastructure enhancements at Mont Belvieu should approximate $340 million.

&#160;

Channelview Splitter

On December 27, 2015, Targa Terminals LLC (&#8220;Targa Terminals&#8221;) and Noble Americas Corp., a subsidiary of Noble Group Ltd. (&#8220;Noble&#8221;) entered into a long-term, fee-based agreement (&#8220;Splitter Agreement&#8221;) under which Targa Terminals will build and operate a 35,000 barrel per day crude and condensate splitter at Targa Terminals&#8217; Channelview Terminal on the Houston Ship Channel (&#8220;Channelview Splitter&#8221;). The Channelview Splitter will have the capability to split approximately 35,000 barrels per day of condensate into its various components, including naphtha, kerosene, gas oil, jet fuel, and liquefied petroleum gas and will provide segregated storage for the crude, condensate and components. The Channelview Splitter is expected to be completed by early 2018, and has an estimated total cost of approximately $130 million to $150 million. The Partnership&#8217;s current total project capital expenditures estimate is higher than the original announcement in March 2014 because of changes in project scope and anticipated increases in costs for engineering, procurement and construction services and/or materials, including labor costs. As contemplated by the agreement entered into on December 31, 2014 between Targa Terminals and Noble (the &#8220;December 2014 Agreement&#8221;), the Splitter Agreement completes and terminates the December 2014 Agreement while retaining the Partnership&#8217;s economic benefits from that agreement.

Field Gathering and Processing Segment Expansion

Badlands Little Missouri 3

In the first quarter of 2015, the Partnership completed the 40 MMcf/d Little Missouri 3 plant expansion in McKenzie County, North Dakota, that increased capacity to 90 MMcf/d.

Permian Basin Buffalo Plant

In April 2014, TPL announced plans to build a new plant and expand the gathering footprint of its WestTX system. This project includes the laying of a new high pressure gathering line into Martin and Andrews counties of Texas, as well as incremental compression and a new 200 MMcf/d cryogenic processing plant, known as the Buffalo plant. Although construction was suspended for a period of time to assess supply uncertainties, it is now expected to be completed during the second quarter of 2016. Total growth capital expenditures for the Buffalo plant should approximate $105 million.

Eagle Ford Shale Natural Gas Processing Joint Venture

In October 2015, the Partnership announced that it entered into joint venture agreements with Sanchez Energy Corporation (&#8220;Sanchez&#8221;) to construct a new 200MMcf/d cryogenic natural gas processing plant in La Salle County, Texas (the &#8220;Raptor Plant&#8221;) and approximately 45 miles of associated pipelines. The Partnership owns a 50% interest in the plant and the approximately 45 miles of high pressure gathering pipelines that will connect Sanchez&#8217;s Catarina gathering system to the plant. The Partnership holds a portion of the transportation capacity on the pipeline, and the gathering joint venture receives fees for transportation. The Partnership expects to invest approximately $125 million of growth capital expenditures related to the joint ventures.

The Raptor Plant will accommodate the growing production from Sanchez&#8217;s premier Eagle Ford Shale acreage position in Dimmit, La Salle and Webb Counties, Texas and from other third party producers. The plant and high pressure gathering lines are supported by long-term, firm, fee-based contracts and acreage dedications with Sanchez. The Partnership will manage construction and operations of the plant and high pressure gathering lines, and the plant is expected to begin operations in early 2017. Prior to the plant being placed in-service, the Partnership will benefit from Sanchez natural gas volumes that will be processed at our Silver Oak facilities in Bee County, Texas.

In addition to the major projects in process noted above, the Partnership potentially has other growth capital expenditures in 2016 related to the continued build out of its gathering and processing infrastructure and logistics capabilities. In the depressed commodity price environment, the Partnership will evaluate these potential projects based on return profile, capital requirements and strategic need and may choose to defer projects depending on expected activity levels.

&#160;

Financing Activities

In connection with the closing of the Atlas mergers, we entered into a Credit Agreement (the &#8220;TRC Credit Agreement&#8221;), dated as of February 27, 2015, among us, each lender from time to time party thereto and Bank of America, N.A. as administrative agent, collateral agent, swing line lender and letter of credit issuer. The TRC Credit Agreement provides for a new five year revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount up to $670 million and a seven year term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $430 million. We used the net proceeds from the term loan issuance and the revolving credit facility to fund cash components of the ATLS merger, including cash merger consideration and approximately $160 million related to change of control payments made by ATLS, cash settlements of equity awards and transaction fees and expenses. In March 2015, we repaid $188.0 million of the term loan and wrote off $3.3 million of the discount and $5.7 million of debt issuance costs. In June 2015, we repaid $82.0 million of the term loan and wrote off $1.4 million of the discount and $2.4 million of debt issuance costs. The write-off of the discount and debt issuance costs are reflected as Loss from financing activities on the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2015.

Public Offering

During March 2015, we sold, to the public, 3,250,000 shares of our common stock under a registration statement on Form S-3 at a price to the public of $91 per share of common stock, providing net proceeds of $292.8 million to us. Pursuant to the exercise of the underwriters&#8217; overallotment option, we also sold an additional 487,500 shares of our common stock, providing additional net proceeds of $43.9 million. The proceeds from this offering were used to repay a portion of the outstanding borrowings under our term loan facility and to make a capital contribution of $52.4 million to the Partnership to maintain our 2% general partnership interest in the Partnership and for general corporate purposes.

Financing Activities of the Partnership

In January 2015, the Partnership Issuers issued $1.1 billion in aggregate principal amount of 5% Notes resulting in approximately $1,089.8 million of net proceeds were used together with borrowings from the Partnership&#8217;s senior secured revolving credit facility (the &#8220;TRP Revolver&#8221;) to fund the APL Notes Tender Offers and the Change of Control Offer (both as defined herein).

In February 2015, the Partnership amended the TRP Revolver to increase available commitments to $1.6 billion from $1.2 billion while retaining the right to request up to an additional $300.0 million in commitment increases. In connection with the 58,614,157 common units issued in the Atlas mergers in February 2015, Targa contributed an additional $52.4 million to the Partnership to maintain its 2% general partner interest.

In May 2015, the Partnership entered into an equity distribution agreement (the &#8220;May 2015 EDA&#8221;)&#8221;, pursuant to which it may sell through its sales agents, at its option, up to an aggregate of $1.0 billion of common units. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, the Partnership issued 7,377,380 common units under its equity distribution agreements (&#8220;EDAs&#8221;), receiving proceeds of $316.1 million (net of commissions). As of December 31, 2015, approximately $4.2 million of capacity and $835.6 million of capacity remain under the Partnership&#8217;s 2014 equity distribution agreement (the &#8220;May 2014 EDA&#8221;) and May 2015 EDAs. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, pursuant to the issuance of the EDAs, we contributed $6.5 million to the Partnership to maintain our 2% general partner interest.

In May 2015, the Partnership Issuers issued $342.1 million aggregate principal amount of the 6 &#8541; % Notes due 2020 to holders of the APL 6 &#8541; % Notes due 2020, which were validly tendered for exchange.

In September 2015, the Partnership Issuers issued $600.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 6&#190;% Notes resulting in approximately $595.0 million of net proceeds, which were used to reduce borrowings under the TRP Revolver and for general partnership purposes.

In October 2015, the Partnership completed an offering of 4,400,000 Preferred Units at a price of $25.00 per unit. The Partnership sold an additional 600,000 Preferred Units pursuant to the exercise of the underwriters&#8217; overallotment option . The Partnership received net proceeds of approximately $121.1 million. The Partnership used the net proceeds from this offering to reduce borrowings under the TRP Revolver and for general partnership purposes. As of December 31, 2015, the Partnership has paid preferred unit distributions of $1.5 million to its preferred unitholders . See Note 11 &#8211; Partnership Units and Related Matters.

&#160;

In December 2015, the Partnership amended its account receivable securitization facility to extend the maturity to December 9, 2016 with a facility size of $225 million.

In December 2015, the Partnership repurchased on the open market a portion of its outstanding Senior Notes as follows (the &#8220;December 2015 note repurchases&#8221;):

&#183; 5&#188;% Notes due 2023 (the &#8220;5&#188;% Notes&#8221;) paying $13.0 &#160; million plus accrued interest to repurchase $16.3 million of the outstanding balance of the 5&#188;% Notes. 

&#183; 4&#188;% Notes due 2023 (the &#8220;4&#188;% Notes&#8221;) paying $1.2 &#160; million plus accrued interest to repurchase $1.5 million of the outstanding balance of the 4&#188;% Notes. 

&#183; 6&#8541;% APL Notes due 2020 (the &#8220;6&#8541;% Notes&#8221;) paying $0.1 &#160; million plus accrued interest to repurchase $0.1 million of the outstanding balance of the 6&#8541;% Notes. 

The December 2015 note repurchases resulted in a $3.6 million gain on debt repurchases and a corresponding write-off of $0.1 million in related deferred debt issuance costs.

Growth Drivers

We believe that the Partnership&#8217;s near-term growth will be driven by the level of producer activity in the basins where its gathering and processing infrastructure is located and by the level of demand for services for the Partnership&#8217;s Downstream Business. The Partnership believes its assets are not easily duplicated, and even in the current depressed commodity price environment, are located in many of the most attractive and active areas of exploration and production activity and are near key markets and logistics centers. Over the longer term, the Partnership expects its growth will continue to be driven by the strong position of the Partnership&#8217;s quality assets which will benefit from production from shale plays and by the deployment of shale exploration and production technologies in both liquids-rich natural gas and crude oil resource plays that will also provide additional opportunities for its Downstream Business. The Partnership expects that third-party acquisitions will also continue to be a focus of its growth strategy.

Attractive Asset Positions

The Partnership believes that, despite continued declines in market prices for crude oil, natural gas and NGLs that have led to declines in producer activity, its positioning in some of the most attractive basins will allow the Partnership to capture increased natural gas supplies for processing. As commodity prices have declined, producers have focused drilling activity on their most attractive acreage, especially in the Permian Basin where the Partnership has a large and well positioned footprint and expects to see continued, though lower level, activity even in the current commodity price environment.

The development of shale and resources plays has resulted in increasing NGL supplies that continue to generate demand for the Partnership&#8217;s fractionation services at the Mont Belvieu market hub and for LPG export services at its Galena Park Marine Terminal on the Houston Ship Channel. Since 2010, in response to increasing demand, the Partnership has added 178 MBbl/d of additional fractionation capacity with the additions of CBF Trains 3 and 4, and will complete construction of CBF Train 5 which is expected to add an additional 100 MBbl/d of fractionation capacity starting in the second quarter of 2016. The Partnership also funded its share of the NGL fractionation expansion at Gulf Coast Fractionators (&#8220;GCF&#8221;) in 2012. In periods of strong demand, fractionation service providers benefit from long-term, &#8220;take-or-pay&#8221; contracts for new and existing fractionation capacity. The Partnership believes that the higher volumes of fractionated NGLs will also result in increased demand for other related fee-based services provided by its Downstream Business. Continued long-term demand for fractionation capacity is expected to lead to other growth opportunities.

As domestic producers have focused their drilling in crude oil and liquids-rich areas, new gas processing facilities are being built to accommodate liquids-rich gas, which results in an increasing supply of NGLs. As drilling in these areas continues, supply of NGLs requiring transportation and fractionation to market hubs is expected to continue. As the supply of NGLs increases, the Partnership&#8217;s integrated Mont Belvieu and Galena Park Terminal assets allow it to provide the raw product, fractionation, storage, interconnected terminaling, refrigeration and ship loading capabilities to support exports by third party customers.

&#160;

Drilling and production activity from liquids-rich natural gas shale plays and similar crude oil resource plays

The Partnership is actively pursuing natural gas gathering and processing and NGL fractionation opportunities associated with liquids-rich natural gas from shale and other resource plays and is also actively pursuing crude gathering and natural gas gathering and processing and NGL fractionation opportunities from active crude oil resource plays. We believe that the Partnership&#8217;s leadership position in the Downstream Business, which includes its fractionation and export services, provides it with a competitive advantage relative to other gathering and processing companies without these capabilities.

Bakken Shale / Three Forks opportunities

Although the declining commodity prices have reduced producer activity in the Bakken Shale and Three Forks plays in the Williston Basin, the Partnership has increased its volumes of crude oil gathered and natural gas gathered and processed. The Partnership continues to expand its infrastructure to capture additional volumes from wells that have already been drilled but that are not yet connected to the Partnership&#8217;s system.

Eagle Ford opportunities

As a result of the Partnership&#8217;s joint venture agreements with Sanchez in South Texas to construct a new 200 MMcf/d cryogenic processing plant and the associated infrastructure to connect to the Sanchez Catarina gathering system, the Partnership expects to benefit from increasing Sanchez production in the Eagle Ford play at the Partnership&#8217;s Silver Oak facilities prior to completion of the Raptor Plant and at the Raptor Plant thereafter.

Third party acquisitions

While the Partnership&#8217;s growth through 2010 was primarily driven by the implementation of a focused drop down strategy, the Partnership and Targa also have a record of completing third party acquisitions. Since its formation, its strategy included approximately $12.6 billion in acquisitions (including the APL merger) and growth capital expenditures of which approximately $6.2 billion was for acquisitions from third-parties. The Partnership expects that third-party acquisitions will continue to be a focus of its growth strategy.

Competitive Strengths and Strategies

We believe that the Partnership is well positioned to execute its business strategies due to the following competitive strengths:

Strategically located gathering and processing asset base

The Partnership&#8217;s gathering and processing businesses are strategically located in generally attractive oil and gas producing basins and are well positioned within each of those basins. Activity in the shale resource plays underlying its gathering assets is driven by the economics of oil, condensate, gas and NGL production from the particular reservoirs in each play. Activity levels for most of our gathering and processing asset are driven primarily by liquid hydrocarbon commodity prices. If drilling and production activities in these areas continue, the Partnership would likely increase the volumes of natural gas and crude oil available to its gathering and processing systems.

Leading fractionation, LPG export and NGL infrastructure position

The Partnership is one of the largest fractionators of NGLs in the Gulf Coast. Its primary fractionation assets are located in Mont Belvieu, Texas and to a lesser extent Lake Charles, Louisiana, which are key market centers for NGLs. The Partnership&#8217;s logistics operations at Mont Belvieu, the major U.S. hub of NGL infrastructure, include connection to a number of mixed NGL (&#8220;mixed NGLs&#8221; or &#8220;Y-grade&#8221;) supply pipelines, storage, interconnection and takeaway pipelines and other transportation infrastructure. Its Logistics assets, including fractionation facilities, storage wells, and its Galena Park marine export/import terminal and related pipeline systems and interconnects, are also located near and connected to key consumers of NGL products including the petrochemical and industrial markets. The location and interconnectivity of these assets are not easily replicated, and the Partnership has sufficient additional capability to expand their capacity. The Partnership has extensive experience in operating these assets and developing, permitting and constructing new midstream assets.

&#160;

Comprehensive package of midstream services

The Partnership provides a comprehensive package of services to natural gas and crude oil producers. These services are essential to gather crude and to gather, process and treat wellhead gas to meet pipeline standards and to extract NGLs for sale into petrochemical, industrial, commercial and export markets. We believe that the Partnership&#8217;s ability to provide these integrated services provides an advantage in competing for new supplies because the Partnership can provide substantially all of the services producers, marketers and others require for moving natural gas and NGLs from wellhead to market on a cost-effective basis. Additionally, the Partnership believes the barriers to enter the midstream sector on a scale similar to the Partnership are reasonably high due to the high cost of replicating or acquiring assets in key strategic positions, the difficulty of permitting and constructing new midstream assets and the difficulty of developing the expertise necessary to operate them.

High quality and efficient assets

The Partnership&#8217;s gathering and processing systems and Logistics assets consist of high-quality, well-maintained facilities, resulting in low-cost, efficient operations. Advanced technologies have been implemented for processing plants (primarily cryogenic units utilizing centralized control systems), measurements (essentially all electronic and electronically linked to a central data-base) and operations and maintenance to manage work orders and implement preventative maintenance schedules (computerized maintenance management systems). These applications have allowed proactive management of its operations resulting in lower costs and minimal downtime. The Partnership has established a reputation in the midstream industry as a reliable and cost-effective supplier of services to its customers and has a track record of safe, efficient, and reliable operation of its facilities. The Partnership intends to continue to pursue new contracts, cost efficiencies and operating improvements of its assets. Such improvements in the past have included new production and acreage commitments, reducing fuel gas and flare volumes and improving facility capacity and NGL recoveries. The Partnership will also continue to optimize existing plant assets to improve and maximize capacity and throughput.

In addition to routine annual maintenance expenses, the Partnership&#8217;s maintenance capital expenditures have averaged approximately $83.2 million per year over the last four years, which included $20.4 million of maintenance capital from TPL in the last ten months of 2015. We believe that the Partnership&#8217;s assets are well-maintained and anticipate that a similar level of maintenance capital expenditures will be sufficient for the Partnership to continue to operate its existing assets in a prudent, safe and cost-effective manner.

Large, diverse business mix with favorable contracts and increasing fee-based business

The Partnership maintains gas gathering and processing positions in strategic oil and gas producing areas across multiple basins and provides services under attractive contract terms to a diverse mix of customers across its areas of operation. Consequently, the Partnership is not dependent on any one oil and gas basin or customer. The Partnership&#8217;s Logistics and Marketing assets are typically located near key market hubs and near most of its NGL customers. They also serve must-run portions of the natural gas value chain, are primarily fee-based and have a diverse mix of customers.

The Partnership&#8217;s contract portfolio has attractive rate and term characteristics including a significant fee-based component, especially in its Downstream Business. The Partnership&#8217;s expected continued growth of the fee-based Downstream Business may result in increasing fee-based cash flow.

&#160;

Financial flexibility

The Partnership has historically maintained a conservative leverage ratio and ample liquidity and has funded its growth investments with a mix of equity and debt over time. Disciplined management of leverage, liquidity and commodity price volatility allows the Partnership to be flexible in its long-term growth strategy and enable it to pursue strategic acquisitions and large growth projects.

Experienced and long-term focused management team

Our current executive management team includes a number of individuals who formed us in 2004 and several others who managed many of our businesses prior to acquisition by Targa. They possess a breadth and depth of experience working in the midstream energy business. Other officers and key operational, commercial and financial employees provide significant experience in the industry and with its assets and businesses.

Attractive cash flow characteristics

The Partnership believes that its strategy, combined with its high-quality asset portfolio, allows it to generate attractive cash flows. Geographic, business and customer diversity enhances its cash flow profile. The Partnership&#8217;s Field Gathering and Processing segment has a contract mix that is primarily percent-of-proceeds, but also has increasing components of fee-based revenues, from some fee-based basins, from fees added to percent-of-proceeds contracts for natural gas treating and compression, from new/amended contracts with a combination of percent-of-proceeds and fee-based and from essentially fully fee-based crude oil gathering and gas gathering and processing in its Williston Basin and SouthTX assets. Contracts in its Coastal Gathering and Processing segment are primarily hybrid (percent-of-liquids with a fee floor) or percent-of-liquids contracts. Contracts in the Downstream Business are predominately fee-based based on volumes and contracted rates, with a large take-or-pay component. The Partnership&#8217;s contract mix, along with its commodity hedging program, serves to mitigate the impact of commodity price movements on cash flow.

&#160;

The Partnership has hedged the commodity price risk associated with a portion of its expected natural gas, NGL and condensate equity volumes through 2018 by entering into financially settled derivative transactions. These transactions include swaps, futures, purchased puts (or floors) and costless collars. The primary purpose of its commodity risk management activities is to hedge its exposure to price risk and to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in commodity prices on cash flow. The Partnership has intentionally tailored its hedges to approximate specific NGL products and to approximate its actual NGL and residue natural gas delivery points. Although the degree of hedging will vary, the Partnership intends to continue to manage some of its exposure to commodity prices by entering into similar hedge transactions. The Partnership also monitors and manages its inventory levels with a view to mitigate losses related to downward price exposure.

Asset base well-positioned for organic growth

We believe that the Partnership&#8217;s asset platform and strategic locations allow the Partnership to maintain and potentially grow its volumes and related cash flows as its supply areas benefit from continued exploration and development over time. Technology advances have resulted in increased domestic oil and liquids-rich gas drilling and production activity. While recent commodity price levels have impacted activity, the location of its assets provides the Partnership with access to natural gas and crude oil supplies and proximity to end-user markets and liquid market hubs while positioning the Partnership to capitalize on drilling and production activity in those areas. The Partnership&#8217;s existing infrastructure has the capacity to handle some incremental increases in volumes without significant investments as well as opportunities to leverage existing assets with meaningful expansions. We believe that as domestic supply and demand for natural gas, crude oil and NGLs, and services for each grows over the long term, the Partnership&#8217;s infrastructure will increase in value as such infrastructure takes on increasing importance in meeting that growing supply and demand.

While we have set forth the Partnership&#8217;s strategies and competitive strengths above, its business involves numerous risks and uncertainties which may prevent the Partnership from executing its strategies or impact the amount of distributions to limited partners. These risks include the adverse impact of changes in natural gas, NGL and condensate/crude oil prices or in the supply of or demand for these commodities, and its inability to access sufficient additional production to replace natural declines in production. For a more complete description of the risks associated with an investment in the Partnership, see &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors.&#8221;

The Partnership&#8217;s Relationship with Us

We have used the Partnership as a growth vehicle to pursue the acquisition and expansion of midstream natural gas, NGL, crude oil and other complementary energy businesses and assets as evidenced by the Partnership&#8217;s acquisitions of businesses from us. However, we are not prohibited from competing with the Partnership and may evaluate acquisitions and dispositions that do not involve the Partnership. In addition, through its relationship with us, the Partnership has access to a significant pool of management talent, strong commercial relationships throughout the energy industry and access to our broad operational, commercial, technical, risk management and administrative infrastructure.

As of December 31, 2015, we and our named executive officers and directors had a significant ownership interest in the Partnership through our ownership of approximately 9.1% limited partner interest and our 2% general partner interest. As a result of the TRC/TRP Merger, which was completed on February 17, 2016, Targa owns all of the outstanding TRP common units and the IDRs. The Partnership Agreement with us governs our relationship regarding certain reimbursement and indemnification matters. See &#8220;Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions and Director Independence.&#8221;

The Partnership does not have any employees to carry out its operations. We employ approximately 1,870 people. See &#8220;&#8212;Employees.&#8221; We charge the Partnership for all the direct costs of the employees assigned to its operations, as well as all general and administrative support costs other than our direct support costs of being a separate reporting company and our cost of providing management and support services to certain unaffiliated spun-off entities. The Partnership generally reimburses us for cost allocations to the extent that the Partnership has required a current cash outlay by us.

&#160;

The Partnership&#8217;s Challenges

The Partnership faces a number of challenges in implementing its business strategy. For example:

&#183; The Partnership has a substantial amount of indebtedness which may adversely affect its financial position. 

&#183; The Partnership&#8217;s cash flow is affected by supply and demand for crude oil, natural gas and NGL products and by natural gas, NGL and condensate prices, and decreases in these prices could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 

&#183; The Partnership&#8217;s growth strategy requires access to new capital. Volatile capital markets with uncertain access or increased competition for investment opportunities could impair the Partnership&#8217;s ability to grow. 

&#183; The Partnership&#8217;s long-term success depends on its ability to obtain new sources of supplies of natural gas, crude oil and NGLs, which is subject to certain factors beyond the Partnership&#8217;s control. Any decrease in supplies of natural gas, crude oil or NGLs could adversely affect its business and operating results. 

&#183; Although the Partnership believes it has a large, diverse customer base, the Partnership is subject to counterparty risk which could adversely affect our financial position. 

&#183; The Partnership&#8217;s hedging activities may not be effective in reducing the variability of the Partnership&#8217;s cash flows and may, in certain circumstances, increase the variability of the Partnership&#8217;s cash flows. 

&#183; If the Partnership does not successfully make acquisitions on economically acceptable terms or efficiently and effectively integrate assets from acquisitions, its results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. 

&#183; The Partnership is subject to regulatory, environmental, political, legal and economic risks, which could adversely affect the Partnership&#8217;s results of operations and financial condition. 

&#183; The Partnership&#8217;s industry is highly competitive, and increased competitive pressure could adversely affect the Partnership&#8217;s business and operating results. 

For a further discussion of these and other challenges the Partnership faces, please read &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors.&#8221;

The Partnership&#8217;s Business Operations

The Partnership&#8217;s operations are reported in two divisions: (i) Gathering and Processing, consisting of two segments&#8212;(a) Field Gathering and Processing and (b) Coastal Gathering and Processing; and (ii) Logistics and Marketing, consisting of two segments&#8212;(a) Logistics Assets and (b) Marketing and Distribution.

Gathering and Processing Division

The Partnership&#8217;s Gathering and Processing Division consists of gathering, compressing, dehydrating, treating, conditioning, processing, and marketing natural gas and gathering crude oil. The gathering of natural gas consists of aggregating natural gas produced from various wells through small diameter gathering lines to processing plants. Natural gas has a widely varying composition depending on the field, the formation and the reservoir from which it is produced. The processing of natural gas consists of the extraction of imbedded NGLs and the removal of water vapor and other contaminants to form (i) a stream of marketable natural gas, commonly referred to as residue gas, and (ii) a stream of mixed NGLs. Once processed, the residue gas is transported to markets through pipelines that are owned by either the gatherers and processors or third parties. End-users of residue gas include large commercial and industrial customers, as well as natural gas and electric utilities serving individual consumers. The Partnership sells its residue gas either directly to such end-users or to marketers into intrastate or interstate pipelines, which are typically located in close proximity or with ready access to its facilities. The gathering of crude oil consists of aggregating crude oil production primarily through gathering pipeline systems, which deliver crude oil to a combination of other pipelines, rail and truck.

&#160;

The Partnership continually seeks new supplies of natural gas and crude oil, both to offset the natural decline in production from connected wells and to increase throughput volumes. The Partnership obtains additional natural gas and crude oil supply in its operating areas by contracting for production from new wells or by capturing existing production currently gathered by others. Competition for new natural gas and crude oil supplies is based primarily on location of assets, commercial terms including pre-existing contracts, service levels and access to markets. The commercial terms of natural gas gathering and processing arrangements and crude oil gathering are driven, in part, by capital costs, which are impacted by the proximity of systems to the supply source and by operating costs, which are impacted by operational efficiencies, facility design and economies of scale.

The Partnership believes its extensive asset base and scope of operations in the regions in which it operates provide it with significant opportunities to add both new and existing natural gas and crude oil production to its areas of operations. The Partnership believes its size and scope give it a strong competitive position through close proximity to a large number of existing and new producing wells in its areas of operations, allowing it to generate economies of scale and to provide its customers with access to its existing facilities and to end-use markets and market hubs. Additionally, the Partnership believes its ability to serve its customers&#8217; needs across the natural gas and NGL value chain further augments its ability to attract new customers.

Field Gathering and Processing Segment

The Field Gathering and Processing segment&#8217;s assets are located in the Permian Basin of West Texas and Southeast New Mexico; the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas; the Barnett Shale in North Texas; the Anadarko, Ardmore, and Arkoma Basins in Oklahoma and South Central Kansas; and the Williston Basin in North Dakota.

The natural gas processed in this segment is supplied through its gathering systems which, in aggregate, consist of approximately 23,630 miles of natural gas pipelines and include 28 owned and operated processing plants. During 2015, the Partnership processed an average of 2,344.2 MMcf/d of natural gas and produced an average of 223.6 MBbl/d of NGLs. In addition to the Partnership&#8217;s natural gas gathering and processing, its Badlands operations include a crude oil gathering system and four terminals with crude oil operational storage capacity of 125 MBbl.

The Partnership believes it is well positioned as a gatherer and processor in the Permian Basin, Eagle Ford Shale, Barnett Shale, Anadarko, Ardmore, Arkoma and Williston Basins. The Partnership believes proximity to production and development activities allows it to compete for new supplies of natural gas and crude oil partially because of its lower competitive cost to connect new wells, process additional natural gas in its existing processing plants and because of its reputation for reliability. Additionally, because the Partnership operates all of its plants, which are often interconnected in these regions, it is often able to redirect natural gas among its processing plants, providing operational flexibility and allowing it to optimize processing efficiency and further improve the profitability of its operations.

The Field Gathering and Processing segment&#8217;s operations consist of SAOU, WestTX, Sand Hills, Versado, SouthTX, North Texas, SouthOK, WestOK and Badlands, each as described below

Coastal Gathering and Processing Segment

The Partnership&#8217;s Coastal Gathering and Processing segment assets are located in the onshore region of the Louisiana Gulf Coast, accessing natural gas from the Gulf Coast and the Gulf of Mexico. With the strategic location of its assets in Louisiana, the Partnership has access to the Henry Hub, the largest natural gas hub in the U.S., and to a substantial NGL distribution system with access to markets throughout Louisiana and the southeast U.S. The Coastal Gathering and Processing segment&#8217;s assets consist of LOU and the Coastal Straddles, each as described below. For the year ended 2015, the Partnership processed an average of 897.0 MMcf/d of plant natural gas inlet and produced an average of 41.8 MBbl/d of NGLs.

LOU

LOU consists of approximately 900 miles of onshore gathering system pipelines in Southwest Louisiana. The gathering system is connected to numerous producing wells, central delivery points and/or pipeline interconnects in the area between Lafayette and Lake Charles, Louisiana. The gathering system is a high-pressure gathering system that delivers natural gas for processing to either the Acadia or Gillis plants via three main trunk lines. The processing facilities include the Gillis and Acadia processing plants, both of which are cryogenic plants. The Big Lake plant, also cryogenic, is located near the LOU gathering system. These processing plants have an aggregate processing capacity of approximately 440 MMcf/d. In addition, the Gillis plant has integrated fractionation with operating capacity of approximately 11 MBbl/d which is interconnected with the Lake Charles Fractionator. The LOU gathering system is also interconnected with the Lowry gas plant, allowing receipt or delivery of gas.

Coastal Straddles

Coastal Straddles process natural gas produced from shallow-water central and western Gulf of Mexico natural gas wells and from deep shelf and deep-water Gulf of Mexico production via connections to third-party pipelines or through pipelines owned by the Partnership. Coastal Straddles has access to markets across the U.S. through the interstate natural gas pipelines to which they are interconnected. The industry continues to rationalize gas processing capacity along the Gulf Coast by moving gas from older, less efficient plants to higher efficiency cryogenic plants. For example, in the last two years, the Yscloskey, Stingray and Calumet plants have been shut-down, with most of the producer volumes going to more efficient Targa plants such as its Venice, Lowry and Barracuda plants.

VESCO

Through the Partnership&#8217;s 76.8% ownership interest in Venice Energy Services Company, L.L.C., it operates the Venice gas plant, which has an aggregate processing capacity of 750 MMcf/d and the Venice Gathering System (&#8220;VGS&#8221;) that is approximately 150 miles in length and has a nominal capacity of 320 MMcf/d (collectively &#8220;VESCO&#8221;). VESCO receives unprocessed gas directly or indirectly from seven offshore pipelines and gas gathering systems including the VGS system. VGS gathers natural gas from the shallow waters of the eastern Gulf of Mexico and supplies the VESCO gas plant.

&#160;

Other Coastal Straddles

Other Coastal Straddles consists of two wholly owned and operated gas processing plants (one now idled) and three partially owned plants which are not operated by the Partnership. These plants, having an aggregate processing capacity of approximately 3,255 MMcf/d, are generally situated on mainline natural gas pipelines near the coastline and process volumes of natural gas collected from multiple offshore gathering systems and pipelines throughout the Gulf of Mexico. Coastal Straddles also has ownership in two offshore gathering systems that are operated by the Partnership. The Pelican and Seahawk gathering systems have a combined length of approximately 200 miles and a combined capacity of approximately 230 MMcf/d. These systems gather natural gas from the shallow waters of the central Gulf of Mexico and supply a portion of the natural gas delivered to the Barracuda and Lowry processing facilities.

The following table lists the Coastal Gathering and Processing segment&#8217;s natural gas processing plants and related volumes for the year ended December 31, 2015:

Logistics and Marketing Division

The Partnership&#8217;s Logistics and Marketing Division is also referred to as the Downstream Business. It includes the activities necessary to convert mixed NGLs into NGL products and provide certain value-added services such as the fractionation, storage, terminaling, transportation, exporting, distribution and marketing of NGLs and NGL products; the storing and terminaling of refined petroleum products and crude oil; and certain natural gas supply and marketing activities in support of the Partnership&#8217;s other businesses. These products are delivered to end-users through pipelines, barges, ships, trucks and rail cars. End-users of NGL products include petrochemical, refining companies, export markets for propane and butane, and propane markets for heating, cooking or agricultural applications.

&#160;

Logistics Assets Segment

The Logistics Assets segment uses its platform of integrated assets to receive, fractionate, store, treat, transport and deliver NGLs typically under fee-based arrangements. For NGLs to be used by refineries, petrochemical manufacturers, propane distributors, international export markets and other industrial end-users, they must be fractionated into their component products and delivered to various points throughout the U.S. The Partnership&#8217;s logistics assets are generally connected to, and supplied in part by, its&#8217; gathering and processing assets and are primarily located at Mont Belvieu and Galena Park near Houston, Texas and in Lake Charles, Louisiana. This segment also contains refined petroleum product and crude oil storage and terminaling facilities in Texas (the Channelview and Patriot Terminals; both on the Houston Ship Channel), Maryland (the Baltimore Terminal) and Washington (the Sound Terminal, located in Tacoma).

Fractionation

After being extracted in the field, mixed NGLs, sometimes referred to as &#8220;Y-grade&#8221; or &#8220;raw NGL mix,&#8221; are typically transported to a centralized facility for fractionation where the mixed NGLs are separated into discrete NGL products: ethane, ethane-propane mix, propane, normal butane, iso-butane and natural gasoline.

The Partnership&#8217;s fractionation assets include ownership interests in three stand-alone fractionation facilities that are located on the Gulf Coast, two that it operates, one at Mont Belvieu, Texas and the other at Lake Charles, Louisiana. The Partnership has an equity investment in the third fractionator, GCF, also located at Mont Belvieu. The Partnership is subject to a consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission, issued December 12, 1996, that, among other things, prevents it from participating in commercial decisions regarding rates paid by third parties for fractionation services at GCF. This restriction on the Partnership&#8217;s activity at GCF will terminate on December 12, 2016. In addition to the three stand-alone facilities in the Logistics Assets segment, see the description of fractionation assets in the North Texas System and LOU in the Gathering and Processing division.

The Partnership expanded the fractionation capacity of its assets during the last three years with the following projects:

&#183; CBF Train 4. In August 2013, the Partnership commissioned 100 MBbl/d of additional fractionation capacity, Train 4, at CBF, in Mont Belvieu, Texas, at a gross cost of approximately $385 million (the Partnership&#8217;s net cost was approximately $345 million). Train 4 is supported by long-term contracts that have certain guaranteed volume commitments or provisions for deficiency payments. 

&#183; CBF Train 5. This expansion is currently under construction and will add 100 MBbl/d of fractionation capacity. We expect completion of Train 5 in mid-2016. The net cost to the Partnership of Train 5 is expected to be approximately $340 million and will be supported by supply from Targa&#8217;s Gas Processing Division and by long-term contracts with third parties. 

The Partnership&#8217;s NGL fractionation business is under fee-based arrangements. These fees are subject to adjustment for changes in certain fractionation expenses, including energy costs. The operating results of the Partnership&#8217;s NGL fractionation business are dependent upon the volume of mixed NGLs fractionated, the level of fractionation fees charged and product gains/losses from fractionation.

The Partnership believes that sufficient volumes of mixed NGLs will be available for fractionation in commercially viable quantities for the foreseeable future due to historical increases in NGL production from shale plays and other shale-technology-driven resource plays in areas of the U.S. that include North Texas, South Texas, the Permian Basin, Oklahoma and the Rockies and certain other basins accessed by pipelines to Mont Belvieu, as well as from conventional production of NGLs in areas such as the Permian Basin, Mid-Continent, East Texas, South Louisiana and shelf and deep-water Gulf of Mexico. Hydrocarbon dew point specifications implemented by individual natural gas pipelines and the Policy Statement on Provisions Governing Natural Gas Quality and Interchangeability in Interstate Natural Gas Pipeline Company Tariffs enacted in 2006 by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (&#8220;FERC&#8221;) should result in volumes of mixed NGLs being available for fractionation because natural gas requires processing or conditioning to meet pipeline quality specifications. These requirements establish a base volume of mixed NGLs during periods when it might be otherwise uneconomical to process certain sources of natural gas. Furthermore, significant volumes of mixed NGLs are contractually committed to the Partnership&#8217;s NGL fractionation facilities.

&#160;

Although competition for NGL fractionation services is primarily based on the fractionation fee, the ability of an NGL fractionator to obtain mixed NGLs and distribute NGL products is also an important competitive factor. This ability is a function of the existence of storage infrastructure and supply and market connectivity necessary to conduct such operations. The Partnership believes that the location, scope and capability of the Partnership&#8217;s logistics assets, including its transportation and distribution systems, gives the Partnership access to both substantial sources of mixed NGLs and a large number of end-use markets.

The Partnership also has a natural gasoline hydrotreater at Mont Belvieu, Texas that removes sulfur from natural gasoline, allowing customers to meet new, more stringent environmental standards. The facility has a capacity of 30 MBbl/d and is supported by long-term fee-based contracts that have certain guaranteed volume commitments or provisions for deficiency payments.

Storage, Terminaling and Petroleum Logistics

In general, the Partnership&#8217;s NGL storage assets provide warehousing of mixed NGLs, NGL products and petrochemical products in underground wells, which allows for the injection and withdrawal of such products at various times in order to meet supply and demand cycles. Similarly, the Partnership&#8217;s terminaling operations provide the inbound/outbound logistics and warehousing of mixed NGLs, NGL products and petrochemical products in above-ground storage tanks. The Partnership&#8217;s NGL underground storage and terminaling facilities serve single markets, such as propane, as well as multiple products and markets. For example, the Mont Belvieu and Galena Park facilities have extensive pipeline connections for mixed NGL supply and delivery of component NGLs. In addition, some of the Partnership&#8217;s facilities are connected to marine, rail and truck loading and unloading facilities that provide services and products to customers. The Partnership provides long and short-term storage and terminaling services and throughput capability to third-party customers for a fee.

The Partnership&#8217;s Petroleum Logistics business owns and operates storage and terminaling facilities in Texas, Maryland and Washington. These facilities not only serve the refined petroleum products and crude oil markets, but also include LPGs and biofuels.

Across the Logistics Assets segment, the Partnership owns or operates a total of 39 storage wells at its facilities with a net storage capacity of approximately 64 MMBbl, the usage of which may be limited by brine handling capacity, which is utilized to displace NGLs from storage.

The Partnership operates its storage and terminaling facilities to support its key fractionation facilities at Mont Belvieu and Lake Charles for receipt of mixed NGLs and storage of fractionated NGLs to service the petrochemical, refinery, export and heating customers/markets as well as its wholesale domestic terminals that focus on logistics to service its heating market customer base. In September 2013, the Partnership commissioned Phase I of the international export expansion project that includes facilities at both Mont Belvieu and the Galena Park Marine Terminal near Houston, Texas. Phase I of the project expanded its export capability to approximately 3.5 to 4 MMBbl per month of propane and/or butane. Included in the Phase I expansion was the capability to export international grade low ethane propane. With the completion of Phase I, the Partnership also added capabilities to load VLGC vessels alongside the small and medium sized export vessels that it loads for export. The Partnership completed Phase II of the international export expansion project in the third quarter of 2014, which added approximately 3 MMBbl per month of export capacity. The Partnership continues to experience demand growth for US-based NGLs (both propane and butane) for export into international markets.

&#160;

The Partnership&#8217;s fractionation, storage and terminaling business is supported by approximately 900 miles of company-owned pipelines to transport mixed NGLs and specification products.

Marketing and Distribution Segment

The Marketing and Distribution segment transports, distributes and markets NGLs via terminals and transportation assets across the U.S. The Partnership owns or commercially manages terminal facilities in a number of states, including Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Arizona, Nevada, California, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Tennessee, Kentucky, New Jersey and Washington. The geographic diversity of the Partnership&#8217;s assets provide direct access to many NGL customers as well as markets via trucks, barges, ships, rail cars and open-access regulated NGL pipelines owned by third parties. The Marketing and Distribution segment consists of (i) NGL Distribution and Marketing, (ii) Wholesale Domestic Marketing, (iii) Refinery Services, (iv) Commercial Transportation, (v) Natural Gas Marketing and (vi) Terminal Facilities, each as described below.

NGL Distribution and Marketing

The Partnership markets its own NGL production and also purchases component NGL products from other NGL producers and marketers for resale. Additionally, the Partnership also purchases product for resale in its Logistics segment, including exports. During the year ended December 31, 2015, its distribution and marketing services business sold an average of approximately 432.3 MBbl/d of NGLs.

The Partnership generally purchases mixed NGLs at a monthly pricing index less applicable fractionation, transportation and marketing fees and resell these component products to petrochemical manufacturers, refineries and other marketing and retail companies. This is primarily a physical settlement business in which the Partnership earns margins from purchasing and selling NGL products from customers under contract. The Partnership also earns margins by purchasing and reselling NGL products in the spot and forward physical markets. To effectively serve its Distribution and Marketing customers, the Partnership contracts for and uses many of the assets included in its Logistics Assets segment.

&#160;

Wholesale Domestic Marketing

The Partnership&#8217;s wholesale domestic propane marketing operations primarily sell propane and related logistics services to major multi-state retailers, independent retailers and other end-users. The Partnership&#8217;s propane supply primarily originates from both its refinery/gas supply contracts and other owned or managed logistics and marketing assets. The Partnership sells propane at a fixed posted price or at a market index basis at the time of delivery and in some circumstances, it earns margin on a netback basis.

The wholesale propane marketing business is significantly impacted by seasonal and weather-driven demand, particularly in the winter, which can impact the price and volume of propane sold in the markets the Partnership serves.

Refinery Services

In the Partnership&#8217;s refinery services business, it typically provides NGL balancing services via contractual arrangements with refiners to purchase and/or market propane and to supply butanes. The Partnership uses its commercial transportation assets (discussed below) and contracts for and uses the storage, transportation and distribution assets included in its Logistics Assets segment to assist refinery customers in managing their NGL product demand and production schedules. This includes both feedstocks consumed in refinery processes and the excess NGLs produced by other refining processes. Under typical netback purchase contracts, the Partnership generally retains a portion of the resale price of NGL sales or receives a fixed minimum fee per gallon on products sold. Under netback sales contracts, fees are earned for locating and supplying NGL feedstocks to the refineries based on a percentage of the cost to obtain such supply or a minimum fee per gallon.

Key factors impacting the results of the Partnership&#8217;s refinery services business include production volumes, prices of propane and butanes, as well as its ability to perform receipt, delivery and transportation services in order to meet refinery demand.

Commercial Transportation

The Partnership&#8217;s NGL transportation and distribution infrastructure includes a wide range of assets supporting both third-party customers and the delivery requirements of its marketing and asset management business. The Partnership provides fee-based transportation services to refineries and petrochemical companies throughout the Gulf Coast area. The Partnership&#8217;s assets are also deployed to serve its wholesale distribution terminals, fractionation facilities, underground storage facilities and pipeline injection terminals. These distribution assets provide a variety of ways to transport products to and from the Partnership&#8217;s customers.

The Partnership&#8217;s transportation assets, as of December 31, 2015, include approximately 700 railcars that the Partnership leases and manages; approximately 80 owned and leased transport tractors and 20 company-owned pressurized NGL barges.

Natural Gas Marketing

The Partnership also markets natural gas available to it from the Gathering and Processing segments, purchases and resells natural gas in selected U.S. markets and manages the scheduling and logistics for these activities.

Operational Risks and Insurance

The Partnership is subject to all risks inherent in the midstream natural gas, crude oil and petroleum logistics businesses. These risks include, but are not limited to, explosions, fires, mechanical failure, terrorist attacks, product spillage, weather, nature and inadequate maintenance of rights-of-way and could result in damage to or destruction of operating assets and other property, or could result in personal injury, loss of life or environmental pollution, as well as curtailment or suspension of operations at the affected facility. We maintain, on behalf of ourselves and our subsidiaries, including the Partnership, general public liability, property, boiler and machinery and business interruption insurance in amounts that we consider to be appropriate for such risks. Such insurance is subject to deductibles that we consider reasonable and not excessive given the current insurance market environment. For example, following Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005, insurance premiums, deductibles and co-insurance requirements increased substantially, and terms were generally less favorable than terms that could be obtained prior to such hurricanes. Insurance market conditions worsened as a result of the losses sustained from Hurricanes Gustav and Ike in September 2008. As a result, the Partnership experienced further increases in deductibles and premiums, and further reductions in coverage and limits, with some coverage unavailable at any cost.

The occurrence of a significant loss that is not fully insured or indemnified against, or the failure of a party to meet its indemnification obligations, could materially and adversely affect the Partnership&#8217;s operations and the Partnership&#8217;s and our financial condition. While we currently maintain levels and types of insurance that we believe to be prudent under current insurance industry market conditions, our inability to secure these levels and types of insurance in the future could negatively impact the Partnership business operations and the Partnership&#8217;s and our financial stability, particularly if an uninsured loss were to occur. No assurance can be given that we will be able to maintain these levels of insurance in the future at rates considered commercially reasonable, particularly named windstorm coverage and contingent business interruption coverage for our onshore operations.

Competition

The Partnership faces strong competition in acquiring new natural gas or crude oil supplies. Competition for natural gas and crude oil supplies is primarily based on the location of gathering and processing facilities, pricing arrangements, reputation, efficiency, flexibility, reliability and access to end-use markets or liquid marketing hubs. Competitors to the Partnership&#8217;s gathering and processing operations include other natural gas gatherers and processors, such as major interstate and intrastate pipeline companies, master limited partnerships and oil and gas producers. The Partnership&#8217;s major competitors for natural gas supplies in our current operating regions include Kinder Morgan, WTG Gas Processing, L.P. (&#8220;WTG&#8221;), DCP, Devon Energy Corporation (&#8220;Devon&#8221;), Enbridge Inc., Enlink Midstream Partners, Energy Transfer Partners, L.P., ONEOK, Gulf South Pipeline Company, LP, Hanlon Gas Processing, Ltd., J-W Operating Company, Louisiana Intrastate Gas Company L.L.C. and several other interstate pipeline companies. The Partnership&#8217;s competitors for crude oil gathering services in North Dakota include Crestwood Equity Partners LP, Kinder Morgan, Great Northern Midstream LLC, Caliber Midstream Partners, L.P. and Bridger Pipeline LLC. The Partnership&#8217;s competitors may have greater financial resources than it possesses.

&#160;

The Partnership also competes for NGL products to market through its Logistics and Marketing division. The Partnership&#8217;s competitors include major oil and gas producers who market NGL products for their own account and for others. Additionally, the Partnership competes with several other NGL marketing companies, including EPD, DCP, ONEOK and BP p.l.c.

Additionally, the Partnership faces competition for mixed NGLs supplies at its fractionation facilities. Its competitors include large oil, natural gas and petrochemical companies. The fractionators in which the Partnership owns an interest in the Mont Belvieu region compete for volumes of mixed NGLs with other fractionators also located at Mont Belvieu, Texas. Among the primary competitors are EPD, ONEOK and LoneStar NGL LLC. In addition, certain producers fractionate mixed NGLs for their own account in captive facilities. The Mont Belvieu fractionators also compete on a more limited basis with fractionators in Conway, Kansas and a number of decentralized, smaller fractionation facilities in Texas, Louisiana and New Mexico. The Partnership&#8217;s other fractionation facilities compete for mixed NGLs with the fractionators at Mont Belvieu as well as other fractionation facilities located in Louisiana. The Partnership&#8217;s customers who are significant producers of mixed NGLs and NGL products or consumers of NGL products may develop their own fractionation facilities in lieu of using the Partnerships&#8217; services. Its primary competitor in providing export services to its customers is EPD.

Regulation of Operations

Regulation of pipeline gathering and transportation services, natural gas sales and transportation of NGLs may affect certain aspects of the Partnership&#8217;s business and the market for its products and services.

Regulation of Interstate Natural Gas Pipelines

VGS is regulated by FERC under the Natural Gas Act of 1938 (&#8220;NGA&#8221;), and the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (&#8220;NGPA&#8221;). VGS operates under a FERC-approved, open-access tariff that establishes the rates and the terms and conditions under which the system provides services to its customers. Pursuant to FERC&#8217;s jurisdiction, existing pipeline rates and/or terms and conditions of service may be challenged by customer complaint or by FERC and proposed rate changes or changes in the terms and conditions of service may be challenged by protest. Generally, FERC&#8217;s authority extends to: transportation of natural gas; rates and charges for natural gas transportation; certification and construction of new facilities; extension or abandonment of services and facilities; maintenance of accounts and records; commercial relationships and communications between pipelines and certain affiliates; terms and conditions of service and service contracts with customers; depreciation and amortization policies; and acquisition and disposition of facilities.

VGS holds a certificate of public convenience and necessity issued by FERC permitting the construction, ownership, and operation of its interstate natural gas pipeline facilities and the provision of transportation services. This certificate authorization requires VGS to provide on a nondiscriminatory basis open-access services to all customers who qualify under its FERC gas tariff. FERC has the power to prescribe the accounting treatment of items for regulatory purposes. Thus, the books and records of VGS may be periodically audited by FERC.

The maximum recourse rates that may be charged by VGS for its services are established through FERC&#8217;s ratemaking process. Generally, the maximum filed recourse rates for interstate pipelines are based on the cost of service, including recovery of and a return on the pipeline&#8217;s investment. Key determinants in the ratemaking process are costs of providing service, allowed rate of return and volume throughput and contractual capacity commitment assumptions. VGS is permitted to discount its firm and interruptible rates without further FERC authorization down to the variable cost of performing service, provided they do not &#8220;unduly discriminate.&#8221; The applicable recourse rates and terms and conditions for service are set forth in each pipeline&#8217;s FERC-approved tariff. Rate design and the allocation of costs also can impact a pipeline&#8217;s profitability. On August 31, 2015, VGS filed a revised tariff sheet with FERC, seeking to increase the rates for service on VGS. Several of VGS&#8217;s customers protested the proposed increase, and the ratemaking proceeding remains pending. A hearing before a FERC administrative law judge on the proposed increase is schedule to begin on July 20, 2016.

&#160;

The Partnership also owns (in conjunction with Pioneer) and operates the Driver Residue Pipeline, a gas transmission pipeline extending from the Partnership&#8217;s Driver processing plant in WestTX just over ten miles to points of interconnection with intrastate and interstate natural gas transmission pipelines. The Partnership has obtained a limited jurisdiction certificate of public convenience and necessity under the Natural Gas Act for the Driver Residue Pipeline. In the certificate order, among other things, FERC waived requirements pertaining to the filing of an initial rate for service, the filing of a tariff and compliance with specified accounting and reporting requirements. As such, the Driver Residue Pipeline is not currently subject to conventional rate regulation; to requirements FERC imposes on &#8220;open access&#8221; interstate natural gas pipelines; to the obligation to file and maintain a tariff; or to the obligation to conform to certain business practices and to file certain reports. If, however, the Partnership is unable to receive a bona fide request for firm service on the Driver Residue Pipeline from a third party, FERC would reexamine the waivers it has granted the Partnership and would require the Partnership to file for authorization to offer &#8220;open access&#8221; transportation under its regulations, which would impose additional costs upon the Partnership.

Gathering Pipeline Regulation

The Partnership&#8217;s natural gas gathering operations are typically subject to ratable take and common purchaser statutes in the states in which it operates. The common purchaser statutes generally require gathering pipelines to purchase or take without undue discrimination as to source of supply or producer. These statutes are designed to prohibit discrimination in favor of one producer over another or one source of supply over another. The regulations under these statutes can have the effect of imposing some restrictions on the Partnership&#8217;s ability as an owner of gathering facilities to decide with whom it contracts to gather natural gas. The states in which the Partnership operates have adopted complaint-based regulation of natural gas gathering activities, which allows natural gas producers and shippers to file complaints with state regulators in an effort to resolve grievances relating to gathering access and rate discrimination. The rates the Partnership charges for gathering are deemed just and reasonable unless challenged in a complaint. We cannot predict whether such a complaint will be filed against the Partnership in the future. Failure to comply with state regulations can result in the imposition of administrative, civil and criminal penalties.

Section 1(b) of the NGA exempts natural gas gathering facilities from regulation as a natural gas company by FERC under the NGA. The Partnership believes that the natural gas pipelines in its gathering systems, including the gas gathering systems that are part of the Badlands and of the Pelican and Seahawk gathering systems, meet the traditional tests FERC has used to establish a pipeline&#8217;s status as a gatherer not subject to regulation as a natural gas company. However, to the extent the Partnership&#8217;s gathering systems buy and sell natural gas, such gatherers, in their capacity as buyers and sellers of natural gas, are now subject to Order No. 704. See &#8220;&#8212;Other Federal Laws and Regulations Affecting Our Industry&#8212;FERC Market Transparency Rules.&#8221;

Intrastate Pipeline Regulation

Though the Partnership&#8217;s natural gas intrastate pipelines are not subject to regulation by FERC as natural gas companies under the NGA, the Partnership&#8217;s intrastate pipelines may be subject to certain FERC-imposed reporting requirements depending on the volume of natural gas purchased or sold in a given year. See &#8220;&#8212;Other Federal Laws and Regulations Affecting Our Industry&#8212;FERC Market Transparency Rules.&#8221;

The Partnership&#8217;s intrastate pipelines located in Texas are regulated by the Railroad Commission of Texas (the &#8220;RRC&#8221;). Our Texas intrastate pipeline, Targa Intrastate Pipeline LLC (&#8220;Targa Intrastate&#8221;), owns the intrastate pipeline that transports natural gas from its Shackelford processing plant to an interconnect with Atmos Pipeline-Texas that in turn delivers gas to the West Texas Utilities Company&#8217;s Paint Creek Power Station. Targa Intrastate also owns a 1.65-mile, ten-inch diameter intrastate pipeline that transports natural gas from a third-party gathering system into the Chico system in Denton County, Texas. Targa Intrastate is a gas utility subject to regulation by the RRC and has a tariff on file with such agency. Our other Texas intrastate pipeline, Targa Gas Pipeline LLC, owns a multi-county intrastate pipeline that transports gas in Crane, Ector, Midland, and Upton Counties, Texas, as well as some lines in North Texas. Targa Gas Pipeline LLC is a gas utility subject to regulation by the RRC.

&#160;

The Partnership&#8217;s Louisiana intrastate pipeline, Targa Louisiana Intrastate LLC owns an approximately 60-mile intrastate pipeline system that receives all of the natural gas it transports within or at the boundary of the State of Louisiana. Because all such gas ultimately is consumed within Louisiana, and since the pipeline&#8217;s rates and terms of service are subject to regulation by the Office of Conservation of the Louisiana Department of Natural Resources (&#8220;DNR&#8221;), the pipeline qualifies as a Hinshaw pipeline under Section 1(c) of the NGA and thus is exempt from most FERC regulation.

We have an ownership interest of 50% of the capacity in a 50-mile long intrastate natural gas transmission pipeline, which extends from the tailgate of three natural gas processing plants located near Pettus, Texas to interconnections with existing intrastate and interstate natural gas pipelines near Refugio, Texas. The capacity is held by our subsidiary, TPL SouthTex Transmission Company LP (&#8220;TPL SouthTex Transmission&#8221;), which is entitled to transport natural gas through its capacity on behalf of third parties to both intrastate and interstate markets. Because the jointly owned pipeline system was initially interconnected only with intrastate markets, each of the capacity holders qualified as an &#8220;intrastate pipeline&#8221; within the meaning of the NGPA and therefore are able to provide transportation of natural gas to interstate markets under Section 311 of the NGPA. Under Sections 311 and 601 of the NGPA, an intrastate pipeline may transport natural gas in interstate commerce without becoming subject to FERC regulation as a &#8220;natural-gas company&#8221; under the Natural Gas Act. Transportation of natural gas under authority of Section 311 must be filed with FERC and must be shown to be &#8220;fair and equitable.&#8221; TPL SouthTex Transmission has a Statement of Operating Conditions on file with FERC, and FERC has accepted the rates, which TPL SouthTex Transmission&#8217;s predecessor filed, as being in accordance with the &#8220;fair and equitable&#8221; standard. TPL SouthTex Transmission is required to file, on or before November 6, 2017, a petition for approval of its then-existing rates, or to propose a new rate, applicable to NGPA Section 311 service.

The Partnership also operates natural gas pipelines that extend from some of its processing plants to interconnections with both intrastate and interstate natural gas pipelines. Those facilities, known in the industry as &#8220;plant tailgate&#8221; pipelines, typically operate at transmission pressure levels and may transport &#8220;pipeline quality&#8221; natural gas. Because the Partnership&#8217;s plant tailgate pipelines are relatively short, the Partnership treats them as &#8220;stub&#8221; lines, which are exempt from FERC&#8217;s jurisdiction under the Natural Gas Act. FERC&#8217;s treatment of the &#8220;stub&#8221; line exemption has varied over time, but, absent other factors, FERC generally limits the length of the lines that qualify for the &#8220;stub&#8221; line exemption. To the extent the Partnership&#8217;s plant tailgate pipelines do not qualify for the &#8220;stub&#8221; line exemption, the Partnership will consider whether it needs to obtain FERC authorization to operate its tailgate pipelines or whether they can be reconfigured or otherwise modified to eliminate the possibility that they could be subject to FERC jurisdiction. If the Partnership concludes that FERC authorization is necessary, the Partnership would expect to seek regulatory treatment similar to the treatment FERC has accorded to the Driver Residue Pipeline. The Partnership cannot, however, be assured that FERC would agree to assert only limited jurisdiction. If FERC were to find that it must assert comprehensive jurisdiction, the Partnership&#8217;s operating costs would increase and the Partnership could be subject to enforcement actions under the Domenici-Barton Energy Policy Act of 2005 (&#8220;EP Act of 2005&#8221;).

Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Kansas have adopted complaint-based regulation of intrastate natural gas transportation activities, which allows natural gas producers and shippers to file complaints with state regulators in an effort to resolve grievances relating to pipeline access and rate discrimination. The rates the Partnership charges for intrastate transportation are deemed just and reasonable unless challenged in a complaint. We cannot predict whether such a complaint will be filed against the Partnership in the future. Failure to comply with state regulations can result in the imposition of administrative, civil and criminal penalties.

The Partnership&#8217;s intrastate NGL pipelines in Louisiana gather mixed NGLs streams that the Partnership owns from processing plants in Louisiana and deliver such streams to the Gillis fractionators in Lake Charles, Louisiana, where the mixed NGLs streams are fractionated into various products. The Partnership delivers such refined petroleum products (ethane, propane, butanes and natural gasoline) out of its fractionator to and from Targa-owned storage, to other third-party facilities and to various third-party pipelines in Louisiana. These pipelines are not subject to FERC regulation or rate regulation by the DNR, but are regulated by United States Department of Transportation (&#8220;DOT&#8221;) safety regulations.

The Partnership&#8217;s intrastate pipelines in North Dakota are subject to the various regulations of the State of North Dakota. In addition, various federal agencies within the U.S. Department of the Interior, particularly the Bureau of Land Management, Office of Natural Resources Revenue (formerly the Minerals Management Service) and the Bureau of Indian Affairs, as well as the Three Affiliated Tribes, promulgate and enforce regulations pertaining to operations on the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation. Please see &#8220;-Other State and Local Regulation of Operations&#8221; below.

&#160;

Natural Gas Processing

The Partnership&#8217;s natural gas gathering and processing operations are not presently subject to FERC regulation. However, since May 2009 the Partnership has been required to report to FERC information regarding natural gas sale and purchase transactions for some of its operations depending on the volume of natural gas transacted during the prior calendar year. See &#8220;&#8212;Other Federal Laws and Regulations Affecting Our Industry&#8212;FERC Market Transparency Rules.&#8221; There can be no assurance that the Partnership&#8217;s processing operations will continue to be exempt from other FERC regulation in the future.

Sales of Natural Gas and NGLs

The price at which the Partnership buys and sells natural gas and NGLs is currently not subject to federal rate regulation and, for the most part, is not subject to state regulation. However, with regard to the Partnership&#8217;s physical purchases and sales of these energy commodities and any related hedging activities that the Partnership undertakes, it is required to observe anti-market manipulation laws and related regulations enforced by FERC and/or the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (&#8220;CFTC&#8221;). See &#8220;&#8212;Other Federal Laws and Regulations Affecting Our Industry&#8212;EP Act of 2005&#8221;).&#8221; Since May 2009, the Partnership has been required to report to FERC information regarding natural gas sale and purchase transactions for some of the Partnership&#8217;s operations depending on the volume of natural gas transacted during the prior calendar year. See &#8220;&#8212;Other Federal Laws and Regulations Affecting Our Industry&#8212;FERC Market Transparency Rules.&#8221; Should the Partnership violate the anti-market manipulation laws and regulations, it could also be subject to related third-party damage claims by, among others, market participants, sellers, royalty owners and taxing authorities.

Other State and Local Regulation of Operations

The Partnership&#8217;s business activities are subject to various state and local laws and regulations, as well as orders of regulatory bodies pursuant thereto, governing a wide variety of matters, including marketing, production, pricing, community right-to-know, protection of the environment, safety and other matters. In addition, the Three Affiliated Tribes promulgate and enforce regulations pertaining to operations on the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation, on which the Partnership operates a significant portion of its Badlands gathering and processing assets. The Three Affiliated Tribes is a sovereign nation having the right to enforce certain laws and regulations independent from federal, state and local statutes and regulations. For additional information regarding the potential impact of federal, state, tribal or local regulatory measures on the Partnership&#8217;s business, see &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Risks Related to Our Business.&#8221;

Interstate Common Carrier Liquids Pipeline Regulation

Targa NGL Pipeline Company LLC (&#8220;Targa NGL&#8221;) has interstate NGL pipelines that are considered common carrier pipelines subject to regulation by FERC under the Interstate Commerce Act (the &#8220;ICA&#8221;). More specifically, Targa NGL owns a regulated twelve-inch diameter pipeline that runs between Lake Charles, Louisiana and Mont Belvieu, Texas. This pipeline can move mixed NGLs and purity NGL products. Targa NGL also owns an eight-inch diameter pipeline and a twenty-inch diameter pipeline, each of which run between Mont Belvieu, Texas and Galena Park, Texas. The eight-inch and the twenty-inch pipelines are also regulated and are part of an extensive mixed NGL and purity NGL pipeline receipt and delivery system that provides services to domestic and foreign import and export customers. The ICA requires that we maintain tariffs on file with FERC for each of these pipelines. Those tariffs set forth the rates we charge for providing transportation services as well as the rules and regulations governing these services. The ICA requires, among other things, that rates on interstate common carrier pipelines be &#8220;just and reasonable&#8221; and non-discriminatory. All shippers on these pipelines are the Partnership&#8217;s subsidiaries.

The crude oil pipeline system that is part of the Badlands assets has qualified for a temporary waiver of applicable FERC regulatory requirements under the ICA based on current circumstances. Such waivers are subject to revocation, however, should the pipeline&#8217;s circumstances change. FERC could, either at the request of other entities or on its own initiative, assert that some or all of the transportation on this pipeline system is within its jurisdiction. In the event that FERC were to determine that this pipeline system no longer qualified for waiver, we would likely be required to file a tariff with FERC, provide a cost justification for the transportation charge, and provide service to all potential shippers without undue discrimination. Such a change in the jurisdictional status of transportation on this pipeline could adversely affect the Partnership&#8217;s results of operations.

&#160;

Other Federal Laws and Regulations Affecting Our Industry

EP Act of 2005

The EP Act of 2005 is a comprehensive compilation of tax incentives, authorized appropriations for grants and guaranteed loans, and significant changes to the statutory policy that affects all segments of the energy industry. Among other matters, the EP Act of 2005 amends the NGA to add an anti-market manipulation provision which makes it unlawful for any entity to engage in prohibited behavior to be prescribed by FERC, and furthermore provides FERC with additional civil penalty authority. The EP Act of 2005 provides FERC with the power to assess civil penalties of up to $1 million per day for violations of the NGA and $1 million per violation per day for violations of the NGPA. The civil penalty provisions are applicable to entities that engage in the sale of natural gas for resale in interstate commerce, including VGS. In 2006, FERC issued Order No. 670 to implement the anti-market manipulation provision of the EP Act of 2005. Order No. 670 does not apply to activities that relate only to intrastate or other non-jurisdictional sales or gathering, but does apply to activities of gas pipelines and storage companies that provide interstate services, as well as otherwise non-jurisdictional entities to the extent the activities are conducted &#8220;in connection with&#8221; gas sales, purchases or transportation subject to FERC jurisdiction, which includes the annual reporting requirements under a final rule on the annual natural gas transaction reporting requirements, as amended by subsequent orders on rehearing (Order No. 704), and the quarterly reporting requirement under Order No. 735. The anti-market manipulation rule and enhanced civil penalty authority reflect an expansion of FERC&#8217;s NGA enforcement authority.

FERC Market Transparency Rules

Beginning in 2007, FERC has issued a number of rules intended to provide for greater marketing transparency in the natural gas industry, including Order Nos. 704, 720, and 735. Under Order No. 704, wholesale buyers and sellers of more than 2.2 Bcf of physical natural gas in the previous calendar year, including interstate and intrastate natural gas pipelines, natural gas gatherers, natural gas processors and natural gas marketers, are now required to report, on May 1 of each year, aggregate volumes of natural gas purchased or sold at wholesale in the prior calendar year to the extent such transactions utilize, contribute to, or may contribute to the formation of price indices.

Under Order No. 720, certain non-interstate pipelines delivering, on an annual basis, more than an average of 50 million MMBtu of gas over the previous three calendar years, are required to post on a daily basis certain information regarding the pipeline&#8217;s capacity and scheduled flows for each receipt and delivery point that has a design capacity equal to or greater than 15,000 MMBtu/d and interstate pipelines are required to post information regarding the provision of no-notice service. In October 2011, Order No. 720 as clarified was vacated by the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. We take the position that, at this time, all of the Partnership&#8217;s entities are exempt from Order No. 720 as currently effective.

Under Order No. 735, intrastate pipelines providing transportation services under Section 311 of the NGPA and &#8220;Hinshaw&#8221; pipelines operating under Section 1(c) of the NGA are required to report on a quarterly basis more detailed transportation and storage transaction information, including: rates charged by the pipeline under each contract; receipt and delivery points and zones or segments covered by each contract; the quantity of natural gas the shipper is entitled to transport, store, or deliver; the duration of the contract; and whether there is an affiliate relationship between the pipeline and the shipper. Order No. 735 also extends FERC&#8217;s periodic review of the rates charged by the subject pipelines from three years to five years. On rehearing, FERC reaffirmed Order No. 735 with some modifications. As currently written, this rule does not apply to the Partnership&#8217;s Hinshaw pipelines.

Additional proposals and proceedings that might affect the natural gas industry are pending before Congress, FERC and the courts. We cannot predict the ultimate impact of these or the above regulatory changes to the Partnership&#8217;s natural gas operations. We do not believe that the Partnership would be affected by any such FERC action materially differently than other midstream natural gas companies with whom it competes.

&#160;

Environmental and Operational Health and Safety Matters

General

The Partnership&#8217;s operations are subject to stringent federal, tribal, state and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment, worker health and safety, or otherwise relating to environmental protection. As with the industry generally, compliance with current and anticipated environmental laws and regulations increases the Partnership&#8217;s overall cost of business, including its capital costs to construct, maintain and upgrade equipment and facilities. The Partnership has implemented programs and policies designed to keep its pipelines, plants and other facilities in compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations. The recent trend in environmental regulation is to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment and thus, any changes in environmental laws and regulations or reinterpretation of enforcement policies that result in more stringent and costly waste management or disposal, pollution control or remediation requirements could have a material adverse effect on the Partnership&#8217;s operations and financial position. The Partnership may be unable to pass on such increased compliance costs to our customers. See Risk Factor &#8220;Failure to comply with environmental laws or regulations or an accidental release into the environment may cause us to incur significant costs and liabilities&#8221; under Item 1A of this Form 10-K for further discussion on environmental compliance matters. See &#8220;Item 3. Legal Proceedings &#8211; Environmental Proceedings&#8221; for a discussion of certain recent or pending proceedings related to environmental matters.

&#160;

Historically, the Partnership&#8217;s environmental compliance costs have not had a material adverse effect on its results of operations; however, there can be no assurance that such costs will not become material in the future. The following is a summary of the more significant existing environmental and worker health and safety laws and regulations, as amended from time to time, to which our business operations are subject and for which compliance may have a material adverse impact on our capital expenditures, results of operations or financial position.

Hazardous Substances and Waste

The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (&#8220;CERCLA&#8221;), and comparable state laws impose joint and several, strict liability on certain classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a &#8220;hazardous substance&#8221; into the environment. These persons include current and prior owners or operators of the site where the release occurred and entities that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances found at the site. Liability of these &#8220;responsible persons&#8221; under CERCLA may include the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. CERCLA also authorizes the Environmental Protection Agency (&#8220;EPA&#8221;) and, in some instances, third-parties to act in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover from these responsible persons the costs they incur. It is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third-parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances or other pollutants into the environment. The Partnership generates materials in the course of its operations that are regulated as &#8220;hazardous substances&#8221; under CERCLA or similar state statutes and, as a result, may be jointly and severally liable under CERCLA or such statutes for all or part of the costs required to clean up releases of hazardous substance into the environment.

The Partnership also generates solid wastes, including hazardous wastes that are subject to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (&#8220;RCRA&#8221;) and comparable state statutes. While RCRA regulates both solid and hazardous wastes, it imposes strict requirements on the generation, storage, treatment, transportation and disposal of hazardous wastes. In the course of its operations, the Partnership generates petroleum product wastes and ordinary industrial wastes such as paint wastes, waste solvents and waste compressor oils that are regulated as hazardous wastes. Although certain materials generated in the exploration, development or production of crude oil and natural gas are excluded from RCRA&#8217;s hazardous waste regulations, it is possible that future changes in law or regulation could result in these wastes, including wastes currently generated during its operations, being designated as &#8220;hazardous wastes&#8221; and therefore subject to more rigorous and costly disposal requirements, which could have a material adverse effect on the Partnership&#8217;s capital expenditures and operating expenses.

The Partnership currently owns or leases, and has in the past owned or leased, properties that for many years have been used for midstream natural gas and NGL activities and refined petroleum product and crude oil storage and terminaling activities. Hydrocarbons or other substances and wastes may have been released on or under the properties owned or leased by the Partnership or on or under the other locations where these hydrocarbons or other substances and wastes have been taken for treatment or disposal. In addition, certain of these properties have been operated by third parties whose treatment and release of hydrocarbons or other substances and wastes was not under the Partnership&#8217;s control. These properties and any hydrocarbons, substances and wastes released thereon may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws. Under these laws, the Partnership could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes (including wastes released by prior owners or operators), to clean up contaminated property (including contaminated groundwater) and to perform remedial operations to prevent future contamination.

&#160;

Air Emissions

The federal Clean Air Act and comparable state laws and regulations restrict the emission of air pollutants from many sources, including processing plants and compressor stations and also impose various monitoring and reporting requirements. These laws and regulations may require the Partnership to obtain pre-approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce or significantly increase air emissions, obtain and strictly comply with stringent air permit requirements or utilize specific equipment or technologies to control emissions. The need to obtain permits has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas related projects. Over the next several years, the Partnership may be required to incur certain capital expenditures for air pollution control equipment or other air emissions related issues. For example, in October 2015, the EPA issued a final rule under the Clean Air Act, lowering the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (&#8220;NAAQS&#8221;) for ground-level ozone to 70 parts per billion under both the primary and secondary standards to provide requisite protection of public health and welfare, respectively. The final rule became effective on December 28, 2015, and EPA is expected to make final geographical attainment designations by late 2017. Such reclassification may make it more difficult to construct new or modified sources of air pollution in newly designated non-attainment areas. Also, states are expected to implement more stringent regulations, which could apply to our operations. Additionally, on August 18, 2015, the EPA proposed four new rules related to air emissions from the oil and gas industry, including (1) New Source Performance Standards for emissions of methane and VOCs from new and modified oil and natural gas production and natural gas gathering, processing, and transmission facilities; (2) suggested control technique guidelines for existing oil and gas sources for states to consider adopting in certain ozone non-attainment areas; (3) a rule intended to more clearly define, and possibly expand, the definition of a &#8220;source&#8221; for purposes of determining applicability of air emissions permitting for oil and gas sources; and (4) a Federal Implementation Plan to govern minor new source review air emissions permitting for oil and gas sources on certain Indian Reservations, including the Forth Berthold Indian Reservation in North Dakota. Compliance with these or other new regulations could, among other things, require installation of new emission controls on some of the Partnership&#8217;s equipment, result in longer permitting timelines, and significantly increase the Partnership&#8217;s capital expenditures and operating costs, which could adversely impact on the Partnership&#8217;s business.

Climate Change

The EPA has determined that greenhouse gas (&#8220;GHG&#8221;) emissions endanger public health and the environment because emissions of such gases are contributing to warming of the earth&#8217;s atmosphere and other climatic changes. Based on these findings, the EPA has adopted regulations under the Clean Air Act related to GHG emissions. See Risk Factor &#8220;The adoption of climate change legislation and regulations restricting emissions of GHGs could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the products and services we provide&#8221; under Item 1A of this Form 10-K for further discussion on climate change and regulation of GHG emissions.

Water Discharges

The Federal Water Pollution Control Act (&#8220;Clean Water Act&#8221; or &#8220;CWA&#8221;) and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into navigable waters. Pursuant to the CWA and analogous state laws, permits must be obtained to discharge pollutants into state waters or waters of the United States. Any such discharge of pollutants into regulated waters must be performed in accordance with the terms of the permit issued by the EPA or the analogous state agency. Spill prevention, control and countermeasure requirements under federal law require appropriate containment berms and similar structures to help prevent the contamination of navigable waters in the event of a petroleum hydrocarbon tank spill, rupture or leak. In addition, the CWA and analogous state laws require individual permits or coverage under general permits for discharges of storm water runoff from certain types of facilities and such permits may require us to monitor and sample the storm water runoff. The CWA also prohibits the discharge of dredge and fill material in regulated waters, including wetlands, unless authorized by permit. The CWA and analogous state laws also may impose substantial civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance including spills and other non-authorized discharges.

In May 2015, the EPA released a final rule that attempted to clarify the meaning of the definition of &#8220;waters of the United States&#8221; under the CWA but several judicial challenges to this rule have been initiated, with plaintiffs&#8217; generally objecting to the perceived broadening of the definition of waters of the United States under a rule that allegedly did not comply with appropriate procedural requirements. On August 27, 2015, one day prior to the rule going into effect, a federal district judge in North Dakota enjoined implementation of the rule in 13 states, and, on October 9, 2015 the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals stayed the rule nationwide, as there are currently cases in more than a dozen district courts as well as the Sixth Circuit that may affect the rule and its implementation. Any expansion to CWA jurisdiction in areas where the Partnership or its customers operate could impose additional permitting obligations on the Partnership or its customers.

&#160;

The Federal Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (&#8220;OPA&#8221;) which amends the CWA, establishes strict liability for owners and operators of facilities that are the site of a release of oil into waters of the United States. The OPA and its associated regulations impose a variety of requirements on responsible parties related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages resulting from such spills. A &#8220;responsible party&#8221; under the OPA includes owners and operators of onshore facilities, such as our plants and our pipelines. Under the OPA, owners and operators of facilities that handle, store, or transport oil are required to develop and implement oil spill response plans, and establish and maintain evidence of financial responsibility sufficient to cover liabilities related to an oil spill for which such parties could be statutorily responsible.

&#160;

Hydraulic Fracturing

Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand and chemical additives under pressure into rock formations to stimulate gas production. The process is typically regulated by state oil and gas commissions, but several federal agencies have asserted regulatory authority over aspects of the process, including the EPA &#160; and the federal Bureau of Land Management (&#8220;BLM&#8221;). In addition, Congress has from time to time considered the adoption of legislation to federally regulate hydraulic fracturing. At the state level, a growing number of states have adopted or are considering adopting legal requirements that could impose more stringent permitting, disclosure or well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities, and states could elect to prohibit hydraulic fracturing altogether. In addition, local governments may seek to adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time, place and manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular. Further, several federal governmental agencies are conducting reviews and studies on the environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing activities, including the White House Council on Environmental Quality and the EPA, which released a draft report for public and Scientific Advisory Board review in June 2015. These studies, depending on their degree of pursuit and any meaningful results obtained, could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing. While the Partnership does not conduct hydraulic fracturing, if new or more stringent federal, state, or local legal restrictions or prohibitions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where the Partnership&#8217;s oil and natural gas exploration and production customers operate, those customers could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements and experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development or production activities, which could reduce demand for the Partnership&#8217;s gathering, processing and fractionation services. See Risk Factor &#8220;Increased regulation of hydraulic fracturing could result in reductions or delays in drilling and completing new oil and natural gas wells, which could adversely impact our revenues by decreasing the volumes of natural gas, NGLs or crude oil through our facilities and reducing the utilization of our assets&#8221; under Item 1A of this Form 10-K for further discussion on hydraulic fracturing.

Endangered Species Act Considerations

The federal Endangered Species Act (&#8220;ESA&#8221;) restricts activities that may affect endangered or threatened species or their habitats. Some of the Partnership&#8217;s facilities may be located in areas that are designated as habitat for endangered or threatened species. If endangered species are located in areas of the underlying properties where we wish to conduct development activities, such work could be prohibited or delayed or expensive mitigation may be required. Moreover, as a result of a settlement approved by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in September 2011, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (&#8220;FWS&#8221;) is required to make a determination on the listing of numerous species as endangered or threatened under the ESA before the completion of the agency&#8217;s 2017 fiscal year. The designation of previously unprotected species as threatened or endangered in areas where we or our oil and natural gas exploration and production customers operate could cause us or our customers to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures and could result in delays or limitations in our customers&#8217; performance of operations, which could reduce demand for our midstream services.

&#160;

Employee Health and Safety

We are subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations, including the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act (&#8220;OSHA&#8221;) and comparable state statutes, whose purpose is to protect the health and safety of workers, both generally and within the pipeline industry. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standard, the EPA community right-to-know regulations under Title III of the Federal Superfund Amendment and Reauthorization Act and comparable state statutes require that information be maintained concerning hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens. We and the entities in which we own an interest are also subject to OSHA Process Safety Management regulations, which are designed to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable or explosive chemicals. The regulations apply to any process that (1) involves a listed chemical in a quantity at or above the threshold quantity specified in the regulation for that chemical, or (2) involves certain flammable gases or flammable liquids present on site in one location in a quantity of 10,000 pounds or more. Flammable liquids stored in atmospheric tanks below their normal boiling point without the benefit of chilling or refrigeration are exempt. We have an internal program of inspection designed to monitor and enforce compliance with worker safety requirements.

Pipeline Safety

Many of the Partnership&#8217;s natural gas, NGL and crude pipelines are subject to regulation by the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (&#8220;PHMSA&#8221;) of the DOT (or state analogs) under the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968 (&#8220;NGPSA&#8221;) with respect to natural gas, and the Hazardous Liquids Pipeline Safety Act of 1979 (&#8220;HLPSA&#8221;) with respect to crude oil, NGLs and condensates. Both the NGPSA and the HLPSA were amended by the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002 (&#8220;PSI Act&#8221;) and the Pipeline Inspection, Protection, Enforcement, and Safety Act of 2006 (&#8220;PIPES Act&#8221;). The NGPSA and HLPSA govern the design, installation, testing, construction, operation, replacement and management of natural gas, crude oil, NGL and condensate pipeline facilities. Pursuant to these acts, PHMSA has promulgated regulations governing, among other things, pipeline wall thicknesses, design pressures, maximum operating pressures, pipeline patrols and leak surveys, minimum depth requirements, and emergency procedures, as well as other matters intended to ensure adequate protection for the public and to prevent accidents and failures. Additionally, PHMSA has promulgated regulations requiring pipeline operators to develop and implement integrity management programs for certain gas and hazardous liquids pipelines that, in the event of a pipeline leak or rupture, could affect &#8220;high consequence areas,&#8221; which are areas where a release could have the most significant adverse consequences, including high-population areas, certain drinking water sources and unusually sensitive ecological areas. The Partnership&#8217;s past compliance with the NGPSA and HLPSA has not had a material adverse effect on its results of operations; however, future compliance with these pipeline safety laws could result in increased costs.

These pipeline safety laws were amended by the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act of 2011 (&#8220;2011 Pipeline Safety Act&#8221;), which requires increased safety measures for gas and hazardous liquids transportation pipelines. Among other things, the 2011 Pipeline Safety Act directs the Secretary of Transportation to promulgate regulations relating to expanded integrity management requirements, automatic or remote-controlled valve use, excess flow valve use, leak detection system installation, testing to confirm the material strength of certain pipelines, and operator verification of records confirming the maximum allowable pressure of certain intrastate gas transmission pipelines. The 2011 Pipeline Safety Act also increases the maximum penalty for violation of pipeline safety regulations from $100,000 to $200,000 per violation per day of violation and also from $1 million to $2 million for a related series of violations. The safety enhancement requirements and other provisions of the 2011 Pipeline Safety Act as well as any implementation of PHMSA regulations thereunder or any issuance or reinterpretation of PHMSA guidance with respect thereto could require us to install new or modified safety controls, pursue additional capital projects or conduct maintenance programs on an accelerated basis, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Partnership&#8217;s results of operations or financial position.

In addition, states have adopted regulations, similar to existing PHMSA regulations, for intrastate gathering and transmission lines. Texas, Louisiana and New Mexico, for example, have developed regulatory programs that parallel the federal regulatory scheme and are applicable to intrastate pipelines transporting natural gas and NGLs. North Dakota has similarly implemented regulatory programs applicable to intrastate natural gas pipelines. The Partnership currently estimates an annual average cost of $5.0 million for the years 2016 through 2018 to perform necessary integrity management program testing on its pipelines required by existing PHMSA and state regulations. This estimate does not include the costs, if any, of any repair, remediation, or preventative or mitigating actions that may be determined to be necessary as a result of the testing program, which costs could be substantial. However, we do not expect that any such costs would be material to the Partnership&#8217;s financial condition or results of operations.

&#160;

The Partnership, or the entities in which it owns an interest, inspects its pipelines regularly in compliance with state and federal maintenance requirements. Nonetheless, the adoption of new or amended regulations by PHMSA or the states that result in more stringent or costly pipeline integrity management or safety standards could have a significant adverse effect on us and similarly situated midstream operators. For example, federal construction, maintenance and inspection standards that apply to pipelines in relatively populated areas generally do not apply to gathering lines running through rural regions. In recent years, the PHSMA has considered changes to this &#8220;rural gathering exemption, including publishing an advance notice of proposed rulemaking in 2011, in which the agency sought public comment on possible changes to the definition of &#8220;high consequence areas&#8221; and &#8220;gathering lines&#8221; and the strengthening of pipeline integrity management requirements. More recently, in response to an August 2014 report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office, the PHMSA stated that it is developing revisions to its pipeline safety regulations, including consideration of the need to adopt safety requirements for gas gathering pipelines that are not currently subject to regulation. In the absence of the PHMSA pursuing any legal requirements, state agencies, to the extent authorized, may pursue state standards, including standards for rural gathering lines. For example, in 2013 the Texas Legislature authorized the Texas Railroad Commission to adopt and implement safety standards applicable to the intrastate transportation of hazardous liquids and natural gas in rural locations by gathering pipeline. See Risk Factor &#8220;Federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to pipeline safety that require the use of new or more stringent safety controls or result in more stringent enforcement of applicable legal requirements could subject the Partnership to increased capital costs, operational delays and costs of operation&#8221; under Item 1A of this Form 10-K for further discussion on pipeline safety standards.

Title to Properties and Rights-of-Way

The Partnership&#8217;s real property falls into two categories: (1) parcels that it owns in fee and (2) parcels in which its interest derives from leases, easements, rights-of-way, permits or licenses from landowners or governmental authorities permitting the use of such land for its operations. Portions of the land on which the Partnership&#8217;s plants and other major facilities are located are owned by the Partnership in fee title and we believe that the Partnership has satisfactory title to these lands. The remainder of the land on which the Partnership plant sites and major facilities are located is held by the Partnership pursuant to ground leases between the Partnership, as lessee, and the fee owner of the lands, as lessors. The Partnership and its predecessors have leased these lands for many years without any material challenge known to the Partnership relating to the title to the land upon which the assets are located, and we believe that the Partnership has satisfactory leasehold estates to such lands. We have no knowledge of any challenge to the underlying fee title of any material lease, easement, right-of-way, permit, lease or license; and we believe that the Partnership has satisfactory title to all of its material leases, easements, rights-of-way, permits, leases and licenses.

Employees

Through a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours, we employ approximately 1,870 people who primarily support the Partnership&#8217;s operations. None of those employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. We consider our employee relations to be good.
