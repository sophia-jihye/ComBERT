Overview 

Haynes International, Inc. (&#8220;Haynes&#8221; or &#8220;the Company&#8221;) is one of the world&#8217;s largest producers of high&#8209;performance nickel&#8209; and cobalt&#8209;based alloys in flat product form such as sheet, coil and plate forms. The Company is focused on developing, manufacturing, marketing and distributing technologically advanced, high&#8209;performance alloys, which are sold primarily in the aerospace, chemical processing and industrial gas turbine industries. The Company&#8217;s products consist of high&#8209;temperature resistant alloys, or HTA products, and corrosion&#8209;resistant alloys, or CRA products. HTA products are used by manufacturers of equipment that is subjected to extremely high temperatures, such as jet engines for the aerospace market, gas turbine engines used for power generation and waste incineration, and industrial heating equipment. CRA products are used in applications that require resistance to very corrosive media found in chemical processing, power plant emissions control and hazardous waste treatment. Management believes Haynes is one of the principal producers of high&#8209;performance alloy flat products in sheet, coil and plate forms, and sales of these forms, in the aggregate, represented approximately 62% of net product revenues in fiscal 2016. The Company also produces its products as seamless and welded tubulars, and in slab, bar, billet and wire forms. 

The Company has manufacturing facilities in Kokomo, Indiana; Arcadia, Louisiana; and Mountain Home, North Carolina. The Kokomo facility specializes in flat products, the Arcadia facility specializes in tubular products, and the Mountain Home facility specializes in wire products. The Company&#8217;s products are sold primarily through its direct sales organization, which includes 13 service and/or sales centers in the United States, Europe and Asia. All of these centers are Company&#8209;operated. During fiscal 2016, the Company closed its sales office in India and converted to an agency arrangement for sales into India. In fiscal 2016, approximately 79% of the Company&#8217;s net revenue was generated by its direct sales organization, and the remaining 21% was generated by a network of independent distributors and sales agents that supplement its direct sales efforts primarily in the United States, Europe and Asia, some of whom have been associated with the Company for over 30 years.

Business Strategy 

The Company&#8217;s goal is to grow its business by increasing revenues, profitability and cash flow while continuing to be its customers&#8217; provider of choice for high&#8209;performance alloys. The Company pursues this goal by analyzing capital allocation alternatives while simultaneously taking advantage of its expert technical abilities in delivering innovative products and applications combined with its niche manufacturing and value-added service capabilities to penetrate end markets. 

&#183; 

Increase revenues by inventing new alloys, developing new applications for existing alloys and expanding into new markets. The Company believes that it is the industry leader in developing new alloys designed to meet its customers&#8217; specialized and demanding requirements. The Company continues to work closely with customers and end users of its products to identify, develop, manufacture and test new high&#8209;performance alloys. Since fiscal 2003, the Company&#8217;s technical programs have yielded eight new proprietary alloys, an accomplishment that the Company believes distinguishes it from its competitors. The Company expects continued emphasis on product innovation to yield similar future results. 

&#160;

Developing new applications for existing alloys is also a key strength and strategy of the Company. The Company leverages its technical expertise to find unique applications for its products especially proprietary and specialty alloys that can yield higher margins. 

Developing additional markets is a key strategy of the Company. Through development of new alloys and new applications for existing alloys, the Company is seeking to develop additional markets which will generate new revenue streams beyond the core markets of aerospace, chemical processing and industrial gas turbine industries. The Company believes that synthetic natural gas, renewable energy (such as solar), fuel cells, clean-coal, waste-to-energy, oil and gas, flue&#8209;gas desulfurization in China, automotive, consumer electronics, heat treatment, medical and nuclear industries all present opportunities for its products. 

&#183; 

Increase revenues by providing value&#8209;added processing services and leveraging our global distribution network. The Company believes that its network of service and sales centers throughout North America, Europe and Asia distinguishes it from its competitors, many of whom operate only mills. The Company&#8217;s service and sales centers enable it to develop close customer relationships through direct interaction with customers and to respond to customer orders quickly, while providing value&#8209;added cutting services such as laser, plasma and water jet cutting. These services allow the Company&#8217;s customers to minimize their processing costs and outsource non&#8209;core activities. In addition, the Company&#8217;s rapid response time and enhanced processing services for products shipped from its service and sales centers offers the opportunity for the Company to service its customers more timely. 

&#183; 

Capitalize on strategic equipment investment and optimize our processes with lean manufacturing improvements. The Company expects to continue to improve operations through ongoing capital investment in manufacturing facilities and equipment including information technology and utilizing six sigma and lean manufacturing process improvements. Ongoing investment in equipment has significantly improved the Company&#8217;s operations by increasing capacity, reducing unplanned downtime and manufacturing costs, and improving product quality and working capital management. Management believes that the Company&#8217;s capital investments will enable it to continue to satisfy long&#8209;term customer demand for value&#8209;added products that meet increasingly precise specifications. For additional discussion of capital spending, see &#8220;Summary of Capital Spending&#8221; in Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, contained elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10&#8209;K. 

&#183; 

Expand product capability through strategic acquisitions and alliances. The Company will continue to examine opportunities that enable it to offer customers an enhanced and more competitive product line to complement its core flat products. These opportunities may include product line enhancement and market expansion opportunities. The Company will also continue to evaluate strategic relationships with third parties in the industry in order to enhance its competitive position and relationships with customers. 

&#183; 

Continue to expand the maintenance, repair and overhaul business. The Company believes that its maintenance, repair and overhaul, or MRO, business serves a growing market and represents both an expanding and recurring revenue stream. Products used in the Company&#8217;s end markets require periodic replacement due to the extreme environments in which they are used, which drives demand for recurring MRO work. The Company intends to continue to leverage the capabilities of its service and sales centers to respond quickly to its customers&#8217; time&#8209;sensitive MRO needs to develop new and retain existing business opportunities. 

Company History 

The Company was founded in 1912 as Haynes Stellite Works by American inventor and entrepreneur Elwood Haynes in Kokomo, Indiana. Since its founding, the Company has continuously conducted its main operations in Kokomo, Indiana. The Company was owned for much of its history by corporate parents, including Union Carbide and Cabot Corporation, until purchased in 1989 and then again in 1997 by private equity firms. The debt incurred in the last leveraged buy&#8209;out ultimately forced the Company into bankruptcy in March 2004, from which it emerged five months later in August 2004. 

&#160;

The Company began operations for its tubular facility in Arcadia, Louisiana over 30 years ago. This facility and the Company&#8217;s tubular product business have grown with additional investment over time. The Company operates service centers in the U.S. that include value-added operations with laser, water-jet and plasma cutting. In addition the Company has expanded globally with service center locations in the United Kingdom, Switzerland, China and other sales offices in France, Japan, Singapore and Italy. The Company also acquired a stainless steel and high&#8209;temperature alloy wire company located in Mountain Home, North Carolina in 2005. The Company primarily produces high&#8209;performance alloy wire at that facility. Most recently, in January 2015, the Company acquired assets in LaPorte, Indiana enabling coil stretching, leveling, slitting and cut-to-length operations. The Laporte operation also includes a toll processing business. 

In March 2007, the Company completed a public equity offering, and simultaneously the Company listed its common stock on the NASDAQ Global Market. The Company began paying a dividend in fiscal 2010 and raised the dividend at the beginning of fiscal 2012. 

Products 

The global specialty alloy market consists of three primary sectors: stainless steel, general purpose nickel alloys and high&#8209;performance nickel&#8209; and cobalt&#8209;based alloys. The Company believes that the high&#8209;performance alloy sector represents less than 10% of the total alloy market. The Company competes primarily in the high&#8209;performance nickel&#8209; and cobalt&#8209;based alloy sectors, which includes HTA products and CRA products. In fiscal 2014, 2015 and 2016, HTA products accounted for approximately 75%, 76% and 81% of the Company&#8217;s net revenues, respectively; and sales of the Company&#8217;s CRA products accounted for approximately 25%, 24% and 19% of the Company&#8217;s net revenues, respectively. These percentages are based on data which include revenue associated with sales by the Company to its foreign subsidiaries, but exclude revenue associated with sales by foreign subsidiaries to their customers. Management believes, however, that the effect of including revenue data associated with sales by its foreign subsidiaries would not materially change the percentages presented in this section. 

&#160;

High&#8209;temperature Resistant Alloys. HTA products are used primarily in manufacturing components for the hot sections of gas turbine engines. Stringent safety and performance standards in the aerospace industry result in development lead times typically as long as eight to ten years in the introduction of new aerospace&#8209;related market applications for HTA products. However, once a particular new alloy is shown to possess the properties required for a specific application in the aerospace market, it tends to remain in use for extended periods. HTA products are also used in gas turbine engines produced for use in applications such as naval and commercial vessels, electric power generation, power sources for offshore drilling platforms, gas pipeline booster stations and emergency standby power generators. The following table sets forth information with respect to the Company&#8217;s significant high&#8209;temperature resistant alloys, applications and features (new HTA development is discussed below under &#8220;Patents and Trademarks&#8221;):

Patents and Trademarks 

The Company currently maintains a total of approximately 23 published U.S. patents and applications and approximately 223 foreign counterpart patents and applications targeted at countries with significant or potential markets for the patented products and continues to develop, manufacture and test high&#8209;performance nickel&#8209; and cobalt&#8209;based alloys. Since fiscal 2003, the Company&#8217;s technical programs have yielded eight new proprietary alloys, five of which are currently commercially available and three of which are being scaled&#8209;up to be brought to market. The alloys being commercialized saw significant further advancement in the process during fiscal 2015 and 2016. HAYNES 282 alloy, which management believes will have significant commercial potential for the Company in the long term, is the subject of a U.S. patent issued in 2011. HAYNES 282 alloy has excellent formability, fabricability and forgeability. The commercial launch of HAYNES 282 alloy occurred in October 2005 and, since that time, there have been a significant number of customer tests and evaluations of this product for the hot sections of gas turbines in the aerospace and industrial gas turbine markets, as well as for automotive and other high&#8209;temperature applications. The alloy has already been specified into major aerospace and industrial gas turbine components. The Company will continue to actively promote HAYNES 282 alloy through customer engineering visits and technical presentations and papers. Another new alloy for use in the aerospace and industrial gas turbine markets is HAYNES 244&#8482; alloy (U.S. patent filed in 2012 and granted in 2013). It combines high strength to 1400 degrees Fahrenheit with a low coefficient of thermal expansion. Commercialization is ongoing for this alloy, and it has recently been specified into a major aerospace component. 

In the chemical processing industry, customers have found extensive applications for HASTELLOY G&#8209;35 alloy particularly in wet phosphoric acid production. Management expects demand for this alloy will continue to grow. Commercialization of HASTELLOY C&#8209;22HS alloy has also continued, and the alloy has already found applications in the 

&#160;

oil and gas industry. Testing, evaluation and promotion of this alloy is ongoing with special emphasis on applications for this industry. The Company believes that its alloys (particularly HAYNES 282 alloy) are being commercialized rapidly when compared to historical trends for other proprietary alloys introduced by the Company. In addition to HAYNES 282 alloy, HAYNES 244, HASTELLOY G&#8209;35 alloy and HASTELLOY C&#8209;22HS alloy, commercialization is also ongoing for HASTELLOY HYBRID&#8209;BC1 &#174; alloy. This alloy is a CRA product with potential applications in the chemical processing industry that has demonstrated resistance to hydrochloric and sulfuric acid. 

In addition to the commercialization of the above alloys, the Company continues to develop applications for new alloys not yet ready to begin the commercialization process. Two new high&#8209;temperature alloys, HAYNES NS&#8209;163 &#174; alloy (U.S. patent granted in 2011) and HAYNES HR&#8209;224 &#174; alloy (U.S. patent application filed in 2008 and granted in 2013), are in the scale&#8209;up phase. Both of these new materials are believed to have significant, medium to long&#8209;term commercial potential. HAYNES NS&#8209;163 alloy is a new alloy with extraordinary high&#8209;temperature strength in sheet form, which has applications in the aerospace, industrial gas turbine and automotive markets. Data generation and fabrication trials continued through 2016, with test marketing initiated in early 2009. HAYNES HR&#8209;224 alloy is an HTA product with superior resistance to oxidation. Most recently, HAYNES HR&#8209;235 TM was introduced in fiscal 2013. This alloy has excellent resistance to metal dusting in carbonaceous high temperature environments. Potential uses include applications in petrochemical production and syngas plants. Scale-up of this alloy is well underway and material is currently being evaluated by certain key customers. 

Patents or other proprietary rights are an important element of the Company&#8217;s business. The Company&#8217;s strategy is to file patent applications in the U.S. and any other country that represents an important potential commercial market to the Company. In addition, the Company seeks to protect technology that is important to the development of the Company&#8217;s business. The Company also relies upon trade secret rights to protect its technologies and its development of new applications and alloys. The Company protects its trade secrets in part through confidentiality and proprietary information agreements with its customers. Trademarks on the names of many of the Company&#8217;s alloys have also been applied for or granted in the U.S. and certain foreign countries. 

While the Company believes its patents are important to its competitive position, significant barriers to entry continue to exist beyond the expiration of any patent period. These barriers to entry include the unique equipment required to produce this material and the exacting process required to achieve the desired metallurgical properties. These processing requirements include such items as specific annealing temperature, processing speeds and reduction per rolling pass. Management believes that the current alloy development program and these barriers to entry reduce the impact of patent expirations on the Company. 

End Markets 

The global specialty alloy market consists of stainless steels, general purpose nickel alloys and high&#8209;performance nickel&#8209; and cobalt&#8209;based alloys. Of this total market, the Company primarily competes in the high&#8209;performance nickel&#8209; and cobalt&#8209;based alloy sector, which demands diverse specialty alloys suitable for use in precision manufacturing. Given the technologically advanced nature of the products, strict requirements of the end users and higher&#8209;growth end markets, the Company believes the high&#8209;performance alloy sector provides greater growth potential, higher profit margins and greater opportunities for service, product and price differentiation as compared to the stainless steels and general purpose nickel alloys markets. While stainless steel and general purpose nickel alloys are generally sold in bulk through third&#8209;party distributors, the Company&#8217;s products are sold in smaller&#8209;sized orders which are customized and typically handled on a direct&#8209;to&#8209;customer basis. 

Aerospace. The Company has manufactured HTA products for the aerospace market since the late 1930s and has developed numerous proprietary alloys for this market. Customers in the aerospace market tend to be the most demanding with respect to meeting specifications within very precise tolerances and achieving new product performance standards. Stringent safety standards and continuous efforts to reduce equipment weight and develop more fuel-efficient designs require close coordination between the Company and its customers in the selection and development of HTA products. As a result, sales to aerospace customers tend to be made through the Company&#8217;s direct sales force. Demand for the Company&#8217;s products in the aerospace market is based on the new and replacement market for jet engines and the maintenance needs of operators of commercial and military aircraft. The Company specializes in the static parts included 

&#160;

in the hot sections of the jet engine. The hot sections are subjected to substantial wear and tear and accordingly require periodic maintenance, repair and overhaul. The Company views the maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) business as an area of continuing long&#8209;term growth. 

Chemical Processing. The chemical processing market represents a large base of customers with diverse CRA applications driven by demand for key end-use markets such as automobiles, housing, health care, agriculture and metals production. CRA products supplied by the Company have been used in the chemical processing market since the early 1930s. Demand for the Company&#8217;s products in this market is driven by the level of MRO and expansion requirements of existing chemical processing facilities, as well as the construction of new facilities. The expansion of manufacturing of natural gas liquids in North America is expected to be a driver of demand in this market. In addition, the Company believes the extensive worldwide network of Company&#8209;owned service and sales centers, as well as its network of independent distributors and sales agents who supplement the Company&#8217;s direct sales efforts outside of the U.S., provide a competitive advantage in marketing its CRA products in the chemical processing market. 

Industrial gas turbine (formerly referred to as Land-based gas turbines). Demand for the Company&#8217;s products in the industrial gas turbines market is driven by the construction of cogeneration facilities such as base load for electric utilities or as backup sources to fossil fuel&#8209;fired utilities during times of peak demand. Demand for the Company&#8217;s alloys in the industrial gas turbine markets has also been driven by concerns regarding lowering emissions from generating facilities powered by fossil fuels. Industrial gas turbine generating facilities have gained acceptance as clean, low&#8209;cost alternatives to fossil fuel&#8209;fired electric generating facilities. Industrial gas turbines are also used in power barges with mobility and as temporary base&#8209;load&#8209;generating units for countries that have numerous islands and a large coastline. Demand is also generated by mechanical drive units used for oil and gas production and pipeline transportation, as well as microturbines that are used as back up sources of power generation for hospitals and shopping malls. 

Other Markets. Other markets in which the Company sells its HTA products and CRA products include flue&#8209;gas desulfurization (FGD), oil and gas, waste incineration, industrial heat treating, automotive, instrumentation, biopharmaceuticals, solar and nuclear fuel. The FGD market has been driven by both legislated and self&#8209;imposed standards for lowering emissions from fossil fuel&#8209;fired electric generating facilities. This market is expected to soften in the U.S. if the trend to switch from coal to natural gas for power plants continues. The Company also sells its products for use in the oil and gas market, primarily in connection with sour gas production. In addition, incineration of municipal, biological, industrial and hazardous waste products typically produces very corrosive conditions that demand high&#8209;performance alloys. The Company continues to look for opportunities to introduce and expand the use of its alloys in emerging technologies such as solar and nuclear fuel applications. Markets capable of providing growth are being driven by increasing performance, reliability and service life requirements for products used in these markets which, could provide further applications for the Company&#8217;s products. 

Sales and Marketing and Distribution 

The Company sells its products primarily through its direct sales organization, which operates from 17 total locations in the U.S., Europe and Asia, 13 of which are service and/or sales centers. All of the Company&#8217;s service and/or sales centers are operated either directly by the Company or through its wholly&#8209;owned subsidiaries. Approximately 79% of the Company&#8217;s net revenues in fiscal 2016 was generated by the Company&#8217;s direct sales organization. The remaining 21% of the Company&#8217;s fiscal 2016 net revenues was generated by a network of independent distributors and sales agents who supplement the Company&#8217;s direct sales in the U.S., Europe and Asia, some of whom have been associated with the Company for over 30 years. Going forward, the Company expects its direct sales force to continue to generate approximately 80% of its total net revenues. 

Providing technical assistance to customers is an important part of the Company&#8217;s marketing strategy. The Company provides performance analyses of its products and those of its competitors for its customers. These analyses enable the Company to evaluate the performance of its products enabling the products to be included as part of the technical specifications used in the production of customers&#8217; products. The Company&#8217;s market development professionals are assisted by its engineering and technology staff in directing the sales force to new opportunities. Management believes the Company&#8217;s combination of direct sales, technical marketing, engineering and customer support provides an advantage over other manufacturers in the high&#8209;performance alloy industry. This activity allows the Company to obtain direct insight into customers&#8217; alloy needs and to develop proprietary alloys that provide solutions to customers&#8217; problems. 

&#160;

The Company continues to focus on growing its business in foreign markets, operating from service and sales centers in Asia and Europe. 

While the Company is making concentrated efforts to expand foreign sales, the majority of its revenue continues to be provided by sales to U.S. customers. The Company&#8217;s domestic expansion effort includes, but is not limited to, capital investment in increased capacity, the continued expansion of ancillary product forms, the continued development of new high&#8209;performance alloys, the addition of equipment in U.S. service and sales centers to improve the Company&#8217;s ability to provide a product closer to the form required by the customer and the continued effort, through the technical expertise of the Company, to find solutions to customer challenges. 

The following table sets forth the approximate percentage of the Company&#8217;s fiscal 2016 net revenues generated through each of the Company&#8217;s distribution channels.

The Company&#8217;s top twenty customers accounted for approximately 34%, 40% and 41% of the Company&#8217;s net revenues in fiscal 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively. No customer or group of affiliated customers of the Company accounted for more than 10% of the Company&#8217;s net revenues in fiscal 2014, 2015 or 2016. 

Net revenues in fiscal 2014, 2015 and 2016 were generated primarily by the Company&#8217;s U.S. operations. Sales to domestic customers comprised approximately 57%, 59% and 58% of the Company&#8217;s net revenues in fiscal 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively. In addition, the majority of the Company&#8217;s operating costs are incurred in the U.S., as all of its manufacturing facilities are located in the U.S. It is expected that net revenues will continue to be highly dependent on the Company&#8217;s domestic sales and manufacturing facilities in the U.S. 

The Company&#8217;s foreign and export sales were approximately $193.8 million, $199.9 million and $172.8 million for fiscal 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively. Additional information concerning foreign operations and export sales is set forth in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10&#8209;K. 

Manufacturing Process 

High&#8209;performance alloys require a lengthier, more complex production process and are more difficult to manufacture than lower&#8209;performance alloys, such as stainless steel. The alloying elements in high&#8209;performance alloys must be highly refined during melting, and the manufacturing process must be tightly controlled to produce precise chemical properties. The resulting alloyed material is more difficult to process because, by design, it is more resistant to deformation. Consequently, high&#8209;performance alloys require that a greater force be applied when hot or cold working and are less susceptible to reduction or thinning when rolling or forging. This results in more cycles of rolling, annealing and pickling compared to a lower&#8209;performance alloy to achieve proper dimensions. Certain alloys may undergo forty or more distinct stages of melting, remelting, annealing, hot reduction, cold reduction, pickling and testing before they achieve the specifications required by a customer. This longer production cycle contributes to slower inventory turns. The Company manufactures its high&#8209;performance alloys in various forms, including sheet, coil, plate, billet/ingot, tubular, wire and other forms. The Company also performs value&#8209;added cutting services to supply certain customers with product cut to their specification. 

At the Kokomo, Indiana facility, the manufacturing process begins with raw materials being combined, melted and refined in a precise manner to produce the chemical composition specified for each high&#8209;performance alloy. The Company&#8217;s primary melt facility utilizes two different melting processes. The argon oxygen decarburization process utilizes gas controls to remove carbon and other undesirable elements, thereby allowing more tightly&#8209;controlled chemistries, which in turn produce more consistent properties in the high&#8209;performance alloys. The other primary melt method utilizes vacuum induction melting which involves the melting of raw materials through electromagnetic induction while under vacuum conditions to produce the desired tightly&#8209;controlled chemistry. The control systems allow for 

&#160;

statistical process control monitoring in real time to improve product quality. For most high&#8209;performance alloys, this molten material is cast into electrodes and additionally refined through electroslag remelting. The resulting ingots are then forged or rolled to an intermediate shape and size depending upon the intended final product form. Intermediate shapes destined for flat products are then sent through a series of hot and cold rolling, annealing, pickling, stretching and shearing operations before being cut to final size. 

The Company has a four&#8209;high Steckel rolling mill for use in hot rolling high&#8209;performance alloys, created specifically for that purpose. The four&#8209;high Steckel rolling mill was installed in 1982 and is one of the most powerful four&#8209;high Steckel rolling mills in the world. The mill is capable of generating approximately 12.0 million pounds of separating force and rolling a plate up to 72 inches wide. The mill includes integrated computer controls (with automatic gauge control and programmed rolling schedules), two coiling Steckel furnaces and seven heating furnaces. Computer&#8209;controlled rolling schedules for each of the hundreds of combinations of product shapes and sizes the Company produces allow the mill to roll numerous widths and gauges to exact specifications without stoppages or changeovers. 

The Company also operates a three&#8209;high hot rolling mill and a two&#8209;high hot rolling mill, each of which is capable of custom processing much smaller quantities of material than the four&#8209;high Steckel rolling mill. These mills provide the Company with significant flexibility in running smaller batches of varied products in response to customer requirements. The Company believes the flexibility provided by the three&#8209;high and two&#8209;high mills provides the Company with an advantage over its major competitors in obtaining smaller specialty orders. 

The coil and sheet operation includes the ability to cold roll to tight tolerances, bright anneal, oxidize anneal and pickle, along with finishing processes that slit and cut to size. A significant capacity increase is underway as the Company has completed a capital investment to redesign and rebuild a cold mill that has been shuttered for the past 10 years. The Company is also investing into more annealing capacity to support the added rolling capacity and plans to have it in operation in 2017. This added annealing capacity is expected to give the Company the ability to offer either bright annealed finish or anneal and pickled finish that will be determined by specifications, application or type of alloy. 

The Arcadia, Louisiana facility uses feedstock produced at the Kokomo facility to fabricate welded and seamless alloy pipe and tubing and purchases extruded tube hollows to produce seamless titanium tubing. The manufacturing processes at Arcadia require cold pilger mills, weld mills, draw benches, annealing furnaces and pickling facilities. The Company recently completed a capital investment project that added capacity in the above&#8209;mentioned processes. 

The Mountain Home, North Carolina facility primarily manufactures finished high&#8209;performance alloy wire. Finished wire products are also warehoused at this facility. 

Backlog 

The Company defines backlog to include firm commitments from customers for delivery of product at established prices. Approximately 30% of the orders in the backlog at any given time include prices that are subject to adjustment based on changes in raw material costs. Historically, approximately 75% of the Company&#8217;s backlog orders have shipped within six months and approximately 90% have shipped within 12 months. The backlog figures do not typically reflect that portion of the Company&#8217;s business conducted at its service and sales centers on a spot or &#8220;just&#8209;in&#8209;time&#8221; basis. For additional discussion of backlog, see Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contained in this Annual Report on Form 10&#8209;K.

Raw Materials 

Raw materials represented 39% of cost of sales in fiscal 2016. Nickel, a major component of many of the Company&#8217;s products, accounted for approximately 49% of raw material costs, or approximately 19% of total cost of sales in fiscal 2016. These proportions are lower in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 due to the decline in the market price of nickel that occurred towards the end of fiscal 2015. As nickel prices remained relatively lower throughout fiscal 2016, nickel as a percentage of raw materials and total cost were lower in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015. Other raw materials include cobalt, chromium, molybdenum and tungsten. Melt materials consist of virgin raw material, purchased scrap and internally produced scrap. 

The average nickel price per pound for cash buyers for the 30&#8209;day period ended on September 30, 2014, 2015 and 2016, as reported by the London Metals Exchange, was $8.20, $4.49 and $4.63 respectively. Prices for certain other raw materials which are significant in the manufacture of the Company&#8217;s products, such as molybdenum, cobalt and chrome, were lower in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015. 

Although alternative sources of supply are available, the Company currently purchases nickel through an exclusive arrangement with a single supplier to ensure consistent quality and supply. The Company purchases raw materials through various arrangements including fixed&#8209;term contracts and spot purchases, which involve a variety of pricing mechanisms. In cases where the Company prices its products at the time of order placement, the Company attempts to establish selling prices with reference to known costs of materials, thereby reducing the risk associated with changes in the cost of raw materials. However, to the extent that the price of nickel fluctuates rapidly, there may be a favorable or unfavorable effect on the Company&#8217;s gross profit margins. The Company periodically purchases material forward with certain suppliers in connection with fixed price agreements with customers. In the event a customer fails to meet the expected volume levels or the consumption schedule deviates from the expected schedule, a rapid or prolonged decrease in the price of raw materials could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s operating results. 

The Company values inventory utilizing the first&#8209;in, first&#8209;out (&#8220;FIFO&#8221;) inventory costing methodology. Under the FIFO inventory costing method, the cost of materials included in cost of sales may be different from the current market price at the time of sale of finished product due to the length of time from the acquisition of the raw material to the sale of the finished product. In a period of decreasing raw material costs, the FIFO inventory valuation method normally results in higher costs of sales as compared to last&#8209;in, first out method. Conversely, in a period of rising raw material costs, the FIFO inventory valuation method normally results in lower costs of sales. 

Research and Technical Support 

The Company&#8217;s technology facilities are located at the Kokomo headquarters and consist of 19,000 square feet of offices and laboratories, as well as an additional 90,000 square feet of paved storage area. The Company has six fully equipped technology testing laboratories, including a mechanical test lab, a metallographic lab, an electron microscopy lab, a corrosion lab, a high-temperature lab and a welding lab. These facilities also contain a reduced scale, fully equipped melt shop and process lab. As of September 30, 2016, the technology, engineering and technological testing staff consisted of 29 persons, 14 of whom have engineering or science degrees, including 6 with doctoral degrees, with the majority of degrees in the field of metallurgical engineering or materials science. 

Research and technical support costs primarily relate to efforts to develop new proprietary alloys and new applications for existing alloys. The Company spent approximately $3.6 million, $3.6 million and $3.7 million for research and technical support activities for fiscal 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively. 

During fiscal 2016, research and development projects were focused on new alloy development, new product form development, supportive data generation and new alloy concept validation, relating to products for the aerospace, industrial gas turbine, chemical processing and oil and gas industries. In addition, significant projects were conducted to generate technical data in support of major market application opportunities in areas such as renewable energy, fuel cell systems, biotechnology (including toxic waste incineration and pharmaceutical manufacturing) and power generation. 

&#160;

Competition 

The high&#8209;performance alloy market is a highly competitive market in which eight to ten major producers participate in various product forms. The Company&#8217;s primary competitors in flat rolled products include Special Metals Corporation, a subsidiary of Precision Castparts Corp., Allegheny Technologies, Inc. and VDM Metals GmbH. The Company faces strong competition from domestic and foreign manufacturers of both high&#8209;performance alloys (similar to those the Company produces) and other competing metals. The Company may face additional competition in the future to the extent new materials are developed, such as plastics, ceramics or additive manufacturing that may be substituted for the Company&#8217;s products. The Company also believes that it will face increased competition from non&#8209;U.S. entities in the next five to ten years, especially from competitors located in Eastern Europe and Asia. Additionally, in recent years, the Company&#8217;s domestic business has been challenged by a strong U.S. dollar, which makes the goods of foreign competitors less expensive to import into the U.S and makes the Company&#8217;s products more expensive to export outside the U.S. 

In recent years, the Company experienced strong price competition from competitors who produce both stainless steel and high&#8209;performance alloys due primarily to weakness in the stainless steel market. Increased competition requires the Company to price its products competitively, which pressures the Company&#8217;s gross profit margin and net income. The Company continues to respond to this competition by increasing emphasis on service centers, offering value&#8209;added services, improving its cost structure and striving to improve delivery times and reliability. 

Employees 

As of September 30, 2016, the Company employed 1,123 full&#8209;time employees worldwide. All eligible hourly employees at the Kokomo, Indiana and Arcadia, Louisiana plants, and the Lebanon, Indiana service center (583 in the aggregate) are covered by two collective bargaining agreements. 

On July 1, 2013, the Company entered into a new five-year collective bargaining agreement with the United Steelworkers of America, which covers eligible hourly employees at the Kokomo, Indiana plant and the Lebanon, Indiana service center. This agreement will expire in June 2018. 

On December 21, 2015, the Company entered into a new collective bargaining agreement with the United Steelworkers of America which covers eligible hourly employees at the Company&#8217;s Arcadia, Louisiana plant. This agreement will expire in December 2020. 

Management believes that current relations with the union are satisfactory. 

Environmental Matters 

The Company&#8217;s facilities and operations are subject to various foreign, federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of human health and the environment, including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the environment and the storage, handling, use, treatment and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes. In the U.S., such laws include, without limitation, the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. As environmental laws and regulations continue to evolve, it is likely the Company will be subject to increasingly stringent environmental standards in the future, particularly under air quality and water quality laws and standards related to climate change issues, such as reporting of greenhouse gas emissions. Violations of these laws and regulations can result in the imposition of substantial penalties and can require facility improvements. Expenses related to environmental compliance were approximately $2.8 million for fiscal 2016 and are currently expected to be approximately $3.0 million for fiscal 2017. 

The Company&#8217;s facilities are subject to periodic inspection by various regulatory authorities, who from time to time have issued findings of violations of governing laws, regulations and permits. In the past five years, the Company has paid administrative fines, none of which have had a material effect on the Company&#8217;s financial condition, for alleged violations relating to environmental matters, requirements relating to its Title V Air Permit and alleged violations of record keeping and notification requirements relating to industrial waste water discharge. Capital expenditures of approximately $0.5 million were made for pollution control improvements during fiscal 2016, with additional expenditures of 

&#160;

approximately $1.7 million for similar improvements planned for fiscal 2017. 

The Company has received permits from the Indiana Department of Environmental Management and the North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources to close and provide post&#8209;closure environmental monitoring and care for the certain areas of its Kokomo and Mountain Home, North Carolina facilities, respectively. 

The Company is required to, among other things, monitor groundwater and to continue post&#8209;closure maintenance of the former disposal areas at each site. As a result, the Company is aware of elevated levels of certain contaminants in the groundwater, and additional testing and corrective action by the Company could be required. The Company is unable to estimate the costs of any further corrective action at these sites, if required. Accordingly, the Company cannot assure that the costs of any future corrective action at these or any other current or former sites would not have a material effect on the Company&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. 

The Company may also incur liability for alleged environmental damages associated with the off&#8209;site transportation and disposal of hazardous substances. Generators of hazardous substances which are transported to disposal sites where environmental problems are alleged to exist are subject to claims under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, or CERCLA, and state counterparts. CERCLA imposes strict, joint and several liabilities for investigatory and cleanup costs upon hazardous substance generators, site owners and operators and other potentially responsible parties. The Company is currently named as a potentially responsible party at one site. There can be no assurance that the Company will not be named as a potentially responsible party at other sites in the future or that the costs associated with those sites would not have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. 

On February 11, 2016, the Company voluntarily reported to the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality a leak that it discovered in one of its chemical cleaning operations at its Arcadia, Louisiana facility. As a result of the discovery, the Company is working with that department to determine the extent of the issue and appropriate remediation.
