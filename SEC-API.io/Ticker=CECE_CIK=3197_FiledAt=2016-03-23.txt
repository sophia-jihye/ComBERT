Industry Overview

We serve a large industrial market for environmental, energy, and fluid handling and filtration. This market is a highly fragmented, multi-billion dollar, global market.

We believe demand for our products and services in the United States and globally will continue to be driven by the following factors:

&#160;

&#183; 

Stringent Regulatory Environment . The adoption of increasingly stringent environmental regulations in the United States and globally requires businesses to pay strict attention to environmental protection. Businesses and industries of all types from refineries, power, chemical processes, metals and minerals, energy market and industrial manufacturing must comply with these various international, federal, state and local government regulations or potentially face substantial fines or be forced to suspend production or alter their production processes. These increasingly stringent environmental regulations are a principal factor that drives our business. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Natural Gas Infrastructure . The natural gas industry consists of the exploration, production, processing, transportation, storage and distribution of natural gas. The International Energy Association (&#8220;IEA&#8221;) projects a pronounced shift in Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (&#8220;OECD&#8221;) countries away from oil and coal towards natural gas and renewables. Natural gas continues to be the fuel of choice for the electric power and industrial sectors in many of the world&#8217;s regions, in part because of its lower carbon intensity compared with coal and oil, which makes it an attractive fuel source in countries where governments are implementing policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 

&#160;

Natural gas delivery is a complex process that refines raw natural gas for industrial, commercial or residential uses. Initially, raw natural gas is extracted from the earth and cleansed of contaminants such as dirt and water at the well site. The natural gas is then transported through a gathering facility to a processing facility, where it is processed to meet quality standards set by pipeline and distribution companies, such as specified levels of solids, liquids and other gases. After processing, the natural gas is transmitted for storage or through an extensive network of pipelines to consumers. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Power Generation. Power generation encompasses a broad range of activities related to the production of electricity. The primary types of fuel used to generate electricity are coal, natural gas and nuclear. In the United States, concerns about potential environmental regulations enhance the attractiveness of natural gas-fired power plants compared with coal-fired power plants, which generally have higher pollutant emission rates than natural gas-powered plants. Natural gas-fired power plants have lower initial capital needs and are more flexible in terms of operating times than coal plants. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Refining, Oil Production and Petrochemical Processing . Refining, oil production and petrochemical processing involves the producing, refining and processing of fuels and chemicals for use in a variety of applications, such as gasoline, fertilizers and plastics. In response to increasing international demand for petrochemicals and refined products, companies are producing more products from new sources, constructing new refineries and petrochemical processing facilities as well as expanding existing facilities. In many cases, these new and expanded facilities must comply with stricter environmental regulations, which influence both choice of fuel and demand for systems to control exhaust emissions. These facilities use a broad range of our products and systems, including our SCR pollution reduction systems, oily water treatment systems and our separation and filtration products. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Worldwide Industrialization . Global trade has increased significantly over the last decade and is driven by growth in emerging markets, including China and India, as well as other developing nations in Asia and the Europe, Middle East, and Africa (&#8220;EMEA&#8221;) region. As a result of globalization, manufacturing that was historically performed domestically continues to migrate to lower cost countries. This movement of the manufacture of goods throughout the world increases demand for industrial ventilation products as new construction continues. We expect that more rigorous environmental regulations will be introduced to create a cleaner working environment and reduce environmental emissions as these economies evolve. 

These factors, individually or collectively, tend to cause increases in industrial capital spending that are not directly impacted by general economic conditions, expansion, or capacity increases. In contrast, favorable conditions in the economy generally lead to plant expansions and the construction of new industrial sites. However, in a weak economy, customers tend to lengthen the time from their initial inquiry to the purchase order, or defer purchases.

Products and Services

We believe we are a leading provider of critical solutions to the environmental, energy, and fluid handling and filtration segments. We focus on engineering, designing, building, and installing systems that capture, clean and destroy airborne contaminants from industrial facilities as well as equipment that controls emissions from such facilities, as well as fluid handling and filtration systems. We provide a wide spectrum of products and services including dampers and diverters, cyclonic technology, thermal oxidizers, filtration systems, scrubbers, fluid handling equipment and plant engineering services and engineered design build fabrication.

Project Design and Research and Development

We focus our development efforts on designing and introducing new and improved approaches and methodologies that produce better system performance for our customers, and often improve customer process performance. We produce specialized products that are often tailored to the specifications of a customer or application. We continually collaborate with our customers to develop the proper solution and ensure customer satisfaction.

We also specialize in the design, fabrication and installation of full ventilation systems and processes. The project development cycle may follow many different paths depending on the specifics of the job and end-market. The cycle normally takes between one and six months from concept and design to production, but may vary significantly depending on developments that occur during the process, including among others, the emergence of new environmental demands, changes in design specifications and ability to obtain necessary approvals.

Sales, Marketing and Support

Our global selling strategy is to provide a solutions-based approach by being a single source provider of technology products and services. The strategy involves expanding our scope of products and services through selective acquisitions and the formation of new business units that are then integrated. We believe this strategy provides a discernible competitive advantage. We execute this strategy by utilizing our portfolio of in-house technologies and those of third-party equipment suppliers. Many of these have been long standing relationships, which have evolved from pure supplier roles to value-added business partnerships. This enables us to leverage existing business with selective alliances of suppliers and application specific engineering expertise. Our products primarily compete on the basis of price, performance, speed of delivery, quality, customer support, and single source. Our value proposition to customers is to provide competitively priced, customized solutions. Our industry-specific knowledge, accompanied by our product and service offerings, provide valuable synergies for design innovation.

We sell and market our products and services with our own direct sales force, including employees in the United States, the Netherlands, United Kingdom, Canada, United Arab Emirates, India, Mexico, China, Singapore, and South America, in conjunction with outside sales representatives in North America, South America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia, and India. We expect to continue expanding our sales and support capabilities and our network of outside sales representatives in key regions domestically and internationally.

Much of our marketing effort consists of individual visits to customers, dissemination of sales and advertising materials, such as product announcements, brochures, magazine articles, advertisements and cover or article features in trade journals and other publications. We also participate in public relations and promotional events, including industry tradeshows and technical conferences. We have an internal marketing organization that is responsible for these initiatives.

&#160;

Our customer service organization or sales force provides our customers with technical assistance, use and maintenance information as well as other key information regard ing their purchase. We also actively provide our customers with access to key information regarding changes and pending changes in environmental regulations as well as new product or service developments. We believe that maintaining a close relationship wi th our customers and providing them with the support they request improves their level of satisfaction and enables us to foresee their potential future product needs or service demands. Moreover, they can lead to sales of annual service and support contrac ts as well as consumables. Our website (www.cecoenviro.com) also provides our customers with online tools and technical resources. 

Quality Assurance

In engineered systems, quality is defined as system performance. We review with our customers, before the contract is signed, the technical specification and the efficiency of the equipment that will be customized to meet their specific needs. We then review these same parameters internally to assure that warranties will be met. Standard project management and production management tools are used to help ensure that all work is done to specification and that project schedules are met. Equipment is tested at the site to ensure it is functioning properly. Historically, our warranty expense has been very low.

Customers

We are not dependent upon any single customer, and no customer comprised 10% or more of our consolidated revenues for 2015, 2014 or 2013. We do not believe the loss of any one of our customers would have a material adverse effect on us.

Suppliers and Subcontractors

We purchase our raw materials and supplies from a variety of global sources. When possible, we directly secure angle iron and sheet plate products from steel mills, whereas other materials are purchased from a variety of steel service centers. Steel prices have been volatile, but we typically mitigate the risk of higher prices by including a &#8220;surcharge&#8221; on our standard products. On contract work, we mitigate the risk of higher prices by including the current price in our estimate and generally include price inflation clauses for protection.

We believe we have a good relationship with our suppliers and do not anticipate any difficulty in continuing to purchase such items on terms acceptable to us. We have not experienced difficulty in procuring a sufficient supply of materials in the past. We typically agree to billing terms with our suppliers ranging from net 30 to 45 days. To the extent that our current suppliers are unable or unwilling to continue to supply us with materials, we believe that we would be able to obtain such materials from other suppliers on acceptable terms.

Typically, on turnkey projects, we subcontract such things as electrical work, concrete work, controls, conveyors and insulation. We use subcontractors with whom we have good working relationships and review each project at the beginning and on an ongoing basis to help ensure that all work is being done according to our specifications. Subcontractors are generally paid when we are paid by our customers according to the terms of our contract with the customer.

Backlog

Backlog is a representation of the amount of revenue expected from complete performance of firm fixed-price contracts that have not been completed for products and services we expect to substantially deliver within the next 12 months. Our customers may have the right to cancel a given order, although historically cancellations have been rare. Backlog was approximately $211.2 million and $140.1 million as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Substantially all 2014 backlog was completed in 2015. Most of the 2015 backlog is expected to be completed in 2016. Backlog is not defined by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;) and our methodology for calculating backlog may not be consistent with methodologies used by other companies.

Competition

The markets we serve are highly fragmented with numerous small and regional participants. We believe no single company competes with us across the full range of our systems and products. Competition in the markets we serve is based on a number of considerations, including price, timeliness of delivery, technology, applications experience, know-how, reputation, product warranties and service. We believe our reputation, technical engineering capabilities and service differentiate us from many of our competitors, including those competitors who often offer products at a lower price.

&#160;

Due to the size and shipping weight of many of our projects, localized manufacturing/fabrication capabilities are very important t o our customers. As a result, competition varies widely by region and industry. The market for our engineered products is reasonably competitive and is characterized by technological change, continuously changing environment regulations, and evolving custo mer requirements. We believe that the additional competitive factors in our markets include: 

&#160;

&#183; 

performance track record in difficult plant applications; 

&#160;

&#183; 

comprehensive portfolio of products with leading technology; 

&#160;

&#183; 

solid brand recognition in the fluid handling market; 

&#160;

&#183; 

ability to design standard and custom products that meet customers&#8217; needs; 

&#160;

&#183; 

ability to provide reliable solutions in a timely manner; 

&#160;

&#183; 

quality customer service and support; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

financial and operational stability, including reputation. 

We believe we compete favorably with respect to these factors.

Government Regulations

We believe our operations are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations. We believe that changes in environmental laws and regulations create opportunity given the nature of our business.

We are subject to the requirements of OSHA and comparable state statutes. We believe we are in material compliance with OSHA and state requirements, including general industry standards, record keeping requirements and monitoring of occupational exposures. In general, we expect to increase our expenditures to comply with stricter industry and regulatory safety standards when needed. Although such expenditures cannot be accurately estimated at this time, we do not believe that they will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Intellectual Property

We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, employee and third-party nondisclosure/confidentiality agreements and license agreements to protect our intellectual property. We sell most of our products under a number of registered trade names, brand names and registered trademarks, which we believe are widely recognized in the industry. While we hold patents within a number of our businesses, we do not view our patents to be material to our business.

Financial Information about Geographic Areas

For 2015, 2014 and 2013, sales to customers outside the United States, including export sales, accounted for approximately 38%, 30% and 21%, respectively, of consolidated net sales. The largest portion of these sales were to Asian and European customers. Of consolidated long lived assets, $62.9 million and $49.2 million were located outside of the United States as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Our operations outside of the United States are subject to additional risks, which are fully described in &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors.&#8221;

Employees

We had approximately 1,170 full-time and four part-time employees as of December 31, 2015. The facilities in Cincinnati, Ohio and Telford, Pennsylvania are unionized except for selling, engineering, design, administrative and operating management personnel. None of our other employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relationship with our employees to be satisfactory. In total, as of December 31, 2015, 196 employees were represented by international or independent labor unions under various union contracts that expire at various intervals.

All such postings and filings are available on our website free of charge. The SEC also maintains a website, www.sec.gov, that contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC. The content on any website referred to in this Annual Report on Form 10-K is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K unless expressly noted.
