Business Overview 

Energy Fuels is engaged in conventional and in situ (&#147; ISR &#148;) uranium extraction and recovery, along with the exploration, permitting, and evaluation of uranium properties in the United States. Energy Fuels owns the Nichols Ranch Uranium Recovery Facility in Wyoming (the &#147;Nichols Ranch Project&#148; ), which is one of the newest uranium recovery facilities operating in the United States. In addition, Energy Fuels owns the White Mesa Mill in Utah (the &#147;White Mesa Mill&#148; or &#147;Mill&#148; ), which is the only conventional uranium recovery facility operating in the United States. The Company also owns uranium and uranium/vanadium properties and projects in various stages of exploration, permitting, and evaluation, as well as fully-permitted uranium and uranium/vanadium projects on standby. The White Mesa Mill can also recover vanadium as a co-product of mineralized material produced from certain of its projects in Colorado and Utah. In addition, Energy Fuels recovers uranium from other uranium-bearing materials not derived from conventional material, referred to as &#147;alternate feed materials,&#148; at its White Mesa Mill. 

The Company&#146;s activities are divided into two segments: the &#147;ISR Uranium Segment&#148; and the &#147;Conventional Uranium Segment.&#148; 

ISR Uranium Segment 

The Company conducts its ISR activities through its Nichols Ranch Project, located in northeast Wyoming, which it acquired in June 2015 through its acquisition of Uranerz Energy Corporation ( &#147;Uranerz&#148; ). The Nichols Ranch Project includes: (i) a licensed and operating ISR processing facility (the &#147; Nichols Ranch Plant &#148;); (ii) licensed and operating ISR wellfields (the &#147; Nichols Ranch Wellfields &#148;); (iii) planned ISR wellfields currently in the licensing process (the &#147; Jane Dough Property &#148;), and; (iv) a licensed satellite ISR uranium project (the &#147;Hank Project&#148; ), which will include an ISR processing plant (the &#147;Hank Satellite Plant&#148; ) that, when constructed, will produce loaded-resin, and associated planned wellfields (the &#147;Hank Property&#148; ). See &#147; The Nichols Ranch ISR Project &#148; under Item 2 below. Also through the acquisition of Uranerz, the Company acquired the Reno Creek property (the &#147;Reno Creek Property&#148; ), West North Butte property (the &#147;West North Butte Property&#148; ), and the North Rolling Pin property (the &#147;North Rolling Pin Property&#148; ), as well as the Arkose Mining Venture (the &#147;Arkose Mining Venture&#148; ), which is a joint venture of Wyoming ISR properties held 81% by Energy Fuels. See &#147; Non-Material Mineral Properties &#150; Other ISR Projects &#148; under Item 2 below. All of the Company&#146;s ISR properties are held by the Company&#146;s wholly-owned subsidiary, Uranerz. 

The Nichols Ranch Project is an operating ISR facility that recovers uranium through a series of injection and recovery wells. Using groundwater fortified with oxygen and sodium bicarbonate, uranium is dissolved within a deposit. The groundwater is then collected in a series of recovery wells and pumped to the Nichols Ranch Plant. The Nichols Ranch Plant creates a yellowcake slurry that is transported by truck to the White Mesa Mill, where it is dried and packaged into drums that are shipped to uranium conversion facilities.

Construction of the Nichols Ranch Plant, other than the elution, drying and packaging circuits, was completed in 2013, and it commenced uranium recovery activities in the second quarter of 2014. In September of 2015, the Company commenced construction of an elution circuit at the Nichols Ranch Plant, which was completed and began operations in February 2016. During 2015, a total of 273,000 pounds of U 3 O 8 were recovered from the Nichols Ranch Project, of which approximately 172,000 pounds were recovered by the Company after its acquisition of Uranerz in June 2015. 

Additionally, the Company announced on March 4, 2016 that it entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Meste&#241;a Uranium LLC, which includes additional ISR properties located in Brooks and Jim Hogg Counties, Texas, as described below in &#147; Subsequent Events &#148; of this Item 1. 

Conventional Uranium Segment 

The Company conducts its conventional uranium extraction and recovery activities through its White Mesa Mill, which is the only operating conventional uranium mill in the United States. The White Mesa Mill, located near Blanding Utah, is centrally located such that it can be fed by a number of the Company&#146;s uranium and uranium/vanadium projects in Colorado, Utah, Arizona and New Mexico, as well as by ore purchases or toll milling arrangements with third party miners in the region as market conditions warrant.

The White Mesa Mill is a 2,000 ton per day uranium recovery facility, which can also process vanadium as a co-product of mineralized material extracted from certain uranium/vanadium properties. In addition, the Mill can recycle other uranium-bearing materials not derived from conventional ore, referred to as "alternate feed materials", for the recovery of uranium, alone or in combination with other metals. 

The White Mesa Mill has historically operated on a campaign basis, whereby mineral processing occurs as mill feed, contract requirements, and market conditions warrant. Over the years, the Company&#146;s own, and third-party owned, conventional uranium properties in Utah, Colorado, Arizona and New Mexico have been both active and on standby, from time-to-time, in response to changing market conditions. From 2007 through 2014, running on a campaign basis, the White Mesa Mill recovered on average over 1 million pounds of U 3 O 8 per year from conventional sources, including its La Sal Project, Daneros Project, and Tony M property in Utah; its Arizona 1 and Pinenut Projects in Arizona; and alternate feed materials. During 2015, the Mill recovered a total of 296,000 lbs. of U 3 O 8 , of which 25,000 pounds were recovered from conventional materials and the remainder from processing alternate feed materials (including 72,000 pounds for the account of a third party). Between campaigns, the Mill is maintained on standby status, ready to resume mineral processing activities, as market conditions warrant. 

The Company&#146;s Pinenut Project, where mineral extraction activities occurred until September 2015, is now depleted, and reclamation activities have commenced. Approximately 43,000 tons of mineralized material extracted from the Pinenut Project is currently stockpiled at the White Mesa Mill. The Company is also continuing to receive and stockpile alternate feed materials at the White Mesa Mill for a future mineral processing campaign. At the Company&#146;s permitted Canyon Project, shaft-sinking activities are currently taking place. The Company expects to complete an underground drilling program at the Canyon Project during 2016. The timing to extract and process mineralized material from the Canyon Project will be based on the results of this additional evaluation work, along with market conditions, available financing, and sales requirements. All of the Company&#146;s other conventional properties and projects are currently in the permitting process or on standby pending improvements in market conditions. No third party conventional properties are active at this time. 

The Company also owns the Sheep Mountain Project (the &#147;Sheep Mountain Project&#148; ), which is a conventional uranium extraction project located in Wyoming in an advanced stage of permitting. Due to its distance from the White Mesa Mill, the Sheep Mountain Project is not expected to be a source of feed material for the Mill. The Sheep Mountain Project consists of open pit and underground extraction components (the &#147;Sheep Mountain Extraction Operation&#148; ) and a planned processing facility to process extracted mineralized material (the &#147;Sheep Mountain Processing Operation&#148; ). 

The Company&#146;s principal conventional properties include the following: 

&#149; the White Mesa Mill, a 2,000 ton per day uranium and vanadium processing facility located near Blanding, Utah, held through the Company&#146;s subsidiary EFR White Mesa LLC. See &#147; The White Mesa Mill &#148; under Item 2 below; 

&#149; the Arizona Strip uranium properties located in north central Arizona, including: the Canyon Project, which is a fully-permitted uranium project with all surface facilities in place and shaft-sinking underway (see &#147; The Canyon Project &#148; under Item 2 below); the Wate project (the &#147; Wate Project &#148;), which is a uranium deposit in the permitting stage; the Arizona 1 project (the &#147;Arizona 1 Project&#148; ), which is a fully-permitted uranium project on standby; the Pinenut Project which is a depleted uranium deposit in reclamation; and the EZ properties (&#147; EZ Properties &#148;), which are uranium deposits in the exploration and evaluation stage. All of the Company&#146;s Arizona Strip properties are held by the Company&#146;s subsidiary EFR Arizona Strip LLC, with the exception of the Wate Project, which is held by the Company&#146;s subsidiary Wate Mining Company LLC.

Under that transaction, the Company acquired all of the Company&#146;s current ISR facilities, assets, and properties (other than those in the Shirley Basin), including the Nichols Ranch Project, the Hank Project, the Reno Creek Property, the West North Butte Property, the North Rolling Pin Property, the Company&#146;s interest in the Arkose Mining Venture, uranium sales contracts, and other assets, as well as the shares of Uranerz, which holds those assets. See &#147; 2015 Corporate Developments &#148; below; and &#149; In two separate transactions in February and November of 2015, the Company acquired 100% ownership of the Wate Project, through the acquisition of Wate Mining Company LLC (see &#147; 2015 Corporate Developments &#148; below). 2015 Corporate Developments 

On January 5, 2015, the Company announced that it had entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the &#147; Merger Agreement &#148;) with Uranerz and EFR Nevada Corp., a Nevada corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (&#147; Merger Sub &#148;). The Merger Agreement provided for a business combination between Uranerz and Merger Sub, whereby the Company would acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of Uranerz. On June 18, 2015, the acquisition was consummated, and Uranerz became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. At that time, two additional directors were appointed to the Board of Directors of Energy Fuels, and each issued and outstanding share of Uranerz was canceled and automatically converted into the right to receive 0.255 common shares of the Company. The Company issued an aggregate of 24,457,773 Common Shares in exchange for all of the issued and outstanding shares of Uranerz common stock. In addition, the Company reserved for issuance an aggregate of 2,690,250 Common Shares for issuance upon exercise of Uranerz warrants, and 2,048,408 Common Shares for issuance pursuant to Uranerz stock options. Through the Uranerz acquisition, the Company added its ISR Uranium Segment, as further discussed above in this Item 1.

On February 17, 2015, the Company acquired a 50% interest in the Wate Project from VANE Minerals (US) LLC (&#147; VANE &#148;). The Wate Project is held in the Company&#146;s subsidiary, Wate Mining Company, LLC (&#147; WMCL &#148;). As consideration for the 50% interest in WMCL, the Company paid VANE $0.25 million cash at closing, along with a $0.50 million non-interest-bearing promissory note, payable in two equal installments of $0.25 million each on the first and second anniversaries of the note, and a 2% production royalty on the 50% interest in the Wate Project being acquired. The royalty can be purchased by Energy Fuels upon payment to VANE of an additional $0.75 million. In addition, upon the satisfaction of certain permitting milestones and other conditions, the amounts due under the note will be accelerated, and the Company will pay to VANE an additional $0.25 million cash. If Energy Fuel elects not to make the payments under the note, it will be required to transfer this interest in WMCL interest back to VANE. The terms of the note were amended on February 15, 2016. See &#147; Subsequent Events &#148; below. On November 4, 2015, the Company announced that it acquired the other 50% of WMCL from Anfield Resources Holding Corp. (&#147; Anfield &#148;). The Company paid Anfield $0.275 million in cash and 92,906 Common Shares, having a market value of $0.275 million at the time of issuance. In addition, after mineral extraction commences from the property, the Company is required to make an additional cash payment of $0.275 million to Anfield and issue to Anfield additional Common Shares having a value of $0.275 million. As a result of the two foregoing transactions, the Company now owns a 100% interest in the Wate Project and WMCL. 

In two separate announcements on July 16, 2015 and July 21, 2015, respectively, the Company announced two key permitting milestones. The State of Wyoming granted the Company approval for a major revision to the existing permit for the Company&#146;s Sheep Mountain Project, including expansion of surface and underground mining activities. In addition, the U.S. Bureau of Land Management ( &#147;BLM&#148; ) issued a Final EA and granted its final approval for the PO for the Company&#146;s 100%-owned Hank Project. The issuance of the EA and approval of the PO were the final major regulatory approvals required to construct the Hank Project in the future as a satellite to our Nichols Ranch Project. 

On August 3, 2015, the Company completed the acquisition of mineral properties adjacent to its Roca Honda Project from Uranium Resources, Inc. (&#147; URI &#148;). The Roca Honda Project is held by the Company&#146;s 60% subsidiary, Roca Honda Resources LLC (&#147; RHR &#148;), with the remaining 40% held by subsidiaries of Sumitomo Corporation (&#147; Sumitomo &#148;), currently the Company&#146;s joint venture partner. RHR declined its option to have the properties included in the joint venture due to Sumitomo's decision to sell its interest in RHR. The Company has subsequently entered into a non-binding letter of intent to purchase Sumitomo&#146;s 40% interest in RHR. See &#147; Subsequent Events &#148; below. The acquired properties, which total approximately 4,580 acres (1,854 hectares), include: fee mineral ownership of 640 acres ( &#147;Section 17&#148; ); fee ownership of 36 unpatented lode mining claims; and a leasehold interest in 131 unpatented lode mining claims. As consideration for acquiring such properties, the Company delivered to URI: $2.5 million cash; $375,000 of Common Shares; the royalty held by the Company on certain properties included within later phases of Peninsula Energy&#146;s Lance Uranium Project in Wyoming; unpatented lode mining claims adjacent to URI&#146;s Church Rock property; and a 4% gross royalty on Section 17, which can be repurchased by Energy Fuels upon payment to URI of US$5.0 million cash at any time in the Company&#146;s sole discretion prior to the date on which the first royalty becomes due. 

On September 25, 2016, the Board of Directors of the Company increases the size of the Board of Directors from eight to nine and appointed Mr. Ames Brown to the Board of Directors. Mr. Brown has been the Chief Investment Officer at Capital Counsel Mgmt LLC since 2014, and prior to that he was a financial consultant with Wells Fargo &#38; Co. from 2009 to 2013. Mr. Brown holds a BA, History from Yale University and an MBA and an M.S. Strategic Communications from Columbia University. 

The Company filed a prospectus supplement (the &#147; Supplement &#148;) on September 29, 2015 in both Canada and the United States to its Canadian base shelf prospectus (the &#147; Canadian Base Prospectus &#148;) and U.S. registration statement on Form F-10 (the &#147;Registration Statement&#148; ), both of which were filed on April 9, 2014. Concurrent with the filing of the 2015 Supplement, the Company entered into a Controlled Equity Offering Sales Agreement with Cantor Fitzgerald &#38; Co. (&#147; Cantor &#148;), which enabled the Company, at its discretion from time to time, to sell, through Cantor as agent, up to US$15.64 million worth of Common Shares by way of an &#147;at-the-market&#148; offering (the &#147; ATM &#148;). Under the ATM, sales of the shares were authorized to occur by means of ordinary brokers&#146; transactions or block trades, with sales only being made on the NYSE MKT at market prices. No Common Shares were authorized to be offered or sold through the ATM on the TSX. As of the date hereof, a total of 1,476,133 Common Shares were sold under the ATM, for net proceeds to the Company of US$3.39 million. Upon filing of this Form 10-K, the ATM will terminate and no longer be effective.

On October 2, 2015, the Company commenced a normal course issuer bid (&#147; NCIB &#148;) to purchase for cancellation up to CDN$2.2 million aggregate amount of its outstanding Debentures, representing approximately 10% of the CDN$22,000,000 aggregate principal amount of Debentures outstanding at that time. The Company may purchase the Debentures at prevailing market prices and by means of open market transactions through the facilities of the TSX. The NCIB will remain in effect until the earlier of October 1, 2016 or the date on which the Company has purchased the maximum number of Debentures permitted under the NCIB. As of the date hereof, the Company has not repurchased any Debentures under the NCIB.

On November 24, 2015, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell a package of non-core uranium assets to enCore Energy Corp. (TSX.V:UE) (&#147; enCore &#148;) and Tigris Uranium U.S. Corp., including unpatented mining claims and leases known as the Marquez and Nose Rock properties in New Mexico, the Moonshine property in Arizona, and the Cedar Mountain, Geitus, Blue Jay, and Marcy Look properties in Utah. The transaction closed on January 6, 2016. Disposition of these properties is part of our continuing asset rationalization strategy that cuts holding, permitting, and corporate costs and allows the Company to focus on its higher quality uranium assets. The consideration received by Energy Fuels for the sale of the properties was $329,960 cash and 14,250,000 common shares of enCore. As a result of the transaction, Energy Fuels owns 19.9% of the issued and outstanding shares of enCore and holds a seat on enCore&#146;s board of directors. enCore assumed all liabilities on the properties, including all reclamation obligations. 

Company Strategy 

Energy Fuels intends to continue to strengthen its position as a leading uranium extraction and recovery company focused on the United States. With the acquisition of Uranerz, the Company has added ISR recovery to our portfolio that, along with certain of the Company&#146;s conventional projects and alternate feed material processing at the White Mesa Mill, sit at the lower end of the Company&#146;s cost curve. With its large uranium resource base and existing conventional projects on standby, under construction, and in permitting, the Company&#146;s strategy is to remain a unique and valuable call option on increases in the price of uranium, with significant scalability in improved market conditions. The Company currently intends to maintain its ISR and conventional uranium recovery capabilities, uranium resource base, and scalability. However, continued weakness in uranium prices and cash needs dictate that the Company engage in further measures to maintain the value of this option. As a result, at this time we intend to conserve cash and focus on our lowest cost uranium sources of uranium recovery, as follows: 

Continuing to systematically expand wellfield construction and uranium recovery at the Nichols Ranch Project on a conservative basis as market conditions warrant; Continuing the current mineral processing campaign at the White Mesa Mill into late 2016 to process stockpiled Pinenut Project material and alternate feed materials; Continuing shaft-sinking at the Canyon Project. In mid-2016, the Company expects to commence an underground drilling program to further evaluate the deposit; Following completion of the current mineral processing campaign at the White Mesa Mill, placing the Mill on standby and maintaining it in a state of readiness for the purpose of restarting mineral processing as available material and/or market conditions may warrant. The Company is currently installing five new replacement leach tanks, which are required for the 2016 conventional processing campaign. While on standby, the White Mesa Mill will continue to dry and package yellowcake from the Nichols Ranch Project; Continuing to maintain standby projects and facilities, including the La Sal Project and the Daneros Project, in a state of readiness for the purpose of restarting mining activities, as market conditions may warrant. At this time, all of the Company&#146;s conventional projects, other than the Canyon Project, are expected to remain on standby until market conditions warrant restarting mining activities, or are in the evaluation or permitting process; Continuing ongoing business development activities, including evaluation and permitting of existing projects such as the Roca Honda Project, the Sheep Mountain Project, the Bullfrog Property at the Henry Mountains Complex, the Wate Project, and the Jane Dough Property of the Nichols Ranch Project; and Continuing to evaluate the sale or abandonment of non-core assets that the Company does not believe will add value in order to reduce costs and/or receive sales proceeds. 6 

Subsequent Events 

On January 27, 2016, the Board of Directors appointed Mr. Hyung Mun Bae as a director of the Company to fill the vacancy left by the resignation of Mr. Joo Soo Park. Mr. Bae serves as the representative of Korea Electric Power Corporation on the Board of Directors of the Company. 

On February 2, 2016, the Company received final notice from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (&#147; NRC &#148;) that uranium recovery operations involving elution, precipitation, filter press, and slurry processes were authorized to commence at the Nichols Ranch Plant, providing the Company with 100% self-contained ISR processing capabilities. 

On February 15, 2016, the Company renegotiated the existing non-interest bearing promissory note payable to VANE, for the 50% interest in the Wate Project that it acquired from VANE in 2015. Originally, the note was payable in two equal installments of $0.25 million each on the first and second anniversaries of the note. Under the renegotiated note, the Company paid to VANE $50,000 on or before February 13, 2015, in lieu of the first $0.25 million payment due under the note, with the remaining $0.45 million converted to a lump sum payment due on first commercial mineral extraction from the project.

On March 4, 2016, the Company announced that it entered into a non-binding letter of intent ( &#147;Letter of Intent&#148; ) with Sumitomo to acquire its 40% interest in the Roca Honda Project, for: (i) $1.0 million in cash; (ii) a number of common shares of the Company equal to $1.5 million; and (iii) once commercial mineral extraction is first commented at the Roca Honda Project, an additional $4.5 million of cash payable at that time. Under the Letter of Intent, definitive agreements are expected to be entered into on or about April 1, 2016, with the closing of the transaction expected to occur on or about April 18, 2016, subject to final Sumitomo approval, and regulatory and stock exchange approvals. The Roca Honda Project, located near Grants, New Mexico, is a uranium project in the advanced stages of permitting. Based on a Preliminary Economic Assessment prepared under NI 43-101 by Roscoe Postle (USA) Ltd. dated February 27, 2015, the Roca Honda Project is estimated to have a total of approximately 14.56 million pounds of uranium contained in approximately 1.51 million tons of Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources with an average grade of 0.48% eU 3 O 8 . In addition, the project is estimated to have a total of approximately 11.21 million pounds of uranium contained in approximately 1.20 million tons of Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources with an average grade of 0.47% eU 3 O 8 . See &#147; The Roca Honda Project &#148; under Item 2below. If this transaction closes as contemplated, the Company&#146;s current 60% interest in the project and these resources will increase to 100%. The Company believes that by increasing its ownership in this project to 100% the Company will further enhance the value of its call option on increases in the price of uranium, with significant additional scalability in improved market conditions.

On March 7, 2016, the Company announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement (the &#147;Meste&#241;a Purchase Agreement&#148; ) to acquire Meste&#241;a Uranium, LLC (&#147; Meste&#241;a &#148;) (the &#147; Meste&#241;a Acquisition &#148;). Meste&#241;a is a well-known uranium recovery company that owns the Alta Mesa Project, located in South Texas. Meste&#241;a engaged in uranium recovery activities at the Alta Mesa Project from October 2005 to November 2013, during which time the Alta Mesa Project recovered over 4.6 million pounds U 3 O 8 from six production areas. From November 2013 to the present, Meste&#241;a has maintained the Alta Mesa Project on standby in response to low uranium prices. The Alta Mesa Project is located on the Jones Ranch, which is approximately 350,000 acres in size and located in Brooks and Jim Hogg Counties, Texas. The properties included within the project include over 195,000 acres covered by a Uranium Testing Permit and Lease Option Agreement (the &#147; Meste&#241;a Properties &#148;). Of that acreage, 4,575 acres is currently subject to a Uranium Solution Mining Lease that allows current and future uranium recovery operations. The Alta Mesa Project has a fully-licensed and constructed ISR plant, with a design capacity of 1.5 million pounds of uranium concentrate per year. There is an existing June 1, 2014 historical resource estimate for a portion of the properties, prepared by Douglas L. Beahm, P.E., P.G., that is not currently compliant with NI 43-101. This recent historical estimate shows that the Alta Mesa Project currently contains 1.6 million tons of Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources with an average grade of 0.11% eU 3 O 8 containing 3.6 million pounds of uranium, in addition to 7.0 million tons of Inferred Mineral Resources with an average grade of 0.12% eU 3 O 8 containing 16.8 million pounds of uranium. In addition, the historic estimate summarizes the resources currently contained in certain exploration targets, including 2.6 million tons of material with average grades ranging from 0.08% - 0.12% eU 3 O 8 containing 4.1 &#150; 6.6 million pounds of uranium. Readers should be cautioned that a qualified person has not done sufficient work to classify this estimate as a current estimate of mineral resources or mineral reserves, and as such the Company is not treating it as a current estimate of mineral reserves or mineral resources. However, the Company believes the estimate is relevant and reliable, as it was prepared within the last two years by a reputable mining consultant. In order to upgrade and verify this historical estimate and classify it as a current mineral resource estimate, the Company needs to perform further evaluations of the report and confirm that its underlying assumptions continue to be reasonable and that the report is complete and current. The Company expects to perform this evaluation and update the historical report to a NI 43-101 compliant technical report, which is expected to be filed on the System for Electronic Document Analysis and Retrieval (&#147; SEDAR &#148;). Under the Meste&#241;a Purchase Agreement, the Company has agreed to issue 4,551,284 Common Shares to the current owners of Meste&#241;a at the closing of the transaction, which is expected to occur on or before May 4, 2016, subject to receipt of all applicable regulatory and stock exchange approvals and the satisfaction of certain other conditions to closing. At closing, the Company will assume the existing $11.0 million reclamation obligation for the project, but will acquire the existing cash collateral backing the reclamation obligation in the amount of approximately $4.4 million. The Meste&#241;a properties will be subject to a royalty equal (in total) to 3.125%of the value of the recovered U 3 O 8 from the Meste&#241;a properties sold at a uranium price of $65.00 or less per pound U 3 O 8 , 6.25% of the value of the recovered U 3 O 8 from the Meste&#241;a properties sold at a uranium price greater than $65.00 and up to and including $95.00 per pound U 3 O 8 , and 7.5% of the value of the recovered U3O8 from the Meste&#241;a properties sold at a uranium price greater than $95.00 per pound U 3 O 8 . The Meste&#241;a Purchase Agreementcontains customary representations and warranties of the Company and customary conditions of closing including: receipt of all required regulatory and stock exchange approvals, including approval from the TSX, and approval from the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality and Texas Railroad Commission relating to the change of control of certain licenses and permits; the provision of notice to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States; an amended Uranium Solution Mining Lease covering the existing wellfields, an amended Uranium Testing Permit and Lease Option Agreement for the entire 195,000-acres, and amended Surface Use Agreements covering all of the 195,000-acres, as well as other amended agreements, are entered into by all relevant parties in the forms attached to the Meste&#241;a Purchase Agreement or as otherwise provided for in that agreement; the replacement by the Company of the existing surety arrangements required under existing licenses and permits; and satisfactory completion of certain title investigations by the Company. 

On March 14, 2016 the Company closed a public offering (the &#147;Offering&#148; ) of Units made pursuant to an underwriting agreement dated March 9, 2016 between the Company and a syndicate of underwriters led by Cantor Fitzgerald Canada Corporation, as sole bookrunner, along with Haywood Securities Inc., Roth Capital Partners, LLC, Dundee Securities Ltd., Raymond James Ltd., and Rodman &#38; Renshaw, a unit of H.C. Wainwright &#38; Co., LLC. Pursuant to the Offering, the Company sold an aggregate of 5,031,250 Units (which includes 656,250 Units that were issued upon the exercise, in full, of the over-allotment option that was granted to the underwriters) at a price of $2.40 per Unit for total net proceeds of $10.88 million after commissions and estimated expenses of the offering. Each Unit consists of one Common Share and one half of one Common share purchase warrant, or a total of 5,031,250 Common Shares and 2,525,625 warrants. Each warrant will be exercisable until March 14, 2019, and will entitle the holder thereof to acquire one Common Share upon exercise at an exercise price of $3.20 per Common Share. 

Uranium Sales 

The Company has four (4) existing long-term contracts, which require deliveries of 550,000 pounds of U 3 O 8 in 2016 and 620,000 pounds of U 3 O 8 in 2017. Two contracts expire in 2017, one contract expires in 2018, and another contract expires in 2020. Of the 1,170,000 pounds of deliveries for 2016 and 2017, a total of 570,000 pounds of U 3 O 8 is required to come from the Company&#146;s uranium recovery operations, while Energy Fuels has the option to fulfill the remaining 600,000 pounds of U 3 O 8 from the Company&#146;s uranium recovery operations and/or open market purchases. At December 31, 2015, the Company has approximately 520,000 pounds of finished goods inventory from the Company&#146;s uranium recovery operations.

The Company expects to have sufficient material available for the 550,000 pounds of 2016 contractual deliveries, through current inventories and expected recoveries from the White Mesa Mill and the Nichols Ranch Project. In 2017, the Company expects to have existing inventory or uranium recovery to meet all of its commitments to sell 620,000 pounds of uranium under its existing long-term contracts.

The average expected realized price per pound under the existing contracts is not subject to any decrease resulting from declines in future U 3 O 8 spot and/or term prices, due to the minimum floor prices now in effect or the prices being fixed. The average sales price under the Company&#146;s long-term contracts is expected to be higher in 2016 than 2015 levels. Selective spot sales are also expected to be made in 2016 as necessary to generate cash for operations, construction and resource evaluation activities, including continued shaft-sinking and evaluation at the Canyon Project and the construction of additional wellfields at the Nichols Ranch Project. 

Segment Information 

Prior to the Uranerz acquisition in June of 2015, the Company was engaged solely in conventional uranium exploration, permitting, extraction, and recovery. The Company&#146;s source of conventional uranium recovery is the White Mesa Mill, which generates revenue through conventional processing, alternate feed material processing, and toll processing agreements (the &#147;Conventional Uranium Segment&#148; ). The nature of the Company&#146;s business expanded with the addition of ISR facilities when the Company acquired Uranerz (the &#147;ISR Uranium Segment&#148; ). Although the principal product of both segments is uranium concentrate, or &#147;yellowcake,&#148; the methods of extraction and recovery differ. In addition, the Conventional Uranium Segment provides services at the White Mesa Mill, namely alternate feed material processing and toll processing, which the Company&#146;s ISR Uranium Segment does not provide.

Set forth below is a chart depicting the two segments of the Company&#146;s business, together with the properties and services associated with each segment: 

ISR URANIUM SEGMENT CONVENTIONAL URANIUM SEGMENT The ISR Uranium Segment currently includes the Nichols Ranch Project, which includes the Nichols Ranch Plant and surrounding uranium properties which are geographically situated to enable mineralized materials to be transported to the Nichols Ranch Plant either by pipeline or by truck for processing.

The material properties included in the ISR Uranium Segment include: The Nichols Ranch Project, including the Nichols Ranch Plant, the Nichols Ranch Wellfield and the Jane Dough Property; and the Hank Project, including the permitted, but not constructed, Hank Satellite Plant and the Hank Property. The Conventional Uranium Segment currently includes the White Mesa Mill, which includes alternate feed material and toll processing at the Mill, and all conventional underground mineral extraction projects which are geographically situated to enable mineralized materials to be transported to the White Mesa Mill by truck for processing under current or reasonably anticipated future economic conditions. 

The material properties included in the Conventional Uranium Segment include: the White Mesa Mill, the Henry Mountains Complex, the Roca Honda Project, the Sheep Mountain Project (described below), the Canyon Project, the Daneros Project, and the La Sal Project. Non-material properties included in the Conventional Uranium Segment include: the Arizona 1 Project, the Wate Project, the possible EZ Project, the Whirlwind Project, the Rim Project, and the Sage Plain Project. The Company is currently evaluating the possible sale of the Whirlwind Project. &#147;Other ISR Properties&#148; includes other ISR properties which are not close enough for mineralized materials to be transported to the Nichols Ranch plant by pipeline or truck, or that are currently in the evaluation stage.

The Other ISR Properties include: The Reno Creek Property, the West North Butte Property, the North Rolling Pin Property, and the Collins Draw, Willow Creek, East Nichols, North Nichols, Verna Ann, Niles Ranch, Cedar Canyon, East Buck, South Collins Draw, Sand Rock, Little Butte, Beecher Draw, Lone Bull, Kermit, Monument and Stage properties (each of which are in the evaluation stage and are considered not material at this time). &#147;Other Conventional Properties&#148; include conventional projects which are too geographically distant for mineralized materials to be transported to the White Mesa Mill for processing under current or reasonably anticipated future economic conditions. 

The Other Conventional Properties include: the Sheep Mountain Project, which is material, and the Gas Hills and Juniper Ridge Projects, which are not material. The Gas Hills and Juniper Ridge Projects are currently being held for sale. 

Additional segment information, including financial information about segments, is provided in Note 20 to our financial statements under the section heading &#147; Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data &#148; below.

Overview of Uranium Market 

The primary commercial use of uranium is to fuel nuclear power plants for the generation of electricity. All the uranium extracted from Energy Fuels&#146; projects is expected to be used for this purpose. 

According to the Nuclear Energy Institute ( &#147;NEI&#148; ), in 2012 nuclear power plants provided about 11% of global electricity production. According to the World Nuclear Association ( &#147;WNA&#148; ), as of March 1, 2016, there are currently 440 operable reactors world-wide, which require approximately 170 million pounds of U 3 O 8 fuel per year at full operation. Worldwide there are currently 65 new reactors under construction with an additional 173 reactors on order, or in the planning stage and another 337 which have been proposed. 

According to data from TradeTech LLC ( &#147;TradeTech&#148; ), the world continues to require more uranium than it produces from primary extraction, largely due to increasing uranium demands in Asia. The gap between demand and primary supply has been filled by stockpiled inventories and secondary supplies.

According to the WNA, the United States currently has 99 operating reactors, five reactors under construction, and another 42 reactors on order, planned or proposed. According to the NEI, the United States produced approximately 19.5% of its electricity from nuclear technology in 2014. According to the U.S. Energy Information Agency ( &#147;EIA&#148; ), U.S. utilities purchased approximately 53.3 million pounds of U 3 O 8 in 2014. However, the U.S. only produced approximately 4.9 million pounds (9%). As a result, in 2014, the U.S. filled about 91% of its demand from foreign sources. The EIA estimates that 2015 production is expected to drop to approximately 3.3 million pounds.

Uranium is not traded on an open market or organized commodity exchange such as the London Metal Exchange, although the New York Mercantile Exchange provides financially-settled uranium futures contracts. Typically, buyers and sellers negotiate transactions privately and directly. Spot uranium transactions typically involve deliveries that occur immediately and up to 12 months in the future. Term uranium transactions typically involve deliveries that occur more than 12 months in the future, with long-term transactions involving delivery terms of at least three years. Uranium prices, both spot prices and term prices, are published by two independent market consulting firms, TradeTech and The Ux Consulting Company ( &#147;Ux&#148; ), on a weekly and monthly basis.

The spot and term prices of uranium are influenced by a number of global factors. For example, both the spot and term prices of uranium were impacted by the accident at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Plant in March 2011. The events at Fukushima created heightened concerns regarding the safety of nuclear plants and led to both temporary and permanent closures of nuclear plants around the world. The Fukushima incident has created downward pressure on uranium prices over the past five years, which is still being felt today. Alternatively, China is pursuing an aggressive nuclear program, with 30 units now operating, 24 new units under construction, 42 units which are planned, and 178 units that have been proposed, according to the WNA.

Historically, most nuclear utilities have sought to purchase a portion of their uranium needs through long-term supply contracts, while other portions are bought on the spot market. Like sellers, buyers seek to balance the security of long term supply with the opportunity to take advantage of lower prices caused by volatility in prices. For this reason, both buyers and sellers track current spot and long-term prices for uranium carefully, make considered projections as to future prices, and negotiate with one another on transactions which each deems favorable to their respective interests. According to data from Ux, levels of long-term contracting in 2013, 2014 and 2015 were well below historical averages. 

The graph below shows the monthly spot (blue line) and long-term (red line) uranium price from August 1969 until February 2016 as reported by TradeTech (not adjusted for inflation): 

To give a more recent perspective, the graph below shows the monthly spot (blue line) and long-term (red line) uranium price from January 2010 until February 2016 as reported by TradeTech (not adjusted for inflation): 

According to monthly price data from TradeTech, uranium prices during 2015 were down $1.30, or 3.7% for the year. Monthly spot prices began the year at $35.50 per pound of U 3 O 8 and ended the year at $34.20per pound, reaching a high of $39.40 per pound for the month of March 2015 and a low of $34.20 per pound for the month of December 2015, and dropping to $32.15 per pound on February 29, 2016. According to Trade Tech, the spot price was $28.75 per pound on March 11, 2016. TradeTech price data also indicated that long-term U 3 O 8 prices began 2015 at $50.00 per pound and ended 2015 at $44.00 per pound, reaching a low of $44.00 per pound in August 2015, which persisted through the end of the year. The high long-term price for 2015 was $50.00 per pound. The Company believes the weak uranium markets are the result of excess uranium supplies caused by large quantities of secondary uranium extraction and excess inventories, the availability of low-priced spot material, the delayed restart of Japanese reactors, insufficient cut-backs, premature reactor closures, continued weak uranium demand, and general weakness in the global economy. 

Uranium Market Outlook and Uranium Marketing Strategy 

World demand for clean, reliable, and affordable baseload electricity is growing. As a result of the expected growth of nuclear energy, the Company believes the long-term fundamentals of the uranium industry are positive. The Company believes prices must rise to higher levels to support the new primary production that will be required to meet the increasing demand we expect to see as more nuclear units are constructed around the world. According to TradeTech, world uranium requirements exceed primary mine production, with the gap being bridged by secondary supplies and excess uranium inventories in various forms that have already been mined. As excess inventories are drawn down and as production from existing mines drops, the Company believes primary mine production will be required to meet demand over the long-term. According to data from Ux, long-term contracting levels in 2013, 2014 and 2015 have been low by historical standards. The Company believes uranium prices, and long-term contracting levels in particular, will need to rise to levels that are sufficient to incentivize new mine production. Even if prices rise to these levels, it may be difficult for suppliers to respond in a timely manner, as it typically requires many years of permitting and development to bring new mines into production. The Company expects these permitting and development lead times to put further pressure on prices to increase. 

Despite current market uncertainty and recently falling prices, the Company believes it has begun to see certain early signs of a market recovery. Japanese utilities have begun to restart their reactor fleet (Reuters, August 11, 2015). According to data from TradeTech and the WNA, Chinese utilities continue to aggressively build new reactors and buy uranium. According to TradeTech, the growth of Kazakh uranium production has slowed significantly over the past three years, and is not expected to increase significantly in the coming years. And, in addition to China, according to the WNA, there are large numbers of new reactors under construction and in various stages of planning around the world. 

However in the short- and medium-terms, market challenges remain. The world continues to be oversupplied with uranium, mainly due to large quantities of secondary and other inelastic uranium supplies (including enricher underfeeding), high levels of excess inventories, insufficient producer cut-backs, premature reactor shutdowns, delays in new reactor construction, two large new mines coming into production (Cigar Lake and Husab), and decreased demand due to Japanese reactors remaining offline for longer than expected. In addition, there is a great deal of uncertainty in uranium prices regarding the timing and level of the recovery, as fundamental, political, technical, and other factors could cause prices to be significantly above or below currently expected ranges.

Nevertheless, according to data from Ux, global utilities have significant uncovered uranium requirements over the next 10 years, which the Company expects will increase levels of market activity in the short- and medium-terms. 

The Company&#146;s marketing strategy is to seek a base of earnings and cash flow through sales of a portion of its uranium into term contracts. To gain exposure to increasing uranium prices, the Company seeks to sell a portion of its planned uranium extraction into contracts with market-related formulas (when available) and through future spot and term sales. Further exposure to increasing uranium prices can be generated through the Company&#146;s ability to bring additional uranium extraction online in the future in response to increasing prices, which can be sold on a market-related or fixed basis at then prevailing prices. The Company&#146;s current existing term contracts utilize market-related formulas with base, floor and ceiling prices, some of which are escalated at the rate of inflation. During 2015, the pricing on all of the Company&#146;s term contracts were at their floors or at prices fixed by the contract. Under the Company&#146;s contracts, the Company sold 1,025,000 pounds of U 3 O 8 at a weighted- average price of $57.41 per pound during 2015. The Company also sold 50,000 pounds on the spot market at a price of $37.35 per pound. In 2016, the Company expects to sell a total of 550,000 pounds of U 3 O 8 into its four existing contracts at pricing expected to average approximately $58.11 based on current forecasts of price inflation. Selective spot sales are also expected to be made in 2016 as necessary to generate cash for operations, construction and resource evaluation activities, including continued shaft-sinking and evaluation at the Canyon Project and the construction of additional wellfields at the Nichols Ranch Project. 

The Vanadium Market 

The White Mesa Mill has historically recovered vanadium as a co-product of uranium from certain of its properties on the Colorado Plateau, most notably from the La Sal Project, as well as from properties owned by third-parties on the Colorado Plateau through toll milling and similar arrangements, when the price of vanadium has been high enough to justify its recovery. The Mill&#146;s most recent vanadium recovery occurred in 2013 when it recovered 1.5 million pounds of vanadium. 

According to the market consultant TTP Squared, Inc. ( &#147;TTP&#148; ), the vast majority of vanadium is used in the production of high strength steels (approximately 93%). 3% is used in titanium alloys in aerospace and other applications, and another 4% is used in catalyst and chemical applications. Today, while only a minor quantity of vanadium is used in energy storage applications, there is potential for greatly expanded use of vanadium in emerging battery technologies.

According to data from the Vanadium International Technical Committee compiled by TTP, vanadium consumption in 2014 is estimated to have been in excess of 92,000 metric tons. However, as the demand for high strength, high performance steels increases, and as new uses are developed for lightweight, high strength titanium alloys, vanadium demand can be expected to increase at a faster rate than the growth of global steel production. The average vanadium content in steel in developing countries is much lower than the ratios in the developed countries and can be expected to increase, adding to the demand. If high-capacity batteries using vanadium are commercialized, demand can be expected to increase further. The Company believes the future prospects for vanadium are highly dependent on continued growth in China. 

While demand is expected to grow over time, supply likely has the capacity to increase to meet this demand. Most vanadium is recovered as a byproduct or coproduct of other processes. Many primary producers, in countries such as China, Russia and South Africa, have been shut down due to low prices. Extraction of vanadium from steel making slag has been cut back or halted. As demand increases and prices strengthen, some of these facilities can be expected to restart or increase production, thus moderating any anticipated price increases. 

Vanadium (as V 2 O 5 ) prices were down for 2015, beginning the year at $5.03 per pound, and ending the year at $2.38 per pound. Vanadium prices are currently at $2.85 per pound. 

While long-term demand for vanadium can be expected to increase, it is unknown whether future prices for vanadium will increase due to the relatively high number of low-cost suppliers who may re-enter the market as prices increase. 

Vanadium Marketing 

In the past, Energy Fuels has sold its vanadium both as V 2 O 5 and as ferrovanadium ( &#147;FeV&#148; ) through spot sales to industry end-users and trading companies. No vanadium was recovered or sold by the Company during 2015, and none is expected to be recovered or sold until uranium and/or vanadium prices improve. 

Competition 

The uranium industry is highly competitive. The Company competes with mining and exploration companies for uranium sales, the acquisition of uranium mineral properties, and the procurement of equipment, materials and personnel necessary to explore, develop, and extract uranium from such properties. There is competition for a limited number of uranium acquisition opportunities, including competition with other companies having substantially greater financial resources, staff and facilities than the Company. As a result, the Company may encounter challenges in acquiring attractive properties, and exploring and advancing properties currently in the Company&#146;s portfolio. In addition, Energy Fuels competes with other uranium recovery companies, along with traders, brokers, financial institutions, converters, enrichers, and other market actors, for uranium sales. Due to the Company&#146;s limited capital and personnel and the relative size of its operations, the Company may be at a competitive disadvantage compared to some other companies with regard to exploration and, if warranted, development of mining properties and securing uranium sales. The Company believes that competition for acquiring mineral prospects and completing uranium sales will continue to be intense in the future.

The availability of funds for exploration, evaluation, permitting and construction of uranium projects is limited, and the Company may find it difficult to compete with larger and more established uranium exploration and production companies for capital. The Company&#146;s inability to continue exploration, advancement, and the acquisition of new properties due to lack of funding could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s future operations and financial position.

Government Regulation 

The Company&#146;s properties and facilities are subject to extensive laws and regulations which are overseen and enforced by multiple federal, state and local authorities. These laws govern exploration, construction, extraction, recovery, processing, exports, various taxes, labor standards, occupational health and safety, waste disposal, protection and remediation of the environment, protection of endangered and protected species, toxic and hazardous substances, and other matters. Uranium minerals exploration, extraction, recovery, and processing are also subject to risks and liabilities associated with pollution of the environment and disposal of waste products occurring as a result of such activities. 

Compliance with these laws and regulations may impose substantial costs on the Company and will subject the Company to significant potential liabilities. Changes in these regulations could require the Company to expend significant resources to comply with new laws or regulations or changes to current requirements and could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s business operations. 

Environmental Regulations 

Exploration, development, and extraction activities are subject to certain environmental regulations which may prevent or delay the continuance of our activities. In general, our exploration, evaluation, and extraction activities are subject to certain federal and state laws and regulations relating to environmental quality and pollution control. Such laws and regulations increase the costs of these activities and may prevent or delay the commencement or continuance of a given operation. Specifically, we are subject to legislation regarding emissions into the environment, water discharges, and storage and disposition of hazardous wastes. In addition, legislation has been enacted which requires facility sites to be abandoned and reclaimed in accordance with such legislation. Compliance with these laws and regulations has not had a material effect on our operations or financial condition to date.

Uranium milling in the U.S. is primarily regulated by the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the &#147; NRC &#148;) pursuant to the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 , as amended. Its primary function is to ensure the protection of employees, the public, and the environment from radioactive materials, and it also regulates most aspects of the uranium recovery process. The NRC regulations pertaining to uranium recovery facilities are codified in Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations.

On August 16, 2004, the State of Utah became an Agreement State for the regulation of uranium mills. This means that the primary regulator for the White Mesa Mill is now the State of Utah Department of Environmental Quality (&#147; UDEQ &#148;) rather than the NRC. At that time, the Mill&#146;s NRC Source Material License was transferred to the State of Utah and became a Radioactive Materials License. The State of Utah incorporates, through its own regulations or by reference, all aspects of Title 10 pertaining to uranium recovery facilities. When the State of Utah became an Agreement State, it required that a Groundwater Discharge Permit (&#147; GWDP &#148;) be put in place for the White Mesa Mill. The GWDP is required for all similar facilities in the State of Utah, and specifically tailors the implementation of the state groundwater regulations to the Mill site. The State of Utah requires that every operating uranium mill have a GWDP, regardless of whether or not the facility discharges to groundwater. The GWDP for the Mill was finalized and implemented in March 2005. The White Mesa Mill also maintains a permit approval for air emissions with the UDEQ, Division of Air Quality. 

Conventional uranium extraction is subject to regulation by a number of agencies including (1) local county and municipal government agencies; (2) the applicable state divisions responsible for mining and protecting the environment within Utah, Colorado, Arizona, New Mexico, and Wyoming; (3) the BLM and the United States Forest Service (the &#147; USFS &#148;) on public lands under their jurisdiction; (4) the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration (&#147; MSHA &#148;); (5) the United States Environmental Protection Agency (the &#147; EPA &#148;) for radon emissions from underground mines; and (6) other federal agencies (e.g., U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, U.S. Army Corp. of Engineers, DOE), where certain conditions exist. In addition, a uranium processing facility at the Sheep Mountain Project will be subject to regulation under the NRC, as a uranium processing facility and for permanent disposal of the resulting tailings.

The provisions of the Atomic Energy Act and its regulations that are applicable to uranium milling also apply to our ISR facilities in Wyoming. The Nichols Ranch Project has a Source Material licensed issued by the NRC. ISR facilities in Wyoming are also regulated by the State of Wyoming and the EPA under the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. In addition, ISR wellfields require an Underground Injection Control Permit under the Safe Drinking Water Act, as administered by the EPA. ISR operations, such as the Nichols Ranch Project, are subject to regulations by the U.S. Occupational, Safety and Health Administration ( &#147;OSHA&#148; ), rather than MSHA. 

Reclamation bonds or the equivalent have been posted for each of the Company&#146;s material properties that have structures or facilities.

Energy Fuels is required to have export licenses issued by the NRC for its uranium exports. Such licenses are obtained by the Company as required. 

Land Tenure 

The Company&#146;s land holdings are held either by leases from the fee simple owners (private parties or the State) or unpatented mining claims located on property owned and managed by the U.S. Federal Government. Annual fees must be paid to maintain unpatented mining claims, but work expenditures are not required. Holders of unpatented mining claims are generally granted surface access to conduct mineral exploration and extraction activities. However, additional permits and plans are generally required prior to conducting exploration or mining activities on such claims. 

On July 9, 2009, BLM issued a Notice of Proposed Withdrawal ( &#147;2009 Notice&#148; ) under which it proposed that a total of approximately one million acres of public lands around the Grand Canyon National Park be withdrawn from location and entry under the Mining Law of 1872 (the &#147;Mining Law&#148; ), subject to valid existing rights. In the 2009 Notice, BLM stated that the purpose of the withdrawal, if determined to be appropriate, would be to protect the Grand Canyon watershed from any adverse effects of locatable hardrock mineral exploration and mining. The 2009 Notice segregated the lands from location and entry under the mining laws for up to two years to allow time for various studies and analyses, including appropriate NEPA analysis. In order to allow more time for BLM to complete its NEPA analysis, the U.S. Department of the Interior (the &#147;DOI&#148; ) published Public Land Order 7773 on June 21, 2011, which affected a six-month emergency withdrawal of the area. The emergency withdrawal prevented the lands from opening to location and entry under the Mining Law upon expiration of the two-year segregation while the DOI completed the decision&#150;making process on the proposed withdrawal. The emergency withdrawal was effective July 21, 2011 to January 20, 2012. During the two-year segregation and six month emergency withdrawal, the BLM, along with its cooperating agencies, completed various studies and analyses of resources in the withdrawal area, including an EIS under NEPA. These studies and analyses were undertaken to provide the basis for the final decision regarding whether or not to proceed with the proposed withdrawal or to select an alternative action. Based on this analysis, on January 9, 2012, the DOI announced its final decision to withdraw from location and entry under the Mining Law, subject to valid existing rights, the total of approximately one million acres of lands originally proposed in the 2009 Notice (the &#147;Withdrawn Lands&#148; ), for a 20-year period. Lawsuits challenging this decision have been filed by various industry groups and interested parties. 

No new mining claims may be filed on the Withdrawn Lands and no new Plans of Operations may be approved, other than Plans of Operations on mining claims that were valid at the time of withdrawal and that remain valid at the time of plan approval. Whether or not a mining claim is valid must be determined by a mineral examination conducted by BLM or USFS, as applicable. The mineral examination, which involves an economic evaluation of a project, must demonstrate the existence of a locatable mineral resource and that the mineral resource constitutes the discovery of a valuable mineral deposit. 

All of the Company&#146;s properties located on the Arizona Strip, with the exception of its Wate property and certain exploration properties held by the Company&#146;s subsidiary, Arizona Strip Partners LLC, are located within the Withdrawn Lands. A mineral examination on the Company&#146;s EZ Project will need to be completed by BLM, in conjunction with its review of the Company&#146;s proposed Plan of Operations for that project. Mineral examinations were not required for the Company&#146;s Arizona 1 and Pinenut projects, which had previously approved Plans of Operations and were recently active. Although the Company&#146;s Canyon Project also has an approved Plan of Operation, and a mineral examination is not required, the USFS performed a mineral examination on that project in 2012 and concluded that the Canyon Project&#146;s claims constitute valid existing rights. The USFS also concluded that no additional approvals are required on the Canyon Project. 

The Company believes that all of its material projects within the Withdrawn Lands are on valid mining claims that will each withstand a mineral examination. However, market conditions may postpone or prevent the performance of mineral examinations on certain properties and, if a mineral examination is performed on a property, there can be no guarantee that the mineral examination would not result in one of more of the Company&#146;s mining claims being considered invalid, which could prevent a project from proceeding.

In addition, there are efforts underway that have the potential to create a National Monument on the Withdrawn Lands, and additional lands, near the Grand Canyon National Park. These efforts include proposed legislation which has been introduced in Congress and lobbying of the President of the United States to create a National Monument utilizing his executive powers under the Antiquities Act of 1906. All of the Company&#146;s projects, except the Wate Project, are located on lands which have the potential to be included in a National Monument. If such a National Monument is created, there is the potential that these projects could become subject to additional requirements and/or costs, or be prevented from proceeding.
