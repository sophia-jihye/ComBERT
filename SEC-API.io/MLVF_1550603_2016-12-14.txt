 Item 1. Business 

&#160; 

Historical Development of Business 

&#160; 

Malvern Bancorp, Inc., a Pennsylvania corporation (the &#8220;Company&#8221; or &#8220;Malvern Bancorp&#8221;), is the holding company for Malvern Federal Savings Bank (&#8220;Malvern Federal Savings&#8221; or the &#8220;Bank&#8221;) and owns all of the issued and outstanding shares of the common stock of the Bank. In connection with the &#8220;second-step&#8221; conversion and reorganization which we completed in October 2012, 3,636,875 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Malvern Bancorp were sold in a subscription offering to certain depositors of the Bank and other investors for $10 per share, or $36.4 million in the aggregate, and 2,921,598 shares of common stock were issued in exchange for the outstanding shares of common stock of the former federally chartered mid-tier holding company, Malvern Federal Bancorp, Inc. (the &#8220;Mid-Tier Holding Company&#8221;), held by the &#8220;public&#8221; shareholders of the Mid-Tier Holding Company (all shareholders except Malvern Federal Mutual Holding Company).

&#160;

The Bank has one subsidiary, Strategic Asset Management Group, Inc. (&#8220;SAMG&#8221;), a Pennsylvania corporation. SAMG holds a 50% ownership interest in Malvern Insurance Associates, LLC (&#8220;Malvern Insurance&#8221;), a Pennsylvania limited liability company. Malvern Insurance is a licensed insurance broker under Pennsylvania law.

&#160;

During September 2014, the Bank and Malvern Bancorp dissolved two former investment subsidiaries, Malvern Federal Holdings, Inc. and Malvern Federal Investments, Inc., both of which were Delaware corporations that held and managed certain investment securities.

&#160; 

Malvern Federal Savings Bank is a federally chartered, FDIC-insured savings bank that was originally organized in 1887. The Bank conducts business from its headquarters in Paoli, Pennsylvania, a suburb of Philadelphia, as well as eight other financial centers located throughout Chester and Delaware Counties, Pennsylvania and a Private Banking Loan Production headquarters office in Morristown, New Jersey.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

The Bank&#8217;s principal business consists of attracting deposits from businesses and the general public primarily in Chester County, Pennsylvania and investing those deposits, together with borrowings and funds generated from operations, in one- to four-family residential real estate loans, construction and development loans, commercial and multi-family real estate loans, commercial business loans, home equity loans and lines of credit and other consumer loans, as well as investing in investment securities. In addition to Chester County, our lending efforts are focused in neighboring Bucks County, Montgomery County and Delaware County, which are also in southeastern Pennsylvania, New Jersey and the New York metropolitan marketplace. We also service client needs in the greater Philadelphia market area. Our primary market niche is providing personalized service to our client base.

&#160;

The Bank&#8217;s revenues are derived principally from interest on loans and investment securities, loan commitment and customer service fees and our mortgage banking operation. Our primary sources of funds are deposits, borrowings and principal and interest payments on loans and securities, as well as the sale of residential loans in the secondary market both with servicing retained and released. The Bank&#8217;s primary expenses are interest expense on deposits and borrowings, provisions for loan losses and general operating expenses. 

&#160;

SEC Reports and Corporate Governance 

&#160; 

The Company makes its Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments thereto available on its website at www.malvernfederal.com without charge as soon as reasonably practicable after filing or furnishing them to the SEC. Also available on the website are the Company&#8217;s corporate code of ethics that applies to all of the Company&#8217;s employees, including principal officers and directors, and charters for the Audit Committee, Compensation Committee and Nominating Committee.

&#160;

Additionally, the Company will provide without charge, a copy of its Annual Report on Form 10-K to any shareholder by mail. Requests should be sent to Malvern Bancorp, Inc., Attention: Shareholder Relations, 42 East Lancaster Avenue, Paoli, Pennsylvania, 19301 and our telephone number is (610) 644-9400.

&#160;

Market Area and Competition 

&#160;

The banking business is highly competitive. We face substantial immediate competition and potential future competition both in attracting deposits and in originating loans. We compete with numerous commercial banks, savings banks and savings and loan associations, many of which have assets, capital and lending limits larger than those that we have. Other competitors include money market mutual funds, mortgage bankers, insurance companies, stock brokerage firms, regulated small loan companies, credit unions and issuers of commercial paper and other securities.

&#160;

Our larger competitors have greater financial resources to finance wide-ranging advertising campaigns.

&#160;

Additionally, we endeavor to compete for business by providing high quality, personal service to customers, customer access to our decision-makers and competitive interest rates and fees. We seek to hire and retain quality employees who desire greater responsibility than may be available working for a larger employer. Additionally, the local real estate and other business activities of our Directors help us develop business relationships by increasing our profile in our communities.

&#160;

Product and Services 

&#160; 

We derive substantially all of our income from our net interest income (i.e., the difference between the interest we receive on our loans and securities and the interest we pay on deposits and other borrowings). We offer a broad range of deposit and loan products. In addition, to attract the business of consumer and business customers, we also provide a broad array of other banking services. Products and services provided include personal and business checking accounts, retirement accounts, money market accounts, time and savings accounts, credit cards, wire transfers, access to automated teller services, internet banking, ACH origination, telephone banking, and mobile banking by phone. In addition, we offer safe deposit boxes. The Bank also offers remote deposit capture banking for business customers, providing the ability to electronically scan and transmit checks for deposit, reducing time and cost. In addition the Bank offers mobile remote deposit capture banking for both retail and business customers, providing the convenience to deposit on the go.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Checking account products consist of both retail and business demand deposit products. Retail products include free checking and, for businesses, both interest-bearing accounts, which require a minimum balance, and non-interest bearing accounts. NOW accounts consist of both retail and business interest-bearing transaction accounts that have minimum balance requirements. Money market accounts consist of products that provide a market rate of interest to depositors but have limited check writing capabilities. Our savings accounts consist of statement type accounts. Time deposits consist of certificates of deposit, including those held in IRA accounts. CDARS/ICS Reciprocal deposits are offered based with the Bank&#8217;s participation in Promontory Interfinancial Network, LLC. Customers who are FDIC insurance sensitive are able to place large dollar deposits with the Company and the Company uses CDARS to place those funds into certificates of deposit issued by other banks in the Network. This occurs in increments of less than the FDIC insurance limits so that both the principal and interest are eligible for complete FDIC insurance coverage. The FDIC currently considers these funds as brokered deposits.

&#160;

The Bank, through its partnership with Bell Rock Capital, offers through its private banking and wealth management division personalized wealth management and advisory services to high net worth individuals and families. Services provided include liquidity management, investment services, custody, wealth planning, trust and fiduciary services, insurance and 401k services.

&#160;

Deposits serve as the primary source of funding for our interest-earning assets, but also generate non-interest revenue through insufficient funds fees, stop payment fees, safe deposit rental fees, card income, including ATM fees and credit and debit card interchange, gift card fees, and other miscellaneous fees. In addition, the Bank generates additional non-interest revenue associated with residential loan origination and sale, loan servicing, late fees and merchant services.

&#160;

We offer personal and commercial business loans on a secured and unsecured basis, revolving lines of credit, commercial mortgage loans, and residential mortgages on both primary and secondary residences, home equity loans, bridge loans and other personal purpose loans. However, we are not and have not historically been a participant in the sub-prime lending market.

&#160;

Commercial loans are loans made for business purposes and are primarily secured by collateral such as cash balances with the Bank, marketable securities held by or under the control of the Bank, business assets including accounts receivable, inventory and equipment, and liens on commercial and residential real estate.

&#160;

Commercial construction loans are loans to finance the construction of commercial or residential properties secured by first liens on such properties. Commercial real estate loans include loans secured by first liens on completed commercial properties, including multi-family properties, to purchase or refinance such properties. Residential mortgages include loans secured by first liens on residential real estate, and are generally made to existing customers of the Bank to purchase or refinance primary and secondary residences. Home equity loans and lines of credit include loans secured by first or second liens on residential real estate for primary or secondary residences.

&#160;

Consumer loans are made to individuals who qualify for auto loans, cash reserve, credit cards and installment loans.

&#160;

The Bank&#8217;s lending policies generally provide for lending inside of our primary market area. However, the Bank will make loans to persons outside of our primary trade area when we deem it prudent to do so. In an effort to promote a high degree of asset quality, the Bank focuses primarily upon offering secured loans. However, the Bank does make unsecured loans to borrowers with high net worth and income profiles. The Bank generally requires loan customers to maintain deposit accounts with the Bank. In addition, the Bank generally provides for a minimum required rate of interest in its variable rate loans. We believe that having senior management on-site allows for an enhanced local presence and rapid decision-making that attracts borrowers . The Bank&#8217;s legal lending limit to any one borrower is 15% of the Banks&#8217;s capital base (defined as tangible equity plus the allowance for loan losses) for most loans ($13.6 million) and 25% of the capital base for loans secured by readily marketable collateral ($22.6 million). At September 30, 2016, the Bank&#8217;s largest committed relationship totaled $10.0 million.

&#160;

Our business model includes using industry best practices for community banks, including personalized service, state-of-the-art technology and extended hours. We believe that this will generate deposit accounts with larger average balances than we might attract otherwise. We also use pricing techniques in our efforts to attract banking relationships having larger than average balances.

&#160; 

Supervision and Regulation 

&#160;

The banking industry is highly regulated. Earnings of the Company are affected by state and federal laws and regulations and by policies of various regulatory authorities. Changes in applicable law or in the policies of various regulatory authorities could affect materially the business and prospects of the Company and the Bank. The following discussion of supervision and regulation is qualified in its entirety by reference to the statutory and regulatory provisions discussed.

&#160;

On October 7, 2014, the Bank entered into a formal written agreement (the &#8220;Formal Agreement&#8221;) with the OCC. The Formal Agreement was terminated effective January 21, 2016. As a result of such termination, the Bank is no longer considered to be in &#8220;troubled condition.&#8221;

&#160;

Dodd-Frank Act 

&#160;

On July 21, 2010, Congress enacted the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the &#8220;Dodd-Frank Act&#8221;). The Dodd-Frank Act has significantly changed the bank regulatory structure and significantly impacted the lending, deposit, investment, trading and operating activities of financial institutions and their holding companies. The Dodd-Frank Act requires various federal agencies to adopt a broad range of new implementing rules and regulations, and to prepare numerous studies and reports for Congress. The federal agencies have been given significant discretion in drafting the implementing rules and regulations, and consequently, many of the details and future impact of the Dodd-Frank Act may not be known for many more months or years. The discussion below generally discusses the material provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act applicable to the Company and the Bank and is not complete or meant to be an exhaustive discussion.

&#160;

The following aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act are related to the operations of the Bank:

&#160;

&#183; A new independent consumer financial protection bureau was established within the Federal Reserve Board, empowered to exercise broad regulatory, supervisory and enforcement authority with respect to both new and existing consumer financial protection laws. Smaller financial institutions, like the Bank, are subject to the supervision and enforcement of their primary federal banking regulator with respect to the federal consumer financial protection laws. &#160;

&#183; Tier 1 capital treatment for &#8220;hybrid&#8221; capital items like trust preferred securities was eliminated subject to various grandfathering and transition rules. &#160;

&#183; The prohibition on payment of interest on demand deposits was repealed. &#160;

&#183; State consumer financial law is preempted only if it would have a discriminatory effect on a federal savings association, prevents or significantly interferes with the exercise by a federal savings association of its powers or is preempted by any other federal law. The OCC must make a preemption determination on a case-by-case basis with respect to a particular state law or another state law with substantively equivalent terms. &#160;

&#183; Deposit insurance has been permanently increased to $250,000. &#160;

&#183; Deposit insurance assessment base calculation equals the depository institution&#8217;s total assets minus the sum of its average tangible equity during the assessment period. &#160;

&#183; The minimum reserve ratio of the Deposit Insurance Fund increased to 1.35 percent of estimated annual insured deposits or assessment base; however, the FDIC was directed to &#8220;offset the effect&#8221; of the increased reserve ratio for insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion. &#160; 

The following aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act are related to the operations of the Company:

&#160;

&#183; Authority over savings and loan holding companies transferred to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the &#8220;Federal Reserve Board&#8221; or the &#8220;FRB&#8221;). &#160;

&#160; -4- &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; The Home Owners&#8217; Loan Act was amended to provide that leverage capital requirements and risk-based capital requirements applicable to depository institutions and bank holding companies were extended to thrift holding companies. &#160;

&#183; The Federal Deposit Insurance Act was amended to direct federal regulators to require depository institution holding companies to serve as a source of strength for their depository institution subsidiaries. &#160;

&#183; Public companies are required to provide their shareholders with a non-binding vote: (i) at least once every three years on the compensation paid to executive officers, and (ii) at least once every six years on whether they should have a &#8220;say on pay&#8221; vote every one, two or three years. &#160;

&#183; A separate, non-binding shareholder vote is required regarding golden parachutes for named executive officers when a shareholder vote takes place on mergers, acquisitions, dispositions or other transactions that would trigger the parachute payments. &#160;

&#183; Securities exchanges are required to prohibit brokers from using their own discretion to vote shares not beneficially owned by them for certain &#8220;significant&#8221; matters, which include votes on the election of directors, executive compensation matters, and any other matter determined to be significant. &#160;

&#183; Stock exchanges, which includes the Nasdaq, will be prohibited from listing the securities of any issuer that does not have a policy providing for (i) disclosure of its policy on incentive compensation payable on the basis of financial information reportable under the securities laws, and (ii) the recovery from current or former executive officers, following an accounting restatement triggered by material noncompliance with securities law reporting requirements, of any incentive compensation paid erroneously during the three-year period preceding the date on which the restatement was required that exceeds the amount that would have been paid on the basis of the restated financial information. &#160;

&#183; Disclosure in annual proxy materials will be required concerning the relationship between the executive compensation paid and the financial performance of the issuer. &#160;

&#183; Item 402 of Regulation S-K has been amended to require companies to disclose the ratio of the Chief Executive Officer&#8217;s annual total compensation to the median annual total compensation of all other employees. This information must be reported for the first time for the first full fiscal year beginning on or after January 1, 2017. &#160;

Regulation of Malvern Bancorp, Inc. 

&#160;

Holding Company Acquisitions . Malvern Bancorp is a savings and loan holding company under the Home Owners&#8217; Loan Act, as amended, and is subject to examination and supervision by the Federal Reserve Board. Federal law generally prohibits a savings and loan holding company, without prior FRB approval, from acquiring the ownership or control of any other savings institution or savings and loan holding company, or all, or substantially all, of the assets or more than 5% of the voting shares of the savings institution or savings and loan holding company. These provisions also prohibit, among other things, any director or officer of a savings and loan holding company, or any individual who owns or controls more than 25% of the voting shares of such holding company, from acquiring control of any savings institution not a subsidiary of such savings and loan holding company, unless the acquisition is approved by the FRB.

&#160;

The FRB may not approve any acquisition that would result in a multiple savings and loan holding company controlling savings institutions in more than one state, subject to two exceptions: (1) the approval of interstate supervisory acquisitions by savings and loan holding companies; and (2) the acquisition of a savings institution in another state if the laws of the state of the target savings institution specifically permit such acquisitions. The states vary in the extent to which they permit interstate savings and loan holding company acquisitions.

&#160;

Holding Company Activities. Malvern Bancorp operates as a unitary savings and loan holding company and is permitted to engage only in the activities permitted for financial institution holding companies or for multiple savings and loan holding companies. Multiple savings and loan holding companies are permitted to engage in the following activities: (i) activities permitted for a bank holding company under section 4(c) of the Bank Holding Company Act (unless the Federal Reserve Board prohibits or limits such 4(c) activities); (ii) furnishing or performing management services for a subsidiary savings association; (iii) conducting any insurance agency or escrow business; (iv) holding, managing, or liquidating assets owned by or acquired from a subsidiary savings association; (v) holding or managing properties used or occupied by a subsidiary savings association; (vi) acting as trustee under deeds of trust; or (vii) activities authorized by regulation as of March 5, 1987, to be engaged in by multiple savings and loan holding companies.

&#160;

&#160; -5- &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Under recently enacted legislation, savings and loan holding companies became subject to statutory capital requirements. However, in May 2015, amendments to the Federal Reserve Board&#8217;s small bank holding company policy statement (the &#8220;SBHC Policy&#8221;) became effective. The amendments made the SBHC Policy applicable to savings and loan holding companies such as Malvern Bancorp, and increased the asset threshold to qualify to be subject to the provisions of the SBHC Policy from $500 million to $1 billion. Savings and loan holding companies that have total assets of $1 billion or less are subject to the SBHC Policy and are not required to comply with the regulatory capital requirements set forth in the table below. Such treatment continues until Malvern Bancorp&#8217;s total assets exceed $1 billion or the Federal Reserve Board deems it to no longer be a small savings and loan holding company. However, if Malvern Bancorp had been subject to the requirements, it would have been in compliance with them as of September 30, 2016.

&#160;

Certain of the savings and loan holding company capital requirements promulgated by the FRB in 2013 became effective as of January 1, 2015. Those requirements establish the following four minimum capital ratios that savings and loan holding companies not subject to the SBHC Policy must comply with as of that date:

&#160;

Capital Ratio &#160; Regulatory Minimum &#160; Common Equity Tier 1 Capital &#160; &#160; 4.5 % Tier 1 Leverage Capital &#160; &#160; 4.0 % Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital &#160; &#160; 6.0 % Total Risk-Based Capital &#160; &#160; 8.0 % &#160;

The leverage capital requirement is calculated as a percentage of total assets and the other three capital requirements are calculated as a percentage of risk-weighted assets. For a more detailed discussion of current capital rules, see &#8220;Regulatory Capital Requirements&#8221; under &#8220;Regulation of Malvern Federal Savings Bank&#8221; below.

&#160;

While there are no specific restrictions on the payment of dividends or other capital distributions for savings and loan holding companies, federal regulations do prescribe such restrictions on subsidiary savings institutions, as described below. Malvern Federal Savings Bank is required to notify the Federal Reserve Board 30 days before declaring any dividend. In addition, the financial impact of a holding company on its subsidiary institution is a matter that is evaluated by the Federal Reserve Board and the agency has authority to order cessation of activities or divestiture of subsidiaries deemed to pose a threat to the safety and soundness of the institution.

&#160;

All savings associations that are subsidiaries of savings and loan holding companies are required to meet a qualified thrift lender, or QTL, test to avoid certain restrictions on their operations. If the subsidiary savings institution fails to meet the QTL, as discussed below, then the savings and loan holding company must register with the Federal Reserve Board as a bank holding company, unless the savings institution requalifies as a QTL within one year thereafter.

&#160;

Federal Securities Laws . Malvern Bancorp&#8217;s common stock is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission under Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Malvern Bancorp is subject to the proxy and tender offer rules, insider trading reporting requirements and restrictions, and certain other requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

&#160;

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act. As a public company, Malvern Bancorp is subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 which addresses, among other issues, corporate governance, auditing and accounting, executive compensation, and enhanced and timely disclosure of corporate information. As directed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer are required to certify that our quarterly and annual reports do not contain any untrue statement of a material fact. The rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act have several requirements, including having these officers certify that: they are responsible for establishing, maintaining and regularly evaluating the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting; they have made certain disclosures to our auditors and the audit committee of the Board of Directors about our internal control over financial reporting; and they have included information in our quarterly and annual reports about their evaluation and whether there have been changes in our internal control over financial reporting or in other factors that could materially affect internal control over financial reporting.

&#160;

Volcker Rule Regulations 

&#160;

Regulations adopted by the federal banking agencies to implement the provisions of the Dodd Frank Act commonly referred to as the Volcker Rule contain prohibitions and restrictions on the ability of financial institution holding companies and their affiliates to engage in proprietary trading and to hold certain interests in, or to have certain relationships with, various types of investment funds, including hedge funds and private equity funds. The Company is in compliance with the various provisions of the Volcker Rule.

&#160;

Regulation of Malvern Federal Savings Bank 

&#160; 

General. Malvern Federal Savings Bank is subject to the regulation of the OCC, as its primary federal regulator and the FDIC, as the insurer of its deposit accounts, and, to a limited extent, the Federal Reserve Board. As the primary federal regulator of Malvern Federal Savings Bank, the OCC has extensive authority over the operations of federally chartered savings institutions. As part of this authority, Malvern Federal Savings Bank is required to file periodic reports with the OCC and is subject to periodic examinations by the OCC and the FDIC. The investment and lending authorities of savings institutions are prescribed by federal laws and regulations, and such institutions are prohibited from engaging in any activities not permitted by such laws and regulations. Such regulation and supervision is primarily intended for the protection of depositors and the Deposit Insurance Fund, administered by the FDIC.

&#160;

The OCC&#8217;s enforcement authority over all savings institutions includes, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, to issue cease and desist or removal orders and to initiate injunctive actions. In general, these enforcement actions may be initiated for violations of laws and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices. Other actions or inactions may provide the basis for enforcement action, including misleading or untimely reports filed with the OCC.

&#160;

Insurance of Accounts. The deposits of Malvern Federal Savings Bank are insured to the maximum extent permitted by the Deposit Insurance Fund and are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government. As insurer, the FDIC is authorized to conduct examinations of, and to require reporting by, insured institutions. It also may prohibit any insured institution from engaging in any activity determined by regulation or order to pose a serious threat to the FDIC. The FDIC also has the authority to initiate enforcement actions against savings institutions, after giving the OCC an opportunity to take such action.

&#160;

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation&#8217;s risk-based premium system provides for quarterly assessments. Each insured institution is placed in one of four risk categories depending on supervisory and capital considerations. Within its risk category, an institution is assigned to an initial base assessment rate which is then adjusted to determine its final assessment rate based on its brokered deposits, secured liabilities and unsecured debt. To implement the Dodd Frank Act, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation amended its deposit insurance regulations (1) to change the assessment base for insurance from domestic deposits to average assets minus average tangible equity and (2) to lower overall assessment rates. The revised assessments rates are between 2.5 to 9 basis points for banks in the lowest risk category and between 30 to 45 basis points for banks in the highest risk category.

&#160;

In addition, all institutions with deposits insured by the FDIC are required to pay assessments to fund interest payments on bonds issued by the Financing Corporation, or FICO, a mixed-ownership government corporation established to recapitalize the predecessor to the Deposit Insurance Fund. These assessments will continue until the Financing Corporation bonds mature in 2019.

&#160;

The FDIC may terminate the deposit insurance of any insured depository institution, including the Bank, if it determines after a hearing that the institution has engaged or is engaging in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, order or any condition imposed by an agreement with the FDIC. It also may suspend deposit insurance temporarily during the hearing process for the permanent termination of insurance, if the institution has no tangible capital. If insurance of accounts is terminated, the accounts at the institution at the time of the termination, less subsequent withdrawals, shall continue to be insured for a period of six months to two years, as determined by the FDIC. Management is not aware of any existing circumstances which could result in termination of the Bank&#8217;s deposit insurance.

&#160;

&#160; -7- &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

As noted above, the Dodd Frank Act raises the minimum reserve ratio of the Deposit Insurance Fund from 1.15% to 1.35% and requires the FDIC to offset the effect of this increase on insured institutions with assets of less than $10 billion (small institutions). The FDIC has adopted a rule to accomplish this by imposing a surcharge on larger institutions commencing when the reserve ratio reaches 1.15% and ending when it reaches 1.35%. The reserve ratio reached 1.15% on June 30, 2016. Accordingly, surcharges began on July 1, 2016. Small institutions will receive credits for the portion of their regular assessments that contributed to growth in the reserve ratio between 1.15% and 1.35%. The credits will apply for each quarter the reserve ratio is above 1.38%, in amounts as determined by the FDIC . 

&#160;

Regulatory Capital Requirements . Federally insured savings institutions are required to maintain minimum levels of regulatory capital. The OCC has established capital standards consisting of a &#8220;tangible capital requirement,&#8221; a &#8220;leverage capital requirement&#8221; and &#8220;a risk-based capital requirement.&#8221; The OCC also is authorized to impose capital requirements in excess of these standards on individual institutions on a case-by-case basis.

&#160;

In July of 2013 the respective U.S. federal banking agencies issued final rules implementing Basel III and the Dodd-Frank Act capital requirements to be fully phased in on a global basis on January 1, 2019. The new regulations establish a new tangible common equity capital requirement, increase the minimum requirement for the current Tier 1 risk-weighted asset (&#8220;RWA&#8221;) ratio, phase out certain kinds of intangibles treated as capital and certain types of instruments and change the risk weightings of certain assets used to determine required capital ratios. The new common equity Tier 1 capital component requires capital of the highest quality &#8211; predominantly composed of retained earnings and common stock instruments. For community banks such as Malvern Federal Savings Bank, a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5% became effective on January 1, 2015. The new capital rules also increased the current minimum Tier 1 capital ratio from 4.0% to 6.0% beginning on January 1, 2015. In addition, in order to make capital distributions and pay discretionary bonuses to executive officers without restriction, an institution must also maintain greater than 2.5% in common equity attributable to a capital conservation buffer to be phased in from January 1, 2016 until January 1, 2019. The new rules also increased the risk weights for several categories of assets, including an increase from 100% to 150% for certain acquisition, development and construction loans and more than 90-day past due exposures. The new capital rules maintain the general structure of the prompt corrective action rules, but incorporate the new common equity Tier 1 capital requirement and the increased Tier 1 RWA requirement into the prompt corrective action framework.

&#160;

Savings institutions such as Malvern Federal Savings Bank are currently required to satisfy the following capital requirements:

&#160;

&#183; Tangible capital requirement &#8211; &#8220;tangible&#8221; capital equal to at least 1.5% of adjusted total assets; &#160;

&#183; Common equity Tier 1 capital requirement &#8211; generally consists of retained earnings and common stock instruments equal to at least 4.5% of &#8220;risk weighted&#8221; assets; &#160;

&#183; Tier 1 capital requirement &#8211; equal to at least 6.0%; &#160;

&#183; leverage capital requirement &#8211; &#8220;core&#8221; capital equal to at least 3.0% of adjusted total assets for the most highly rated institutions; &#160;

&#183; an additional &#8220;cushion&#8221; of at least 100 basis points of core capital for all but the most highly rated savings associations effectively increasing their minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio to 4.0% or more; and &#160;

&#183; risk-based capital requirement &#8211; &#8220;total&#8221; capital (a combination of core and &#8220;supplementary&#8221; capital) equal to at least 8.0% of &#8220;risk-weighted&#8221; assets. &#160;

Core capital generally consists of common stockholders' equity (including retained earnings). Tangible capital generally equals core capital minus intangible assets, with only a limited exception for purchased mortgage servicing rights. Malvern Federal Savings Bank had no intangible assets at September 30, 2016. Both core and tangible capital are further reduced by an amount equal to a savings institution&#8217;s debt and equity investments in subsidiaries engaged in activities not permissible to national banks (other than subsidiaries engaged in activities undertaken as agent for customers or in mortgage banking activities and subsidiary depository institutions or their holding companies). These adjustments do not affect Malvern Federal Savings Bank&#8217;s regulatory capital.

&#160;

In determining compliance with the risk-based capital requirement, a savings institution is allowed to include both core capital and supplementary capital in its total capital, provided that the amount of supplementary capital included does not exceed the savings institution&#8217;s core capital. Supplementary capital generally consists of general allowances for loan losses up to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets, together with certain other items. In determining the required amount of risk-based capital, total assets, including certain off-balance sheet items, are multiplied by a risk weight based on the risks inherent in the type of assets. The risk weights range from 0% for cash and securities issued by the U.S. Government or unconditionally backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government to 100% for loans (other than qualifying residential loans weighted at 80%) and repossessed assets.

&#160;

Savings institutions must value securities available for sale at amortized cost for regulatory capital purposes. This means that in computing regulatory capital, savings institutions should add back any unrealized losses and deduct any unrealized gains, net of income taxes, on debt securities reported as a separate component of GAAP capital.

&#160;

The table below sets forth Malvern Federal Savings Bank's capital position relative to the OCC&#8217;s regulatory capital requirements at September 30, 2016. Malvern Bancorp is not subject to the regulatory capital ratios imposed by the Dodd-Frank Act on savings and loan holding companies because it was deemed to be a small savings and loan holding company as of September 30, 2016.

Any savings institution that fails any of the capital requirements is subject to possible enforcement actions by the OCC or the FDIC. Such actions could include a capital directive, a cease and desist order, civil money penalties, the establishment of restrictions on the institution&#8217;s operations, termination of federal deposit insurance and the appointment of a conservator or receiver. The OCC&#8217;s capital regulation provides that such actions, through enforcement proceedings or otherwise, could require one or more of a variety of corrective actions.

&#160;

Prompt Corrective Action . The following table shows the amount of capital associated with the different capital categories set forth in the prompt corrective action regulations.

&#160;

Capital Category &#160; Total Risk-Based Capital &#160; Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital &#160; Common Equity Tier 1 Capital &#160; Tier 1 Leverage Capital Well capitalized &#160; 10% or more &#160; 8% or more &#160; 6.5% or more &#160; 5% or more Adequately capitalized &#160; 8% or more &#160; 6% or more &#160; 4.5% or more &#160; 4% or more Undercapitalized &#160; Less than 8% &#160; Less than 6% &#160; Less than 4.5% &#160; Less than 4% Significantly undercapitalized &#160; Less than 6% &#160; Less than 4% &#160; Less than 3% &#160; Less than 3% &#160;

In addition, an institution is &#8220;critically undercapitalized&#8221; if it has a ratio of tangible equity to total assets that is equal to or less than 2.0%. Under specified circumstances, a federal banking agency may reclassify a well capitalized institution as adequately capitalized and may require an adequately capitalized institution or an undercapitalized institution to comply with supervisory actions as if it were in the next lower category (except that the FDIC may not reclassify a significantly undercapitalized institution as critically undercapitalized).

&#160;

Capital Distributions . OCC regulations govern capital distributions by savings institutions, which include cash dividends, stock repurchases and other transactions charged to the capital account of a savings institution to make capital distributions. A savings institution must file an application for OCC approval of the capital distribution if either (1) the total capital distributions for the applicable calendar year exceed the sum of the institution&#8217;s net income for that year to date plus the institution&#8217;s retained net income for the preceding two years, (2) the institution would not be at least adequately capitalized following the distribution, (3) the distribution would violate any applicable statute, regulation, agreement or OCC-imposed condition, or (4) the institution is not eligible for expedited treatment of its filings. If an application is not required to be filed, savings institutions which are a subsidiary of a savings and loan holding company (as well as certain other institutions) must still file a notice with the OCC at least 30 days before the board of directors declares a dividend or approves a capital distribution if either (1) the institution would not be well capitalized following the distribution; (2) the proposed distribution would reduce the amount or retire any part of the institution&#8217;s common or preferred stock or (3) the savings institution is a subsidiary of a savings and loan holding company and the proposed dividend is not a cash dividend. If a savings institution, such as Malvern Federal Savings Bank, that is the subsidiary of a savings and loan holding company, has filed a notice with the Federal Reserve Board for a cash dividend and is not required to file an application or notice with the OCC for any of the reasons described above, then the savings institution is only required to provide an informational copy to the OCC of the notice filed with the Federal Reserve Board.

&#160;

An institution that either before or after a proposed capital distribution fails to meet its then applicable minimum capital requirement or that has been notified that it needs more than normal supervision may not make any capital distributions without the prior written approval of the OCC. In addition, the OCC may prohibit a proposed capital distribution, which would otherwise be permitted by OCC regulations, if the OCC determines that such distribution would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice.

&#160;

Under federal rules, an insured depository institution may not pay any dividend if payment would cause it to become undercapitalized or if it is already undercapitalized. In addition, federal regulators have the authority to restrict or prohibit the payment of dividends for safety and soundness reasons. The FDIC also prohibits an insured depository institution from paying dividends on its capital stock or interest on its capital notes or debentures (if such interest is required to be paid only out of net profits) or distributing any of its capital assets while it remains in default in the payment of any assessment due the FDIC. Malvern Federal Savings Bank is currently not in default in any assessment payment to the FDIC.

&#160;

Qualified Thrift Lender Test . All savings institutions are required to meet a qualified thrift lender, or QTL, test to avoid certain restrictions on their operations. A savings institution can comply with the QTL test by either qualifying as a domestic building and loan association as defined in the Internal Revenue Code or meeting the QTL test of the OCC.

&#160;

Currently, the OCC&#8217;s QTL test requires that 65% of an institution&#8217;s &#8220;portfolio assets&#8221; (as defined) consist of certain housing and consumer-related assets on a monthly average basis in nine out of every 12 months. To be a qualified thrift lender under the IRS test, the savings institution must meet a &#8220;business operations test&#8221; and a &#8220;60 percent assets test,&#8221; each defined in the Internal Revenue Code.

&#160;

If the savings institution fails to maintain its QTL status, the holding company&#8217;s activities are restricted. In addition, it must discontinue any non-permissible business within three years. Nonetheless, any company that controls a savings institution that is not a qualified thrift lender must register as a bank holding company within one year of the savings institution&#8217;s failure to meet the QTL test.

&#160;

Statutory penalty provisions prohibit an institution that fails to remain a QTL from the following:

&#160;

&#183; Making any new investments or engaging in any new activity not allowed for both a national bank and a savings association; &#160;

&#183; Establishing any new branch office unless allowable for a national bank; and &#160; 

&#183; Paying dividends unless allowable for a national bank. &#160;

&#160; -10- &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Three years from the date a savings association should have become or ceases to be a QTL, by failing to meet either QTL test, the institution must comply with the following restriction:

&#160;

&#183; Dispose of any investment or not engage in any activity unless the investment or activity is allowed for both a national bank and a savings association. &#160;

Under the Dodd-Frank Act, a savings institution not in compliance with the QTL test is also subject to an enforcement action for violation of the Home Owners&#8217; Loan Act, as amended.

&#160;

At September 30, 2016, Malvern Federal Savings Bank met the requirements to be deemed a QTL.

&#160; 

Limitations on Transactions with Affiliates. Transactions between savings associations and any affiliate are governed by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act as made applicable to savings associations by Section 11 of the Home Owners&#8217; Loan Act. An affiliate of a savings association includes any company or entity which controls the savings institution or that is controlled by a company that controls the savings association. In a holding company context, the holding company of a savings association (such as Malvern Bancorp) and any companies which are controlled by such holding company are affiliates of the savings association. Generally, Section 23A limits the extent to which the savings association or its subsidiaries may engage in &#8220;covered transactions&#8221; with any one affiliate to an amount equal to 10% of such association&#8217;s capital stock and surplus, and contains an aggregate limit on all such transactions with all affiliates to an amount equal to 20% of such capital stock and surplus. Section 23B applies to &#8220;covered transactions&#8221; as well as certain other transactions and requires that all transactions be on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable, to the savings association as those provided to a non-affiliate. The term &#8220;covered transaction&#8221; includes the making of loans to, purchase of assets from and issuance of a guarantee to an affiliate and similar transactions. Section 23B transactions also include the provision of services and the sale of assets by a savings association to an affiliate. In addition to the restrictions imposed by Sections 23A and 23B, Section 11 of the Home Owners&#8217; Loan Act prohibits a savings association from (i) making a loan or other extension of credit to an affiliate, except for any affiliate which engages only in certain activities which are permissible for bank holding companies, or (ii) purchasing or investing in any stocks, bonds, debentures, notes or similar obligations of any affiliate, except for affiliates which are subsidiaries of the savings association.

&#160;

In addition, Sections 22(g) and (h) of the Federal Reserve Act as made applicable to savings associations by Section 11 of the Home Owners&#8217; Loan Act, place restrictions on loans to executive officers, directors and principal shareholders of the savings association and its affiliates. Under Section 22(h), loans to a director, an executive officer and to a greater than 10% shareholder of a savings association, and certain affiliated interests of either, may not exceed, together with all other outstanding loans to such person and affiliated interests, the savings association&#8217;s loans to one borrower limit (generally equal to 15% of the association&#8217;s unimpaired capital and surplus). Section 22(h) also requires that loans to directors, executive officers and principal shareholders be made on terms substantially the same as offered in comparable transactions to other persons unless the loans are made pursuant to a benefit or compensation program that (i) is widely available to employees of the association and (ii) does not give preference to any director, executive officer or principal shareholder, or certain affiliated interests of either, over other employees of the savings association. Section 22(h) also requires prior board approval for certain loans. In addition, the aggregate amount of extensions of credit by a savings association to all insiders cannot exceed the association&#8217;s unimpaired capital and surplus. Furthermore, Section 22(g) places additional restrictions on loans to executive officers. Malvern Federal Savings Bank currently is subject to Sections 22(g) and (h) of the Federal Reserve Act and at September 30, 2016, was in compliance with the above restrictions.

&#160;

Community Reinvestment Act. All federal savings associations have a responsibility under the Community Reinvestment Act and related regulations to help meet the credit needs of their communities, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. An institution&#8217;s failure to comply with the provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act could result in restrictions on its activities. Malvern Federal Savings Bank received a &#8220;satisfactory&#8221; Community Reinvestment Act rating in its most recently completed examination.

&#160; 

Anti-Money Laundering . All financial institutions, including savings and loan associations are subject to federal laws that are designed to prevent the use of the U.S. financial system to fund terrorist activities. Financial institutions operating in the United States are required to develop new anti-money laundering compliance programs, due diligence policies and controls to ensure the detection and reporting of money laundering. Such compliance programs are intended to supplement existing compliance requirements, also applicable to financial institutions, under the Bank Secrecy Act and the Office of Foreign Assets Control Regulations. Malvern Federal Savings Bank has established policies and procedures to ensure compliance with these provisions, and their impact on our operations has not been material.

Federal Home Loan Bank System . Malvern Federal Savings Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh, which is one of 12 regional Federal Home Loan Banks that administers the home financing credit function of savings institutions. Each FHLB serves as a reserve or central bank for its members within its assigned region. It is funded primarily from proceeds derived from the sale of consolidated obligations of the FHLB System. It makes loans to members (i.e., advances) in accordance with policies and procedures established by the board of directors of the FHLB. At September 30, 2016, Malvern Federal Savings Bank had $118.0 million of FHLB advances outstanding and $127.8 million available on its line of credit with the FHLB.

&#160;

As a member, Malvern Federal Savings Bank is required to purchase and maintain stock in the FHLB of Pittsburgh in an amount equal to at least 1.0% of its aggregate unpaid residential mortgage loans or similar obligations at the beginning of each year. At September 30, 2016, Malvern Federal Savings Bank had $5.4 million in FHLB stock, which was in compliance with this requirement.

&#160;

The Federal Home Loan Banks are required to provide funds for the resolution of troubled savings institutions and to contribute to affordable housing programs through direct loans or interest subsidies on advances targeted for community investment and low- and moderate-income housing projects. The FHLB has communicated that it believes the calculation of risk-based capital under the current rules of the Federal Housing Finance Agency significantly overstates the market risk of the FHLB&#8217;s private-label mortgage-backed securities in the current market environment and that it has enough capital to cover the risks reflected in the FHLB&#8217;s balance sheet. As a result, an &#8220;other than temporary impairment&#8221; has not been recorded for the Bank&#8217;s investment in FHLB stock. However, continued deterioration in the FHLB&#8217;s financial position may result in impairment in the value of those securities. Management will continue to monitor the financial condition of the FHLB as it relates to, among other things, the recoverability of the Bank&#8217;s investment.

&#160;

Federal Reserve System . The Federal Reserve Board requires all depository institutions to maintain reserves against their transaction accounts (primarily NOW and Super NOW checking accounts) and non-personal time deposits. Because required reserves must be maintained in the form of vault cash or a noninterest-bearing account at a Federal Reserve Bank, the effect of this reserve requirement is to reduce an institution&#8217;s earning assets. At September 30, 2016, Malvern Federal Savings Bank had met its reserve requirement.
