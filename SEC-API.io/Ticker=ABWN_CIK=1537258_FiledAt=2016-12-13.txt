 ITEM 1- BUSINESS 

&#160;

Overview 

&#160;

AIRBORNE WIRELESS NETWORK. (&#8220;we&#8221;, &#8220;us,&#8221; or &#8220;our&#8221; the &#8220;Company&#8221;) was formed as a Nevada corporation on January 5, 2011, with the name Ample-Tee to engage in the business of promoting, marketing, selling, and distributing hard to find ergonomic products for the physically disabled. 

&#160;

On September 31, 2011, we changed our name to Ample-Tee, Inc. 

&#160;

On May 19, 2016, we changed our name to Airborne Wireless Network . We changed our name to Airborne Wireless Network to better associate us with the aviation industry. 

&#160;

On October 20, 2015, our president, J. Edwards Daniels, purchased from Lawrence Chenard, our former president, 84,400,000 our shares of common stock for a purchase price of $250,000.

&#160; &#160; 3 

&#160;

On August 3, 2016, we acquired from Apcentive, Inc., a Nevada corporation (&#8220;Apcentive&#8221;), all of Apcentive&#8217;s right, title and interest in and to U.S. Patent No. 6,285,878 B1 and all related support materials, continuations, amendments, updates, and contemplated updates and amendments (collectively, the &#8220;Patent&#8221;). The Patent relates to a new use for already existing fleets of commercial aircraft to replace low-earth orbit communication satellites.

&#160;

On August 3, 2016, we acquired from Apcentive the trademark &#8220;Infinitus Super Highway&#8221; (the &#8220;Trademark&#8221;). 

&#160;

The consideration for the Patent and the Trademark is (i) 40,000,000 shares of our common stock and (ii) a royalty in the amount of 1.5% of the net cash we received from the promotion, marketing, sale, licensing, distribution, and other exploitation of the Patent. A copy of the agreement pursuant to which we acquired the Patent and the Trademark is attached as an exhibit to that Current Report on Form 8-K/A filed on October 21, 2016, with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#8220;SEC&#8221;).

&#160;

As of August 7, 2016, we entered into a written consulting agreement with C. Neal Monte, pursuant to which Mr. Monte will serve as our FAA Designated Engineering Representative. In that capacity, Mr. Monte will consult with us regarding the development of data and analysis to support FAA Civil Certification of our fully-meshed airborne wireless communication network. A copy of that agreement is attached as an exhibit to that Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 16, 2016.

&#160;

On August 8, 2016, we entered into a written Memorandum of Understanding with Concept Development, Inc., a leading aerospace engineering and design firm, pursuant to which Concept Development Inc. will provide us technical expertise regarding the preparation of systems drawings, designing, and manufacturing the onboard hardware and components, and providing software development support for our fully-meshed airborne wireless communication network. A copy of that memorandum is attached as an exhibit to that Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 11, 2016. 

&#160;

On August 9, 2016, we retained the services of Alex Sandel as the chairman of our Advisory Board.

&#160;

On August 11, 2016, we canceled the issuance to J. Edward Daniels of 80,000,000 shares of our common stock. A copy of the agreement pursuant to which we cancelled that issuance is attached as an exhibit to that Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 11, 2016.

&#160;

On August 19, 2016, we hired Marius D. de Mos as our Vice President of Technical Affairs and Development. 

&#160;

On August 30, 2016, we entered into a written Memorandum of Understanding with Jet Midwest Group, LLC, pursuant to which Jet Midwest Group, LLC will provide to us the use of aircraft for the purpose of enabling us to complete the FAA certification process. A copy of that memorandum is attached as an exhibit to that Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on September 1, 2016.

&#160;

We have not earned any revenues to date. 

&#160;

Our independent registered public accountant has issued an audit opinion which includes a statement expressing substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. There is the possibility that we may never be able to license the Infinitus product to successfully complete our plan of operation. If we are not capable of building a market for the Infinitus product, all funds that we spend on development will be lost.

&#160; &#160; 4 

&#160;

We are a developmental stage company with a principal business of developing, marketing and licensing a wholesale fully meshed high speed broadband airborne wireless network by linking commercial aircraft in flight, which will be the first and only fully-meshed true airborne broadband system, and which is known as the (&#8220;Infinitus&#8221;). Infinitus will use commercial aircrafts as hubs or &#8220;mini-satellites,&#8221; rather than traditional satellites or terrestrial systems. We believe that Infinitus will become the future of airborne communications network. 

&#160;

The Company has not been involved in any bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceedings since its incorporation nor has it been involved in any reclassification, merger or consolidation.

&#160;

Plan of Operations 

&#160;

Our business plan contemplates the development, promotion and licensing of Infinitus, a wholesale fully-meshed broadband digital carrier network, which is the first and only true airborne broadband network providing connectivity for worldwide broadband carrier services using commercial aircraft, which is an effort to reduce significantly internet problems associated with traditional air-to-ground and satellite based airborne communications providers. Infinitus is the first broadband fully meshed network using high level patented technology to bring speed and reliability in the air. 

&#160;

We intend to become a significant global wholesale communication carrier. We intend to sell wholesale bandwidth to the world&#8217;s top telecom and internet services providers using Infinitus, which will enable participating aircraft to act as airborne repeaters or routers, sending and receiving broadband signals from one aircraft to the next, which will create a digital superhighway in the sky. We do not intend to become a service provider to individual airline passengers.

&#160;

Our operations to date have been devoted primarily to start-up business development activities. Our president has performed activities such as: 

&#160;

&#183; Negotiating a relationship with a leading aerospace engineering design and manufacturing firm, which contemplates that firm will provide to the Company technical expertise regarding the preparation of systems drawings, designing and manufacturing the onboard hardware and components, and providing software development support. &#160;

&#160;

&#183; Negotiating a relationship with an appropriate aircraft firm, which contemplates that firm will provide us with the use of 2 aircraft, for the purpose of enabling us to complete the FAA certification process. &#160;

&#160;

&#183; Negotiating with various persons an employment and consulting relationships, with appropriate management and technical personnel. &#160;

&#160;

&#183; Negotiating the acquisition from Apcentive, Inc., a California corporation (&#8220;Apcentive&#8221;), of certain intellectual property, which consists of a patent and a trademark, which are essential for our operations. &#160;

&#160;

&#183; Negotiating a relationship with a certification and engineering firm pursuant to which that firm shall support the Company in the development of data and analysis to support FAA Civil Certification of Infinitus. 

&#160;

We have no plans to change our plan of operations.

&#160; &#160; 5 

&#160;

The Company has not been involved in any bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceedings since its incorporation nor has it been involved in any reclassification, merger or consolidation.

&#160;

We anticipate that our revenues would come from &#8220;facilitating global high-speed data communications&#8221; using Infinitus. We anticipate that our primary customers will be global communication, wholesalers, data wholesalers, VOIP carriers, and government agencies (FAA, DOD, TSA, etc.). As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have not licensed Infinitus.

&#160;

It is anticipated that with Infinitus, key markets which are currently underserved, such as maritime, rural and remote locations, will now have the ability to connect reliably on a global scale. Reaching previously unserved and inaccessible rural markets is a positive off shoot of Infinitus.

&#160;

Much of the air traveling public is familiar with traditional airborne services as many airlines offer &#8220;Wi-Fi&#8221; services. The integrity of those services depends on a single link, either accessing a cellular-tower, or a satellite. This limits customer usage to non-real time services. There simply is not enough bandwidth. Accordingly, service is often interrupted and slow, due to an infrastructure not designed to handle the demand for data traffic. The reason for slow data-rates is that data is &#8220;stored and forwarded,&#8221; meaning the onboard host holds the data until the next link is available. With Infinitus, &#8220;real connectivity&#8221; is expected almost 100% of the time, as there are multiple simultaneous data-connections (as with a spider&#8217;s web), so the system does not rely on a single link.

&#160;

By commercializing Infinitus, the Company anticipates that it would enable its future wholesale customers to minimize their infrastructure development time and costs, minimize their land purchase requirements and right of way negotiations and associated costs, and help these clients increase their systems reliability (no more stolen or damaged transport-cabling, fewer weather-related outages, etc.)

&#160;

Because Infinitus is typically used at mid-level altitudes (20,000 to 40,000 feet), it has many inherent advantages over satellites. Those altitudes provide us with the primary advantage of being able to reuse operating spectrum. Nature limits the range of signals based upon the curvature of the earth, allowing the same frequencies to be reused beyond the horizon.

&#160;

Our ability to assign operating frequencies dynamically and the ease and cost effective ways in which we can service and/or upgrade our equipment, unlike high altitude solutions, should provide us a steady leading role in the ever expanding broadband industry.

&#160;

As the proliferation of mobile devices has grown, so too has the dependency on these and the need, or rather demand, for more bandwidth. Regardless of application; airborne, maritime or remote, with current technology, there simply is not enough available bandwidth to adequately support that growth. Once fully commissioned, our wholesale carriers should be able to provide this &#8220;demanded-connectivity&#8221; worldwide.

&#160;

Limited satellite bandwidth, combined with the inherent air-to-ground connectivity challenges of current solutions, underscores the challenges to meet current expectations. Add the significant limitations of current technology, especially when it involves trans-oceanic journeys, we believe that the desire for new, comprehensive solutions is very clear.

&#160;

With the exception of outages due to heavy rainstorms, current infrastructure is perfectly capable to support &#8220;one-way-broadcasts (transmissions)&#8221; of TV signals and movies. Also, it can support duplex (two-way) Internet connectivity on a very limited basis. In spite of these severe limitations, there has been a growing demand for Internet connectivity and &#8220;slow connections&#8221; as well as &#8220;waiting to connect&#8221; are commonplace today, and acceptance of these problematic systems has become the norm, rather than the exception.

&#160; &#160; 6 

&#160;

Finding cost effective solutions for reaching the maritime, rural and airborne customers remains one of the primary challenges of VOIP/data-wholesalers today. The cost to build cellular networks across sparsely populated areas remains out of reach when considering the &#8220;Average Revenue Per User&#8221; for these desolate populations.

&#160;

If we are unable to complete any aspect of our development or marketing efforts because we don&#8217;t have enough money, we will cease our development and/or marketing operations until we raise money. Attempting to raise capital after failing in any phase of our business plan would be difficult. As such, if we cannot secure additional proceeds we will have to cease operations and our shareholders may lose their entire investments.

&#160;

We anticipate that we will need approximately $10,500,000 to fund our operations for the next 12 months. We anticipate that we will obtain that amount from sales of shares of our common stock; provided, however, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to sell a sufficient number of shares of our common stock to raise that amount, or any amount whatsoever. In the event we do not receive cash sufficient to fund our operations, our operations may be reduced or eliminated completely. 

&#160;

We anticipate requiring approximately $5,000,000 for leasing of plane assets, hanger space, equipment purchases, and hardware costs for the development of prototypes and for testing of equipment during the next 12 months. Of this $5,000,000, we anticipate $1,600,000 for the purchase of equipment and 1,400,000 for other prototype development hardware for research and development.

&#160;

Products and Services 

&#160;

Infinitus is for use for already existing fleets of commercial airline aircraft to replace low-earth orbit communication satellites. Infinitus will provide low-cost, broadband wireless communication infrastructure among points-to-points accomplished by using and modifying existing, small, lightweight low power, low cost microwave relay station equipment onboard the commercial airline aircraft. Each equipped aircraft would have a broadband wireless communication link (within line-of-sight coverage ranges) to one or more neighboring aircraft or ground stations and form a chain of seamless airborne repeaters providing broadband wireless communication gateways along the entire flight path. Those broadband wireless communication services also provide for customer onboard in-flight as well as customers overboard, along the line-of-sight ranges of flight path from the commercial airline aircraft. 

&#160;

Nearly 100% real-time (not store and forward) traditional technologies suffer from &#8220;single points of failure.&#8221; With Infinitus, if a link is interrupted the signal is redirected to the next participating aircraft, ship or earth station in the chain. Infinitus is designed with the security of meshed, redundant data-paths.

&#160;

Infinitus is expected to be extremely robust, as it is a &#8220;fully-meshed&#8221; network, which utilizes commercial aircraft as its hubs. It also uses a proportionally smaller number of &#8220;earth-stations&#8221; as its &#8220;up/down-links.&#8221;

&#160;

As new software becomes available, Infinitus can be easily updated. When new and more efficient data-transmission technologies emerge, upgrading Infinitus can be as easy as replacing a single module, and the system is ready for &#8220;the future.&#8221; Infinitus is never obsolete. Satellite technology, on the other hand, in most cases, has already been surpassed by the time a satellite is launched. These cannot be upgraded or serviced once launched. 

&#160; &#160; 7 

&#160;

It is anticipated that Infinitus would be the first and only airborne broadband fully meshed digital network, using patented technology, to bring speed and reliability to the far corners of the earth.

&#160;

As many as 27,000 airborne aircraft could be circling the earth, each of which could be considered a &#8220;flying cell tower.&#8221; Each cell-tower (airplane) is wirelessly linked to the next one (meshed). Only a few aircraft in the mesh would be connected to the ground. This would create one of the largest wholesale carrier network pipelines in the world. 

&#160;

Because Infinitus is typically used at mid-level altitudes (20,000 to 40,000 feet), it has many inherent advantages over satellites. Those altitudes provide us with the primary advantage of being able to reuse operating spectrum. Nature limits the range of signals based upon the curvature of the earth, allowing the same frequencies to be reused beyond the horizon.

&#160;

Our ability to assign operating frequencies dynamically and the ease and cost effective ways in which we can service and/or upgrade our equipment, unlike high altitude solutions, should provide us a steady leading role in the ever expanding broadband industry.

&#160;

Market 

&#160;

We believe that the market for Infinitus is worldwide and has the potential of growing almost exponentially, as our relationships with synergetic companies around the world increase. Each additional aircraft coming &#8220;on-line&#8221; increases the coverage-area and data-throughput of Infinitus. We intend to develop relationships rural and maritime markets, as well. Additionally, the growth of the drone industry and the FAA&#8217;s need to offer control these &#8220;beyond the horizon&#8221; (which is currently unavailable), could provide us a marketing opportunity, as we would be able to supply the required IP and location-based support, and monitor and facilitate growth. Traditional cell and satellite services cannot adequately reach and fully support this growing industry and its ever expanding demands.

&#160;

We plan to engage commercial airlines, including passenger and freight operators, as connected partners. The key to our success will be our ability to engage those airlines as connected partners.

&#160;

We have identified a number of strategic customers that would be instrumental to our success. By reaching out to the customers we have begun our marketing efforts. Additionally, our certification work with the FAA, also, provides us with access to other government agencies with respect to services which we could provide. 

&#160;

Customers 

&#160;

We believe that we will not depend on one or a few major customers.

&#160;

As it is a &#8220;wholesale-pipeline&#8221; and not a &#8220;consumer product,&#8221; our customers are expected to be larger communications and Internet Service Providers. Our potential customers are a known and finite group, with the exception of the drone marketplace. There is a potential in the drone industry as we would work closely with the FAA to develop the standards for &#8220;safe&#8221; drone control.

&#160;

Below are some of our anticipated customers: 

&#160;

&#183; Wholesale Airline Network Access &#183; Rural Network Access &#183; Maritime AccessDrone Network Access/Safe Drone control beyond the horizon 

&#160; &#160; 8 

&#160;

&#183; Private Business Jet Network Access &#183; Government Services &#183; Air Traffic Control Access (far beyond the capabilities of Next-Gen) &#183; Comprehensive Airline Monitoring Access (far beyond the capabilities of Next-Gen) &#183; Business Jet Communications/Internet Service Providers &#183; Disaster Aid Providers &#183; Oil Drilling Platforms &#160; Marketing 

&#160;

Our core marketing strategy involves establishing a number of close partnerships with businesses that are well-known multinationals, in order to minimize our &#8220;time to market.&#8221; Several of those relationships are expected to be with our primary wholesale customers, delivering their services over our network, Initial discussions have demonstrated tremendous interest in Infinitus and a strong desire to participate from airlines, aircraft owners (leasing and refurbishing companies) to equipment providers. 

&#160;

From our establishment of strategic suppliers to the alignment with jetliner owners/participants for our testing and prototyping, each relationship could provide opportunities for marketing our services.

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

The proprietary nature of Infinitus allows us to create a unique broadband network, which currently is not available in the market-place.

&#160;

There are a number of &#8220;possibly competing systems,&#8221; which rely on launching large numbers (thousands) of small satellites. However, commercializing these may not be economically or environmentally feasible, as most of these would increase the already damaging amounts of space-junk, which in turn could jeopardize the very future they envision.

&#160;

Most of the potential &#8220;competitors&#8221; may more likely become partners, rather than adversaries, as we can offer what no other company can.

&#160;

&#8220;Potential competitors&#8221; are:

&#160;

&#183; Inmarsat satellites &#183; Traditional communications and broadcast satellites &#183; Facebook, using drones (which may be infringe on our patent) &#183; Google, using drones or balloons (which may infringe on our patent) 

&#160;

In a pre- Infinitus environment, satellites (despite their many disadvantages and huge environmental impact), are the only solution to solving the world&#8217;s ever growing need for communications and connectivity.

&#160;

Inmarsat is a leader in the providing of satellite based communication services to the maritime industry, but it

suffers from inadequate bandwidth and needs many more satellites to resolve this issue.

&#160;

Facebook is attempting to create a network in the sky utilizing drones with wingspans the size of 737/757 aircraft. As of yet, it has not passed its beginning testing, and indications by regulatory agencies are that (and probably infringe on our patent) these cannot be certified for use inside of the United States.

&#160; &#160; 9 

&#160;

Google is attempting to create a network in the sky utilizing balloons and drones. It has had a number of technological setbacks and is likely infringing on our patented technology.

&#160;

While in theory, each of these could be considered a competitor, we believe that, due to the benefits of Infinitus, these &#8220;competitors&#8221; would quickly realize that utilizing Infinitus&#8217; network would be a win/win for all.

&#160;

We believe that the closest approach to Infinitus is Facebook's proposed use of drones to provide network coverage. This approach resembles Infinitus, with two major differences. First, the use of large, unmanned drones (with wingspans the size of a 737/757 aircraft) flying overhead, solely depending on solar power, seem not to be the safest method (especially, as similar government and military drones have unexplainably crashed). Second, we have a U.S. patent, which is recognized by most of the world&#8217;s nations, and protects Infinitus; our competitors do not own a similar patent, nor do they have a license to use our patent, and, therefore, their use of technology similar to Infinitus would likely infringe on our intellectual property.

&#160;

Employees 

&#160;

As of August 31, 2016, we had 2 employees. Our officers, director and employees are responsible for all planning, development and operational duties and will continue to do so throughout the early stages of our growth. Additionally, we utilize the services of consultants to assist with the development of our business. Human resource planning will be a part of an ongoing process that will include regular evaluation of our operations. We intend to hire additional employees at such time as we determine it is appropriate. We can provide no assurance or guarantee on the date on which we will hire additional employees.

&#160;

Employment Agreements 

&#160;

On August 19, 2016, we entered into with Marius D. de Mos a written employment agreement pursuant to the provisions of which Mr. de Mos shall serve as our Vice President of Technical Affairs and Development. A copy of that agreement is attached as an exhibit to that Current Report on this Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 26, 2016.

&#160;

As of August 7, 2016, we entered into with C. Neal Monte a written Consulting Agreement pursuant to which Mr. Monte shall serve as FAA Designated Engineering Representative. A copy of that agreement is attached to that Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 16, 2016.

&#160;

Other than as specified above, as of August 31, 2016, we are not party to written or verbal employment or consulting agreements.

&#160;

Intellectual Property and other Proprietary Rights 

&#160;

Our intellectual property consists of (i) U.S. patent No. 6,285,878 B1, which is for a new use for the already existing fleets of commercial aircraft to replace low orbit communication satellites, and (ii) the trademark &#8220;Infinitus Super Highway.&#8221; The expiration date for that patent is September 4, 2018, and the expiration date of that trademark is June 11, 2025. 

&#160; 

To ensure our intellectual property remains under tight control, we have partnered with California-based Concept Development, Inc., an aerospace manufacturing and development firm, for our airborne equipment needs. We are developing our own custom airborne antennas with Tyco Electronics (TE Aerospace Defense and Marine), and all equipment designs will remain our exclusive property. All of our proprietary software development will be done under the strict guidance of our chief software engineer. Although we intend to use several well-qualified consultants, no single outside person will be allowed to have access to our core software.

&#160;

&#160; 10 

&#160;

Effect of Government Regulations 

&#160;

We require FAA supplemental certification for mounting Infinitus on aircraft. We are in the process of obtaining that certification. In that regard, we are utilizing our FAA certification plan to install Infinitus on Boeing 757-200 test aircraft, and we expect completion of this certification to be obtained within 6 to 9 months. After we receive that certification, additionally, similar certificates will be added to each aircraft type, a simple process after initial approval is obtained. 

&#160;

In additions to that certificate, we intend to obtain from the FAA approval for us to become an improved manufacturer of our system, which includes the entire component supply chain, including outside vendors under the control of an FAA authorized company controlled and maintained quality system.

&#160;

Additional, we are seeking from FAA certification regarding non-interference of Infinitus with onboard critical aircraft operating components. The FAA has established a standard certification process by which, if followed, project certification is all but guaranteed. Next, we shall seek approval from the FAA as an essential aircraft system for flight operations. FAA approval will allow us to move into the cockpit and provide critical Air Traffic Control and airline aircraft flight operation services.

&#160;

We are subject to FCC approval of our operating frequency, to ensure we do not interfere with existing satellite and ground based communications. 

&#160;

Research and Development Activities 

&#160;

Other than time spent researching our proposed business, we have not spend any funds on research and development activities to date.

&#160;

Compliance with Environmental Laws 

&#160;

Currently, we believe that we will incur no costs related to compliance with environmental laws, as we expect our operations will have no effect on the environment. 

&#160;

Change in Control of Our Company 

&#160;

We do not know of any arrangements that might result in a change in control of the Company.

&#160;

Registered Agent 

&#160;

We are required by Section 78.090 of the Nevada Revised Statutes (the &#8220;NRS&#8221;) to maintain a registered agent in the State of Nevada. Our registered agent for this purpose is State Agent and Transfer Syndicate, Inc., 112 N. Curry Street, Carson City, Nevada 89703.
