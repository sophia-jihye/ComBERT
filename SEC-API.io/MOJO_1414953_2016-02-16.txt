 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

&#160; 

COMPANY OVERVIEW 

&#160; 

Headquartered in Jersey City, New Jersey, the Company engages in new product development, production, marketing and distribution of beverage brands that are natural, USDA Organic and Non GMO Project Verified, which speak to the quality of our beverages. 

&#160; 

CURRENT OPERATIONS 

&#160; 

Sales and Distribution 

&#160; 

The Company began selling its new MOJO Naturals Pure Coconut Water in December 2015. In addition to Pure Coconut Water, the Company has begun production of two additional flavors: Coconut Water + Peach Mango and Coconut Water + Pineapple. These additional products will be available for sale in 2016. We seek to grow market share for our products by establishing and expanding our distribution network through the relationships and efforts of our management and the establishment of third party distribution relationships, including relationships with food brokers. Through October 2015, the Company&#8217;s revenues were derived from the sale of 100% fruit juice products. 

&#160; 

Production 

&#160; 

The Company currently sources its ingredients and packaging from one source, but believes that adequate alternate suppliers exist in the event that it becomes necessary. The Company believes that its fruit sources are of high quality and are an important part of the overall taste and quality of its products. The Company believes that its current production and packaging arrangements are adequate. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

The beverage market is highly competitive. Competitors in our market compete for brand recognition, ingredient sourcing, qualified personnel and product shelf space. As a young company, some of our competitors are more established and better capitalized. Many of our competitors have brand recognition and consumer confidence and are able to readily secure shelf space and media attention for their products. Our competitors have the same distribution channels and retailers to move their products into the consumers hands through which we sell our products. 

&#160; 

Government Regulation 

&#160; 

Beverages are governed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. As such, it is necessary for the Company to establish, maintain and make available for inspection records as well as to develop labels (including nutrition information) that meet legal food labeling requirements. The Company&#8217;s contracted production facilities are subject to many regulations, including Food Facility Registration, recordkeeping, Good Manufacturing Practice Requirements, reporting, preventive controls and inspections. We rely on these third parties to comply with these regulations when producing our products. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

As of February 12, 2016, the Company had two full-time employees and one part-time employee. The Company mitigates the need for additional employees by using the services of contractors, consultants and other third-parties. We contract with food brokers to represent our products to retail stores nationally, and in certain regions of the United States, utilize the services of direct sales and distribution companies that sell our products in their distribution channels. This mitigates the need for a large sales and merchandising force. We use third-party facilities to produce our beverages and we outsource the storage and transportation of our finished goods and raw materials to public warehouses and common carriers.
