 ITEM 1. BUSINESS.

General

Photoamigo, Inc. ("the Company"' "we", "us" or our") was incorporated in the State of Nevada on April 2, 2008 ("Inception) and since then we have been engaged in activities to formulate and implement our business plan as explained below.

Overview

We provide social networking and photo sharing from the website PhotoAmigo.com. As of July 31, 2016, our website had 4,710 users using our free photo sharing products. We also maintain the domain names PhotoAmigo.net, fotoamigo.com and fotoamigo.net. These domain names all redirect incoming traffic to our main website, PhotoAmigo.com.

Our website currently allows users to upload photos, share comments via photo blogs, and print photos through third-party vendors. Our free services allow users to upload up to ten photos per day. We offer a premium service which is priced at $19.99 per year and allows for unlimited uploading of photos. As of the date of this prospectus, all of our users are using our free service.

In addition to our photo sharing services, we offer display advertising on our site through Google Adsense. We do not currently generate any revenue through advertising, and we estimate that we will require a minimum of six months to begin generating revenue from display advertising. In order to generate revenue from advertising, we will need to increase traffic to our website.

Business Strategy

Our business strategy is to engage users by offering free photo sharing and social networking services. We believe that by offering a full suite of services for free, we can eventually get users to upgrade their membership for more photo sharing storage space. Currently, we offer the following services to our members:

&#183;

Full html in guestbooks and photo descriptions--by providing html based pages, users are able to embed video, audio and links within their pages. By allowing users to include this type of data, the PhotoAmigo internal pages can provide rich media to the site's visitors;

&#183;

High resolution images&#8212;our image compression tools create a repository for higher resolution images for enlargements and printing;

&#183;

Cell phone uploads&#8212;users are able to send images from their mobile phone directly to their PhotoAmigo pages;

&#183;

In-house mail program allowing users to send and receive email originated within the site;

&#183;

Image printing&#8212;we have integrated with Shutterfly to allow users to print their photos directly from our website.

&#160;

&#160;

Marketing

We will use a variety of marketing strategies to build overall traffic to the site and intend to emphasize our marketing efforts. We plan to gain new members by offering the free subscription level but will use marketing efforts within the site to upgrade our members to a paid program. To cultivate new members, we plan to use the following marketing strategies:

&#183;

Search Engine Optimization

&#183;

Google adwords (purchasing key words such as "free photo sharing")

&#183;

International Craigslist postings

&#183;

Guerrilla marketing: handing out postcards and installing street posters

&#183;

Harvesting existing photo sharing sites (direct email invites)

&#183;

Press releases to mass publications (magazines, newspapers, radio and TV)

&#183;

Friends, family and word of mouth.

We also believe that our success is dependent on viral marketing, which is implicit in photo sharing since our domain name is presented each time a member shares a photo.

In addition to viral marketing strategies, we intend to rely on search engine optimization techniques to increase traffic to our website over the next twelve months. Search engine optimization, or SEO, is the process of improving the volume of traffic generated from search engines such as Google or Yahoo. We intend to optimize our website for key terms such as "photo sharing", "photo blogs", and "free photo hosting." There is significant competition for these keywords and other keywords that direct traffic to photo sharing websites. Given our limited capital resources, we may be unable to optimize our site in order to generate significant traffic from search engines. 

Competition

Several online sites allow for storage and printing of digital photos. Many of these sites have grown to recognized brand names and receive millions of uploaded photos each day. We believe that some users are interested in using a smaller site in which their photos can be featured.

Flickr was acquired by Yahoo! When it had approximately 300,000 members. According to a 2007 article in the weblog TechCrunch.com, "Flickr now has over 1 billion photos and 37.7 million unique monthly visitors. 2.5 million new photos are uploaded daily by 15 million registered users.

Fotolog : A February 2007 press release from the Company cited 6.5 million member accounts from more than 200 countries that have shared more than 200 million photos since the site's inception in October 2002. The press release went on to call Fotolog "the world's largest photo-blogging community and the third most trafficked social media network on the Internet." It added, "Fotolog has grown 100 percent virally since its founding in 2002, with no marketing or member incentives."

Photobucket was founded in 2003. $15 million was invested before Photobucket was acquired by Fox Interactive Media's MySpace for $250 million in May of 2007, according to crunchbase.com. "Their main revenue streams are through premium accounts and advertising."
