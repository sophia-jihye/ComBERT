 Items 1 and 2. BUSINESS AND PROPERTIES 

CORPORATE STRUCTURE 

Phillips 66, headquartered in Houston, Texas, was incorporated in Delaware in 2011 in connection with, and in anticipation of, a restructuring of ConocoPhillips resulting in the separation of its downstream businesses into an independent, publicly traded company named Phillips 66. The two companies were separated by ConocoPhillips distributing to its stockholders all the shares of common stock of Phillips 66 after the market closed on April 30, 2012 (the Separation). On May 1, 2012, Phillips 66 stock began trading &#8220;regular-way&#8221; on the New York Stock Exchange under the &#8220;PSX&#8221; stock symbol. 

Our business is organized into four operating segments: 

1) 

Midstream&#8212; Gathers, processes, transports and markets natural gas; and transports, fractionates and markets natural gas liquids (NGL) in the United States. In addition, this segment transports crude oil and other feedstocks to our refineries and other locations, delivers refined and specialty products to market, and provides terminaling and storage services for crude oil and petroleum products. The Midstream segment includes our master limited partnership, Phillips 66 Partners LP, as well as our 50 percent &#32;equity investment in DCP Midstream, LLC (DCP Midstream). 

2) 

Chemicals&#8212; Manufactures and markets petrochemicals and plastics on a worldwide basis. The Chemicals segment consists of our 50 percent &#32;equity investment in Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC (CPChem). 

3) 

Refining&#8212; Buys, sells and refines crude oil and other feedstocks at 14 &#32;refineries, mainly in the United States and Europe. 

4) 

Marketing and Specialties (M&#38;S)&#8212; Purchases for resale and markets refined petroleum products (such as gasolines, distillates and aviation fuels), mainly in the United States and Europe. In addition, this segment includes the manufacturing and marketing of specialty products, as well as power generation operations. 

Corporate and Other includes general corporate overhead, interest expense, our investment in new technologies and various other corporate activities. Corporate assets include all cash and cash equivalents. 

At December 31, 2015 , Phillips 66 had approximately 14,000 employees.

&#8226; 

NGL &#8212;transports, fractionates and markets natural gas liquids. 

Phillips 66 Partners LP 

In 2013, we formed Phillips 66 Partners LP, a master limited partnership (MLP), to own, operate, develop and acquire primarily fee-based crude oil, refined petroleum product and NGL pipelines and terminals, as well as other transportation and midstream assets. At December 31, 2015, we owned a 69 percent limited partner interest and a 2 percent general partner interest in Phillips 66 Partners, while the public owned a 29 percent limited partner interest. 

Headquartered in Houston, Texas, Phillips 66 Partners&#8217; assets and equity investments consist of crude oil, NGL and refined petroleum product pipelines, terminals, rail racks and storage systems that are geographically dispersed throughout the United States, most of which are integral to a Phillips 66-operated refinery. 

During 2015, Phillips 66 Partners expanded its business by acquiring from us: 

&#8226; 

One-third equity interests in DCP Sand Hills Pipeline, LLC (Sand Hills) and DCP Southern Hills Pipeline, LLC (Southern Hills), as well as a 19.5 percent equity interest in Explorer Pipeline Company (Explorer). This acquisition closed in March 2015. 

&#8226; 

A 40 percent equity interest in Bayou Bridge Pipeline, LLC (Bayou Bridge). This acquisition closed in December 2015. 

The operations and financial results of Phillips 66 Partners are included in either the Transportation or NGL business line, based on the nature of the activity within the partnership. 

Transportation 

We own or lease various assets to provide environmentally safe, strategic and timely delivery and terminaling and storage of crude oil, refined products, natural gas and NGL. These assets include pipeline systems; petroleum product, crude oil and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) terminals; a petroleum coke handling facility; marine vessels; railcars and trucks. 

Pipelines and Terminals 

At December 31, 2015 , our Transportation business managed over 18,000 miles of crude oil, natural gas, NGL and petroleum products pipeline systems in the United States, including those partially owned or operated by affiliates. We owned or operated 39 finished product terminals, 37 storage locations, 5 LPG terminals, 16 crude oil terminals and 1 petroleum coke exporting facility. 

During 2015, we continued to invest in our Beaumont Terminal, the largest terminal in the Phillips 66 portfolio, which currently has 4.7 million barrels of crude oil storage capacity and 2.4 million barrels of refined product storage capacity. As of December 31, 2015, we had 2.0 million barrels of incremental crude storage capacity under construction, which is 

Index to Financial Statements 

expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2016. In addition, we have initiated a variety of other projects aimed at increasing storage and throughput capabilities as we continue the expansion of the Beaumont terminal from its current 7.1 million barrels of storage capacity to 16 million barrels. 

Construction progressed in 2015 on our two crude oil pipeline systems being developed by our joint ventures, Dakota Access LLC (DAPL) and Energy Transfer Crude Oil Company, LLC (ETCOP). Phillips 66 owns a 25 percent interest in each joint venture, with our co-venturer holding the remaining 75 percent interest and acting as operator of both the DAPL and ETCOP pipeline systems. The DAPL pipeline is expected to deliver 470,000 barrels per day of crude oil from the Bakken/Three Forks production area in North Dakota to market centers in the Midwest. The DAPL pipeline will provide shippers with access to Midwestern refineries, unit-train rail loading facilities to facilitate deliveries to East Coast refineries, and the Gulf Coast market through an interconnection in Patoka, Illinois, with ETCOP pipeline. The ETCOP pipeline will provide crude oil transportation service from the Midwest to the Sunoco Logistics Partners L.P. (Sunoco Logistics) and Phillips 66 storage terminals located in Nederland, Texas. The pipelines are expected to be operational in fourth-quarter 2016. 

In the third quarter of 2015, Phillips 66 became a joint venture partner with a 40 percent equity interest in Bayou Bridge. Energy Transfer Partners, L.P. (ETP) and Sunoco Logistics each hold a 30 percent interest in the joint venture, with Sunoco Logistics serving as the operator. The joint venture was formed for the funding and development of the Bayou Bridge pipeline. The Bayou Bridge pipeline is a new-build 30&#8221; and 24&#8221; pipeline that will deliver crude oil from Nederland, Texas, to Lake Charles, Louisiana and on to St. James, Louisiana. Phillips 66 is constructing the segment to Lake Charles, which will be in service by the end of first-quarter 2016. The remaining section of the pipeline, which will be constructed by ETP, is scheduled for completion in the second half of 2017. Effective December 1, 2015, Phillips 66 Partners acquired Phillips 66&#8217;s 40 percent equity interest in Bayou Bridge. 

In the fourth quarter of 2015, Phillips 66 Partners commenced operation of the Palermo Rail Terminal, which is located on a 710-acre site near Palermo, North Dakota. The crude terminal has an initial capacity of 100,000 barrels per day, with the flexibility to be expanded to 200,000 barrels per day. It is located on a railway with two mainline switches, allowing east- and west-bound deliveries. The terminal includes 6 truck unloading facilities and 206,000 barrels of operational storage, with permits allowing total storage capacity of up to 2.4 million barrels, as well as space for 6 additional truck unloading facilities. The terminal is owned by the joint venture Phillips 66 Partners Terminal LLC, of which Phillips 66 Partners holds a 70 percent interest, with Paradigm Energy Partners, LLC (Paradigm) owning the remaining 30 percent interest. Phillips 66 Partners is the operator. 

In 2016, the Palermo Rail Terminal is anticipated to include a pipeline delivery and receipt connection to the 76-mile Sacagawea Pipeline, allowing the terminal to receive crude oil from areas in Dunn County and McKenzie County, North Dakota, and deliver it to terminals and pipelines located in Stanley, North Dakota. The Sacagawea Pipeline is owned by the joint venture Sacagawea Pipeline Company, LLC, of which Paradigm Pipeline LLC holds an 88 percent interest, with the remaining 12 percent interest owned by Grey Wolf Midstream, LLC. Phillips 66 Partners and Paradigm each own a 50 percent interest in Paradigm Pipeline LLC. Paradigm is constructing the pipeline and Phillips 66 Partners will be the operator.

Index to Financial Statements 

Marine Vessels 

At December 31, 2015 , we had 12 double-hulled, international-flagged crude oil and product tankers under term charter, with capacities ranging in size from 300,000 to 1,100,000 barrels. Additionally, we had under term charter three Jones Act compliant tankers and 66 tug/barge units. These vessels are used primarily to transport feedstocks or provide product transportation for certain of our refineries, including delivery of domestic crude oil to our Gulf Coast and East Coast refineries. 

&#160; 

Truck and Rail 

Truck and rail operations support our feedstock and distribution operations. Rail movements are provided via a fleet of more than 12,300 owned and leased railcars. Truck movements are provided through approximately 170 third-party truck companies, as well as through Sentinel Transportation LLC, in which we hold a 20 percent equity interest. 

DCP Midstream 

Our Midstream segment includes our 50 percent equity investment in DCP Midstream, which is headquartered in Denver, Colorado. As of December 31, 2015 , DCP Midstream owned or operated 64 natural gas processing facilities, with a net processing capacity of approximately 8.0 BCFD. DCP Midstream&#8217;s owned or operated natural gas pipeline systems included gathering services for these facilities, as well as natural gas transmission, and totaled approximately 68,000 miles of pipeline. DCP Midstream also owned or operated 12 NGL fractionation plants, along with natural gas and NGL storage facilities, a propane wholesale marketing business and NGL pipeline assets. 

The residual natural gas, primarily methane, which results from processing raw natural gas, is sold by DCP Midstream at market-based prices to marketers and end users, including large industrial companies, natural gas distribution companies and electric utilities. DCP Midstream purchases or takes custody of substantially all of its raw natural gas from producers, principally under contractual arrangements that expose DCP Midstream to the prices of NGL, natural gas and condensate. DCP Midstream also has fee-based arrangements with producers to provide midstream services such as gathering and processing. 

DCP Midstream markets a portion of its NGL to us and CPChem under existing 15-year contracts, the primary commitment of which began a ratable wind-down period in December 2014 and expires in January 2019. These purchase commitments are on an &#8220;if-produced, will-purchase&#8221; basis. 

During 2015, DCP Midstream and DCP Midstream Partners, LP (DCP Partners), the MLP formed by DCP Midstream, completed or advanced the following growth projects:

&#8226; 

Phillips 66 Partners owns a direct one-third interest in both Sand Hills and Southern Hills, whose pipelines connect Eagle Ford, Permian and Midcontinent production to the Mont Belvieu, Texas market. 

In December 2015, operations began at Sweeny Fractionator One. Sweeny Fractionator One is located adjacent to our Sweeny Refinery and supplies purity ethane and LPG to the petrochemical industry and heating markets. Raw NGL supply to the fractionator is delivered from nearby major pipelines, including the Sand Hills pipeline. 

The fractionator is supported by significant new infrastructure including connectivity to two NGL supply pipelines, a 180,000 BPD bi-directional pipeline to the Mont Belvieu market center and a multi-million barrel salt dome storage facility with access to our marine terminal in Freeport, Texas. 

During 2015, construction progressed on the Freeport LPG Export Terminal located at the site of our existing marine terminal in Freeport, Texas. The terminal expansion will leverage our transportation and storage infrastructure to supply petrochemical, heating and transportation markets globally. In addition, a 100,000 BPD unit to upgrade domestic propane for export is being installed near the Sweeny Fractionator One. The terminal will have an initial export capacity of 150,000 BPD of LPG with a ship loading rate of 36,000 barrels per hour. The terminal is currently exporting 10,000 to 15,000 BPD of natural gasoline (C5+) from Sweeny Fractionator One. 

The LPG produced at Sweeny Fractionator One is being delivered via pipeline to local petrochemical customers, as well as to the market hub at Mont Belvieu, Texas. We will have the capability to place the LPG into global markets upon completion of our Freeport LPG Export Terminal in the second half of 2016. Sweeny Fractionator One and the Freeport LPG Export Terminal represent a combined capital investment of more than $3 billion. 

CHEMICALS 

The Chemicals segment consists of our 50 percent equity investment in CPChem, which is headquartered in The Woodlands, Texas. At the end of 2015 , CPChem owned or had joint-venture interests in 34 manufacturing facilities and two research and development centers located around the world. 

We structure our reporting of CPChem&#8217;s operations around two primary business segments: Olefins and Polyolefins (O&#38;P) and Specialties, Aromatics and Styrenics (SA&#38;S). The O&#38;P business segment produces and markets ethylene and other olefin products; the ethylene produced is primarily consumed within CPChem for the production of polyethylene, normal alpha olefins and polyethylene pipe. The SA&#38;S business segment manufactures and markets aromatics and styrenics products, such as benzene, styrene, paraxylene and cyclohexane, as well as polystyrene and styrene-butadiene copolymers. SA&#38;S also manufactures and/or markets a variety of specialty chemical products including organosulfur chemicals, solvents, catalysts, drilling chemicals and mining chemicals. 

Index to Financial Statements 

The manufacturing of petrochemicals and plastics involves the conversion of hydrocarbon-based raw material feedstocks into higher-value products, often through a thermal process referred to in the industry as &#8220;cracking.&#8221; For example, ethylene can be produced from cracking the feedstocks ethane, propane, butane, natural gasoline or certain refinery liquids, such as naphtha and gas oil. The produced ethylene has a number of uses, primarily as a raw material for the production of plastics, such as polyethylene and polyvinyl chloride. Plastic resins, such as polyethylene, are manufactured in a thermal/catalyst process, and the produced output is used as a further raw material for various applications, such as packaging and plastic pipe. 

CPChem, including through its subsidiaries and equity affiliates, has manufacturing facilities located in Belgium, China, Colombia, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Korea and the United States.

In addition, this segment includes the manufacturing and marketing of specialty products (such as base oils and lubricants), as well as power generation operations. 

Marketing 

Marketing&#8212;United States 

In the United States, as of December 31, 2015 , we marketed gasoline, diesel and aviation fuel through approximately &#32; 8,350 marketer-owned or -supplied outlets in 48 states. These sites utilize the Phillips 66 , Conoco &#32;or 76 brands. 

At December 31, 2015 , our wholesale operations utilized a network of marketers operating approximately 6,700 outlets. We have placed a strong emphasis on the wholesale channel of trade because of its lower capital requirements. In addition, we held brand-licensing agreements with approximately 800 sites. Our refined products are marketed on both a branded and unbranded basis. A high percentage of our branded marketing sales are made in the Midcontinent, Rockies and West Coast regions, where our wholesale marketing operations provide efficient off-take from our refineries. We continue to utilize consignment fuels agreements with several marketers whereby we own the fuel inventory and pay the marketers a fixed monthly fee. 

In the Gulf Coast and East Coast regions, most sales are conducted via unbranded sales which do not require a highly integrated marketing and distribution infrastructure to secure product placement for refinery pull through. We are expanding our export capability at our U.S. coastal refineries to meet growing international demand and increase flexibility to provide product to the highest-value markets. 

In addition to automotive gasoline and diesel, we produce and market jet fuel and aviation gasoline, which is used by smaller piston-engine aircraft. At December 31, 2015 , aviation gasoline and jet fuel were sold through dealers and independent marketers at approximately 850 Phillips 66-branded locations in the United States. 

Marketing&#8212;International 

We have marketing operations in five European countries. Our European marketing strategy is to sell primarily through owned, leased or joint venture retail sites using a low-cost, high-volume approach. We use the JET &#32;brand name to market retail and wholesale products in Austria, Germany and the United Kingdom. In addition, a joint venture in which we have an equity interest markets products in Switzerland under the Coop &#32;brand name. 

We also market aviation fuels, LPG, heating oils, transportation fuels, marine bunker fuels, bitumen and fuel coke specialty products to commercial customers and into the bulk or spot markets in the above countries and Ireland. 

As of December 31, 2015 , we had approximately 1,280 marketing outlets in our European operations, of which approximately 950 were company owned and 330 were dealer owned. In addition, through our joint venture operations in Switzerland, we have interests in 295 additional sites. 

Specialties
