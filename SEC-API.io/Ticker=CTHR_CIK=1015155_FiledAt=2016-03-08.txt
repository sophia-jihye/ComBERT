 Item 1. Business 

General

Charles &#38; Colvard, Ltd., a North Carolina corporation founded in 1995 (which may be referred to as Charles &#38; Colvard, we, us, or our), manufactures, markets, and distributes Charles &#38; Colvard Created Moissanite &#174; (which we refer to as moissanite or moissanite jewels) and finished jewelry featuring moissanite for sale in the worldwide jewelry market. Moissanite, also known by its chemical name silicon carbide (SiC), is a rare mineral first discovered in a meteor crater. Because naturally occurring SiC crystals are too small for commercial use, larger crystals must be grown in a laboratory. Leveraging our advantage of being the original and leading worldwide source of created moissanite jewels, our strategy is to establish Charles &#38; Colvard with reputable, high-quality, and sophisticated brands and to position moissanite as an ethically-sourced, affordable, and luxurious alternative to other gemstones such as diamond. We believe this is possible due to moissanite&#8217;s exceptional brilliance, fire, durability, and rarity like no other jewel available on the market. We sell loose moissanite jewels and finished jewelry at wholesale to distributors, manufacturers, and retailers and at retail to end consumers through our wholly owned operating subsidiaries, Moissanite.com, LLC and Charles &#38; Colvard Direct, LLC (until March 2016), and through third-party marketplaces.

In February 2016, we made the strategic decision to explore a potential divestiture of our direct-to-consumer home party business previously operated through our Charles &#38; Colvard Direct, LLC (dba Lulu Avenue &#174; ) subsidiary. After careful analysis of our core competencies, go-to-market strategies, and intent to advance toward profitability, the management team and Board of Directors determined a divestiture of this distribution channel to be in our and our shareholders&#8217; best interests. On March 4, 2016, we and Charles &#38; Colvard Direct, LLC entered into an asset purchase agreement with Yanbal USA, Inc., or Yanbal, under which Yanbal purchased certain assets related to our direct-to-consumer home party business for $500,000 and assumed certain liabilities related to such assets. A more detailed description of this transaction is included in &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8211; Recent Developments&#8221; in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

As a result of the divestiture, our operating and strategic initiatives discussed below focus on our remaining wholesale and e-commerce distribution segments on a going-forward basis. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we managed our business primarily through our three distribution channels that we used to sell our product lines, loose jewels and finished jewelry, which included Charles and Colvard Direct, LLC. Accordingly, for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, our reportable segments remained our wholesale distribution channel transacted through our parent entity, and our two direct-to-consumer distribution channels transacted through the wholly owned operating subsidiaries, Moissanite.com, LLC and Charles &#38; Colvard Direct, LLC.

We sell our loose moissanite jewels at wholesale to some of the largest distributors and manufacturers in the world, which mount them into fine jewelry to be sold at retail outlets and via the Internet. We also sell loose moissanite jewels and finished jewelry featuring moissanite at wholesale to retailers, TV shopping networks, and designers to be sold to end consumers and directly to consumers through our e-commerce sales channel Moissanite.com and third-party marketplaces. We believe our continued and expanding use of multiple sales channels to the jewelry trade and the end consumer with branded finished jewelry featuring moissanite creates a compelling consumer value proposition with the potential to drive increased demand.

United States, or U.S., sales represented 89% and 86% of total consolidated net sales for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Our largest customer during the year ended December 31, 2015 accounted for 21% of our total consolidated sales compared to 28% during the year ended December 31, 2014. A second customer accounted for 10% of our total consolidated sales during the year ended December 31, 2014 but did not account for more than 10% of our total consolidated sales during the year ended December 31, 2015. No additional customers accounted for more than 10% of total consolidated sales in 2015 or 2014.

Our future growth strategy is closely linked to our vision statement: &#8220;To be an innovative, disruptive leader in the jewelry industry by offering a socially responsible created jewel that will last forever at a revolutionary value.&#8221; We plan to accomplish this vision by growing our core loose jewel and finished jewelry wholesale distribution segment with key distributors, jewelry manufacturers, and retailers while working to develop and expand our continuing direct-to-consumer distribution segment, which is conducted through our e-commerce subsidiary, Moissanite.com, LLC. We also intend to expand our multi-channel e-commerce footprint through third-party marketplaces, comparison shopping engines, affiliate networks, social commerce sites and more. We plan to support these initiatives by increasing consumer awareness through a broad digital marketing footprint, clearly communicating to the consumer the value proposition of our products, and developing and distributing leading global brands for our moissanite jewel and finished jewelry featuring moissanite with an unrelenting focus on quality and design. Our key strategies for 2016 are as follows:

&#183; Expansion of Forever One TM . In September 2015, Charles &#38; Colvard launched Forever One &#8482; &#8211; the world&#8217;s first colorless moissanite jewel. We introduced Forever One TM to the market with a limited launch. It was met with great enthusiasm from channel partners and existing customers. We intend to leverage this momentum, and expand our Forever One TM assortment (more shapes and sizes) throughout 2016 via a series of scheduled product releases. 

&#160;

&#183; A move up-market. Over the years our core product supplier, Cree, Inc., or Cree, has improved its proprietary processes for SiC production. It is this 20-year evolution that has enabled the launch of our colorless jewel, Forever One TM . With this improvement in core product comes the opportunity for Charles &#38; Colvard to move up-market &#8211; competing directly with diamond for share of wallet. Over the next few years, we plan to sell our remaining Forever Classic TM inventory, leaving only Forever Brilliant &#174; and Forever One TM products for sale. We believe that this higher quality product line positions Charles &#38; Colvard for a move up-market to higher end retail opportunities. We do anticipate new providers of moissanite to enter the market, as our USA exclusive patent expired in 2015, and international patents will be expiring this year. We know how challenging it is to create high-quality moissanite and anticipate it will take emerging providers significant time and investment to bring meaningful and competitive products to market. As we experienced ourselves, we anticipate these new providers evolving from low-end moissanite quality, and do not anticipate competition in the near-colorless ( Forever Brilliant &#174; ) or colorless ( Forever One TM ) range for some time to come. To differentiate ourselves from emerging competition and to ensure our customers they are receiving a reputable and high-quality jewel, each Charles &#38; Colvard Created Moissanite &#174; jewel is backed by a Limited Lifetime Warranty and Certificate of Authenticity &#8211; our commitment to our customers that their purchase is guaranteed to retain its fire and brilliance forever. 

&#160;

&#183; Expansion of our jewelry line. &#160; In 2010, Charles &#38; Colvard made the conscious decision to expand from being solely a loose jewel supplier to being a loose jewel and finished jewelry provider. This calculated measure has proven to be a positive one as it provided us the opportunity to make an emotional connection with the consumer. Our finished jewelry customers tend to be repeat customers &#8211; returning again and again to purchase additional goods. We intend to leverage this positive momentum with an expanded product line in 2016 to include increased focus on the bridal category. Charles &#38; Colvard plans to curate a blend of its own finished jewelry featuring moissanite with products from select artisan jewelers. This broadened collection will be available to our retail and wholesale partners as well as promoted on Charles &#38; Colvard&#8217;s e-commerce site and third-party transactional websites. 

&#183; Growth within our traditional channels. Charles &#38; Colvard has enjoyed 20 years of partnership with industry leaders in the wholesale and retail spaces. We believe these traditional channels represent fertile ground for our move up-market, and we are already working with several existing partners to expand their product lines to include Forever One TM . With this new, extraordinary, upscale product we believe we have an opportunity to both expand our relationship with existing partners and onboard new partners. A continued presence for Charles &#38; Colvard Created Moissanite &#174; in traditional retail channels remains an important way for us to create touchpoints directly with consumers by providing them an opportunity to see and believe the beauty and brilliance of moissanite. 

&#183; Expanding our direct-to-consumer e-commerce business. Our direct-to-consumer e-commerce website, Moissanite.com , features an intuitive site design with robust functionality to enhance the customer experience and convert traffic into sales. We continue to expand the website&#8217;s finished jewelry collections and its loose moissanite jewel assortment by featuring a variety of shapes and sizes, and invest in targeted advertising and marketing campaigns. During 2016, we intend to expand our e-commerce footprint by providing our products for sale through additional e-commerce channels and emerging social commerce channels. We believe our direct-to-consumer e-commerce sales channels will not only add to our top-line revenues, but will also play a key role in our campaign to increase overall consumer awareness of moissanite. We also envision e-commerce as a part of a broader effort to establish online connections with consumers that builds our brand and subsequently our business with wholesale and retail partners. 

&#183; A laser focus on millennials. &#160; Millennials are the largest age group in U.S. history, and they are moving into their prime spending years. Millennials have less money to spend and are often encumbered with debt, with student loans taking up a significant chunk of postgraduate millennials&#8217; income. They are the first &#8216;digital natives,&#8217; known for spending significant time online, especially within their social networks. When they do partake in traditional pastimes such as listening to music or watching television, they do so streaming from their digital devices. And most importantly, they are socially and ethically-responsible individuals. Millennials proactively seek out goods and services that align with their core principles, and become devoted and vocal advocates of brands that embody &#8216;green&#8217; practices. Our socially responsible and ethically-sourced loose jewel and finished jewelry products align directly with the principles and purchasing preferences of the millennial, and our quality and price point offer unprecedented value to the cost-conscious millennial. Throughout 2016, Charles &#38; Colvard plans to proactively engage this target market through a multi-channel traditional and digital marketing strategy, as outlined below. 

&#160;

&#183; Our go-to-market strategy. In order to expand existing channels while reaching our millennial targets, Charles &#38; Colvard intends to reconstruct its promotional and go-to-market strategies. In 2016, we plan to: 

&#160;

Table of Contents 

&#183; Develop significant educational content to help the market understand moissanite, the availability of our expanded selection of loose jewels and finished jewelry featuring moissanite, and our commitment to corporate social responsibility in the products we bring to market and the way we operate our business. We also plan to deliver background content relative to the mined diamond industry to help the consumer understand the significant difference in practices between the created gemstone and jewel industry versus the mined diamond industry. We anticipate being disruptive in the industry and intend to be an authority on the topics of social injustices and environmental impact in the mined diamond industry, the upsurge of created gemstones and jewels, and the social and ethical appeal of created gemstones and jewels to the market. 

&#160;

&#183; Expand our traditional channels. We plan to foster existing relationships designed to move channel partners up-market with us, while onboarding new partners who we believe are well positioned to help us bring Forever One TM to market. We intend to focus our efforts on additional television channels, new wholesale and retail opportunities, an expanded drop-ship network, a presence with independent jewelers, and more. 

&#160;

&#183; Execute an aggressive social media strategy to directly reach consumers. Leveraging our own social media properties and those of third parties, we believe we will create a dialogue that enables a &#8216;pull&#8217; strategy which draws consumers to Charles &#38; Colvard to learn about and acquire our products. 

&#160;

&#183; Expand our online presence including an aggressive push of Charles &#38; Colvard product to e-commerce marketplaces, comparison shopping engines, affiliate networks, social commerce sites and more. We intend to couple these postings with a significant digital marketing presence to deliver online advertising and search engine results to the consumer at the time they are searching for related products. 

&#160;

&#183; Adopt new and emerging technologies to deliver our message. In order to remain relevant and in front of today&#8217;s rapidly-evolving consumer, it is incumbent on Charles &#38; Colvard to study and adopt new technologies as the consumer demands them. A prime example is advancements in streaming video and the increasing impact video has on consumer education and behavior. We believe this is a significant shift, and one we need to employ in our online toolkit. We will strive to adopt this and other technologies to enhance our own e-commerce property as well as third-party outlets to tell our story. 

Moissanite

Moissanite is a rare, naturally occurring mineral that is generally very small in size, dark green or black in color, and not a commercially viable source of gemstone material. Therefore, we expect only lab-grown SiC crystals to provide a sustainable source of moissanite for jewels.

In addition to carat size, important characteristics of a gemstone are beauty, durability, and rarity. The beauty of a near colorless and colorless gemstone is characterized by its color, brilliance, and fire. The brilliance of a gemstone is measured by its refractive index, or the extent to which, when coupled with the facet design, the gemstone reflects light. The fire of a gemstone, or the breaking of light rays into spectral colors, is measured by its dispersion. Durability is determined by a gemstone&#8217;s hardness, or resistance to scratching; and toughness, or resistance to chipping or cleaving. Rarity is the availability or perceived availability of a gemstone.

Moissanite jewels have a unique combination of brilliance, fire, durability, and rarity. Moissanite&#8217;s beauty is objectively derived from its refractive index, which is higher than other gemstones, including diamond, and its hardness is greater than all known gemstone materials except diamond. As a result, moissanite jewels, like diamond, can be cut with sharp, well-defined, and highly polished facets that accentuate their brilliance and fire. The cutting specifications (facet arrangement and proportions) for moissanite jewels are designed to maximize the brilliance and fire of the material. Additionally, we evaluate the finished jewels to exacting standards with automated video-imaging equipment and specially trained quality control personnel. Due to the rare natural occurrence of moissanite and both the proprietary and technical limitations in producing mass quantities of gem-grade moissanite, we believe that moissanite is among the rarest of jewels.

Products and Product Development

Moissanite jewels

Historically, Charles &#38; Colvard primarily sold near-colorless moissanite jewels including Forever Classic TM and Forever Brilliant &#174; . We continue to offer these products in a variety of shapes including round, square brilliant, princess, cushion, radiant, pear, marquise, heart, and oval, among others, in sizes ranging from approximately 1.3 to 12 millimeters (approximately 0.008 to 5.3 carats). In 2015, we announced our latest product, the first colorless moissanite jewel, Forever One TM . Our limited launch was met with great enthusiasm from channel partners and existing customers. Based on this market validation, we plan to expand our Forever One TM assortment (more cuts and sizes) throughout 2016 via a series of scheduled product releases.

Finished jewelry

We began selling finished jewelry featuring moissanite in 2010. Our basic designs include stud earnings, solitaire and three-stone rings, pendants, and bracelets. We are also selling more fashion-oriented, designer-inspired moissanite jewelry that we offer as an expansion to the basic line of jewelry. The primary ingredients of our moissanite finished jewelry are loose moissanite jewels that we have on hand as part of our finished goods inventory, white or yellow gold settings, and labor to mount the jewels into the settings. We have also created several pieces of jewelry in alternative metals such as sterling silver and palladium.

In addition, we historically purchased fashion finished jewelry comprising base metals and non-precious gemstones for sale through Lulu Avenue &#174; . This finished jewelry was fashion oriented and subject to styling trends that may change with each catalog season. The majority of this finished jewelry was custom designed for us. We do not anticipate further purchases of fashion finished jewelry after the divestiture of our direct-to-consumer home party business on March 4, 2016.

Source of Raw Material

Our moissanite jewels are made from gem-grade SiC crystals. Our sole supplier of SiC crystals is Cree, with which we have certain exclusive supply rights for SiC crystals to be used for gemstone applications. We source the metals used for our finished jewelry, including white and yellow gold, sterling silver, and palladium, from a number of manufacturers located primarily in the U.S. or internationally in China, India, Mexico, or Thailand. In line with our goal of providing socially and ethically-sourced products, we require suppliers of our gold to certify that the gold is coming from conflict free sources.

&#160;

Exclusive Supply Agreement with Cree

In June 1997, we entered into an Amended and Restated Exclusive Supply Agreement with Cree, or the Cree Exclusive Supply Agreement. The Cree Exclusive Supply Agreement had an initial term of ten years that was extended in January 2005 to July 2015. In connection with the Cree Exclusive Supply Agreement, we had committed to purchase from Cree a minimum of 50%, by dollar volume, of our raw material SiC crystal requirements. Effective February 8, 2013, we entered into an amendment to a prior letter agreement with Cree, which provided a framework for our purchases of SiC crystals under the Cree Exclusive Supply Agreement. Pursuant to this amendment, we agreed to purchase at least $4.00 million of SiC crystals in an initial new order. After the initial new order, we agreed to issue non-cancellable, quarterly orders that must equal or exceed a set minimum order quantity. Our total purchase commitment under the amendment (as subsequently amended) until July 2015, including the initial new order, was dependent upon the grade of the material and ranged between approximately $7.64 million and approximately $18.56 million.

On December 12, 2014, we entered into a new exclusive supply agreement with Cree, or the New Supply Agreement, which superseded and replaced (with respect to materials ordered subsequent to the effective date of the New Supply Agreement) the Cree Exclusive Supply Agreement, which was set to expire in 2015. Under the New Supply Agreement, subject to certain terms and conditions, we agreed to exclusively purchase from Cree, and Cree agreed to exclusively supply, 100% of our required SiC materials in quarterly installments that must equal or exceed a set minimum order quantity. The initial term of the New Supply Agreement will expire on June 24, 2018, unless extended by the parties. We also have one option to unilaterally extend the term of the agreement for an additional two-year period, subject to certain conditions. Our total purchase commitment under the New Supply Agreement until June 2018 is dependent upon the size of the SiC material and ranges between approximately $29.6 million and approximately $31.5 million.

Intellectual Property

We had U.S. product and method patents for moissanite jewels that expired during 2015, under which we had broad, exclusive rights to manufacture, use, and sell moissanite jewels in the U.S. We have these same patents in 25 foreign jurisdictions primarily across Asia and Europe, expiring in 2016, and in Mexico, expiring in 2021. In addition, we have certain trademarks and pending trademark applications that support our moissanite branding strategy. We anticipate new providers of moissanite will enter the market as our patents expire. We know how challenging it is to create high-quality moissanite and anticipate it will take emerging providers significant time and investment to bring meaningful and competitive products to market. As we experienced ourselves, we anticipate these new providers will evolve from low-end moissanite quality, and do not anticipate competition in the near-colorless ( Forever Brilliant &#174; ) or colorless ( Forever One TM ) range for some time to come.

Our success and our ability to compete successfully depend in part upon our proprietary technology. In addition to our remaining international patents, we rely on trade secret laws and employee, consultant, and customer confidentiality agreements to protect certain aspects of our technology. We currently are not subject to any claims that our products or processes infringe on the proprietary rights of third parties. At the present time, we are also dependent on Cree&#8217;s technology for the production of SiC crystals.

Manufacturing and Quality Assurance

Moissanite jewels

The production of Charles &#38; Colvard Created Moissanite &#174; jewels is an elaborate process developed over a number of years of collaborative research and development, acquired and learned knowledge from scientists, and considerable investment expense.

Following are the key manufacturing processes of our moissanite jewels:

&#183; growing gem-grade raw SiC crystals; 

&#183; manufacturing rough preforms; 

&#183; polishing jewels; and 

&#183; inspecting, sorting, and grading. 

&#160;

Table of Contents 

Growing gem-grade raw SiC crystals - SiC crystal growth suitable for gem-grade usage at commercial quantities is proprietary both in design and in operational methodology. Cree has grown the majority of our SiC crystals in accordance with the terms of the Cree Exclusive Supply Agreement and New Supply Agreement. We routinely evaluate the yield and quality of saleable moissanite jewels from SiC crystals. The yield of saleable jewels from each crystal is one of the most significant factors affecting the volume and cost of moissanite jewels available for sale. Yield is dependent on the quality of the crystals, and variations in crystal quality can adversely affect our gross margin percentage.

Manufacturing rough preforms - We have made considerable investment in the design, development, and customization of a proprietary manufacturing process that includes equipment, software, and procedures to maximize raw material yield. The result is production of intermediary shapes, called &#8220;preforms,&#8221; that vary depending upon the size and shape of the finished jewel. We continue to invest research and development resources to improve raw material yield, including studying alternate preform shapes and cutting technologies, due to the dramatic effect such an improvement could have on our gross margin percentage. 

Polishing jewels - Each preform is hand-faceted and polished by our independent third-party gem-cutters based on master designs with multiple quality control measures built into the process. Gem-cutter training is a regimented program involving several months of progressive hands-on bench training. As we expand the assortment of Forever One &#8482; , we have begun the process to certify additional cutters to ensure sufficient scalability of our production capabilities to meet anticipated demand for this new finished jewel.

Inspecting, sorting, and grading - Similar to other gemstones, each faceted moissanite jewel greater than 2.5 millimeters in size is individually graded against established master standards using our specially trained personnel. Additionally, as part of our overall quality assurance program, a representative sample from each batch of jewels is submitted to an image analyzer to ensure critical angles and other attributes designed to maximize moissanite&#8217;s optical properties are consistently maintained. This phase of manufacturing is relatively labor-intensive and requires skills not readily available in the general work force. In the future, we may elect to outsource certain portions of this stage of the manufacturing process to independent third parties that we will require to adhere to our rigorous quality control and monitoring standards.

Finished jewelry

Our line of finished jewelry featuring moissanite is developed by a team of industry experts integrating our moissanite jewels into many forms of jewelry, generally made of 14 karat gold, but also certain alternative metals such as sterling silver and palladium, either designed or purchased by us utilizing a core group of suppliers, manufacturers, and finishers. In addition to our Limited Lifetime Warranty offered on our moissanite jewels, we provide a twelve-month Limited Warranty on all finished jewelry featuring moissanite.

Our prior line of fashion finished jewelry, comprised of base metals and non-precious gemstones for sale through Lulu Avenue &#174; , was either designed exclusively for us and manufactured to our specifications or purchased from a core group of suppliers and manufacturers. We do not anticipate further purchases of fashion finished jewelry after the divestiture of our direct-to-consumer home party business on March 4, 2016.

All procured finished jewelry components are sourced from our approved suppliers, and each finished jewelry item is jobbed and/or tracked by stock keeping unit, or SKU, utilizing our enterprise resource planning system. The components of moissanite finished jewelry comprised in each job are then manufactured into finished jewelry by assemblers either in the U.S. or internationally in China, India, Mexico, or Thailand . We are continuously working with our existing manufacturing partners, as well as identifying new manufacturing partners, to expand our assortments. 

All finished jewelry produced by us undergoes a multi-point inspection process. A representative sampling of manufactured finished jewelry items undergoes stone and metals testing to ensure that the items for sale are of the quality that we strive to maintain. Also, in line with our goal of providing socially and ethically-sourced products, we require suppliers of our gold to certify that the gold is coming from conflict free sources. If required by government ordinance or requested by a customer, we facilitate the inspection of our finished jewelry by internationally recognized testing facilities to comply with legal requirements and to ensure consumer confidence.

Marketing and Distribution

Marketing

Millennials and Social Media

&#183; Millennials &#8211; This important age group is socially and ethically wired. They proactively seek out goods and services that align with their core principles and become devoted and vocal advocates of brands that embody &#8216;green&#8217; practices. Our socially responsible and ethically-sourced product aligns directly with the principles and purchasing requirements of the millennial and our quality and price point offer unprecedented value to the cost-conscious millennial. Throughout 2016, Charles &#38; Colvard plans to proactively engage this target market through a multi-channel strategy. 

&#183; Social Media - To reinforce and support our position as the premier source of moissanite, our marketing team is working on several social media initiatives that target current and future moissanite consumers and support the promotion and sale of Charles &#38; Colvard Created Moissanite &#8482; . Our campaigns are focused on driving a consistent message emphasizing the ethical origins of our jewels, their everlasting beauty, and overall value. We are using various forms of digital and social media outreach to accomplish greater awareness of the value proposition we offer. 

Wholesale Distribution Segment

&#183; Marketing to the trade - In 2015, we continued to target the trade with print advertisements featuring our Forever Brilliant &#174; moissanite jewel and finished jewelry featuring the Forever Brilliant &#174; jewel in leading trade publications, tagging key distributors to support sales growth. Our September 2015 launch of Forever One TM was a controlled event, and little advertising or promotion accompanied the release. We anticipate delivering meaningful promotion of Forever One TM in 2016 as we expand this product line (more shapes and sizes) via a series of scheduled product releases. 

&#183; Industry associations - We maintain relationships with major jewelry industry organizations and jewelry trade publications as an opportunity to communicate with our peers on a consistent basis through media coverage, trade shows, action committees, and charitable events, among others. 

&#183; Trade shows - Our attendance at leading jewelry trade shows as a sponsor, an exhibitor, or a participant has helped us extend our outreach to customers. In 2015, we attended major domestic and international jewelry industry trade shows, including JCK in Las Vegas and the Hong Kong Gem and Jewellery Fair, and we intend to continue investing in these important industry events in 2016. 

&#183; Cooperative advertising - Some of our loose moissanite jewel wholesale customers participate in our cooperative advertising program, which reimburses, via a credit towards future purchases, a portion of their marketing costs based on the amount of their purchases from us, subject to the customer adhering to our branding guidelines and other conditions. We plan to de-emphasize broad-based cooperative advertising, but we will consider strategic opportunities to utilize this form of advertising. 

Direct-to-Consumer E-commerce Segment

&#183; Consumer education - Because education of the consumer is so important to sell-through of moissanite products, we continue to enhance our corporate website www.charlesandcolvard.com to include extensive educational information about moissanite, in addition to general background information about our company. Our direct-to-consumer e-commerce site, Moissanite.com , also features much of the same educational content that allows a consumer to learn more about moissanite prior to purchase. We expect to launch additional improvements and enhancements to our web presence in 2016. 

&#183; Consumer advertising - We are supporting our initiative to increase consumer awareness of moissanite and our finished jewelry primarily with various forms of electronic communication, including targeted email and via social media outlets. 

&#160;

Previously, we marketed our finished fashion and moissanite jewelry offered by Lulu Avenue &#174; through paid search advertising and various forms of electronic communication including social media campaigns. We also offered classes to our independent sales representatives, which we refer to as Style Advisors, to help promote consumer education. Due to our divestiture of this distribution channel, we do not anticipate further marketing of the direct-to-consumer home parties segment.

Distribution

Wholesale Distribution Segment

We generally have contracts and agreements with our domestic and international distributor, manufacturer, and retailer wholesale customers with some variations in terms and duration.

&#183; Domestic - Finished jewelry featuring moissanite is sold through our wholesale distribution segment to consumers through a broad range of channels, including single- and multiple-location independent jewelry stores, jewelry store chains, online retailers, television shopping networks, department stores, and catalogs. We sell our loose moissanite jewels to wholesale distributors and finished jewelry manufacturers, which in turn set them in mountings and sell them to retailers, sell them through their own e-commerce sites, or resell the loose jewels at a markup. We also mount our loose jewels into our own jewelry, which we currently sell at wholesale to home shopping networks, various e-commerce websites, and select retailers. In addition, we have allowed loose moissanite jewel and finished jewelry inventory to be placed in stores on a consignment basis. We continue to evaluate our channel strategy for domestic wholesale distribution, which may result in a change to our historical distribution methods and partners. 

&#183; International - Our international wholesale distribution currently comprises primarily loose moissanite jewels that are sold to international distributors for resale to jewelry manufacturers and retailers in their local markets. We currently have over 20 international wholesale distributors for loose moissanite jewels covering portions of Western Europe, Australia, India, Southeast Asia, and the Middle East. We have continued to invest in certain international markets that we believe have the most potential with respect to acceptance and sales of the moissanite jewel, including Australia, China, India, Italy, and the United Kingdom. Export sales aggregated approximately $3.47 million, or 11% of total consolidated net sales, and $3.54 million, or 14% of total consolidated net sales, in 2015 and 2014, respectively. It should be noted that a portion of our international sales consists of finished jewels sold internationally that may be re-imported to U.S. retailers. 

Direct-to-Consumer E-commerce Distribution Segment

We sell our loose moissanite jewels and finished jewelry featuring moissanite at retail through our direct-to-consumer Moissanite.com e-commerce website at www.moissanite.com. We maintain on-hand stock for such basic designs as stud earrings, solitaire and three-stone rings, pendants, and bracelets and fulfill orders from our main facility. Other finished jewelry styles offered for sale on the website are made-to-order by several of our key distributors who also assist in providing fulfillment of these products directly to the end consumer. We anticipate a continued focus and investment on site enhancement and responsiveness in order to provide our customers with a seamless shopping experience, whether the customer is shopping online from a desktop or mobile device. We believe these enhancements will drive improved customer traffic and conversion.

Currently, all of our direct-to-consumer e-commerce segment distribution is domestic. Sales made to international shipping addresses through our Moissanite.com e-commerce website are shipped to a domestic third-party intermediary that assumes all risks and liabilities for the international transaction.

Direct-to-Consumer Home Parties Distribution Segment

Prior to the divestiture of the assets of this distribution channel, our finished fashion and moissanite jewelry offered by Lulu Avenue &#174; was sold to consumers online at www.luluavenue.com; and in convenient, comfortable venues by our Style Advisors, using sample pieces contained in a sales kit purchased by the Style Advisor as part of the enrollment process. The Style Advisors supplemented the sample pieces with additional styles displayed in seasonal catalogs and online at www.luluavenue.com. Orders were entered by the Style Advisor into a back office system, and the products were fulfilled by a third-party logistics company that shipped the products to the Style Advisor or end consumer. All of our direct-to-consumer home party segment distribution was domestic.

Seasonality

Sales in the retail jewelry industry are typically seasonal due to increased consumer purchases during the Christmas and holiday season. Because historically we have primarily sold our loose moissanite jewels and finished jewelry featuring moissanite at wholesale to distributors, manufacturers, and retailers, our sales to support the holiday season largely have taken place during the third and beginning of the fourth calendar quarters, depending on the sales channel and the level of advance planning and production our customers undertook; however, the effect of seasonality on our business is also impacted by the timing of orders we receive to support new or expanded distribution and the level of current inventory position held by our customers. In the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we experienced a higher degree of seasonality in the fourth quarter than we have experienced in prior years primarily as a result of Christmas and holiday season sales to end consumers through our direct-to-consumer e-commerce website, Moissanite.com , and in the fourth quarter of 2014 as a result of increased sales through televised home shopping networks within our wholesale distribution segment. In future periods, as sales of our finished jewelry increase to retailers and directly to consumers, both in dollars and as a percentage of total sales, we anticipate a seasonality trend more typical with the retail jewelry industry, and these factors may significantly affect our results of operations in a given quarter.

Working Capital Practices

Our primary source of working capital is cash on hand and cash generated by operations. Because we have a quarterly minimum purchase commitment under the New Supply Agreement, we may be required to purchase SiC materials in excess of our immediate needs from time to time, which may result in inventories that are higher than we might otherwise maintain.

Our standard wholesale customer payment terms on trade receivables are generally between 30 and 90 days, though we may offer extended terms with specific customers and on significant orders from time to time. We extend credit to our customers based upon a number of factors, including an evaluation of the customer&#8217;s financial condition and credit history that is verified through trade association reference services, the customer&#8217;s payment history with us, the customer&#8217;s reputation in the trade, and/or an evaluation of the customer&#8217;s opportunity to introduce our moissanite jewels or finished jewelry featuring moissanite to new or expanded markets.

Our return policy allows for the return of jewels and finished jewelry for credit generally within 30 days of shipment and must be returned for a valid reason, such as quality problems or an error in shipment, with the exception of our direct-to-consumer sales channels in which a customer can return their purchases for any reason. We have established an allowance for returns based on our historical return rate, which takes into account any contractual return privileges granted to our customers. Periodically, we ship loose jewel and jewelry finished goods to wholesale customers on consignment terms. Under these terms, the customer assumes the risk of loss and has an absolute right of return for a specified period.

Competition

Our competitive success is reliant upon, in part, the following:

&#183; our ability to understand the consumer market segment and effectively market to them a compelling value proposition that leads to converted customers; 

&#160;

&#183; our continued success in developing and promoting brands for our moissanite jewel and finished jewelry featuring moissanite, resulting in increased interest and demand for moissanite jewelry at the consumer level; 

&#160;

&#183; the continued willingness and ability of our jewelry distributors and other jewelry suppliers, manufacturers, and designers to market and promote Charles &#38; Colvard Created Moissanite &#174; to the retail jewelry trade; 

&#160;

Table of Contents 

&#183; the continued willingness of distributors, retailers, and others in the channel of distribution to purchase loose Charles &#38; Colvard Created Moissanite &#174; , and the continued willingness of manufacturers, designers, and retail jewelers to undertake setting of the loose jewels; 

&#160;

&#183; our continued ability and the ability of manufacturers, designers, and retail jewelers to select jewelry settings that encourage consumer acceptance of and demand for our moissanite jewels and finished jewelry; 

&#160;

&#183; our continued ability and the ability of jewelry manufacturers and retail jewelers to set loose moissanite jewels in finished jewelry with high-quality workmanship; 

&#160;

&#183; our continued ability and the ability of retail jewelers to effectively market and sell finished jewelry featuring moissanite, including finished jewelry to consumers; and 

&#160;

&#183; our ability to operationally execute our direct-to-consumer e-commerce business. 

Moissanite jewels

Gemstone materials can be grouped into three types:

&#183; natural gemstone, which is found in nature; 

&#160;

&#183; synthetic gemstone, which has the same chemical composition and essentially the same physical and optical characteristics of natural gemstone but is created in a lab; and 

&#160;

&#183; simulated or substitute material, which is similar in appearance to natural gemstone but does not have the same chemical composition, physical properties, or optical characteristics. 

Our moissanite jewel competes with fine gemstones such as ruby, sapphire, emerald, and tanzanite as well as with natural, synthetic, and treated diamonds. We may also face competition from synthetic diamonds, synthetic diamond films, and other sources of synthetic moissanite not presently available in qualities, sizes, and volumes suitable for use as gemstones. Some suppliers of diamonds and other fine gemstones, as well as the suppliers of synthetic and simulated gemstones, have substantially greater financial, technical, manufacturing, and marketing resources and greater access to distribution channels than we do.

We market our unique jewel as a socially-conscious and ethically-sourced, affordable, luxurious alternative to diamond at price points that make our jewel more attainable by many consumers. The diamond industry enjoys higher consumer desirability and acceptance, which has been iconicized by the &#8220;Diamonds are Forever&#8221; marketing campaign. Historical efforts to differentiate moissanite from diamond as a unique jewel by virtue of its distinctive composition and its superior optical characteristics remain a challenge, as moissanite resembles diamond in the eyes of consumers. Therefore, we shifted our marketing strategy of moissanite to be a high-quality alternative to diamond beginning in 2009, and have begun a campaign to highlight the social and ethical differences between diamond and moissanite to educate our target market.

The worldwide market for large, uncut, high-quality natural diamonds is significantly consolidated and controlled by DeBeers (headquartered in South Africa), Alrosa (Russia), Rio Tinto (Australia), and BHP (Canada). These companies have a major impact on the worldwide supply and pricing of natural diamonds at both the wholesale and retail levels. Diamond producers may undertake additional marketing or other activities designed to protect the diamond jewelry market against sales erosion from consumer acceptance of moissanite jewels.

We may also face competition from treated and synthetic diamonds. Treated diamonds, which are natural diamonds with imperfections or flaws that have been altered in some manner to enhance their appearance, have been available in the jewelry industry for the past several decades and are generally less expensive than diamonds of similar size, cut, and color that have not been altered. Synthetic diamonds are also available in the marketplace and are produced for jewelry applications available to consumers. We have seen a recent emergence of new manufacturers of lab-grown diamonds that offer a product directly competitive with natural diamond; however they are priced just below that of natural diamond, and therefore compete with Charles &#38; Colvard Created Moissanite &#174; at a much higher price point. Although we believe that colorless gemstone-quality synthetic and treated diamonds presently cannot be produced at prices competitive with those currently offered for our moissanite jewels, there can be no assurance that such competitive prices cannot be achieved in the future by the producers of either or both synthetic and treated diamonds. The primary producers of synthetic diamonds used for industrial applications are DeBeers, Sumitomo, and GE. There are also a number of Russian producers of synthetic diamonds for industrial uses. In addition, companies such as Chatham, Diamond Foundry and Apollo Diamonds are synthesizing diamonds in limited quantities, limited carat sizes, and in limited ranges of color. Synthetic diamond films can be grown at commercially viable prices in thicknesses that can be applied to various surfaces such as other synthetic materials.

Although we believe that our moissanite jewel has a proprietary position, we could face competition from other companies that develop competing SiC technologies. Some of these technologies could be developed by producers of SiC used for other industrial applications. Manufacturers of industrial SiC products include The Carborundum Corporation (currently for abrasive uses); and Cree, Siemens AG, Norstel, Bridgestone, ABB, Dow Chemical, SiC Crystal AG, and Northrop Grumman Corporation (currently for semiconductor uses). We believe that Cree is currently the only supplier of SiC crystals in colors, sizes, and volumes that are suitable for gemstone applications. It is possible, however, that these or other producers of SiC could develop SiC crystals suitable for gemstone applications and produce moissanite jewels until we could obtain judicial enforcement of our patent rights that remain internationally. It is also possible that such competition could emerge in geographic territories where we might not have adequate patent protection, such as within the U.S.

We may also, to a lesser degree, face competition from existing diamond simulants and other synthetic gemstones, including cubic zirconia. Producers and sellers of these products may see the markets for these products being eroded by the market penetration of our moissanite jewels. We believe that the substantially lower price of these products is the primary basis upon which they will compete with our moissanite jewels; however, they are not considered fine jewelry products.

Finished jewelry

The global fine jewelry market competition is fierce. Such well-known jewelry designers and manufacturers as David Yurman, Tacori, Harry Winston, Tiffany &#38; Co., and Pandora, among others, have a variety of jewelry collections featuring diamond and other precious and semi-precious gemstones, and enjoy strong brand recognition and a loyal consumer following. These companies also have greater financial resources than we do to develop and market their products.

We intend to expand our market share and compete with these well-known brands primarily on the basis of the combination of quality, design, and value, as moissanite is the highest quality, affordable alternative available to more expensive gemstones such as diamond. We believe that focusing on the clear advantages in its retail price points, especially in the one-carat and larger sizes, will provide a key point of differentiation and value proposition to the end consumer who may not have had the opportunity previously to purchase fine jewelry due to limitations in discretionary spending income.

In addition, we believe that the Charles &#38; Colvard Created Moissanite &#174; brand, in addition to other brands for both the moissanite jewel, including Forever Brilliant &#174; and Forever One TM , and moissanite finished jewelry that we are developing pursuant to our marketing programs, may create a long-term competitive advantage for our products as we build brand recognition. We endeavor to partner with recognized designers and jewelry companies, in addition to our own proprietary brands of finished jewelry. While our finished jewelry business is still developing, our goal is to build multiple strong brands sought after by the end consumer. We propose to focus our marketing efforts on emphasizing our attractive designs, coupled with moissanite&#8217;s exceptional brilliance, fire, durability, and rarity, to establish moissanite as a primary consumer choice in fine jewelry.

Our design, manufacture, and marketing of finished jewelry featuring moissanite under exclusive brands for sale at wholesale to distributors and retailers and at retail to end consumers through our Moissanite.com e-commerce sales channel may result in some of our current wholesale customers perceiving us as a competitor, despite our efforts to use primarily non-conflicting sales channels. As we continue to develop our finished jewelry business, we intend to increase distribution through new and existing channels similarly to how many other companies have executed cross-channel marketing and distribution strategies. Due to the size of the finished jewelry market, we believe that such sales channels can co-exist, with the overall end result being increased consumer and brand awareness of moissanite products and a corresponding increased demand for not only our products, but those of our distributor and manufacturer customers as well.

Government Regulation

We are subject to governmental regulations in the manufacture and sale of moissanite jewels and finished jewelry. In particular, the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, has issued regulations and guidelines governing the marketing of synthetic gemstones and other gemstones similar to diamond that require such gemstones to be clearly identified in any promotional or marketing materials. In addition, the precious metal in our finished jewelry may be subject to requirements, which vary by country and by state, such as hallmarking and alloy content. While we have a policy to ensure compliance with applicable regulations, if our actions are found to be in violation of FTC or other governmental regulations, we may be required to suspend marketing of our products and could incur significant expenses in developing new marketing strategies and materials that would not violate FTC regulations.

&#160;

Research and Development

We invested approximately $18,000 in research and development during both years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 primarily for the study of product enhancement and manufacturing process efficiencies.

Employees

As of March 8, 2016, we had a total of 82 employees, 75 of which were full-time and seven were part-time. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. We believe that our employee relations are good.
