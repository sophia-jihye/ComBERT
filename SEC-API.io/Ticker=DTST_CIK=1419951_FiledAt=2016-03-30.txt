&#160;

Our Continuing Strategy 

&#160;

DSC derives revenues from long-term subscription and professional services contracts related to the implementation of solutions that provide protection of critical computerized data. In 2009, revenues consisted primarily of offsite data backup, de-duplication, continuous data protection and cloud disaster recovery solutions, protecting information for our clients. In 2010, we expanded our solutions based on the asset acquisition of SafeData, a provider of disaster recovery and business continuity for IBM&#8217;s mid-range servers, Power i. In 2013, we continued to assimilate organizations, expanded our technology, as well as our technical group and positioned the new organization for growth. In October 2012, we purchased the software and assets of Message Logic, an email archival and compliance software. We deliver our solutions over highly reliable, redundant and secure fiber optic networks with separate and diverse routes to the internet from data centers in various states in the U.S.

&#160;

DSC is positioned to leverage our infrastructure, data center, equipment capacity and leadership team to grow revenue to significant levels. Positioned for organic growth, our strategy will be to grow through acquisition of synergistic solutions. DSC believes opportunities exist to acquire service providers to enhance our products and services portfolio, increase our distribution channels, expand our management and increase our cash flow.

&#160;

Our objective with acquisitions is to reduce costs through economies of scale while increasing market share and consolidating efforts. We believe that through a strategy of partnership program, as well as acquisition of synergistic service providers we can create significant value.

&#160;

We continue to believe that the opportunity exists today to acquire and consolidate synergetic companies in this fragmented industry. This strategy will enable DSC to create an international presence and a recognizable premiere brand. The roll up of these technical consulting companies and system integrators will also form a powerful distribution channel for both our current and future service offerings.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES AND SOLUTIONS 

&#160;

DSC&#8217;s core competencies are the following: Email Archival and Data Analysis, Data Vaulting, Virtual Disaster Recovery and High Availability for Intel and IBM infrastructures. DSC has entered in agreements to provide solutions Microsoft 365 and Hosted Email in 2016.

&#160;

BUSINESS CONTINUITY SOLUTION: The Recovery Cloud : 

&#160;

DSC offers a fully automated service designed to reduce the overall costs associated with backup and recovery of application and file servers that enables organizations to centralize and streamline their data protection process. Business-critical data can be backed up any time while servers are up and running.

&#160;

The essence of data backup is the scheduled movement of &#8220;point-in-time&#8221; snapshots of data across a network to a remote location. DSC&#8217;s disk-to-disk backup and recovery solution is reliable and easy-to-use. As part of this service, DSC offers Continuous Data Protection (&#8220;CDP&#8221;), delta block processing, data de-duplication and large volume protection.

&#160;

Significant advantages over traditional backup software: 

&#160;

&#9679; Immediate off-site backup &#9679; Reduced backup windows &#9679; Elimination of tape management issues &#9679; Minimized costs associated with distributed backups &#9679; Elimination of human intervention &#9679; Encryption of all backed up data &#9679; Optimized bandwidth &#160;

BENEFITS AND FEATURES OF THE RECOVERY CLOUD: 

&#160;

Data Archiving &#8211; Lifecycle Management 

&#160;

Backup data must be managed throughout its life cycle to provide the best data protection, meet compliance regulations and to improve recovery time objectives (&#8220;RTO&#8221;). DSC offers policy-based file archiving and manages archiving and restoration of data from backup sessions, reducing the cost of inactive files on-line. DSC creates restorable point-in-time copies of backup sets for historical reference to meet compliance objectives and creates Certificates of Destruction. All of an enterprise's data can be placed into one of two categories; Critical information which is needed for day-to-day operations and resides in the system's primary storage for fast access; Important information is the historical, legal and regulatory information that can safely be archived to secondary storage, lower cost disk or tapes stored offsite.

&#160;

Continuous Data Protection (&#8220;CDP&#8221;) 

&#160;

What if a database is corrupted in the middle of the workday? As data continually mounts in today&#8217;s fast paced business environment, organizations need to protect their systems on an ongoing basis, or risk losing mission-critical data, information, and transactions, as well as associated business revenue. CDP solutions employ sophisticated I/O, CPU, and network throttling to achieve efficiency and reliability. Moreover, to protect against connectivity failures and interruptions, CDP features an auto resume mechanism that sustains replication and adapts according to the environment to achieve optimal and predictable performance.

&#160;

Our technology will identify and propagate only that sector of data to the disaster recovery site, effectively reducing bandwidth and storage consumption. CDP also employs data compression and encryption to maximize network bandwidth utilization and ensure end-to-end security between the primary and DR site.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Microsoft Exchange 

&#160;

Ensure business-critical e-mail data is protected against application or hardware-based corruption or loss, user error, or a natural disaster with our solution. Designed with ease of use in mind, our solution provides Exchange Server 2000/2003/2007 complete protection down to the individual mailbox or even an individual mail message.

&#160;

For those companies that have recovery time objectives of 1 hour or less, DSC&#8217;s HA solution meets the high availability demands of their business. DSC&#8217;s HA solution is a subscription-based high availability offering. For a monthly subscription fee and long-term contract, DSC creates and maintains a mirror of its clients&#8217; mission-critical systems and data at a secure off-site data center ensuring their business is &#8220;switch ready.&#8221; During either planned or unplanned downtime, DSC&#8217;s HA solution ensures the business will continue to operate, by providing an essential Infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS), switchable &#8220;mirror&#8221; of a client&#8217;s data and applications.

&#160;

In the event of an outage, the DSC system becomes the client&#8217;s production system. When the client&#8217;s production system is again operational, the DSC server updates the client&#8217;s system with any new data. When downtime is planned, the customer can switch to the DSC server and run its production applications.

&#160;

CORPORATE HISTORY 

&#160;

To date, DSC consummated (i) a share exchange with Euro Trend Inc. in October 20, 2008, (ii) an asset acquisition of SafeData, LLC (&#8220;SafeData&#8221;) in June 2010, and (iii) an asset acquisition of Message Logic LLC, (&#8220;Message Logic&#8221;) in October 2012.

&#160;

On October 20, 2008 we completed a share exchange agreement whereby we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock and ownership interests of DSC. In exchange we issued 13,357,143 shares of our common stock to the shareholders. This transaction was accounted for as a reverse merger for accounting purposes. Accordingly, DSC, the accounting acquirer, is regarded as the predecessor entity.

&#160;

On June 17, 2010 we entered into an asset purchase agreement with SafeData, a provider of Cloud Storage and Cloud Computing mostly to IBM&#8217;s mid-range equipment users, under which we acquired all right, title and interest in the end user customer base of SafeData and all related current and fixed assets and contracts including the transfer of all of SafeData&#8217;s current liabilities arising out of the business or the assets acquired. Pursuant to the Agreement, we paid an aggregate purchase price equal to $3,000,000. Giving effect to certain holdback and contingency clauses as defined in the agreement, we paid $1,229,952 in cash and $850,000 in shares of our common stock as well as assumption of SafeData accounts payable and receivables. In June of 2011, we made a final payment net of holdback of $482,308 and we issued the remaining balance of $150,000 in Common Stock. The final settlement resulted in a gain of $176,497.

&#160;

On October 31, 2012, DSC purchased the assets of Message Logic including email compliance software all source code to Message Logic&#8217;s email archival and data analytics software and select fixed assets.
