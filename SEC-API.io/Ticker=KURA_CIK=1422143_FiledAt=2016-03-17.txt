Overview

We are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company discovering and developing personalized therapeutics for the treatment of solid tumors and blood cancers. We focus on the development of small molecule product candidates that target cell signaling pathways that are important to driving the progression of certain cancers. We aim to employ molecular diagnostics to identify patients with cancers who are likely to benefit from our targeted product candidates.

Advancements in cancer genetics and new molecular diagnostic tools are helping define why some patients respond to a particular therapy while other patients receive little to no clinical benefit. This new era in cancer drug discovery and development offers the potential for innovative treatments that are safer and more effective for patients with particular cancers. We aim to improve patient outcomes and contribute to the reduction in healthcare costs by matching targeted therapeutics to the patients who will derive the most benefit. We are developing drugs designed to inhibit the mutated or abnormally functioning cellular pathways that drive cancer growth and intend to pair them with molecular diagnostics to identify those patients with tumors most likely to respond to treatment.

We are developing our lead product candidate, tipifarnib, a farnesyl transferase inhibitor, in both solid tumors and blood cancers based on previously generated clinical data, preclinical data as well as our identification of potential molecular biomarkers. We in-licensed tipifarnib from Janssen Pharmaceutica NV, or Janssen, a foreign entity headquartered in Belgium and an affiliate of Johnson &#38; Johnson, in December 2014. We initiated a Phase 2 clinical trial of tipifarnib in patients who have solid tumors with Harvey rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog, or HRAS, mutations in May 2015, and a Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with peripheral T-cell lymphoma, or PTCL, in September 2015. We plan to initiate a Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with lower risk myelodysplastic syndromes, or MDS, in the second quarter of 2016. Tipifarnib is also currently being evaluated in an investigator sponsored Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with advanced, previously treated urothelial carcinomas that carry HRAS mutations.

Our pipeline also includes two preclinical programs. We are advancing KO-947, a small molecule inhibitor of extracellular-signal-regulated kinase, or ERK, as a potential treatment for patients with tumors that have mutations in or other dysregulation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase, or MAPK, signaling pathway, including pancreatic cancer, colorectal cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC, and melanoma. We anticipate submitting an investigational new drug application, or IND, for KO-947 to the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, in the second quarter of 2016 and commencing a Phase 1 clinical trial in the second half of 2016. We are also developing orally available, small molecule inhibitors of the menin-mixed lineage leukemia, or menin-MLL, fusion protein interaction, which are currently in lead optimization as a potential treatment for patients with acute leukemias involving translocations or partial tandem duplications of the MLL gene. Our goal is to nominate a development candidate for our menin-MLL program in the second half of 2016.

We were originally incorporated in the State of Delaware in November 2007 under the name &#8220;Zeta Acquisition Corp. III,&#8221; or Zeta. Zeta was a &#8220;shell&#8221; company registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, with no specific business plan or purpose. On March 6, 2015 , Zeta and Kura Operations, Inc., or Merger Sub, a wholly owned subsidiary of Zeta, and Kura Oncology, Inc. , a privately held company incorporated in Delaware, or Prior Kura, completed a reverse merger transaction, or the Merger, in which Merger Sub merged with and into Prior Kura with Prior Kur a remaining as the surviving entity and a wholly-owned operating subsidiary of Zeta. Prior Kura was incorporated in the State of Delaware in August 2014 to focus primarily on discovering and developing personalized therapeutics for the treatment of solid tumors and blood cancers. In connection with the Merger, Prior Kura changed its name t o &#8220;Kura Operations, Inc.&#8221; and Zeta changed its name to &#8220; Kura Oncology, Inc.&#8221; In addition, on March 31, 2015, Kura Operations, Inc. merged with and into us and we continued as the surviving entity.

Tipifarnib &#8212;An Oral Farnesyl Transferase Inhibitor

Overview

Tipifarnib is a new chemical entity, or NCE, we in-licensed in December 2014 from Janssen. Tipifarnib is a small molecule inhibitor of protein farnesylation, a key cell signaling process implicated in various cancer processes. Tipifarnib has been studied in more than 5,000 oncology patients and was generally well tolerated with a manageable side effect profile.

Although tipifarnib has a well-established safety profile and has demonstrated compelling and durable anti-cancer activity in certain patients, its activity has not been sufficient in any prior clinical trial to support marketing approval by the FDA. A new drug application, or NDA, was previously submitted to the FDA in January 2005 by a member of the Johnson &#38; Johnson family of companies, for accelerated approval of tipifarnib for elderly patients with newly diagnosed, poor risk acute myeloid leukemia, or AML, who were not candidates for standard chemotherapy. At the FDA Oncology Drugs Advisory Committee meeting to review that NDA, the panel voted against accelerated and conventional approval and the FDA subsequently issued a non-approvable letter. However, clinical and preclinical data suggest that, in certain selected patient populations, tipifarnib has the potential to provide significant benefit to cancer patients with limited treatment options.

&#160;

&#160;

Leveraging advances in next-generation sequencing, or NGS, as well as emerging information about cancer genetics, we will seek to identify patients most likely to benefit from tipifarnib. We initiated a Phase 2 clinical trial in patients who have tumors ch aracterized by HRAS mutations in May 2015 and initiated a second Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with PTCL in September 2015. We also plan to initiate a Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with lower risk MDS in the second quarter of 2016. The preclinica l studies and Phase 1&#8211;3 clinical trials in support of our IND for tipifarnib were conducted by affiliates of Johnson &#38; Johnson and the National Cancer Institute. Efficacy and safety observations included in the IND are from 17 phase 1, 2 and 3 single-agent clinical trials conducted prior to December 31, 2007. Regulatory sponsorship of the Janssen IND for tipifarnib has been transferred to us. 

HRAS Mutant Tumors

Market Opportunity

Retrovirus-associated DNA sequences, or RAS, is a family of membrane-associated proteins that are involved in regulating cell division in response to growth factor stimulation. HRAS is a member of the RAS family, which includes two other proto-oncogenes: Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog, or KRAS, and neuroblastoma RAS viral oncogene homolog, or NRAS. Collectively, the three RAS genes constitute one of the most frequently mutated families of oncogenes in human cancers. Although HRAS mutations are less common overall relative to KRAS and NRAS mutations, they have a relatively high prevalence in cancers of the upper digestive tract, skin, thyroid and urinary bladder. Collectively, cancers that have an HRAS mutation are estimated to have an annual incidence of approximately 8,000 patients in the United States.

HRAS as a Human Oncogene

The HRAS protein is involved in regulating cell division in response to growth factor stimulation. Growth factors act by binding cell surface receptors that span the cell&#8217;s plasma membrane. Once activated, receptors stimulate signal transduction events in the cytoplasm, a process by which proteins and second messengers relay signals from outside the cell to the cell nucleus and instruct the cell to grow or divide. HRAS is localized in the plasma membrane, and is an early player in many signal transduction pathways. HRAS acts as a molecular on/off switch &#8211; once HRAS is turned &#8220;on&#8221; it recruits and activates proteins necessary for the propagation of the receptor&#8217;s signal. In certain tumors, mutations in HRAS or its upstream regulators cause HRAS to be permanently &#8220;on,&#8221; resulting in persistent activation of downstream growth and proliferation signals that drive tumor cell growth. Farnesyl transferase inhibitors, or FTIs, work to prevent the aberrant growth and proliferation of cells that are dependent on these signaling pathways by inhibiting protein farnesylation and subsequent membrane localization of HRAS, thereby switching HRAS &#8220;off.&#8221;

FTIs such as tipifarnib prevent protein farnesylation, a type of protein modification known as prenylation, which along with other protein modifications, allows localization of HRAS to the inner surface of the cell membrane where HRAS can receive and transmit extracellular signals implicated in cancer initiation and development. Tipifarnib has been shown to inhibit HRAS function. Specifically, by blocking HRAS farnesylation and subsequent membrane localization, tipifarnib inhibits oncogenic, HRAS-driven cellular transformation in vitro and in vivo . Earlier studies of FTIs were based on the hypothesis that FTIs would be generally active in RAS driven tumors. However, FTIs showed no significant antitumor activity in patients with advanced solid tumors such as lung, pancreatic and colon cancers, which mainly harbor KRAS mutations, and although the FTIs have demonstrated responses in certain patients with AML, the activity of the compound has not been shown to correlate with NRAS mutations. While KRAS and NRAS similarly utilize protein farnesylation, they can also utilize a related prenylation pathway called geranylgeranylation that also leads to membrane localization and confers resistance to FTIs. We believe the refractory nature of RAS-driven tumors to treatment with FTIs has been attributed to this mechanism of resistance that is available to tumors with KRAS and NRAS mutations but not to those tumors with HRAS mutations. HRAS membrane localization is solely dependent on protein farnesylation, and therefore we believe that tipifarnib has the potential for the treatment of HRAS mutant solid tumors.

Clinical Development in HRAS Mutant Tumors

We initiated a Phase 2 clinical trial in May 2015 to test the hypothesis that tipifarnib can be used as a treatment for advanced tumors with a known HRAS mutation. We designed this clinical trial based on preclinical data which demonstrated that tipifarnib inhibits HRAS mutant cell proliferation and HRAS tumor growth in mouse models. Sponsorship of the IND for tipifarnib previously filed by Janssen has been transferred to us. The clinical trial is expected to enroll 2 cohorts of 18 patients each. Cohort 1 will enroll subjects with malignant thyroid tumors with HRAS mutations, independently of thyroid histology. Any subject with a non-hematological HRAS mutant tumor other than thyroid cancer who meets eligibility criteria may be enrolled in Cohort 2. This clinical trial has a two-stage study design to minimize the number of study subjects treated if tipifarnib is not sufficiently efficacious. If one or no objective response is observed in a cohort after the first 11 evaluable 

&#160;

&#160;

patients, the cohort w ill be closed to further enrollment. If more than one response is observed in the cohort, 7 additional subjects will be enrolled (stage 2). The clinical trial will be considered positive if at least 4 responses are observed in a cohort (out of 18 subjects) . The primary endpoint is objective response rate, and tumor response assessments will be conducted according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 criteria (confirmation of response is required). We anticipate receiving topline d ata from this clinical trial in the second half of 2016. 

Investigator Sponsored Trial in HRAS Mutant Urothelial Carcinoma

In addition to the company sponsored Phase 2 clinical trials, a Phase 2 investigator sponsored clinical trial of tipifarnib for the treatment of advanced, previously treated urothelial carcinomas that carry HRAS mutations, was initiated in November 2015. This clinical trial is sponsored by the Samsung Medical Center and designed to enroll at least 18 patients. The primary endpoint of this clinical trial is objective response rate, and secondary endpoints include progression-free survival, duration of response, and safety.

Companion Diagnostics

Patients are being enrolled in the Phase 2 HRAS mutant tumor clinical trials based on information from the clinical sites on the patients&#8217; tumor HRAS mutation status. Typically, this information is being obtained by the clinical sites from the NGS panels used by the site to characterize patients&#8217; tumors. If the results of our Phase 2 clinical trials are positive, we plan to partner development and validation of a companion diagnostic test to aid in the selection of patients with HRAS mutant tumors in subsequent clinical trials of tipifarnib and to prepare and submit an investigational device exemption, or IDE, for use of the assay in the clinical trial. We expect that the companion diagnostic test will either be a qualitative polymerase chain reaction, or qPCR, -based assay or an NGS-based assay. A qualitative PCR based assay would be technically very similar to the qPCR-based assays already developed and approved by the FDA for KRAS. We expect that regulatory approval of tipifarnib as a treatment for patients with HRAS mutant tumors will require FDA approval of an HRAS assay in the form of a companion diagnostic test that has been validated for accuracy, precision and reproducibility.

Peripheral T-Cell Leukemia

Market Opportunity

Lymphoma is the most common blood cancer. The two main forms of lymphoma are Hodgkin&#8217;s lymphoma, or HL, and Non-Hodgkin&#8217;s lymphoma, or NHL. Lymphoma occurs when cells of the immune system called lymphocytes grow and multiply uncontrollably. Cancerous lymphocytes can travel to many parts of the body, including the lymph nodes, spleen, bone marrow, blood, or other organs, and form tumors. The body has two main types of lymphocytes that can develop into lymphomas: B-cells and T-cells.

PTCL consists of a group of rare and usually aggressive (fast-growing) NHLs that develop from mature T-cells. PTCLs collectively account for about 5 to 10 percent of all NHL cases, corresponding to an annual incidence of approximately 5,000 patients per year in the United States. By some estimates, the incidence of PTCL is growing significantly, and the increasing incidence may be attributable to an aging population.

PTCLs are sub-classified into various subtypes, each of which are typically considered to be separate diseases based on their distinct clinical differences. Most of these subtypes are rare; the three most common subtypes are PTCL not otherwise specified, angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma and anaplastic large-cell lymphoma, or ALCL, that collectively account for approximately 70 percent of all PTCLs in the United States.

Treatment Options for PTCL

For most PTCL subtypes, the frontline treatment regimen is typically combination chemotherapy, such as CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone), EPOCH (etoposide, vincristine, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, prednisone), or other multi-drug regimens.

Patients who relapse or are refractory to frontline treatments are typically treated with gemcitabine in combination with other chemotherapies, including gemcitabine, vinorelbine (Navelbine &#174; ) and doxorubicin (Doxil &#174; ) in a regimen called GND, or other chemotherapy regimens such as DHAP (dexamethasone, cytarabine, cisplatin) or ESHAP (etoposide, methylprednisolone, cytarabine, and cisplatin).

&#160;

&#160;

Because most patients with PTCL will relapse, some oncologists recommend giving high-dose chemotherapy followed by an autologous stem cell transplant to some patients who had a good response to their initial chemotherapy. Recent, non-cytotoxic the rapies that have been approved for relapsed or refractory PTCL, such as pralatrexate (Folotyn &#174; ), romidepsin (Istodax &#174; ) and belinostat (Beleodaq &#174; ), are associated with relatively low objective response rates (25-27% overall response rate, or ORR) and relati vely short durations of response (8.2-9.4 months). Accordingly, we believe the treatment of relapsed/refractory PTCL remains a significant unmet medical need. 

The five year survival for patients with PTCL is low&#8212;roughly 35% by most published records&#8212;and few treatment options are able to provide a durable treatment effect. Treatments in the relapsed or refractory setting are not very effective. Therefore, National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines currently recommend that patients seek participation in a clinical trial for the initial treatment.

Previous Phase 2 Experience with Tipifarnib in the Treatment of PTCL

A prior Phase 2 clinical trial of tipifarnib was sponsored by the National Cancer Institute and conducted at the Mayo Clinic and University of Iowa from 2004 to 2009 in adult patients with relapsed or refractory lymphoma. Ninety-three patients (42 aggressive, 15 indolent, and 36 HL/T-cell lymphoma) were enrolled in the study, and patients received tipifarnib 300 mg twice daily on days 1-21 of each 28-day cycle. The median age of patients was 62 years (range, 18-91 years). A total of 71% of patients had stage IV disease. The median number of prior regimens was five (range, 1-17). The majority of patients were diagnosed with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (40%; 37 of 93) or HL (20%; 19 of 93).

The ORR for all patients was 20.4%. In the HL/T-cell lymphoma cohort, the ORR was 31% with 17% complete responses, or CR, and 14% partial responses, or PR. Of these 36 patients 81% had four or more prior therapies and 67% had undergone hematopoietic stem cell transplant. In this cohort, the median overall survival, or OS, was 19.7 months, median duration of response was 7.5 months, and median time to progression, TTP, was 3.2 months. Five patients received treatment for more than 30 months with several patients receiving treatment for 60+ months.

Tipifarnib was generally well tolerated on this dose and schedule. Three patients with aggressive lymphoma died on study of progressive disease, but there were no deaths related to tipifarnib treatment. Across all patients, the grade 3 or 4 toxicities were primarily reversible myelosuppression, with 11% anemia, 37% neutropenia, and 32% thrombocytopenia.

Of particular relevance to our Phase 2 clinical trial in PTCL are the results observed in the patients with T-cell NHL. Although the clinical trial enrolled only small numbers of patients, a 41% response rate (7 responses out of 17 patients) was observed in patients with T-cell NHL, including 4 objective responses out of 8 patients with PTCL (3 CR and 1 PR). We believe the results observed from this Phase 2 clinical trial suggest that tipifarnib can be administered for prolonged periods and may produce durable responses as a single agent in relapsed lymphoma in a group of patients who were heavily pretreated, including those with PTCL.

Clinical Development in PTCL

Based on the promising results observed in the Phase 2 lymphoma study, we initiated a Phase 2 clinical trial in September 2015 to test the hypothesis that tipifarnib can be used as a treatment for patients with relapsed or refractory PTCL. This clinical trial is being conducted under the IND that was transferred to us from Janssen. The current study protocol has a two-stage design for a total number of 18 eligible patients. If one or no objective response is observed after the first 11 evaluable patients (stage 1), the study will be closed to further enrollment. If more than one response is observed, 7 additional patients will be enrolled (stage 2). The clinical trial will be considered positive if at least 4 responses are observed (out of 18 patients). The primary endpoint is objective response rate, and tumor response assessments will be conducted according to the International Workshop Criteria for the assessment of responses in lymphoma. The study also includes a potential extension to up to a total study enrollment of 30 patients if 5 or more objective responses are observed at the end of stage 1. Potential biomarkers that may contribute to the identification of patients who may benefit from tipifarnib therapy will be investigated in the study. These include genes that are expressed and/or mutated in tumor samples, and blood circulating cytokines. We anticipate receiving topline data from this clinical trial in the second half of 2017.

Myelodysplastic Syndromes 

Market Opportunity

MDS are a group of hematopoietic stem cell malignancies with significant morbidity and mortality. MDS is characterized by ineffective blood cell production, or hematopoiesis, leading to low blood cell counts, or cytopenias, and high risk of progression to AML. MDS is a highly heterogeneous disease, and the severity of symptoms and disease progression can vary widely among patients. The current standard clinical tool to evaluate risk stratification, including survival and risk for AML transformation, and treatment options is the revised International Prognostic Scoring System, or IPSS-R. The IPSS-R differentiates patients into five risk groups (Very Low, Low, Intermediate, High, Very High) based on evaluation of cytogenetics, percentage of blasts (undifferentiated blood cells) in the bone marrow, hemoglobin levels, and platelet and neutrophil counts.

According to the ACS, the annual incidence of MDS is approximately 13,000 patients in the United States, the majority of which are 60 years of age or older. The estimated prevalence is over 60,000 patients in the United States. Approximately 75% of patients fall into the IPSS-R risk categories of Very Low, Low, and Intermediate, collectively known as lower risk MDS, which is our target patient population for our planned Phase 2 MDS clinical trial.

Treatment Options for MDS

Therapeutic options fall into three categories including supportive care, low intensity therapy and high intensity therapy. Supportive care includes the use of red blood cell and platelet transfusions as well as administration of hematopoietic cytokines such as erythropoiesis stimulating agents or colony stimulating factors to improve blood counts. Low intensity therapies include hypomethylating agents such as azacytidine (Vidaza &#174; ) and decitabine (Dacogen &#174; ), biological response modifiers such as lenalidomide (Revlimid &#174; ), and immunosuppressive treatments such as cyclosporine A or antithymocyte globulin. High intensity therapies include chemotherapeutic agents such as idarubicin, cytarabine, fludarabine and topotecan, and HSCT.

National Comprehensive Cancer Network, or NCCN, guidelines recommend that lower risk patients (IPSS-R groups Very Low, Low, Intermediate) receive supportive care or low intensity therapies with the major therapeutic goal of hematologic improvement, or HI. A substantial portion of lower risk MDS patients lack effective therapies, and NCCN guidelines recommend clinical trials as additional therapeutic options. We believe that treatment of MDS remains a significant unmet need requiring the development of novel therapies.

Previous Phase 2 Experience with Tipifarnib in the Treatment of MDS

A prior Phase 2 clinical trial of tipifarnib was sponsored by Johnson &#38; Johnson and conducted at 19 sites in seven countries from 2002 to 2006 in adult patients with intermediate to high risk MDS. This study also included patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. Eighty-two patients with IPSS-R scores of Intermediate-1, Intermediate-2, and High risk MDS were enrolled in the study, and patients received tipifarnib 300 mg twice daily on days 1-21 of each 28-day cycle. The median age of patients was 67 (range 39-86 years). The median time since diagnosis was 8.8 months (range 0-128 months) and 37% (30 of 82) had been received prior therapy.

The ORR for all patients was 31.7% (26 of 82), with 14.6% (12 of 82) CR and 17.1% (14 of 82) HI. In the 12 complete responders, the median response duration was 11.5 months (range 2.0-21.9 months), and the median TTP was 12.4 months (3.9-23.8 months). Median duration of HI was 18 weeks (range 6 to 76 weeks). Median OS was 11.7 months for all patients.

Tipifarnib was generally well tolerated. Ten patients died during the treatment period with five deaths due to progressive disease and five due to an adverse event of which only one was considered drug-related. This death was due to coronary insufficiency triggered by anemia and severe internal bleeding in the context of nonresponsive MDS with persistent Grade 4 thrombocytopenia. Grade 3-4 adverse events were primarily neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and anemia, and were repo rted as possibly drug-related in 15 patients (18%), 26 patients (32%), and 15 patients (18%), respectively. We believe the results of this study suggest that tipifarnib may produce durable responses as a single agent in patients with intermediate to high r isk MDS. 

Clinical Development in MDS

We plan to initiate a Phase 2 clinical trial to investigate the anti-tumor activity of tipifarnib in patients with lower risk MDS in the second quarter of 2016. We have prioritized lower risk MDS because of the prevalence of this disease and our belief that treatment of lower risk MDS remains a significant unmet medical need. We expect that the activity of tipifarnib in lower risk MDS will be no less than the activity observed in the previously investigated intermediate/high risk setting, which is a more aggressive form of the disease. We anticipate that our Phase 2 study in lower risk MDS would aim to enroll approximately 58 patients, and have a primary endpoint of transfusion independence according to the adult Myelodysplastic/Myeloproliferative Neoplasms International Working Group criteria or related response assessment system. We expect this study will be conducted under the IND that was transferred to us from Janssen. We anticipate receiving topline data from this clinical trial in the first half of 2017.

Exploratory Biomarkers

We have identified potential biomarkers that could be predictive of response to tipifarnib in MDS patients. One of these potential biomarkers is the killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor 2DS2, or KIR2DS2, which is commonly expressed on natural killer, or NK, cells and some T-cells and serves to regulate their activity. Autoimmunity is known to play a key role in the onset of lower risk MDS, and KIR2DS2 has been shown to predispose patients to onset of both MDS and autoimmune diseases. KIR2DS2 is present in approximately 60% of MDS patients.

Our interest in KIR2DS2 and other killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors, or KIRs, was triggered by the results of our retrospective analysis of gene expression from bone marrow samples in 34 previously untreated poor-risk and elderly AML patients who were treated with tipifarnib in a prior Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program, or CTEP 20, Phase 2 clinical trial sponsored by the National Cancer Institute. Twenty-five of the patients in CTEP 20 had prior MDS. We observed that expression of several markers, including KIR2DS2, strongly correlated with clinical benefit, including complete response rate, progression free survival, and OS.

We hypothesize that tipifarnib may influence the signaling of KIR2DS2 through its inhibition of protein farnesylation, either of RAS proteins or other farnesylated proteins in the cell. Through this mechanism, we believe that tipifarnib could inhibit aberrant NK cell activity and improve patient outcomes. Because KIR2DS2 and KIR2DS5 are known to predispose to autoimmunity and the onset of MDS, we believe that tipifarnib could attenuate the autoimmune process that causes severe cytopenias in lower risk MDS. This hypothesis will be tested in the planned Phase 2 study in lower risk MDS.

Companion Diagnostics

If the results of our Phase 2 clinical trial in MDS are positive, and KIR2DS2 or other immune cell markers are shown to be predictive of response to tipifarnib, we would expect to partner development and validation of a companion diagnostic test to aid in the selection of patients in subsequent clinical trials of tipifarnib in this patient population. Genetic assays detecting the presence or absence of certain of these genes and markers are already available and used in some instances in bone marrow transplantation. We plan to investigate in our Phase 2 clinical trial whether these genetic assays will be sufficient to define the MDS patients susceptible to receive clinical benefit from tipifarnib or whether a PCR based assay defining biomarker expression levels will need to be developed including identification of the optimal biomarker cut-off criterion for patient selection.

&#160;

&#160;

Registration Strategy for Tipifarnib 

We anticipate that we will have topline data from our Phase 2 clinical trial in HRAS mutant solid tumors in the second half of 2016, Phase 2 clinical trial in lower-risk MDS in the first half of 2017 and Phase 2 clinical trial in PTCL in the second half of 2017. If the data from one or more of these three Phase 2 clinical trials is positive, we would plan to initiate a registrational Phase 3 clinical trial of tipifarnib in at least one disease indication. The use of regulatory pathways such as orphan drug or breakthrough therapy designation will be driven by the specific patient population and data from the Phase 2 clinical trials.

ERK Inhibitor Program

Overview

We are advancing KO-947, a small molecule inhibitor of ERK, as a potential treatment for patients with tumors that have dysregulated activity due to mutations or other mechanisms in the MAPK pathway, including lung cancers, colorectal cancers, pancreatic cancers and melanoma. KO-947 and backup compounds represent new chemical entities we acquired pursuant to an agreement effective December 23, 2014 from an affiliated company, Araxes Pharma LLC, or Araxes, a private biopharmaceutical company.

The high frequency of activating mutations in components of the MAPK pathway found in cancer provides strong rationale for targeting the MAPK pathway and, specifically, ERK. The MAPK pathway is responsible for receiving growth-promoting signals from outside the cell and translating these signals within the cell into programs that affect cell growth and proliferation. When external growth factors activate cell surface receptor tyrosine kinases, the MAPK pathway acts inside the cell to relay these growth signals through a series of signaling molecules, including the RAS, rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma, or RAF, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase, or MEK, and ERK family of kinases. ERK kinase is the final signaling kinase of the MAPK pathway. 

Many cancers harbor genetic mutations in components of the MAPK pathway, especially in protein kinases, that lock transformed cells in a pro-growth state, even in the absence of external growth signals. Studies have shown that such aberrations in the MAPK pathway, including mutations in KRAS, B-Raf proto-oncogene, serine/threonine kinase, or BRAF, and other components of the pathway, are frequent contributors to the development of cancer in humans. Targeted cancer drugs, such as inhibitors of the proteins BRAF and MEK, that have been designed to turn off MAPK signaling by inhibiting specific protein kinases are effective, particularly in melanomas where the MAPK circuit is aberrantly active. We believe that a therapeutic product candidate that can block signaling of the MAPK pathway through inhibition of ERK should reduce or prevent cancer growth and may have a beneficial effect for patients.

As part of our ERK inhibitor program, we are advancing KO-947, which is an orally-available inhibitor of ERK that has nanomolar cellular potency in tumor cells with mutations in BRAF, NRAS or KRAS and induces tumor regressions at tolerable doses in xenograft mouse models. Because KO-947 targets ERK, a protein kinase essential to signaling through the MAPK pathway, it has the potential to selectively kill tumor cells bearing activating mutations in this critical pathway. KO-947 is currently in IND enabling studies. We anticipate filing an IND in the second quarter of 2016 and initiating a Phase 1 clinical trial in the second half of 2016.

Opportunity for Kura Oncology

We have focused on the discovery and development of ERK inhibitors and selected KO-947 as a potential product candidate because we believe that ERK inhibitors have two important potential advantages as therapeutics:

Potential to effectively treat patients with metastatic melanoma who receive &#8220;first-generation&#8221; BRAF or MEK inhibitors, but who develop resistance due to reactivation of ERK pathway signaling. KO-947 could prevent resistance through this mechanism and may thus cause responses of greater duration than the ones seen with first generation inhibitors and extend progression-free survival. 

We acquired our ERK inhibitor program from Araxes based in La Jolla, California. Scientists at Araxes designed our ERK inhibitors using structure-guided drug discovery approaches to model chemical structures that would inhibit the ERK 

&#160;

&#160;

protein kinase but spare inhibition of closely related kinases. These molecules were then synthesized and tested in assays to verify their ability to inhibit ERK as well as to inhibit MAPK pathway signaling. 

Market Overview

Activating mutations in the KRAS gene are commonly found in a wide variety of tumor types. Among cancer indications with large patient populations, KRAS mutations are found in approximately 93 percent of pancreatic cancers, approximately 40 percent of colorectal cancers and approximately 12 percent of NSCLC. According to the ACS in 2016, there are estimated to be over 53,000 cases of pancreatic cancer, 134,000 cases of colorectal cancer and over 190,000 cases of NSCLC diagnosed each year in the United States. We believe this corresponds to approximately 49,000 cases of KRAS mutant pancreatic cancer, 54,000 cases of KRAS mutant colorectal cancer, and 23,000 cases of KRAS mutant NSCLC each year in the United States. These cancers typically present relatively late in their clinical course, when locally directed therapy (surgery and radiation) is not curative. The treatment of locally advanced and metastatic cancers represents a significant unmet medical need.

Specific inhibitors of RAF and MEK kinases have been developed to target BRAF- and RAS-mutant tumors. In particular, the FDA has approved the BRAF inhibitors vemurafenib (ZELBORAF &#174; ) and dabrafenib (TAFINLAR &#174; ) as well as the MEK inhibitors trametinib (MEKINIST &#174; ) and cobimetinib (COTELLIC &#174; ) for the treatment of BRAFV600E-mutant metastatic melanoma. Although these approvals are encouraging, durable responses in patients are limited, as median time to disease progression is approximately 6-7 months and resistance is often associated with pathway reactivation of the ERK signaling pathway.

According to the ACS in 2015, the annual incidence of diagnosed melanoma is 76,000 cases in the United States, of which approximately 16% have metastatic disease, and over 10,000 melanoma deaths occur in the each year in the United States. Mutations that activate the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway are common in melanoma, with BRAF mutations in 40% to 60%, and NRAS mutations in 15-20% of melanoma patients, suggesting the therapeutic potential for agents that target this pathway in metastatic melanoma. As ERK inhibitors target the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway, which is activated with BRAF mutation or NRAS mutation, they may also have the potential for activity not only in patients with BRAF-mutant melanoma, but also in patients with tumors that harbor mutations in the NRAS gene, who currently have no adequate treatment option and poor prognosis.

Preclinical Data for KO-947 

Our development candidate in our ERK inhibitor program, KO-947, demonstrates potent inhibition of the ERK kinase and high selectivity relative to a panel of approximately 400 kinases. KO-947 has also shown promising activity in both cell culture and xenograft animal models of KRAS mutant tumors and BRAF mutated melanoma tumors.

In preclinical studies, xenograft BRAF and KRAS mutant tumors were grown subcutaneously in mice, followed by daily oral treatment with KO-947 or vehicle control. Animals treated with KO-947 showed full tumor regression, while vehicle control treated animals showed rapid tumor growth. In addition, KO-947 was tolerated at dose levels required to achieve tumor regressions with no apparent body weight loss in the mice. KO-947 has also shown promising activity in xenograft animal models of BRAF and KRAS mutant tumors with intermittent dosing regimens. In these models, anti-tumor activity has been shown to be comparable when the compound is administered via multiple dosing schedules including once daily, once every other day, or once weekly. 

Ongoing IND-enabling Studies

Based on preclinical efficacy data in KRAS, NRAS and BRAF mutant tumor models as well as other models of dysregulated signaling of the MAPK pathway, we have advanced KO-947 into IND-enabling studies. The IND-enabling program includes toxicology studies to determine if select doses, schedules and modes of administration are able to achieve required drug exposures to generate tumor regression, which could be tolerable in the clinical setting.

We believe opportunities exist to advance both oral and intravenous, or IV, routes of administration of KO-947 into the clinic, however, we have elected to focus our initial efforts on the IV route. Our initial non-rodent toxicology studies have shown that IV administration may increase exposure and tolerability when compared to oral dosing. Based on our preclinical data we believe that we can maintain efficacy with intermittent IV dosing, which may translate into improved tolerability in the clinical setting. We anticipate filing an IND in the second quarter of 2016 and we intend to evaluate whether KO-947 provides clinical benefit to patients with solid tumors with mutations or other dysregulation of the MAPK pathway.

Menin-MLL Program 

Overview

We are developing orally bioavailable small molecule inhibitors of the menin-MLL interaction for the treatment of MLL-r and MLL-PTD acute leukemias, a genetically defined subtype of the two most common forms of acute leukemia, AML and acute lymphoblastic leukemia, or ALL.

Background on Mixed Lineage Leukemias

MLL-r leukemias are an aggressive subtype of two of the most common forms of acute leukemia, ALL and AML. The estimated five-year OS rate for adult patients with the MLL-r subtype of AML ranges from approximately 5% to 24%. Patients with MLL-r leukemias are routinely diagnosed using existing technologies that are commonly used in clinical settings. As a result, there is high awareness of MLL-r leukemias among oncologists. The disease predominantly occurs in two different demographics&#8212;an adult population and an infant/pediatric population. While they share a common genetic alteration, the adult disease is frequently a secondary leukemia resulting from prior chemotherapy for a different, unrelated cancer, and the childhood disease arises de novo. MLL-r leukemias are caused by a chromosomal translocation involving the MLL gene.

MLL-PTD is a subset of AML. MLL-PTD typically confers a worse prognosis with shortened overall and event free survival in childhood and adult AML.

The annual incidence of MLL-r and MLL-PTD patients is estimated to be 3,200 patients in the United States, and those patients currently have limited options other than chemotherapy or allogeneic stem cell transplant. There are no approved therapies specifically indicated for either the MLL-r or MLL-PTD leukemias. We believe there remains a significant unmet medical need.

Targeting the Menin-MLL Interaction

The MLL gene is a common target of chromosomal translocations found in patients with AML and ALL, which affects both children and adults. Fusion of MLL with one of over 50 different partner genes forms oncogenes encoding MLL fusion proteins, which play a causative role in the onset, development and progression of MLL. Binding of menin, a tumor suppressor protein, to MLL fusion proteins upregulates expression of target genes involved in the malignant transformation of blood cells. In contrast, mutations to MLL fusion proteins that block association with menin abrogate the development of acute leukemia in mice. These findings demonstrate that menin functions as an essential oncogenic co-factor of MLL fusion proteins, and it implies that the menin-MLL interaction represents a valuable target for molecular therapy.

We have licensed from the University of Michigan a class of small molecule inhibitors of the menin-MLL fusion protein interaction that specifically bind to menin with nanomolar potency. By blocking menin-MLL fusion protein interactions, these compounds effectively reverse MLL fusion protein-mediated leukemic transformation by down-regulating the expression of target genes required for MLL-fusion protein oncogenic activity. These compounds also selectively block proliferation and induce both apoptosis and differentiation of leukemia cells harboring MLL translocations.

Opportunity for Kura Oncology

Our menin-MLL development program is aimed at identifying product candidates with the potential to effectively treat patients with MLL-r leukemias&#8212;a subset of adult and pediatric patients who today have no effective therapy&#8212;as well as MLL-PTD leukemias, a subset of AMLs that have no effective therapy.

License and Asset Purchase Agreements

Janssen Pharmaceutica NV

In December 2014, we entered into a license agreement with Janssen, which grants us exclusive global rights to develop and commercialize tipifarnib in the field of oncology and includes the right to grant sublicenses. We are obligated under the license agreement to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize tipifarnib in oncology and, with the exception of the transfer to us without cost of Janssen&#8217;s existing inventory of tipifarnib material, we are responsible for all future development and commercialization costs for tipifarnib in oncology. Under the license agreement, Janssen has a first right to negotiate for an exclusive license back from us to develop and commercialize tipifarnib on terms to be 

&#160;

&#160;

negotiated in good faith. Janssen may exercise this right of first negotiation during the 60-day perio d following completion of a Phase 2 clinical trial of tipifarnib in HRAS mutant patients in oncology and delivery by us to Janssen of a complete data package from such clinical trial. 

Under the terms of the license agreement, in January 2015 we issued a convertible promissory note in the principal amount of $1.0 million to Johnson &#38; Johnson Innovation&#8212;JJDC, Inc., which automatically converted into shares of Prior Kura common stock in our March 2015 private placement. When and if commercial sales of tipifarnib begin, we are obligated to pay Janssen tiered royalties of low double digit percentages of our net sales, depending on the amount of our net sales, with standard provisions for royalty offsets in the event of generic competition or compulsory licenses, on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis until the later of the expiration of the last to expire valid claim of the licensed patents covering the licensed product in the field in such country, the expiration of any regulatory exclusivity with respect to such product in such country, and ten years from our first commercial sale. We are also required to make regulatory milestone payments to Janssen of up to $25 million in the aggregate, if specified regulatory approvals are achieved for the first indication and additional payments for each subsequent indication if specified regulatory approvals are achieved. In addition, we are required to make sales milestone payments of up to $50 million in the aggregate if specified sales thresholds are surpassed. If we grant sublicenses under the license from Janssen, we are required to pay to Janssen a percentage of any upfront, lump-sum or milestone payments received from our sublicensee, subject to certain exclusions for regulatory milestone payments due under the license agreement. 

The license agreement with Janssen will remain in effect until the expiration of all of our royalty and sublicense revenue obligations to Janssen, determined on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, unless we elect to terminate the license agreement earlier. If we fail to meet our obligations under the license agreement and are unable to cure such failure within specified time periods, Janssen can terminate the license agreement, resulting in a loss of our rights to tipifarnib.

Araxes Pharma LLC

In December 2014, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with Araxes, which was amended and restated in February 2015, under which we purchased all of Araxes&#8217; patent rights in the ERK program, including KO-947 and additional backup compounds, and related intellectual property. When and if commercial sales of a product candidate covered by the purchased patent rights begin, we are obligated to pay Araxes tiered royalties of low single digit percentages of our net sales, depending on the amount of our net sales with standard provisions for royalty offsets. We are also required to make development and regulatory milestone payments to Araxes of up to $9.7 million in the aggregate if specified development events and regulatory approvals are achieved. Under the terms of the asset purchase agreement, in December 2014 we issued a convertible promissory note in the principal amount of $0.5 million to Araxes, which automatically converted into shares of Prior Kura common stock in our March 2015 private placement.

Competition

The development and commercialization of new products to treat cancer is intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. Although we believe that our knowledge, experience and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face substantial competition from major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies, and biotechnology companies worldwide. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, and human resources. Smaller and early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. As a result, our competitors may discover, develop, license or commercialize products before or more successfully than we do.

We face competition with respect to our current product candidates, and will face competition with respect to future product candidates, from segments of the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other related markets that pursue approaches to targeting molecular alterations and signaling pathways associated with cancer. Our competitors may obtain regulatory approval of their products more rapidly than we do or may obtain patent protection or other intellectual property rights that limit our ability to develop or commercialize our product candidates. Our competitors may also develop drugs that are more effective, more convenient, less costly, or possessing better safety profiles than our products, and these competitors may be more successful than us in manufacturing and marketing their products.

In addition, we will need to develop our product candidates in collaboration with diagnostic companies, and we will face competition from other companies in establishing these collaborations. Our competitors will also compete with us in 

&#160;

&#160;

recruiting and retaining qualified scientific, management and commercial personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as w ell as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. 

Furthermore, we also face competition more broadly across the market for cost-effective and reimbursable cancer treatments. The most common methods of treating patients with cancer are surgery, radiation and drug therapy, including chemotherapy, hormone therapy and targeted drug therapy or a combination of such methods. There are a variety of available drug therapies marketed for cancer. In many cases, these drugs are administered in combination to enhance efficacy. While our product candidates, if any are approved, may compete with these existing drug and other therapies, to the extent they are ultimately used in combination with or as an adjunct to these therapies, our product candidates may not be competitive with them. Some of these drugs are branded and subject to patent protection, and others are available on a generic basis. Insurers and other third-party payors may also encourage the use of generic products or specific branded products. We expect that if our product candidates are approved, they will be priced at a premium over competitive generic, including branded generic, products. As a result, obtaining market acceptance of, and gaining significant share of the market for, any of our product candidates that we successfully introduce to the market will pose challenges. In addition, many companies are developing new therapeutics, and we cannot predict what the standard of care will be as our product candidates progress through clinical development.

Tipifarnib Competition

While there are currently no approved drugs targeting farnesyltransferase, we are aware of a number of compounds that are now or have previously been in clinical development, including Merck&#8217;s lonafarnib, Bristol-Myers Squibb&#8217;s BMS-214662, Astellas Pharma&#8217;s (formerly OSI) CP-609,754, and AstraZeneca&#8217;s AZD3409. Lonafarnib is currently being investigated in a Phase 1 clinical trial in combination with temozolomide in patients with malignant gliomas. To our knowledge, there are no other ongoing clinical trials evaluating any of these agents for the treatment of cancer. However, the initiation of clinical development of another of these agents in an oncology setting could become competitively significant, and if tipifarnib or our other product candidates do not offer sustainable advantages over competing products, we may not be able to successfully compete against current and future competitors.

Even if we are successful in developing our product candidates, the resulting products would compete with a variety of established drugs in the targeted therapeutic indications of PTCL and MDS. Competitive drugs currently approved for PTCL include belinostat (Beleodaq &#174; ) and pralatrexate (Folotyn &#174; ), marketed by Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, romidepsin (Istodax &#174; ), marketed by Celgene, and brentuximab vedotin (Adcetris &#174; ) (for ALCL), marketed by Seattle Genetics. Competitive drugs currently approved for MDS include azacytidine (Vidaza &#174; ) and lenalidomide (Revlimid &#174; ), marketed by Celgene, and decitabine (Dacogen &#174; ) marketed by Otsuka and Johnson &#38; Johnson. Although there are currently no drugs approved specifically for the treatment of HRAS-mutant solid tumors, there are a number of targeted therapies approved for the treatment of thyroid cancer, including AstraZeneca&#8217;s vandetanib (Caprelsa &#174; ), Bayer&#8217;s sorafenib (Nexavar &#174; ), Exelixis&#8217; cabozantinib (Cometriq &#174; ) and Eisai&#8217;s lenvatinib (Lenvima &#174; ). There are no targeted therapies approved for the treatment of urothelial cancer.

ERK Inhibitor Competition

While there are currently no approved drugs targeting ERK, we are aware of a number of compounds that are in clinical development, including Roche/Genentech&#8217;s RG-7842/GDC-0994, Celgene&#8217;s CC-90003, and BioMed Valley Discoveries&#8217; ulixertinib (BVD-523). Furthermore, it is possible that other companies are also engaged in discovery or preclinical development of compounds targeting ERK. These competitors, if successful in clinical development, may achieve clinical activity, regulatory approval and market adoption in advance of our compounds, constraining the ability of our compounds to gain significant market share. Although we believe that our ERK inhibitors, including KO-947, present several potential advantages relative to these aforementioned candidates, including potency as demonstrated in preclinical studies, these results may not translate to superior therapeutic benefit in clinical trials.

Menin-MLL Inhibitor Competition

There are no drugs approved or in clinical trials targeting the menin-MLL protein-protein interaction. Although there are no targeted therapies approved specifically for the treatment of MLL-r leukemias, there are a number of products in clinical development, including Epizyme&#8217;s EPZ-5676 and Novartis&#8217;s midostaurin, as well as Pfizer&#8217;s palbociclib (IBRANCE &#174; ), which has received accelerated approval in combination with letrozole, for the treatment of postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (ER+/HER2-) advanced breast cancer as initial endocrine-based therapy for their metastatic disease.

&#160;

&#160;

Commercialization 

We have not yet established a sales, marketing or product distribution infrastructure because our lead candidates are still in discovery, preclinical or early clinical development. We anticipate that we will aim to retain commercial rights in North America for any of our product candidates for which we may in the future receive marketing approvals. We may also seek to retain commercial rights in Europe for any of our product candidates for which we may in the future receive marketing approvals. We currently anticipate that, if and when appropriate, we will seek to access the North American or European oncology markets through a focused, specialized, internal sales force.

Subject to receiving marketing approvals, we expect to commence commercialization activities by building a focused internal sales and marketing team in North America to sell our products. We may also build a focused internal sales and marketing team in Europe to sell our products. We believe that such an approach will enable us to address the community of oncologists who are the key specialists in treating the patient populations for which our current product candidates are being developed. Outside of regions where we maintain commercial rights, we may enter into distribution and other marketing arrangements with third parties for any of our product candidates that obtain marketing approval in foreign jurisdictions.

We also aim to build a marketing and sales management force to create and implement marketing strategies for any products that we may in the future market through our own sales teams and to oversee and support our sales force. We anticipate that our goals for any such marketing force include developing educational initiatives with respect to any approved products and establishing relationships with thought leaders in relevant fields of medicine.

We currently expect that any third parties with which we may collaborate in the future on the development of any commercial companion diagnostics for use with our therapeutic products will most likely hold the commercial rights to those diagnostic products. We expect that we would coordinate closely with any future diagnostic collaborators in connection with the marketing and sale of such diagnostic products and our related therapeutic products.

Manufacturing

We do not own or operate, and currently have no plans to establish, any manufacturing facilities. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates for preclinical and clinical testing as well as for commercial manufacture of any products that we may commercialize. Under our license agreement with Janssen, Janssen has provided us with its existing inventory of clinical supply of tipifarnib, which we believe will support our ongoing and planned Phase 2 clinical trials of tipifarnib. Janssen also provided us with its existing inventory of the crude drug substance and bulk key intermediate for manufacture of drug substance for tipifarnib. If needed, we aim to engage, by entering into a supply agreement or through another arrangement, third party manufacturers to provide us with additional tipifarnib clinical supply. For all of our product candidates, we aim to identify and qualify manufacturers to provide the active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, and fill-and-finish services prior to submission of an NDA to the FDA.

We generally expect to rely on third parties for the manufacture of any companion diagnostics we or our collaborators may develop.

Intellectual Property

Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary or intellectual property protection for our product candidates and our core technologies, including novel biomarker and diagnostic discoveries and other know-how, to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary or intellectual property rights. We expect that we will seek to protect our proprietary and intellectual property position by, among other methods, licensing or filing our own U.S., international and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our proprietary and intellectual property position, which we generally seek to protect through contractual obligations with third parties.

We currently, and expect that we will continue to, file or license patent applications directed to our key product candidates in an effort to establish intellectual property positions regarding composition-of-matter of these product candidates, as well as formulations, processes and methods of using these product candidates in the treatment of various cancers. We also intend to seek patent protection, if available, with respect to biomarkers that may be useful in selecting the right patient population for use of any of our product candidates. We own or in-license a patent portfolio consisting of 

&#160;

&#160;

approximately 30 patent families, including issued U.S. patents and their respective counterparts in a number of for eign jurisdictions, pending U.S. patent applications, pending applications under the Patent Cooperation Treaty and corresponding pending patent applications in a number of foreign jurisdictions. In particular, we have exclusively licensed from Janssen a po rtfolio of approximately 20 patent families including composition-of-matter patents that cover tipifarnib as well as method-of-use patents covering tipifarnib for treating various cancers. These composition-of-matter and method-of-use patents are issued in major market countries including the United States, Europe, and Japan, and they are expected to expire in 2016 without patent term extension. We in-license from the University of Michigan or co-own approximately six families of patent applications pertain ing to our menin-MLL program. Other patent applications we own include a composition-of-matter and method-of-use application covering our ERK product candidate. We currently, and expect that we will continue to, file for patents in the United States with c ounterparts in major market countries in Europe and other key markets in the rest of the world. We would expect that any patents that may issue from the pending U.S. patent applications directed to our ERK program and our menin-MLL program would likely sta rt to expire in 2030; however, any and all of these patent applications may not result in issued patents. 

In addition to the patent applications that we have filed to date, we plan to continue to expand our intellectual property portfolio by filing patent applications directed to dosage forms, methods of treatment and additional inhibitor compounds of oncology molecular targets and their derivatives. Specifically, we anticipate that we will seek patent protection in the United States and internationally for novel compositions of matter covering the compounds, the chemistries and processes for manufacturing these compounds, their intermediates and/or metabolites, the use of these compounds in a variety of therapies and the use of biomarkers for patient selection for these compounds. However, these or other patent applications that we may file or license from third parties may not result in the issuance of patents, and any issued patents may cover limited claims that reduce their value and/or may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. See &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.&#8221;

In addition to patents, we also rely upon unpatented trade secrets and know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, using confidentiality agreements with our collaborators, scientific advisors, employees and consultants, and invention assignment agreements with our employees and selected consultants, scientific advisors and collaborators. The confidentiality agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of agreements or clauses requiring invention assignment, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with a third-party.

Orange Book Listing

In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA certain patents whose claims cover the applicant&#8217;s product. Upon approval, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA&#8217;s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Any applicant who files an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, seeking approval of a generic equivalent version of a drug listed in the Orange Book or a Section 505(b)(2) NDA referencing a drug listed in the Orange Book must certify to the FDA that (1) no patent information on the drug product that is the subject of the application has been submitted to the FDA; (2) such patent has expired; (3) the date on which such patent expires; or (4) such patent is invalid or will not be infringed upon by the manufacture, use or sale of the drug product for which the application is submitted. This last certification is known as a paragraph IV certification. A notice of the paragraph IV certification must be provided to each owner of the patent that is the subject of the certification and to the holder of the approved NDA to which the ANDA or Section 505(b)(2) application refers. The applicant may also elect to submit a &#8220;section viii&#8221; statement certifying that its proposed label does not contain (or carves out) any language regarding the patented method-of-use rather than certify to a listed method-of-use patent.

If the NDA holder for the reference drug and/or patent owners assert a patent challenge directed to one of the Orange Book listed patents within 45 days of the receipt of the paragraph IV certification notice, the FDA is prohibited from approving the application until the earlier of 30 months from the receipt of the paragraph IV certification, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the applicant. The ANDA or Section 505(b)(2) application also will not be approved until any applicable non-patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the reference drug has expired as described in further detail below.

Non-Patent Exclusivity

In addition to patent exclusivity, the holder of an NDA for a listed drug may be entitled to a period of non-patent exclusivity, during which the FDA cannot approve an ANDA or Section 505(b)(2) application that relies on the listed drug. 

&#160;

&#160;

For example, a pharmaceutical manufacturer may obtain five years of non-paten t exclusivity upon FDA approval of an NCE , which is a drug that contains an active moiety that has not been approved by the FDA in any other NDA. An &#8220;active moiety&#8221; is defined as the molecule or ion responsible for the drug substance&#8217;s physiological or pha rmacologic action. During the five year exclusivity period, the FDA cannot accept for filing any ANDA seeking approval of a generic version of that drug or any Section 505(b)(2) NDA for the same active moiety and that relies on the FDA&#8217;s findings regarding that drug, except that the FDA may accept an application for filing after four years if the follow-on applicant makes a paragraph IV certification. Five-year NCE exclusivity does not block the submission, review or approval of a 505(b)(1) NDA. 

Patent Term Extension

After NDA approval, owners of relevant drug patents may apply for up to a five-year patent extension. The allowable patent term extension is calculated as half of the drug&#8217;s testing phase&#8212;the time between IND application and NDA submission&#8212;plus all of the review phase&#8212;the time between NDA submission and approval up to a maximum of five years. The time can be shortened if the FDA determines that the applicant did not pursue approval with due diligence. The total patent term, including the extension may not exceed 14 years from the date of NDA approval.

For patents that might expire during the application phase, the patent owner may request an interim patent extension. An interim patent extension increases the patent term by one year and may be renewed up to four times. For each interim patent extension granted, the post-approval patent extension is reduced by one year. The director of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or U.S. PTO, must determine that approval of the drug covered by the patent for which a patent extension is being sought is likely. Interim patent extensions are not available for a drug for which an NDA has not been submitted.

Government Regulation

FDA Approval Process

In the United States, pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by FDA. The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FD&#38;C Act, and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending NDAs, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties and criminal prosecution.

Pharmaceutical product development for a new product or certain changes to an approved product in the United States typically involves preclinical laboratory and animal tests, the submission to FDA of an IND which must become effective before clinical testing may commence, and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the drug for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. Satisfaction of FDA pre-market approval, or PMA, requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product or disease.

Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation and toxicity, as well as animal trials to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including good laboratory practices. The results of preclinical testing are submitted to FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long-term preclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted.

A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If FDA has neither commented on nor questioned the IND within this 30-day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin.

Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted: (i) in compliance with federal regulations; (ii) in compliance with good clinical practice, or GCP, an international standard meant to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators and monitors; as well as (iii) under protocols detailing the objectives of the clinical trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. 

&#160;

&#160;

Each protocol involving testing on U.S. patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to FDA as part of the IND. 

FDA may order the temporary, or permanent, discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. The study protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be submitted to an institutional review board, or IRB, for approval. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB&#8217;s requirements, or may impose other conditions.

Clinical trials to support NDAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. In Phase 1, the initial introduction of the drug into healthy human patients, the drug is tested to assess metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions, side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, early evidence of effectiveness. Phase 2 usually involves clinical trials in a limited patient population to determine the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication, dosage tolerance and optimum dosage, and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks. If a compound demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 clinical trials are undertaken to obtain the additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the drug. In most cases FDA requires two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug. A single Phase 3 clinical trial with other confirmatory evidence may be sufficient in rare instances where the study is a large multicenter clinical trial demonstrating internal consistency and a statistically very persuasive finding of a clinically meaningful effect on mortality, irreversible morbidity or prevention of a disease with a potentially serious outcome and confirmation of the result in a second clinical trial would be practically or ethically impossible.

After completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA is prepared and submitted to FDA. FDA approval of the NDA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the United States. The NDA must include the results of all preclinical, clinical and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product&#8217;s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture and controls. The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA is substantial, and the fees are typically increased annually.

FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency&#8217;s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is accepted for filing, FDA begins an in-depth review. FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of NDAs to encourage timeliness. Most applications for standard review drug products are reviewed within twelve months from submission; most applications for priority review drugs are reviewed within eight months from submission. Priority review can be applied to drugs that FDA determines offer major advances in treatment, or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. The review process for both standard and priority review may be extended by FDA for three additional months to consider certain late-submitted information, or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission.

FDA may also refer applications for novel drug products, or drug products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an outside advisory committee&#8212;typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts&#8212;for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations.

Before approving an NDA, FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. Additionally, FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured. FDA will not approve the product unless compliance with current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP&#8212;a quality system regulating manufacturing&#8212;is satisfactory and the NDA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the drug is safe and effective in the indication studied.

After FDA evaluates the NDA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing, or information, in order for FDA to reconsider the application. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to FDA&#8217;s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, FDA will issue an approval letter. FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included.

&#160;

&#160;

An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing in formation for specific indications. As a condition of NDA approval, FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, to help ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communica tion plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use, or ETASU. ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring and the use of patient registries. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the drug. Moreover, product approval may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug&#8217;s safety o r efficacy. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing. 

Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement before the change can be implemented. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs.

Fast Track Designation and Accelerated Approval

FDA is required to facilitate the development, and expedite the review, of drugs that are intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition for which there is no effective treatment and which demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Under the Fast Track program, the sponsor of a new product candidate may request that FDA designate the product candidate for a specific indication as a Fast Track drug concurrent with, or after, the filing of the IND for the product candidate. FDA must determine if the product candidate qualifies for Fast Track Designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor&#8217;s request.

Under the Fast Track program and FDA&#8217;s accelerated approval regulations, FDA may approve a drug for a serious or life-threatening illness that provides meaningful therapeutic benefit to patients over existing treatments based upon a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments.

In clinical trials, a surrogate endpoint is a measurement of laboratory or clinical signs of a disease or condition that substitutes for a direct measurement of how a patient feels, functions, or survives. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. A product candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, will allow FDA to withdraw the drug from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for product candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to priority review by FDA.

If a submission is granted Fast Track Designation, the sponsor may engage in more frequent interactions with FDA, and FDA may review sections of the NDA before the application is complete. This rolling review is available if the applicant provides, and FDA approves, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the applicant pays applicable user fees. However, FDA&#8217;s time period goal for reviewing an application does not begin until the last section of the NDA is submitted. Additionally, Fast Track Designation may be withdrawn by FDA if FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process.

Breakthrough Therapy Designation

FDA is also required to expedite the development and review of the application for approval of drugs that are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition where preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. Under the Breakthrough Therapy program, the sponsor of a new product candidate may request that FDA designate the product candidate for a specific indication as a breakthrough therapy concurrent with, or after, the filing of the IND for the product candidate. FDA must determine if the product candidate qualifies for Breakthrough Therapy designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor&#8217;s request.

&#160;

&#160;

Orphan Drug Designation and Ex clusivity 

The Orphan Drug Act provides incentives for the development of products intended to treat rare diseases or conditions. Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. If a sponsor demonstrates that a drug is intended to treat a rare disease or condition, the FDA will grant orphan designation for that product for the orphan disease indication, assuming that the same drug has not already been approved for the indication for which the sponsor is seeking orphan designation. If the same drug has already been approved for the indication for which the sponsor is seeking orphan designation, the sponsor must present a plausible hypothesis of clinical superiority in order to obtain orphan designation. Orphan designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan designation, the FDA discloses the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use.

Orphan designation may provide manufacturers with benefits such as research grants, tax credits, Prescription Drug User Fee Act application fee waivers, and eligibility for orphan drug exclusivity. If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval of the active moiety for that disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which for seven years prohibits the FDA from approving another product with the same active ingredient for the same indication, except in limited circumstances. Orphan drug exclusivity will not bar approval of another product under certain circumstances, including if a subsequent product with the same active ingredient for the same indication is shown to be clinically superior to the approved product on the basis of greater efficacy or safety, or providing a major contribution to patient care, or if the company with orphan drug exclusivity is not able to meet market demand. Further, the FDA may approve more than one product for the same orphan indication or disease as long as the products contain different active ingredients. Moreover, competitors may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan drug has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan drug has exclusivity.

In the European Union, orphan drug designation also entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and 10 years of market exclusivity is granted following drug or biological product approval. This period may be reduced to 6 years if the orphan drug designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity.

Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an application for marketing approval. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.

Post-Approval Requirements

Once an NDA is approved, a product will be subject to certain post-approval requirements. For instance, FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. Drugs may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling.

Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports are required following FDA approval of an NDA. FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, REMS, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product, or FDA may place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality control, drug manufacture, packaging and labeling procedures must continue to conform to cGMPs after approval. Drug manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with FDA and certain state agencies. Registration with FDA subjects entities to periodic unannounced inspections by FDA, during which the Agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the areas of production and quality-control to maintain compliance with cGMPs. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals or request product recalls if a company fails to comply with regulatory standards, if it encounters problems following initial marketing, or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered.

&#160;

&#160;

Pediatric Information 

Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, NDAs or supplements to NDAs must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug is safe and effective. FDA may grant full or partial waivers, or deferrals, for submission of data. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any drug for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted.

The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, or BPCA, provides NDA holders a six-month extension of any exclusivity&#8212;patent or non-patent&#8212;for a drug if certain conditions are met. Conditions for exclusivity include FDA&#8217;s determination that information relating to the use of a new drug in the pediatric population may produce health benefits in that population, FDA making a written request for pediatric studies, and the applicant agreeing to perform, and reporting on, the requested studies within the statutory timeframe. Applications under the BPCA are treated as priority applications, with all of the benefits that designation confers.

FDA Regulation of Companion Diagnostics

Our drug products may rely upon in vitro companion diagnostics for use in selecting the patients that we believe will respond to our cancer therapeutics. If safe and effective use of a therapeutic product depends on an in vitro diagnostic, or IVD, FDA generally will require approval or clearance of the diagnostic at the same time that FDA approves the therapeutic product. This policy is described in an August 2014 FDA guidance document.

FDA has required in vitro companion diagnostics intended to select the patients who will respond to cancer treatment to obtain a PMA for that diagnostic simultaneously with approval of the drug. We believe that FDA will require PMA approval of one or more in vitro companion diagnostics to identify patient populations suitable for our cancer therapies. The review of these in vitro companion diagnostics in conjunction with the review of our cancer treatments involves coordination of review by FDA&#8217;s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research and by FDA&#8217;s Center for Devices and Radiological Health.

The PMA process, including the gathering of clinical and nonclinical data and the submission to and review by FDA, can take several years or longer. It involves a rigorous premarket review during which the applicant must prepare and provide FDA with reasonable assurance of the device&#8217;s safety and effectiveness and information about the device and its components regarding, among other things, device design, manufacturing and labeling. PMA applications are subject to an application fee. In addition, PMAs for certain devices must generally include the results from extensive preclinical and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the device for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. In particular, for a diagnostic, the applicant must demonstrate that the diagnostic produces reproducible results when the same sample is tested multiple times by multiple users at multiple laboratories. As part of the PMA review, FDA will typically inspect the manufacturer&#8217;s facilities for compliance with the Quality System Regulation, or QSR, which imposes elaborate testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance requirements.

PMA approval is not guaranteed, and FDA may ultimately respond to a PMA submission with a not approvable determination based on deficiencies in the application and require additional clinical trial or other data that may be expensive and time-consuming to generate and that can substantially delay approval. If FDA&#8217;s evaluation of the PMA application is favorable, FDA typically issues an approvable letter requiring the applicant&#8217;s agreement to specific conditions, such as changes in labeling, or specific additional information, such as submission of final labeling, in order to secure final approval of the PMA. If FDA concludes that the applicable criteria have been met, FDA will issue a PMA for the approved indications, which can be more limited than those originally sought by the applicant. The PMA can include post-approval conditions that FDA believes necessary to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution.

After a device is placed on the market, it remains subject to significant regulatory requirements. Medical devices may be marketed only for the uses and indications for which they are cleared or approved. Device manufacturers must also establish registration and device listings with FDA. A medical device manufacturer&#8217;s manufacturing processes and those of its suppliers are required to comply with the applicable portions of the QSR, which cover the methods and documentation of the design, testing, production, processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging and shipping of medical devices. Domestic facility records and manufacturing processes are subject to periodic unscheduled inspections by FDA. FDA also may inspect foreign facilities that export products to the United States.

&#160;

&#160;

Failure to comply with applicable re gulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by FDA, which may include any of the following sanctions: warning letters, fines, injunctions, civil or criminal penalties, recall or seizure of current or future products, operating restrictions, part ial suspension or total shutdown of production, denial of submissions for new products, or withdrawal of PMA approvals. 

Clinical Trials and IDEs

A clinical trial is almost always required to support a PMA application. In some cases, one or more smaller IDE studies may precede a pivotal clinical trial intended to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the investigational device.

All clinical studies of investigational devices must be conducted in compliance with the FDA&#8217;s requirements. If an investigational device could pose a significant risk to patients pursuant to FDA regulations, the FDA must approve an IDE application prior to initiation of investigational use. IVD trials usually do not require an IDE, as the FDA does not judge them to be a significant risk because the results do not affect the patients in the study. However, for a clinical trial where the IVD result directs the therapeutic care of patients with cancer, we believe that the FDA may consider the investigation to present significant risk and require an IDE application.

An IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as laboratory test results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The FDA typically grants IDE approval for a specified number of patients. A non-significant risk device does not require FDA approval of an IDE. Both significant risk and non-significant risk investigational devices require approval from IRBs at the study centers where the device will be used.

During the critical trial, the sponsor must comply with the FDA&#8217;s IDE requirements for investigator selection, clinical trial monitoring, reporting and record keeping. The investigators must obtain patient informed consent, rigorously follow the investigational plan and study protocol, control the disposition of investigational devices and comply with all reporting and record keeping requirements. Prior to granting PMA approval, the FDA typically inspects the records relating to the conduct of the study and the clinical data supporting the PMA application for compliance with applicable requirements.

Although the QSR does not fully apply to investigational devices, the requirement for controls on design and development does apply. The sponsor also must manufacture the investigational device in conformity with the quality controls described in the IDE application and any conditions of IDE approval that the FDA may impose with respect to manufacturing.

Foreign Regulation

In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our product candidates to the extent we choose to sell any products outside of the United States. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval of a product by regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country. As in the United States, post-approval regulatory requirements, such as those regarding product manufacture, marketing, or distribution would apply to any product that is approved outside the United States.

Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, including any manufacturing changes, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, post-approval monitoring and reporting, import and export of pharmaceutical products, such as those we are developing.

Additional Regulations and Environmental Matters

In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, we are subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. These laws, which generally will not be applicable to us or our product candidates unless and until we obtain FDA marketing approval for any of our product candidates, include transparency laws, anti-kickback statutes, false claims statutes and regulation regarding providing drug samples, among others.

&#160;

&#160;

The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, amo ng other things, individuals and entities from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or s ervice reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federally financed healthcare programs. Violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute are punishable by imprisonment, criminal fines, civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in feder al healthcare programs. 

Federal false claims laws and civil monetary penalties, including the False Claims Act, prohibit, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to have a false claim paid. Recently, several pharmaceutical companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly inflating drug prices they report to pricing services, which in turn were used by the government to set Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates, and for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. In addition, certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion, may also violate false claims laws.

The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, imposes criminal and civil liability for, among other things, executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters.

HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or the HITECH Act, and its implementing regulations, also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information used and disclosed by covered entities and their business associates. Many states and foreign jurisdictions also have laws and regulations that govern the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information, and such laws often vary from one another and from HIPAA.

The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children&#8217;s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to report annually to the Centers for Medicare &#38; Medicaid Services, or CMS, information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals, and certain manufacturers and group purchasing organizations to report annually ownership and investment interests held by the physicians and their immediate family members.

The majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Law and false claims laws, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. Our activities may also be certain state laws regarding the privacy and security of health information that may not be preempted by HIPAA, as well as additional tracking and reporting obligations regarding payments to healthcare providers and marketing expenditures.

In addition to regulatory schemes that apply, or may in the future apply, to our business, we are or may become subject to various environmental, health and safety laws and regulations governing, among other things, laboratory procedures and any use and disposal by us of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances in connection with our research and development activities. We do not presently expect such environmental, health and safety laws or regulations to materially impact our present or planned future activities.

Coverage and Reimbursement

Sales of any of our product candidates that may be approved will depend, in part, on the extent to which the cost of the product will be covered by third party payors. Third party payors may limit coverage to an approved list of products, or formulary, which might not include all drug products approved by the FDA for an indication. A payor&#8217;s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor&#8217;s determination to provide coverage for a drug product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the drug product. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.

Any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective by third party payors, and we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in the future to demonstrate the medical necessity and/or cost effectiveness of any such product. Nonetheless, our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost effective. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments 

&#160;

&#160;

have shown increased interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit government-paid health care costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and require ments for substitution of generic products. Continued interest in and adoption of such controls and measures, and tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit payments for pharmaceuticals such as the product candidates we are developing. 

Health Reform

The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives. By way of example, in March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively the ACA, was signed into law, which intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add transparency requirements for the healthcare and health insurance industries, impose taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms. With regard to pharmaceutical products, among other things, the ACA expanded and increased industry rebates for drugs covered under Medicaid programs and made changes to the coverage requirements under the Medicare prescription drug benefit. Since its enactment there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the ACA in the future. We continue to evaluate the effect that the ACA has on our business.

In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. These changes included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year effective April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will stay in effect through 2025 unless additional Congressional action is taken. In January 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These new laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which could have a material adverse effect on customers for our drugs, if approved, and, accordingly, our financial operations. R ecently there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products. For example, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. 

In the coming years, additional legislative and regulatory changes could be made to governmental health programs that could significantly impact pharmaceutical companies and the success of our product candidates.
