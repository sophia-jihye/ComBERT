 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

Unless otherwise specified, references to "United Natural Foods," "UNFI," "we," "us," "our" or "the Company" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K ("Annual Report" or "Report") mean United Natural Foods, Inc. and all entities included in our consolidated financial statements. See the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Report for information regarding our financial performance. 

Overview 

We believe we are a leading distributor based on sales of natural, organic and specialty foods and non-food products in the United States and Canada, and that our thirty-three &#32;distribution centers, representing approximately 8.7 million &#32;square feet of warehouse space, provide us with the largest capacity of any North American-based distributor principally focused on the natural, organic and specialty products industry. We offer more than 100,000 &#32;high-quality natural, organic and specialty foods and non-food products, consisting of national, regional and private label brands grouped into six product categories: grocery and general merchandise, produce, perishables and frozen foods, nutritional supplements and sports nutrition, bulk and foodservice products and personal care items. We serve more than 43,000 &#32;customer locations primarily located across the United States and Canada which can be classified as follows: 

&#8226; 

independently owned natural products retailers, which include single store and chain accounts (excluding Supernatural), which carry more than 90% natural products and buying clubs of consumer groups joined to buy products; 

&#8226; 

supernatural chains, which consist of chain accounts that are national in scope and carry greater than 90% natural products, and at this time currently consists solely of Whole Foods Market, Inc. ("Whole Foods Market"); 

&#8226; 

supermarkets, which include accounts that also carry conventional products, and at this time currently include chain accounts, supermarket independents, and gourmet and ethnic specialty stores; and 

&#8226; 

other, which includes foodservice, e-commerce and international customers outside of Canada. 

We were the first organic food distribution network in the United States designated as a "Certified Organic Distributor" by Quality Assurance International, Inc. ("QAI"), an organic certifying agency accredited by the United States Department of Agriculture ("USDA"). This process involved a comprehensive review by QAI of our operating and purchasing systems and procedures. This certification covers all of our broadline distribution centers in the United States, except for facilities acquired in connection with the acquisitions of Tony's Fine Foods ("Tony's"), Haddon House Food Products Inc. ("Haddon"), Nor-Cal Produce, Inc. ("Nor-Cal") and Gourmet Guru Inc. ("Gourmet Guru"). Although not designated as a "Certified Organic Distributor" by QAI, the three Tony's California locations are certified as Organic by the State of California Department of Public Health Food and Drug Branch, and Nor-Cal is currently registered with the California Department of Food and Agriculture Organic Program as an organic handler. In addition, our Canadian distribution centers in British Columbia, Ontario and Quebec all hold one of the following organic distributor certifications: QAI, EcoCert Canada or ProCert Canada. Our distribution center located in Ontario also offers a large selection of Kosher certified, non-organic products. 

Since the formation of our predecessor in 1976, we have grown our business both organically and through acquisitions which have expanded our distribution network, product selection and customer base. Since fiscal 2006 , our net sales have increased at a compounded annual growth rate of 13.3% . In recent years, our sales to existing and new customers have increased through the continued growth of the natural and organic products industry in general; increased market share through our high-quality service and broader product selection, including specialty products, the acquisition of, or merger with, natural, organic, conventional produce and specialty product distributors; our efforts to increase the number of conventional supermarket customers to whom we distribute products; the expansion of our existing distribution centers; the construction of new distribution centers; the introduction of new products and the development of our own line of natural and organic branded products. Through these efforts, we believe that we have broadened our geographic penetration, expanded our customer base, enhanced and diversified our product selection and increased our market share. 

We have been the primary distributor to Whole Foods Market for more than eighteen &#32;years. Under the terms of our agreement with Whole Foods Market, we serve as the primary distributor to Whole Foods Market in all of its regions in the United States. Our agreement with Whole Foods Market expires on September 28, 2025. 

In July 2014, we completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding capital stock of Tony's, through our wholly-owned subsidiary UNFI West, Inc. ("UNFI West"), for consideration of approximately $202.7 million . With the completion of the transaction, Tony's became a wholly-owned subsidiary and continues to operate as Tony's Fine Foods. Founded in 1934 by the Ingoglia family, Tony's is headquartered in West Sacramento, California and is a leading distributor of perishable food products, including a wide array of specialty protein, cheese, deli, food service and bakery goods to retail and specialty grocers, food service customers and other distribution companies principally located throughout the Western United States, as well as Alaska and Hawaii. We believe that the acquisition of Tony's accomplished certain of our strategic objectives as Tony's has provided us with a platform 

for expanding both our high-growth perishable product offerings and our distribution footprint in the Western Region of the United States. 

During fiscal 2015, we began shipping customers both center of the store products and an enhanced selection of fresh, perishable products. Our customers utilized both UNFI&#8217;s broadline and Tony's offerings, including grocery, refrigerated, protein, specialty cheese and prepared foods. Our customers&#8217; broad utilization supports our belief that there is significant value in UNFI's position as a leading provider of logistics, distribution and category management for both center store and perimeter products. Additionally, we believe that gourmet and ethnic products and fresh foods represent significant incremental growth opportunities for UNFI and as a result we acquired Haddon, a leading distributor of gourmet and ethnic products in the Eastern United States in May 2016. 

In March 2016, the Company acquired certain assets of Global Organic/Specialty Source, Inc. and related affiliates (collectively "Global Organic") through our wholly owned subsidiary Albert's Organics, Inc. ("Albert's"), for consideration of approximately $20.6 million in cash. Global Organic is a premier distributor of organic fruits, vegetables, juices, milk, eggs, nuts, and coffee located in Sarasota, Florida serving customer locations across the Southeastern United States. Global Organic's operations have been combined with the existing Albert's business in the Southeast and operate as Albert's. 

In March 2016, the Company acquired all of the outstanding stock of Nor-Cal and an affiliated entity as well as certain real estate, for approximately $68.6 million in cash, subject to certain customary post-closing adjustments. With the completion of the transaction, Nor-Cal became a wholly-owned subsidiary and continues to operate as Nor-Cal Produce, Inc. Founded in 1972, Nor-Cal is a distributor of conventional and organic produce and other fresh products primarily to independent retailers in Northern California, with primary operations located in West Sacramento, California. We believe that our acquisition of Nor-Cal will aid in our efforts to expand our fresh offering, particularly within the conventional produce segment. 

In May 2016, the Company completed its acquisition of all of the outstanding equity interests of Haddon and certain affiliates in a cash transaction for approximately $219.1 million, subject to certain customary post-closing adjustments. With the completion of the transaction, Haddon became a wholly-owned subsidiary of UNFI and continues to operate as Haddon House Food Products, Inc. Founded in 1960, Haddon is a well-respected distributor and merchandiser of natural and organic and gourmet ethnic products throughout the Eastern United States. Haddon has a history of providing quality high touch merchandising services to their customers. Haddon has a diverse, multi-channel customer base including conventional supermarkets, gourmet food stores and independently owned product retailers. We believe that our acquisition of Haddon will expand the product and service offering that we expect to play an important role in our ongoing strategy to build out our gourmet and ethnic product categories. 

In August 2016, the Company acquired all of the outstanding stock of Gourmet Guru in cash. Founded in 1996 and headquartered in Bronx, New York, Gourmet Guru is a distributor and merchandiser of fresh and organic food focusing on new and emerging brands. We believe that our acquisition of Gourmet Guru enhances our strength in finding and cultivating emerging fresh and organic brands and further expands our presence in key urban markets. 

Our ability to distribute specialty food items (including ethnic, kosher and gourmet products) has accelerated our expansion into a number of high-growth business markets and allowed us to establish immediate market share in the fast-growing specialty foods market. We have now integrated specialty food products and natural and organic specialty non-food items into all of our broadline distribution centers across the United States and Canada. Due to our expansion into specialty foods, over the past several fiscal years we have been awarded new business with a number of conventional supermarkets. We believe our acquisition of Haddon will expand our capabilities in the specialty category and we expect to expand our offerings of specialty products to include those products distributed by Haddon that we did not previously distribute to our customers. We believe that the distribution of these products enhances our conventional supermarket business channel and that our complementary product lines continue to present opportunities for cross-selling. 

We are a Delaware corporation based in Providence, Rhode Island, and we conduct business through our various wholly owned subsidiaries. We operated thirty-three &#32;distribution centers at our 2016 &#32;fiscal year end, and we believe that our approximately 8.7 million &#32;square feet of distribution space provide us with the largest capacity of any distributor that primarily distributes natural, organic and specialty products in the United States or Canada. 

We operate thirteen &#32;natural products retail stores within the United States, located primarily in Florida (with two locations in Maryland and one in Massachusetts), through our subsidiary doing business as Earth Origins Market ("Earth Origins"). In the first quarter of fiscal 2017, the Company closed two of these store locations that had been underperforming. We believe that our retail business serves as a natural complement to our distribution business because it enables us to develop new marketing programs and improve customer service. In addition, our subsidiary doing business as Woodstock Farms Manufacturing specializes in importing, roasting, packaging and the distribution of nuts, dried fruit, seeds, trail mixes, granola, natural and organic snack items and confections for our customers and in branded products of our own. 

Our Industry 

The natural products industry encompasses a wide range of products including organic and non-organic foods, nutritional, herbal and sports supplements, toiletries and personal care items, naturally-based cosmetics, natural/homeopathic medicines, pet products and cleaning agents. According to The Natural Foods Merchandiser , a leading natural products industry trade publication, sales for all types of natural products were $131.2 billion &#32;in calendar 2015 , a growth of $10.8 billion &#32;or approximately 9.0% &#32;from calendar 2014 . According to The Specialty Food Association , a leading specialty food industry trade publication, sales in calendar 2015 &#32;were $120.5 billion , representing growth of 21.3% &#32;from calendar 2013 . We believe the growth of the natural and specialty products industries is a result of the increasing demand by consumers for a healthy lifestyle, food safety and environmental sustainability. 

Our Operating Structure 

Our operations are comprised of three principal operating divisions. These operating divisions are: 

&#8226; 

our wholesale division, which includes: 

&#9702; 

our broadline natural, organic and specialty distribution business in the United States; 

&#9702; 

UNFI Canada, Inc. ("UNFI Canada"), which is our natural, organic and specialty distribution business in Canada; 

&#9702; 

Tony's, which is a leading distributor of a wide array of specialty protein, cheese, deli, food service and bakery goods, principally throughout the Western United States; 

&#9702; 

Albert's, which is a leading distributor of organically grown produce and non-produce perishable items within the United States; 

&#9702; 

Nor-Cal, a distributor of organic and conventional produce and non-produce perishable items in Northern California; 

&#9702; 

Haddon, a distributor and merchandiser of natural and organic specialty and gourmet ethnic products throughout the Eastern United States; and 

&#9702; 

Select Nutrition, which distributes vitamins, minerals and supplements; 

&#8226; 

our retail division, consisting of Earth Origins, which operates our thirteen &#32;natural products retail stores within the United States; and 

&#8226; 

our manufacturing and branded products divisions, consisting of 

&#9702; 

Woodstock Farms Manufacturing, which specializes in importing, roasting, packaging and the distribution of nuts, dried fruit, seeds, trail mixes, granola, natural and organic snack items and confections; and 

&#9702; 

our Blue Marble Brands branded product lines. 

Wholesale Division 

Our broadline distribution business is organized into three regions&#8212;our Eastern Region, Western Region and our Canadian Region. We distribute natural, organic and specialty products in all of our product categories to customers in the Eastern and Midwestern portions of the United States through our Eastern Region and to customers in the Western and Central portions of the United States through our Western Region. Our Canadian Region distributes natural, organic and specialty products in all of our product categories to all of our customers in Canada. As of our 2016 &#32;fiscal year end, our Eastern Region operated ten &#32;distribution centers, which provided approximately 3.6 million &#32;square feet of warehouse space, our Western Region operated seven &#32;distribution centers, which provided approximately 2.9 million &#32;square feet of warehouse space and our Canadian Region operated four &#32;distribution centers, which provided approximately 0.3 million &#32;square feet of warehouse space. 

Through Tony's, we distribute perishable food products, including a wide array of specialty protein, cheese, deli, food service and bakery goods. Tony's operates out of four &#32;distribution centers strategically located on the West coast in California and Washington, providing approximately 0.5 million &#32;square feet of warehouse space. The three California locations are certified as Organic by the State of California Department of Public Health-Food and Drug Branch. In addition to the four Tony's facilities, the Company has begun to distribute Tony's perishable products in other broadline distribution centers, including our Aurora, Colorado facility. 

Through Albert's, we distribute organically grown produce and non-produce perishables, such as organic milk, dressings, eggs, juices, poultry and various other refrigerated specialty items. Albert's operates out of four &#32;distribution centers strategically located throughout the United States, providing approximately 0.3 &#32;million square feet of warehouse space, and is designated as a "Certified Organic Distributor" by QAI. 

Through Nor-Cal, we distribute conventional and organic produce and other fresh products principally in Northern California. Nor-Cal operates out of a distribution center in West Sacramento, California, providing approximately 80,000 &#32;square feet of warehouse space. 

Through Haddon, we distribute natural and organic and gourmet ethnic products throughout the Eastern United States. Haddon operates out of two &#32;distribution centers, strategically located in Howell Township, New Jersey and Richburg, South Carolina, providing approximately 0.7 million &#32;square feet of warehouse space. We are in the process of integrating Haddon's operations with ours and anticipate the Haddon distribution centers will become part of our broadline network in the Eastern Region. This will allow for Haddon products to be rolled out to our other broadline distribution centers. 

Through Select Nutrition, we distribute more than 14,000 &#32;health and beauty aids, vitamins, minerals and supplements from distribution centers in Pennsylvania and California. 

Certain of our distribution centers are shared by multiple operations within our wholesale division. 

In August 2016, we launched a new initiative to organize our sales structure in the United States. We believe this initiative will bring our teams closer to retail operators and will contribute to us providing an exemplary customer experience. This new structure is regional with a Pacific, Central, and Atlantic region. Each region will have a president responsible for all our products and services within the territory, including fresh, grocery, wellness, e-commerce, food services, and ethnic gourmet. Territory managers in these regions will now sell across our complete lines of products. This change brings us to our customer more frequently with all of our service offerings and we anticipate identifying and taking advantage of sales opportunities from our customers having a single point of contact for all of our products and services. 

Retail Division 

We operate thirteen &#32;natural products retail stores as Earth Origins within the United States, ten &#32;of which are located in Florida, two &#32;in Maryland and one &#32;in Massachusetts. In the first quarter of fiscal 2017, the Company closed two of these store locations that had been underperforming. We believe that our retail business serves as a natural complement to our distribution business because it enables us to see market trends, develop new marketing programs and receive direct customer feedback. 

We believe our natural products retail stores have a number of advantages over their competitors, including our financial strength and marketing expertise, the purchasing power resulting from group purchasing by stores within Earth Origins and the breadth of our product selection. 

We believe that we benefit from certain advantages in acting as a distributor to our natural products retail stores, including our ability to: 

&#8226; 

control the purchases made by these stores; 

&#8226; 

expand the number of high-growth, high-margin product categories, such as produce and prepared foods, within these stores; and 

&#8226; 

stay abreast of the trends in the retail marketplace, which enables us to better anticipate and serve the needs of our wholesale customers. 

Additionally, as the primary natural products distributor to our retail locations, we realize significant economies of scale and operating and buying efficiencies. As an operator of natural products retail stores, we also have the ability to test market select products prior to offering them nationally. We can then evaluate consumer reaction to the product without incurring significant inventory risk. We also are able to test new marketing and promotional programs within our stores prior to offering them to our wholesale customer base. 

Manufacturing and Branded Products Divisions 

Our subsidiary, Woodstock Farms Manufacturing, specializes in importing, roasting, packaging and the distribution of nuts, dried fruit, seeds, trail mixes, granola, natural and organic snack items and confections. We sell these items in bulk and through private label packaging arrangements with large health food, supermarket and convenience store chains and independent owners. We operate an organic (USDA and QAI) and kosher (Circle K) certified packaging, roasting, and processing facility in New Jersey that is SQF (Safety Quality Food) level 2 certified. 

Our Blue Marble Brands portfolio is a collection of 15 &#32;organic, natural and specialty food brands representing more than 650 &#32;unique products. We have a dedicated team of marketing, supply chain and sales professionals that have a passion to energize our retail partners and provide consumers with affordable Non-GMO foods. Our unique Blue Marble Brands products are sold through our wholesale division, third-party distributors and directly to retailers. Our Field Day&#174; brand is primarily sold to customers in our independent natural products retailer channel ("independent retailers"), and is meant to serve as a private label brand for independent retailers to allow them to compete with conventional supermarkets and supernatural chains which often have their own private label store brands. In connection with the acquisition of Haddon, we acquired six additional specialty food brands representing 350 unique products. We expect to combine these brands with the existing Blue Marble Brands to expand our branded product offerings. 

Our Competitive Strengths 

We believe we distinguish ourselves from our competitors through the following strengths: 

We are a market leader with a nationwide presence in the United States and Canada . 

We believe that we are the largest distributor of natural, organic and specialty foods and non-food products by sales in the United States and Canada, and one of the few distributors capable of meeting the natural, organic and specialty product needs of regional and local independent retailer customers, conventional supermarket chains, and the supernatural chain. The opening of a new facility in Hudson Valley, New York in September 2014 and the acquisition of the Haddon facility in Howell Township, New Jersey, has provided additional space to serve the growing New York City metropolitan market. The addition of these facilities will allow our other facilities to be deployed to further penetrate our northeastern, mid-Atlantic and southeastern markets. Also aiding in the southeast is the acquisition of Haddon's facility in Richburg, South Carolina, which further increases our capacity in the southeastern United States. We believe the opening of our facilities in Racine and Prescott, Wisconsin in June 2014 and April 2015, respectively, and Gilroy, California in February 2016, will allow us to serve the markets in and around Twin Cities, Minnesota, Greater Chicago and California, respectively, with greater operational efficiencies. We believe that our network of thirty-three &#32;distribution centers (including four &#32;in Canada) creates significant advantages over smaller national and regional distributors. Our presence across the United States and Canada in many instances positions us to have locations closer to our customers than our competitors, offer marketing and customer service programs across regions, offer a broader product selection and provide operational excellence with high service levels and same day or next day on-time deliveries. 

We are an efficient distributor. 

We believe that our scale affords us significant benefits within a highly fragmented industry including volume purchasing opportunities and warehouse and distribution efficiencies. Our continued growth has allowed us to expand our existing facilities and open new facilities as we seek to achieve maximum operating efficiencies, including reduced fuel and other transportation costs, and has created sufficient capacity for future growth. Some of the efficiency improvements we have instituted include the centralization of general and administrative functions, the consolidation of systems applications among physical locations and regions and the optimization of customer distribution routes. We have made significant investments in our people, facilities, equipment and technology to broaden our footprint and enhance the efficiency of our operations. Key examples in the last several years include the following: 

&#8226; 

In May 2013 our Albert's division commenced operations at a new 55,000 square foot distribution facility in Logan Township, New Jersey which allows us to more efficiently serve our growing customer base on the East Coast, including the New York City metropolitan market. 

&#8226; 

In June 2013 we commenced operations at a new 540,000 square foot distribution center in Aurora, Colorado and consolidated all existing Aurora operations including an Albert's location and off-site storage into one building. 

&#8226; 

In June 2014 we commenced operations at a new 450,000 square foot distribution center in Racine, Wisconsin. 

&#8226; 

In connection with the acquisition of Tony's in July 2014, we acquired four distribution centers in California and Washington with approximately 500,000 square feet of combined distribution space. 

&#8226; 

In September 2014 we commenced operations at a new 510,000 square foot distribution center in Hudson Valley, New York which allows us to service the growing New York City metropolitan market and to transfer certain routes from our York, Pennsylvania, Chesterfield, New Hampshire and Dayville, Connecticut distribution centers. 

&#8226; 

In April 2015 we commenced operations at a new 300,000 square foot distribution center in Prescott, Wisconsin which services the Twin Cities market. 

&#8226; 

In February 2016 we commenced operations at a new 400,000 square foot distribution center in Gilroy, California. 

&#8226; 

In connection with the acquisition of Global Organic in March 2016, we acquired additional distribution capacity adjacent to our existing Sarasota, Florida facility, which increased distribution space by approximately 80,000 square feet. 

&#8226; 

In connection with the acquisition of Nor-Cal in March 2016, we acquired an 80,000 &#32;square foot distribution center in West Sacramento, California. 

&#8226; 

In connection with the acquisition of Haddon in May 2016, we acquired a distribution center in each of New Jersey and South Carolina with approximately 700,000 &#32;square feet of combined distribution space. 

We have extensive and long-standing customer relationships and provide superior service . 

Throughout the 40 years of our and our predecessors' operations, we have developed long-standing customer relationships, which we believe are among the strongest in our industry. In particular, we have been the primary supplier of natural and organic products to the largest supernatural chain in the United States, Whole Foods Market, for more than 18 years. We believe a key driver of our strong customer loyalty is our superior service levels, which include accurate fulfillment of orders, timely product delivery, competitive prices and a high level of product marketing support. Our average broadline distribution in-stock service level for fiscal 2016 , measured as the percentage of items ordered by customers that are delivered by the requested delivery date (excluding manufacturer out-of-stocks and discontinued items), was approximately 97% . We believe that our high distribution service levels are attributable to our experienced inventory planning and replenishment department and sophisticated warehousing, inventory control and distribution systems. Furthermore, we offer next-day delivery service to a majority of our active customers and offer multiple deliveries each week to our largest customers, which we believe differentiates us from many of our competitors. 

We have an experienced, motivated management team . 

Our management team has extensive experience in the retail and distribution business, including the natural, organic and specialty product industries. On average, each of our ten &#32;executive officers has over twenty-seven &#32;years of experience in the retail, natural products or food distribution industry. Furthermore, a significant portion of our management-level employees' compensation is equity based or performance based, and, therefore management is incentivized to generate continued strong operating results in the future. 

Our Growth Strategy 

We seek to maintain and enhance our position within the natural and organic industry in the United States and Canada and to increase our market share in the specialty products industry. Since our formation, we have grown our business organically and through the acquisition of a number of distributors and suppliers, which has expanded our distribution network, product selection and customer base. For example, we acquired our Albert's, UNFI Canada, Earth Origins, Woodstock Farms Manufacturing, Tony's, Haddon, Nor-Cal and specialty businesses. 

From fiscal 2009 through fiscal 2015, our strategic plan focused on increasing market share, particularly in our conventional supermarket channel. This channel typically generates lower gross margins than our independent retailer channel, but also typically has lower operating expenses. Beginning with our acquisition of Tony's in July 2014, our strategy has shifted as we have moved more heavily into the growing market of perishable food products and focused on our "building out the store" strategy, which focuses on delivering more products sold in the perimeter of our customers' stores. Our acquisitions of Haddon, Nor-Cal and Global Organic continue this current strategy, with the addition of gourmet ethnic products and conventional produce. Our strategic plan also includes the roll-out of new technology including a national warehouse management and procurement system and transportation management system upgrade. These steps and others are intended to promote operational efficiencies and further reduce our operating expenses to offset the lower gross margins we expect with increased sales to the conventional supermarket and supernatural channels and from sales of our fresh perishable products, which can sell for a lower gross margin than our other natural, organic and specialty products. 

To implement our growth strategy, we intend to continue increasing our market share of the growing natural and organic products industry by expanding our customer base, increasing our share of existing customers' business and continuing to expand and further penetrate new distribution territories. We plan to expand our presence within the specialty industry by offering new and existing customers a single wholesale distributor capable of meeting their specialty and natural and organic product needs on a national or regional basis. Key elements of our strategy include: 

Expanding Our Customer Base 

As of July 30, 2016 , we served more than 43,000 &#32;customer locations primarily in the United States and Canada. We plan to expand our coverage of the natural and organic and specialty products industry by cultivating new customer relationships within the industry and by further developing our existing channels of distribution, such as independent natural products retailers, conventional supermarkets, mass market outlets, institutional foodservice providers, buying clubs, restaurants and gourmet stores. With the coordinated distribution of our specialty products with our natural and organic products, including our increased array of specialty protein, cheese, deli, food service and bakery offerings as a result of our acquisition of Tony's and gourmet ethnic products as a result of our acquisition of Haddon, we believe that we have the opportunity to continue gaining market share in the conventional supermarket channel as the result of our ability to offer an integrated and efficient distribution solution for our customers. We have gained new business from a number of conventional supermarket customers, including Giant-Landover, Giant Eagle, Shop-Rite, Kings, Raley's, Harris Teeter and Wegmans, partially as a result of our complementary product selection and acquisitions. 

Increasing Our Market Share of Existing Customers' Business 

We believe that we are the primary distributor of natural and organic products to the majority of our natural products customer base, including to Whole Foods Market, our largest customer. We intend to maintain our position as the primary supplier for a majority of our customers, and to add to the number of customers for which we serve as primary supplier by offering the broadest product selection in our industry at competitive prices. With the expansion of fresh, perishable and specialty product offerings, including proteins, cheeses and deli items as a result of the Tony's acquisition, and ethnic and gourmet items as a result of the Haddon acquisition, we believe that we have the ability to further meet our existing customers' needs for specialty foods and non-food products, representing an opportunity to continue to grow within the conventional supermarket, supernatural and independent channels. 

Continuing to Improve the Efficiency of Our Nationwide Distribution Network 

We have invested significant capital in our distribution network and infrastructure over the past five fiscal years. We are at the end of our multi-year expansion plan, which included new distribution centers in Racine, Wisconsin, Hudson Valley, New York, Prescott, Wisconsin, and Gilroy, California from which we began operations in June 2014, September 2014, April 2015 and February 2016, respectively. We believe that as a result of the opening of our Gilroy, California distribution center, and our acquisition of Haddon, which operates distribution centers in New Jersey and South Carolina, we are unlikely to open or commence construction on a new distribution center in the next twelve months. 

We will strive to continue to maintain our focus on realizing efficiencies and economies of scale in purchasing, warehousing, transportation and general and administrative functions, which, combined with transportation expense savings and incremental fixed cost leverage, should lead to continued improvements in our operating performance. 

Expanding into Other Distribution Channels and Geographic Markets 

We believe that we will be successful in continuing to expand into the foodservice and e-commerce channels as well as continuing to develop our presence outside of the United States and Canada through our relationships with brokers primarily in Asia and the Caribbean. We will continue to seek to develop regional relationships and alliances with companies in the foodservice channel and the e-commerce channel and seek other alliances outside the United States and Canada. 

Continuing to Selectively Pursue Opportunistic Acquisitions 

Throughout our history, we have successfully identified, consummated and integrated multiple acquisitions. Since fiscal 2000, we have successfully completed nineteen &#32;acquisitions of distributors, manufacturers and suppliers, the most recent being the acquisitions of Haddon, Global Organic and Nor-Cal during fiscal 2016 and Gourmet Guru in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. We intend to continue to selectively pursue opportunistic acquisitions to expand the breadth of our distribution network, increase our efficiency, procure beneficial customer relationships or add additional products and capabilities. 

Continuing to Provide the Leading Distribution Solution 

We believe that we provide a leading distribution solution to the natural, organic and specialty products industry through our national presence, regional preferences, focus on customer service and breadth of product offerings. Our service levels, which we believe to be the highest in our industry, are attributable to our experienced inventory planning and replenishment department and our sophisticated warehousing, inventory control and distribution systems. See "&#8212;Our Focus on Technology" below for more information regarding our use of technology in our warehousing, inventory control and distribution systems. 

We also offer our customers a selection of inventory management, merchandising, marketing, promotional and event management services designed to increase sales and enhance customer satisfaction. These marketing services, which primarily are utilized by customers in our independently owned natural products retailers channel and many of which are co-sponsored with suppliers, include monthly and thematic circular programs, in-store signage and assistance in product display. 

Our Customers 

We maintain long-standing customer relationships with independently-owned natural products retailers, supernatural chains and supermarket chains. In addition, we emphasize our relationships with new customers, such as conventional supermarkets, mass market outlets and gourmet stores, which are continually increasing their natural product offerings. The following were included among our wholesale customers for fiscal 2016 : 

&#8226; 

Whole Foods Market, the largest supernatural chain in the United States and Canada; and 

&#8226; 

Other customers, including Kroger, Natural Grocers, Wegmans, Sprouts Farmers Market, Giant-Carlisle, Stop &#38; Shop, Giant-Landover, Giant Eagle, Hannaford, Food Lion, Bashas', Shop-Rite, Publix, Raley's, Lucky's and Fred Meyer. 

Whole Foods Market is our only customer that represented more than 10% of total net sales in fiscal 2016 , and accounted for approximately 35% &#32;of our net sales. 

Net sales by channel were adjusted in fiscal 2016 to reflect changes in the classification of customer types resulting from an in-depth analysis of our customer channel classifications. This process was undertaken to ensure consistency in reporting across all of the Company's divisions. There was no financial statement impact as a result of revising the classification of customer types. The following table lists the percentage of net sales by customer type for the fiscal years ended July 30, 2016 , August 1, 2015 &#32;and August 2, 2014 &#32;after giving effect to the reclassification:

We distribute natural, organic and specialty foods and non-food products to customers located in the United States and Canada, as well as to customers located in other foreign countries. Our total international sales, including those by UNFI Canada, represented approximately four &#32;percent of our business in fiscal 2016 &#32;and fiscal 2015 &#32;and five percent in fiscal 2014 . We believe that our sales outside the United States, as a percentage of our total sales, will expand as we seek to continue to grow our Canadian operations and our foodservice and e-commerce businesses, both of which include customers based outside of the United States. 

Our Marketing Services 

We offer a variety of marketing services designed to increase sales for our customers and suppliers, including consumer and trade marketing programs, as well as programs to support suppliers in understanding our markets. Trade and consumer marketing programs are supplier-sponsored programs that cater to a broad range of retail formats. These programs are designed to educate consumers, profile suppliers and increase sales for retailers, many of which do not have the resources necessary to conduct such marketing programs independently. 

Our consumer marketing programs include: 

&#8226; 

multiple monthly, region-specific, consumer circular programs, with the participating retailer&#8217;s imprint featuring products sold by the retailer to its customers. The monthly circular programs are structured to pass through the benefit of our negotiated discounts and advertising allowances to the retailer, and also provide retailers with shelf tags corresponding to each month's promotions. We also offer a web-based tool which retailers can use to produce highly customized circulars and other marketing materials for their stores. 

&#8226; 

quarterly coupon programs featuring supplier sponsored coupons, for display and distribution by participating retailers. 

&#8226; 

a truck advertising program that allows our suppliers to purchase advertising space on the sides of our hundreds of trailers traveling throughout the United States and Canada, increasing brand exposure to consumers. 

Our trade marketing programs include: 

&#8226; 

wholesale biannual catalogs, which serve as a primary reference guide and ordering tool for retailers. 

&#8226; 

a Customer Portal advertising program that allows our suppliers to advertise directly to retailers using the portal. 

&#8226; 

a variety of programs with advertising focus on foodservice options designed to support accounts in that category. 

&#8226; 

programs designed to generate volume purchases and retail promotions. 

&#8226; 

monthly specials catalogs that highlight promotions and new product introductions. 

&#8226; 

specialized catalogs for holiday and seasonal products. 

Our supplier marketing programs include: 

&#8226; 

ClearVue&#174;, an information sharing program designed to improve the transparency of information and drive efficiency within the supply chain. With the availability of in-depth data and tailored reporting tools, participants are able to reduce inventory balances with the elimination of forward buys, while improving service levels. 

&#8226; 

Supply Chain by ClearVue&#174;, an information sharing program designed to provide heightened transparency to suppliers through demand planning, forecasting and procurement insights. This program offers weekly and monthly reporting enabling suppliers to identify areas of sales growth while pinpointing specific focuses in which the supplier can become more profitable. 

&#8226; 

Supplier-In-Site (SIS), an information-sharing website that helps our suppliers better understand the independent natural channel in order to generate mutually beneficial incremental sales in an efficient manner. 

&#8226; 

Growth incentive programs, supplier-focused high-level sales and marketing support for selected brands, which foster our partnership by building incremental, mutually profitable sales for suppliers and us. 

We keep current with the latest trends in the industry. Periodically, we conduct focus group sessions with certain key retailers and suppliers to ascertain their needs and allow us to better service them. We also provide our customers with: 

&#8226; 

quarterly reports of trends in the natural and organic industry; 

&#8226; 

product data information such as best seller lists, store usage reports and catalogs; 

&#8226; 

assistance with store layout designs; new store design and equipment procurement; 

&#8226; 

planogramming, shelf and category management support; 

&#8226; 

in-store signage and promotional materials assistance with planning and setting up product displays; 

&#8226; 

shelf tags for products; and 

&#8226; 

a robust customer portal with product information, search and ordering capabilities, reports and publications. 

Our Products 

Our extensive selection of high-quality natural, organic and specialty foods and non-food products enables us to provide a primary source of supply to a diverse base of customers whose product needs vary significantly. We offer more than 100,000 &#32;high-quality natural, organic and specialty foods and non-food products, consisting of national brand, regional brand, private label and master distribution products, in six product categories: grocery and general merchandise, produce, perishables and frozen foods, nutritional supplements and sports nutrition, bulk and food service products and personal care items. Our branded product lines address certain needs of our customers, including providing a lower-cost label known as Field Day. 

We continuously evaluate potential new products based on both existing and anticipated trends in consumer preferences and buying patterns. Our Retail Category Management and Supplier Relationship Management teams regularly attend regional and national natural, organic, specialty, ethnic and gourmet product shows to review the latest products that are likely to be of interest to retailers and consumers. We also utilize syndicated data as a compass to ensure that we are carrying the right mix of products in each of our distribution centers. We make the majority of our new product decisions at the regional level and look to carry those items through national distribution as we begin to spot an emerging trend or brand. We believe that our category review practices at the local distribution center level allow our supplier relationship managers to react quickly to changing consumer preferences and to evaluate new products and new product categories regionally. Additionally, as many of the new products that we offer are marketed on a regional basis or in our own natural products retail stores prior to being offered nationally, this enables us to evaluate consumer reaction to the products without incurring significant inventory risk. Furthermore, by exchanging regional product sales information between our regions, we are able to make more informed and timely new product decisions in each region. 

We maintain a comprehensive quality assurance program. All of the products we sell that are represented as "organic" are required to be certified as such by an independent third-party agency. We maintain current certification affidavits on most organic commodities and produce in order to verify the authenticity of the product. Most potential suppliers of organic products are required to provide such third-party certifications to us before they are approved as suppliers. 

Our Suppliers 

We purchase our products from more than 10,000 &#32;suppliers. The majority of our suppliers are based in the United States and Canada, but we also source products from suppliers throughout Europe, Asia, Central America, South America, Africa and Australia. We believe suppliers of natural and organic products seek to distribute their products through us because we provide access to a large and growing customer base across the United States and Canada, distribute the majority of the suppliers' products and offer a wide variety of marketing programs to our customers to help sell the suppliers' products. Substantially all product categories that we distribute are available from a number of suppliers and, therefore, we are not dependent on any single source of supply for any product category. In addition, although we have exclusive distribution arrangements and vendor support programs with several suppliers, none of our suppliers account for more than 10% of our total purchases in fiscal 2016 . Our largest supplier, Hain Celestial Group, Inc. ("Hain"), accounted for approximately 5% &#32;of our total purchases in fiscal 2016 . However, we believe the product categories we purchase from Hain can be purchased from a number of other suppliers. 

We have positioned ourselves as one of the largest purchasers of organically grown bulk products in the natural and organic products industry by centralizing our purchase of nuts, seeds, grains, flours and dried foods. As a result, we are able to negotiate purchases from suppliers on the basis of volume and other considerations that may include discounted pricing or prompt payment discounts. Furthermore, some of our purchase arrangements include the right of return to the supplier with respect to products that we do not sell in a certain period of time. As described under "Our Products" above, each region is responsible for placing its own orders and can select the products that it believes will most appeal to its customers, although each region is able to participate in our company-wide purchasing programs. Our outstanding commitments for the purchase of inventory were approximately $18.9 million &#32;as of July 30, 2016 . 

Our Distribution System 

We have carefully chosen the sites for our distribution centers to provide direct access to our regional markets. This proximity allows us to reduce our transportation costs relative to those of our competitors that seek to service these customers from locations that are often several hundred miles away. We believe that we incur lower inbound freight expense than our regional competitors, because our scale allows us to buy full and partial truckloads of products. Products are delivered to our distribution centers primarily by our fleet of leased trucks, contract carriers and the suppliers themselves. When financially advantageous, we backhaul between vendors or satellite, staging facilities and our distribution centers using our own trucks. Additionally, we generally can redistribute overstocks and inventory imbalances between our distribution centers if needed, which helps to reduce out of stocks and to sell perishable products prior to their expiration date. 

We lease most of our trucks from national leasing companies such as Ryder Truck Leasing and Penske Truck Leasing, which in some cases maintain facilities on our premises for the maintenance and service of these vehicles. Other trucks are leased from regional firms that offer competitive services. 

We ship certain orders for supplements or for items that are destined for areas outside of regular delivery routes through United States Postal Service, the United Parcel Service and other independent carriers. Deliveries to areas outside the continental United States and Canada are typically shipped by ocean-going containers on a weekly basis. 

Our Focus on Technology 

We have made significant investments in distribution, financial, information and warehouse management systems. We continually evaluate and upgrade our management information systems at our regional operations in an effort to make the systems more efficient, cost-effective and responsive to customer needs. These systems include functionality in radio frequency inventory control, pick-to-voice systems, pick-to-light systems, computer-assisted order processing and slot locator/retrieval assignment systems. At most of our receiving docks, warehouse associates attach computer-generated, preprinted locator tags to inbound products. These tags contain the expiration date, locations, quantity, lot number and other information about the products in bar code format. Customer returns are processed by scanning the UPC bar codes. We also employ a management information system that enables us to lower our inbound transportation costs by making optimum use of our own fleet of trucks or by consolidating deliveries into full truckloads. Orders from multiple suppliers and multiple distribution centers are consolidated into single truckloads for efficient use of available vehicle capacity and return-haul trips. In addition, we utilize route efficiency software that assists us in developing the most efficient routes for our outbound trucks. We are in the process of rolling out a national warehouse management and procurement system to convert our existing facilities into a single warehouse management and supply chain platform ("WMS"). We have completed WMS system conversions at our Lancaster, Texas, Ridgefield, Washington, Auburn, Washington, Prescott, Wisconsin, Racine, Wisconsin, Hudson Valley, New York, Auburn, California, Iowa City, Iowa, Greenwood, Indiana, Dayville, Connecticut and Gilroy, California facilities, and we expect to complete the roll-out to all of our existing U.S. broadline facilities by the end of fiscal 2018 . 

Intellectual Property 

We do not own or have the right to use any patent, trademark, trade name, license, franchise, or concession which upon loss would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. 

Competition 

Our largest competition comes from direct distribution, whereby a customer reaches a product volume level that justifies distribution directly from the manufacturer in order to obtain a lower price. Our major wholesale distribution competitor in both the United States and Canada is KeHE Distributors, LLC ("Kehe"). In addition to its natural and organic products, Kehe distributes specialty food products and markets its own private label program. Kehe's subsidiary, Tree of Life, has also earned QAI certification. We also compete in the United States and Canada with numerous smaller regional and local distributors of natural, organic, ethnic, kosher, gourmet and other specialty foods that focus on niche or regional markets, and with national, regional and local distributors of conventional groceries who have significantly expanded their natural and organic product offerings in recent years and companies that distribute to their own retail facilities. 

We believe that distributors in the natural and specialty products industries primarily compete on distribution service levels, product quality, depth of inventory selection, price and quality of customer service. We believe that we currently compete effectively with respect to each of these factors. 

Our natural products retail stores compete against other natural products outlets, supernatural chains, conventional supermarkets and specialty stores. We believe that retailers of natural products compete principally on product quality and selection, price, customer service, knowledge of personnel and convenience of location. We believe that we currently compete effectively with respect to each of these factors. 

Government Regulation 

Our operations and many of the products that we distribute in the United States are subject to regulation by state and local health departments, the USDA and the United States Food and Drug Administration (the "FDA"), which generally impose standards for product quality and sanitation and are responsible for the administration of bioterrorism legislation. In the United States, our facilities generally are inspected at least once annually by state or federal authorities. For certain product lines, we are also subject to the Federal Meat Inspection Act, the Poultry Products Inspection Act, the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act, the Packers and Stockyard Act and regulations promulgated by the USDA to interpret and implement these statutory provisions. The USDA imposes standards for product safety, quality and sanitation through the federal meat and poultry inspection program. 

In late 2010, the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act ("FSMA") was enacted. The FSMA represents a significant expansion of food safety requirements and FDA food safety authorities and, among other things, requires that the FDA impose comprehensive, prevention-based controls across the food supply chain, further regulates food products imported into the United States, and provides the FDA with mandatory recall authority. The FSMA requires the FDA to undertake numerous rulemakings and to issue numerous guidance documents, as well as reports, plans, standards, notices, and other tasks. As a result, implementation of the legislation is ongoing and likely to take several years. 

The Surface Transportation Board and the Federal Highway Administration regulate our trucking operations. In addition, interstate motor carrier operations are subject to safety requirements prescribed by the United States Department of Transportation and other relevant federal and state agencies. Such matters as weight and dimension of equipment are also subject to federal and state regulations. 

Many of our facilities in the U.S. and in Canada are subject to various environmental protection statutes and regulations, including those relating to the use of water resources and the discharge of wastewater. Further, many of our distribution facilities have ammonia-based refrigeration systems and tanks for the storage of diesel fuel, hydrogen fuel and other petroleum products which are subject to laws regulating such systems and storage tanks. Moreover, in some of our facilities we, or third parties with whom we contract, perform vehicle maintenance. Our policy is to comply with all applicable environmental and safety legal requirements. We are subject to other federal, state, provincial and local provisions relating to the protection of the environment or the discharge of materials; however, these provisions do not materially impact the use or operation of our facilities. 

The failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could result in, among other things, administrative, civil, or criminal penalties or fines, mandatory or voluntary product recalls, warning or untitled letters, cease and desist orders against operations that are not in compliance, closure of facilities or operations, the loss, revocation, or modification of any existing licenses, permits, registrations, or approvals, or the failure to obtain additional licenses, permits, registrations, or approvals in new jurisdictions where we intend to do business, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. These laws and regulations may change in the future and we may incur material costs in our efforts to comply with current or future laws and regulations or in any required product recalls. 

We believe that we are in material compliance with all federal, provincial, state and local laws applicable to our operations. 

Employees 

As of July 30, 2016 &#32;we had approximately 9,554 &#32;full and part-time employees, 363 &#32;of whom (approximately 3.8% ) are covered by collective bargaining agreements at our Auburn, Washington, Edison, New Jersey, Iowa City, Iowa, Moreno Valley, California, Dayville, Connecticut and Nor-Cal's West Sacramento, California facilities. The Auburn, Washington, Edison, New Jersey, Iowa City, Iowa, Moreno Valley, California, Dayville, Connecticut and West Sacramento, California agreements expire in February 2017, June 2017, June 2017, March 2019, July 2019 and May 2020, respectively. We have in the past been the focus of union-organizing efforts, and we believe it is likely that we will be the focus of similar efforts in the future. 

In July 2016, the National Labor Relations Board certified the election results of our drivers in Hudson Valley, New York to be represented by the Teamsters union. We are in the process of negotiating a collective bargaining agreement with these employees. 

Seasonality 

Generally, we do not experience any material seasonality. However, our sales and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to factors such as changes in our operating expenses, management's ability to execute our operating and growth strategies, personnel changes, demand for our products, supply shortages and general economic conditions.
