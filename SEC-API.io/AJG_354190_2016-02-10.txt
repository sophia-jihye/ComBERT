 Item 1. Business. 

Overview 

Arthur J. Gallagher &#38; Co. and its subsidiaries, collectively referred to herein as we, our, us or Gallagher, are engaged in providing insurance brokerage and consulting services and third-party claims settlement and administration services to both domestic and international entities. We believe that our major strength is our ability to deliver comprehensively structured insurance, risk management and consulting services to our clients. Our brokers, agents and administrators act as intermediaries between insurers and their customers. 

Since our founding in 1927, we have grown from a one-person agency to the world&#146;s fourth largest insurance broker based on revenues, according to Business Insurance magazine&#146;s July 20, 2015 edition, and the world&#146;s largest property/casualty third-party claims administrator, according to Business Insurance magazine&#146;s March 30, 2015 edition. We have three reportable segments: brokerage, risk management and corporate, which contributed approximately 62%, 13% and 25%, respectively, to 2015 revenues. We generate approximately 68% of our revenues from the combined brokerage and risk management segments domestically, with the remaining 32% derived internationally, primarily in Australia, Bermuda, Canada, the Caribbean, New Zealand and the United Kingdom (U.K.). Substantially all of the revenues of the corporate segment are generated in the United States (U.S.). 

Shares of our common stock are traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol AJG, and we had a market capitalization at December 31, 2015 of approximately $7.2 billion. Information in this report is as of December 31, 2015 unless otherwise noted. We were reincorporated as a Delaware corporation in 1972. Our executive offices are located at Two Pierce Place, Itasca, Illinois 60143-3141, and our telephone number is (630) 773-3800. 

Information Concerning Forward-Looking Statements 

This report contains certain statements related to future results, or states our intentions, beliefs and expectations or predictions for the future, which are forward-looking statements as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements relate to expectations or forecasts of future events. Such statements use words such as &#147;anticipate,&#148; &#147;believe,&#148; &#147;estimate,&#148; &#147;expect,&#148; &#147;contemplate,&#148; &#147;forecast,&#148; &#147;project,&#148; &#147;intend,&#148; &#147;plan,&#148; &#147;potential,&#148; and other similar terms, and future or conditional tense verbs like &#147;could,&#148; &#147;may,&#148; &#147;might,&#148; &#147;see,&#148; &#147;should,&#148; &#147;will&#148; and &#147;would.&#148; You can also identify forward-looking statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. For example, we may use forward-looking statements when addressing topics such as: market and industry conditions, including competitive and pricing trends; acquisition strategy; the expected impact of acquisitions and dispositions; the development and performance of our services and products; changes in the composition or level of our revenues or earnings; our cost structure and the outcome of cost-saving or restructuring initiatives; future capital expenditures; future debt levels; future debt to earnings ratios; the outcome of contingencies; dividend policy; pension obligations; cash flow and liquidity; capital structure and financial losses; future actions by regulators; the outcome of existing regulatory actions, investigations, reviews or litigation; the impact of changes in accounting rules; financial markets; interest rates; foreign exchange rates; matters relating to our operations; income taxes; expectations regarding our investments, including our clean energy investments; the financial impact of retention agreements in our international brokerage operations; and integrating recent acquisitions.

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Our failure to comply with regulatory requirements, including those related to governance and control requirements in particular jurisdictions, international sanctions, or a change in regulations or enforcement policies that adversely affects our operations (for example, relating to insurance broker compensation methods or the failure of state and local governments to follow through on agreed-upon income tax credits or other related incentives, relating to our planned new corporate headquarters); 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Violations or alleged violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), the U.K. Bribery Act 2010 or other anti-corruption laws and the Foreign Account Tax Compliance provisions of the Hiring Incentives to Restore Employment Act, (which we refer to as FATCA);

&#160; &#149; &#160; Risks related to our clean energy investments, including the risk of intellectual property claims, utilities switching from coal to natural gas, environmental and product liability claims, and environmental compliance costs; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Disallowance of Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (which we refer to as IRC) Section 29 or IRC Section 45 tax credits; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; The risk that our outstanding debt adversely affects our financial flexibility and restrictions and limitations in the agreements and instruments governing our debt; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; The risk we may not be able to receive dividends or other distributions from subsidiaries; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; The risk of share ownership dilution when we issue common stock as consideration for acquisitions and for other reasons; and 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Volatility of the price of our common stock. 

Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of, and are based on information available to us on, the date of the applicable document. All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us or any person acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section. We do not undertake any obligation to update any such statements or release publicly any revisions to these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this report or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. 

Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance. They involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including the risk factors referred to above. Our future performance and actual results may differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements. Many of the factors that will determine these results are beyond our ability to control or predict. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Further information about factors that could materially affect Gallagher, including our results of operations and financial condition, is contained in the &#147;Risk Factors&#148; section in Part I, Item 1A of this report. 

&#160; 

Operating Segments 

We report our results in three segments: brokerage, risk management and corporate. The major sources of our operating revenues are commissions, fees and supplemental and contingent commissions from brokerage operations and fees from risk management operations.

&#160; See 19 to our 2015 consolidated financial statements for additional financial information, including earnings before income taxes and identifiable assets by segment for 2015, 2014 and 2013. 

Our business, particularly our brokerage business, is subject to seasonal fluctuations. Commission and fee revenues, and the related brokerage and marketing expenses, can vary from quarter to quarter as a result of the timing of policy inception dates and the timing of receipt of information from insurance carriers. On the other hand, salaries and employee benefits, rent, depreciation and amortization expenses generally tend to be more uniform throughout the year. The timing of acquisitions, recognition of books of business gains and losses and the variability in the recognition of IRC Section 45 tax credits also impact the trends in our quarterly operating results. See Note 18 to our 2015 consolidated financial statements for unaudited quarterly operating results for 2015 and 2014. 

Brokerage Segment 

The brokerage segment accounted for 62% of our revenues in 2015. Our brokerage segment is primarily comprised of retail and wholesale insurance brokerage operations. Our retail brokerage operations negotiate and place property/casualty, employer-provided health and welfare insurance, and healthcare exchange and retirement solutions principally for middle-market commercial, industrial, public entity, religious and not-for-profit entities. Many of our retail brokerage customers choose to place their insurance with insurance underwriters, while others choose to use alternative vehicles such as self-insurance pools, risk retention groups or captive insurance companies. Our wholesale brokerage operations assist our brokers and other unaffiliated brokers and agents in the placement of specialized, unique and hard-to-place insurance programs. 

Our primary sources of compensation for our retail brokerage services are commissions paid by insurance companies, which are usually based upon either a percentage of the premium paid by insureds, and brokerage and advisory fees paid directly by our clients. For wholesale brokerage services, we generally receive a share of the commission paid to the retail broker from the insurer. Commission rates are dependent on a number of factors, including the type of insurance, the particular insurance company underwriting the policy and whether we act as a retail or wholesale broker. Advisory fees are dependent on the extent and value of the services we provide. In addition, under certain circumstances, both retail brokerage and wholesale brokerage services receive supplemental and contingent commissions. A supplemental commission is a commission paid by an insurance carrier that is above the base commission paid, is determined by the insurance carrier and is established annually in advance of the contractual period based on historical performance criteria. A contingent commission is a commission paid by an insurance carrier based on the overall profit and/or the overall volume of business placed with that insurance carrier during a particular calendar year and is determined after the contractual period. 

We operate our brokerage operations through a network of more than 570 sales and service offices located throughout the U.S. and in 30 other countries. Most of these offices are fully staffed with sales and service personnel. In addition, we offer client-service capabilities in more than 150 countries around the world through a network of correspondent brokers and consultants. 

&#160; 

Retail Insurance Brokerage Operations 

Our retail insurance brokerage operations accounted for 83% of our brokerage segment revenues in 2015. Our retail brokerage operations place nearly all lines of commercial property/casualty and health and welfare insurance coverage. Significant lines of insurance coverage and consultant capabilities are as follows: 

&#160;

Aviation &#160; Disability &#160; General Liability &#160; Products Liability Casualty &#160; Earthquake &#160; Health &#38; Welfare &#160; Professional Liability Claims Advocacy &#160; Errors &#38; Omissions &#160; Healthcare Analytics &#160; Property Commercial Auto &#160; Exchange Solutions &#160; Human Resources &#160; Retirement Compensation &#160; Executive Benefits &#160; Institutional Investment &#160; Voluntary Benefits Cyber Liability &#160; Fiduciary Services &#160; Loss Control &#160; Wind Dental &#160; Fine Arts &#160; Marine &#160; Workers&#146; Compensation Directors &#38; Officers Liability &#160; Fire &#160; Medical &#160; Our retail brokerage operations are organized into approximately 500 office locations primarily located in the U.S., Australia, Canada, the Caribbean, New Zealand and the U.K., and operate within certain key niche/practice groups, which account for approximately 68% of our retail brokerage revenues. These specialized teams target areas of business and/or industries in which we have developed a depth of expertise and a large client base. Significant niche/practice groups we serve are as follows: 

&#160;

Agribusiness &#160; Global Risks &#160; Marine &#160; Religious/Not-for-Profit Automotive &#160; Healthcare &#160; Personal &#160; Restaurant Aviation &#38; Aerospace &#160; Higher Education &#160; Private Equity &#160; Scholastic Construction &#160; Hospitality &#160; Professional Groups &#160; Technology/Telecom Energy &#160; Life Science &#160; Public Entity &#160; Trade Credit/Political Risk Entertainment &#160; Life Solutions &#160; Real Estate &#160; Transportation Environmental &#160; Manufacturing &#160; &#160; Our specialized focus on these niche/practice groups allows for highly-focused marketing efforts and facilitates the development of value-added products and services specific to those industries or business segments. We believe that our detailed understanding and broad client contacts within these niche/practice groups provide us with a competitive advantage. 

We anticipate that our retail brokerage operations&#146; greatest revenue growth over the next several years will continue to come from: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Mergers and acquisitions; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Our niche/practice groups and middle-market accounts; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Cross-selling other brokerage products to existing customers; and 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Developing and managing alternative market mechanisms such as captives, rent-a-captives and deductible plans/self-insurance. 

Wholesale Insurance Brokerage Operations 

Our wholesale insurance brokerage operations accounted for 17% of our brokerage segment revenues in 2015. Our wholesale brokers assist our retail brokers and other non-affiliated brokers in the placement of specialized and hard-to-place insurance. These brokers operate through more than 70 office locations primarily located across the U.S., Bermuda and through our approved Lloyd&#146;s of London brokerage operation. In certain cases, we act as a brokerage wholesaler and, in other cases, we act as a managing general agent or managing general underwriter distributing specialized insurance coverages for insurance carriers. Managing general agents and managing general underwriters are agents authorized by an insurance company to manage all or a part of the insurer&#146;s business in a specific geographic territory. Activities they perform on behalf of the insurer may include marketing, underwriting (although we do not assume any underwriting risk), issuing policies, collecting premiums, appointing and supervising other agents, paying claims and negotiating reinsurance. 

More than 80% of our wholesale brokerage revenues come from non-affiliated brokerage customers. Based on revenues, our domestic wholesale brokerage operation ranked as one of the largest domestic managing general agents/underwriting managers/wholesale brokers/Lloyds coverholders according to Business Insurance magazine&#146;s August 31, 2015 edition. 

We anticipate growing our wholesale brokerage operations by increasing the number of broker-clients, developing new managing general agency and underwriter programs, and through mergers and acquisitions. 

&#160; 

Risk Management Segment 

Our risk management segment accounted for 13% of our revenues in 2015. Our risk management segment provides contract claim settlement and administration services for enterprises that choose to self-insure some or all of their property/casualty coverages and for insurance companies that choose to outsource some or all of their property/casualty claims departments. Approximately 69% of our risk management segment&#146;s revenues are from workers&#146; compensation related claims, 27% are from general and commercial auto liability related claims and 4% are from property related claims. In addition, we generate revenues from integrated disability management (employee absence management) programs, information services, risk control consulting (loss control) services and appraisal services, either individually or in combination with arising claims. Revenues for risk management services are comprised of fees generally negotiated in advance on a per-claim or per-service basis, depending upon the type and estimated volume of the services to be performed. 

Risk management services are primarily marketed directly to Fortune 1000 companies, larger middle-market companies, not-for-profit organizations and public entities on an independent basis from our brokerage operations. We manage our third-party claims adjusting operations through a network of more than 110 offices located throughout the U.S., Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the U.K. Most of these offices are fully staffed with claims adjusters and other service personnel. Our adjusters and service personnel act solely on behalf and under the instruction of our clients and customers. 

While this segment complements our insurance brokerage offerings, more than 90% of our risk management segment&#146;s revenues come from non-affiliated brokerage customers, such as insurance companies and clients of other insurance brokers. Based on revenues, our risk management operation ranked as the world&#146;s largest property/casualty third party claims administrator according to Business Insurance magazine&#146;s March 30, 2015 edition. 

We expect that the risk management segment&#146;s most significant growth prospects through the next several years will come from: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Increased levels of business with Fortune 1000 companies; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Larger middle-market companies, captives; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Program business and the outsourcing of insurance company claims departments; and 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Mergers and acquisitions. 

Corporate Segment 

The corporate segment accounted for 25% of our revenues in 2015. The corporate segment reports the financial information related to our debt, clean energy investments, external acquisition-related expenses and other corporate costs. The revenues reported by this segment in 2015 resulted primarily from our consolidation of refined fuel operations that we control and own more than 50% of and from leased facilities we operate and control. At December 31, 2015, significant investments managed by this segment include: 

Clean Coal Related Ventures 

We have a 46.5% interest in Chem-Mod LLC (Chem-Mod), a privately-held enterprise that has commercialized multi-pollutant reduction technologies to reduce mercury, sulfur dioxide and other emissions at coal-fired power plants. We also have a 12.0% interest in a privately-held start-up enterprise, C-Quest Technology LLC, which owns technologies that reduce carbon dioxide emissions created by burning fossil fuels. 

Tax-Advantaged Investments 

In 2009 and 2011, we built a total of 29 commercial clean coal production plants to produce refined coal using Chem-Mod&#146;s proprietary technologies and in 2013, we purchased a 99% interest in a limited liability company that has ownership interests in four limited liability companies that own five commercial clean coal production plants. We believe these operations produce refined coal that qualifies for tax credits under IRC Section 45. The law that provides for IRC Section 45 tax credits substantially expires in December 2019 for the fourteen plants we built and placed in service in 2009 (2009 Era Plants) and in December 2021 for the fifteen plants we built and placed in service in 2011, plus the five plants we purchased interests in that were placed in service in 2011 (2011 Era Plants). 

&#160; 

International Operations

International and Other Brokerage Related Operations 

The majority of our international brokerage operations are in Australia, Bermuda, Canada, the Caribbean, New Zealand and the U.K., targeting small to medium enterprise risks. 

We operate primarily as a retail commercial property and casualty broker throughout more than 35 locations in Australia, 35 locations in Canada and 25 locations in New Zealand. In the U.K., we operate as a retail broker from approximately 90 locations. We also have an underwriting operation for clients to access the Lloyd&#146;s of London and other international insurance markets, and a program operation offering customized risk management products and services to U.K. public entities. 

In Bermuda, we act principally as a wholesaler for clients looking to access the Bermuda insurance markets and also provide services relating to the formation and management of offshore captive insurance companies. 

We also have strategic brokerage alliances with a variety of international brokers in countries where we do not have a local office presence. Through a network of correspondent insurance brokers and consultants in more than 150 countries, we are able to fully serve our clients&#146; coverage and service needs in virtually any geographic area. 

Captive insurance companies 

We have ownership interests in several insurance and reinsurance companies based in the U.S., Bermuda, Gibraltar, Guernsey, Isle of Man and Malta that primarily operate segregated account &#147;rent-a-captive&#148; facilities. These &#147;rent-a-captive&#148; facilities enable our clients to receive the benefits of owning a captive insurance company without incurring certain disadvantages of ownership. Captive insurance companies, or &#147;rent-a-captive&#148; facilities, are created for clients to insure their risks and capture any underwriting profit and investment income, which would then be available for use by the insureds, generally to reduce future costs of their insurance programs. In general, these companies are set up as protected cell companies that are comprised of separate cell business units (which we refer to as Captive Cells) and the core regulated company (which we refer to as the Core Company). The Core Company is owned and operated by us and no insurance policies are assumed by the Core Company; all insurance is assumed or written within individual Captive Cells. Most Captive Cells reinsure individual lines of insurance coverage from external insurance companies. In addition, some Captive Cells offer individual lines of insurance coverage from one of our insurance company subsidiaries. The different types of insurance coverage include special property, general liability, products liability, medical professional liability, other liability and medical stop loss. The policies are generally claims-made. Insurance policies are written by an insurance company and the risk is assumed by each of the Captive Cells. In general, we structure these operations to have no underwriting risk on a net written basis. In situations where we have assumed underwriting risk on a net written basis, we have managed that exposure by obtaining full collateral for the underwriting risk we have assumed from our clients. We typically require pledged assets including cash and/or investment accounts or letters of credit to limit our risk. 

&#160; 

We have a wholly owned insurance company subsidiary based in the U.S. that cedes all of its insurance to reinsurers or captives under facultative and quota share treaty reinsurance agreements. These reinsurance arrangements diversify our business and minimize our exposure to losses or hazards of an unusual nature. The ceding of insurance does not discharge the original insurer of its primary liability to its policyholder. In the event that all or any of the reinsuring companies are unable to meet their obligations, we would be liable for such defaulted amounts. Therefore, we are subject to credit risk with respect to the obligations of our reinsurers or captives. In order to minimize our exposure to losses from reinsurer credit risk and insolvencies, we have managed that exposure by obtaining full collateral for which we typically require pledged assets, including cash and/or investment accounts or letters of credit, to fully offset the risk. 

See Item 1A. &#147;Risk Factors&#148; for information regarding risks attendant to these foreign operations. 

International Risk Management Operations 

Our international risk management operations are principally in Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the U.K. Services are similar to those provided in the U.S. and are provided primarily on behalf of commercial and public entity clients. 

Markets and Marketing 

We manage our brokerage operations through a network of more than 570 sales and service offices located throughout the U.S. and in 30 other countries. We manage our third-party claims adjusting operations through a network of more than 110 offices located throughout the U.S., Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the U.K. Our customer base is highly diversified and includes commercial, industrial, public entity, religious and not-for-profit entities. No material part of our business depends upon a single customer or on a few customers. The loss of any one customer would not have a material adverse effect on our operations. In 2015, our largest single customer accounted for approximately 1% of our revenues from the combined brokerage and risk management segments and our ten largest customers represented 4% of our revenues from the combined brokerage and risk management segments in the aggregate. Our revenues are geographically diversified, with both domestic and international operations. 

Each of our retail and wholesale brokerage operations has a small market-share position and, as a result, we believe has substantial organic growth potential. In addition, each of our retail and wholesale brokerage operations has the ability to grow through the acquisition of small- to medium-sized independent brokerages. See &#147;Business Combinations&#148; below. 

While historically we have generally grown our risk management segment organically, and we expect to continue to do so, from time to time we consider acquisitions for this segment. 

We require our employees serving in sales or marketing capacities, plus all of our executive officers, to enter into agreements with us restricting disclosure of confidential information and solicitation of our clients and prospects upon their termination of employment. The confidentiality and non-solicitation provisions of such agreements terminate in the event of a hostile change in control, as defined in the agreements. 

Competition 

Brokerage Segment 

According to Business Insurance magazine&#146;s July 20, 2015 edition, we were the fourth largest insurance broker worldwide based on total revenues. The insurance brokerage and service business is highly competitive and there are many insurance brokerage and service organizations and individuals throughout the world who actively compete with us in every area of our business. 

Our retail and wholesale brokerage operations compete with Aon plc, Marsh &#38; McLennan Companies, Inc. and Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company, each of which has greater worldwide revenues than us. In addition, various other competing firms, such as Jardine Lloyd Thomson Group plc, Wells Fargo Insurance Services, Inc., Brown &#38; Brown Inc., Hub International Ltd., Lockton Companies, Inc. and USI Holdings Corporation, operate nationally or are strong in a particular region or locality and may have, in that region or locality, an office with revenues as large as or larger than those of our corresponding local office. We believe that the primary factors determining our competitive position with other organizations in our industry are the quality of the services we render and the overall costs to our clients. In addition, for health/welfare products and benefit consultant services, we compete with larger firms such as Aon Hewitt, Mercer (a subsidiary of Marsh &#38; McLennan Companies, Inc.), Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company, mid-market firms such as Lockton, USI Holdings, and Wells Fargo and the benefits consulting divisions of the national public accounting firms, as well as a vast number of local and regional brokerages and agencies. 

Our wholesale brokerage and binding operations compete with large wholesalers such as CRC Insurance Services, Inc., RT Specialty, AmWINS Group, Inc., Swett &#38; Crawford Group, Inc., as well as a vast number of local and regional wholesalers. 

We also compete with certain insurance companies that write insurance directly for their customers. Government benefits relating to health, disability, and retirement are also alternatives to private insurance and indirectly compete with us. 

&#160; 

Risk Management Segment 

Our risk management operation currently ranks as the world&#146;s largest property/casualty third party claims administrator based on revenues, according to Business Insurance magazine&#146;s March 30, 2015 edition. While many global and regional claims administrators operate within this space, we compete directly with Sedgwick Claims Management Services, Inc., Broadspire Services, Inc. (a subsidiary of Crawford &#38; Company), ESIS (a subsidiary of ACE Limited) and CorVel. Several large insurance companies, such as Travelers and Zurich Insurance, also maintain their own claims administration units, which can be strong competitors. In addition, we compete with various smaller third party claims administrators on a regional level. We believe that the primary factor determining our competitive position is reputation for outstanding service and the ability to resolve customers&#146; losses in the most cost-efficient manner possible. 

Regulation 

We are required to be licensed or receive regulatory approval in nearly every state and foreign jurisdiction in which we do business. In addition, most jurisdictions require individuals who engage in brokerage, claim adjusting and certain other insurance service activities to be personally licensed. These licensing laws and regulations vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. In most jurisdictions, licensing laws and regulations generally grant broad discretion to supervisory authorities to adopt and amend regulations and to supervise regulated activities. 

Business Combinations 

We completed and integrated 383 acquisitions from January 1, 2002 through December 31, 2015, almost exclusively within our brokerage segment. The majority of these acquisitions have been smaller regional or local property/casualty retail or wholesale operations with a strong middle-market client focus or significant expertise in one of our focus market areas. Over the last decade, we have also increased our acquisition activity in the retail employee benefits brokerage and wholesale brokerage areas. The total purchase price for individual acquisitions have typically ranged from $1.0 million to $50.0 million, although in 2014 we completed three large acquisitions with an aggregate purchase price consideration in excess of $1,700.0 million. 

Through acquisitions, we seek to expand our talent pool, enhance our geographic presence and service capabilities, and/or broaden and further diversify our business mix. We also focus on identifying: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; A corporate culture that matches our sales-oriented culture; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; A profitable, growing business whose ability to compete would be enhanced by gaining access to our greater resources; and 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Clearly defined financial criteria. 

See Note 3 to our 2015 consolidated financial statements for a summary of our 2015 acquisitions, the amount and form of the consideration paid and the dates of acquisition. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately 21,500 employees. We continuously review benefits and other matters of interest to our employees and consider our relations with our employees to be satisfactory.
