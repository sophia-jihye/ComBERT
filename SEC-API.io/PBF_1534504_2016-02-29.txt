ITEM. 1 BUSINESS 

Overview 

We are one of the largest independent petroleum refiners and suppliers of unbranded transportation fuels, heating oil, petrochemical feedstocks, lubricants and other petroleum products in the United States. We sell our products throughout the Northeast, Midwest and Gulf Coast of the United States, as well as in other regions of the United States and Canada, and are able to ship products to other international destinations. We were formed in 2008 to pursue acquisitions of crude oil refineries and downstream assets in North America. We currently own and operate four domestic oil refineries and related assets, which we acquired in 2010, 2011 and November 2015. Our refineries have a combined processing capacity, known as throughput, of approximately 730,000 &#32;bpd, and a weighted-average Nelson Complexity Index of 11.7. We operate in two reportable business segments: Refining and Logistics. 

PBF Energy was formed on November 7, 2011 and is a holding company whose primary asset is a controlling equity interest in PBF LLC. We are the sole managing member of PBF LLC and operate and control all of the business and affairs of PBF LLC. We consolidate the financial results of PBF LLC and its subsidiaries and record a noncontrolling interest in our consolidated financial statements representing the economic interests of the members of PBF LLC other than PBF Energy. PBF LLC is a holding company for the companies that directly or indirectly own and operate our business. PBF LLC is PBF Energy&#8217;s predecessor for accounting purposes. Our financial statements and results of operations for periods prior to the completion of our initial public offering are those of PBF LLC. PBF Holding is a wholly-owned subsidiary of PBF LLC and is the parent company for our refining operations. PBF Energy, through its ownership of PBF LLC, also consolidates the financial results of PBFX and records a noncontrolling interest for the economic interests in PBFX held by the public common unit holders of PBFX. 

On February 6, 2015, we completed a public offering of 3,804,653 shares of Class A common stock in a secondary offering (the "February 2015 secondary offering"). All of the shares in the February 2015 secondary offering were sold by funds affiliated with The Blackstone Group L.P. ("Blackstone") and First Reserve Management L.P. ("First Reserve"). In connection with the February 2015 secondary offering, Blackstone and First Reserve exchanged all of their remaining PBF LLC Series A Units for an equivalent number of shares of Class A common stock of PBF Energy, and as a result, Blackstone and First Reserve no longer hold any PBF LLC Series A Units or shares of our Class A Common stock. The holders of PBF LLC Series B Units, which include certain executive officers of PBF Energy, received a portion of the proceeds of the sale of the PBF Energy Class A common stock by Blackstone and First Reserve in accordance with the amended and restated limited liability company agreement of PBF LLC. PBF Energy did not receive any proceeds from the February 2015 secondary offering. 

On October 13, 2015, we completed a public offering of an aggregate of 11,500,000 shares of Class A common stock, including 1,500,000 shares of Class A common stock that were sold pursuant to the exercise of an over-allotment option, for net proceeds of $ 344.0 &#32;million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses (the "October 2015 Equity Offering"). On November 24, 2015, our subsidiary, PBF Holding, issued $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 7.00% Senior Secured Notes due 2023 (the "2023 Senior Secured Notes"). 

As of December 31, 2015 , we held 97,781,933 &#32;PBF LLC Series C Units and our current and former executive officers and directors and certain employees held 4,985,358 &#32;PBF LLC Series A Units (we refer to all of the holders of the PBF LLC Series A Units as &#8220;the members of PBF LLC other than PBF Energy&#8221;). As a result, the holders of our issued and outstanding shares of our Class A common stock have approximately 95.1% &#32;of the voting power in us, and the members of PBF LLC other than PBF Energy through their holdings of Class B common stock have approximately 4.9% &#32;of the voting power in us. 

Refining 

Our four refineries are located in Toledo, Ohio, Delaware City, Delaware, Paulsboro, New Jersey and New Orleans, Louisiana. Our Mid-Continent refinery at Toledo processes light, sweet crude and has a throughput capacity of 170,000 bpd and a Nelson Complexity Index of 9.2. The majority of Toledo&#8217;s WTI-based crude is delivered via pipelines that originate in both Canada and the United States. Since our acquisition of Toledo in 2011, we have added additional truck and rail crude unloading capabilities that provide feedstock sourcing flexibility for the refinery and enables Toledo to run a more cost-advantaged crude slate. Our East Coast refineries at Delaware City and Paulsboro have a combined refining capacity of 370,000 bpd and Nelson Complexity Indices of 11.3 and 13.2, respectively. These high-conversion refineries process primarily medium and heavy, sour crudes and have the flexibility to receive crude and feedstock via both water and rail. We have expanded and upgraded existing on-site railroad infrastructure at our Delaware City refinery, including the expansion of the crude rail unloading facilities that was completed in February 2013. The Delaware City rail unloading facility, which was transferred to PBFX in 2014, allows our East Coast refineries the flexibility to source WTI-based crudes from Western Canada and the Mid-Continent, when doing so provides cost advantages versus traditional Brent-based international crudes. We believe this sourcing optionality is critical to the profitability of our East Coast refining system. The Chalmette Refinery, located outside of New Orleans, Louisiana, is a 189,000 bpd, dual-train coking refinery with a Nelson Complexity of 12.7 and is capable of processing both light and heavy crude oil. The facility is strategically positioned on the Gulf Coast with strong logistics connectivity that offers flexible raw material sourcing and product distribution opportunities, including the potential to export products. 

On November 1, 2015, we closed our acquisition of the Chalmette refinery and related logistics assets (the &#8220;Chalmette Acquisition&#8221;). The Chalmette Acquisition included acquisition of 100% ownership of the MOEM Pipeline, providing access to the Empire Terminal, as well as the CAM Connection Pipeline, providing access to the Louisiana Offshore oil Port (&#8220;LOOP&#8221;) facility through a third party pipeline. We also acquired an 80% ownership in each of the Collins Pipeline Company and T&#38;M Terminal Company, both located in Collins, Mississippi, which provide a clean products outlet for the refinery via the Plantation and Colonial Pipelines. The purchase price was $322.0 million, plus estimated inventory and working capital of $243.3 million, which is subject to final valuation upon agreement of both parties. The transaction was financed through a combination of cash on hand and borrowings under our Revolving Loan (as defined below). 

The Chalmette Acquisition represents our entry into the Gulf Coast market and we believe the acquisition offers numerous opportunities for us to potentially enhance earnings through exercising our commercial flexibility. The Gulf Coast is a product exporting region and this should be an opportunity for us to participate in the international as well as domestic market. Additionally, the Chalmette refinery currently distributes products to the product-short Northeastern United States through access to the Colonial pipeline and we believe there is an opportunity for the Chalmette refinery to increase its profitability by penetrating further into the local products market. We also entered into a market-based crude supply agreement with Petr&#243;leos de Venezuela S.A. (&#8220;PDVSA&#8221;) in connection with the acquisition. By being flexible in supplying products to the international market, exporting to Petroleum Administration for Defense District 3 ("PADD 3") and increasing local sales, we believe the overall profitability of the refinery can be enhanced. 

The acquisition of the Chalmette refinery gives us a broader more diversified asset base and increases the number of operating refineries from three to four, and our combined crude oil throughput capacity from 540,000 bpd to approximately 730,000 bpd. The acquisition provides us with a presence in the attractive PADD 3 market. The Chalmette refinery has excellent conversion capabilities and increases our ability to process low cost heavy sour and high acid crude oils. 

Logistics 

PBFX is a fee-based, growth-oriented, publicly traded Delaware master limited partnership formed by PBF Energy to own or lease, operate, develop and acquire crude oil and refined petroleum products terminals, pipelines, 

storage facilities and similar logistics assets. PBFX engages in the receiving, handling and transferring of crude oil and the receipt, storage and delivery of crude oil, refined products and intermediates from sources located throughout the United States and Canada for PBF Energy in support of its refineries. All of PBFX&#8217;s revenue is derived from long-term, fee-based commercial agreements with PBF Holding, which include minimum volume commitments, for receiving, handling, storing and transferring crude oil and refined products. PBF Energy also has agreements with PBFX that establish fees for certain general and administrative services and operational and maintenance services provided by PBF Holding to PBFX. These transactions are eliminated by PBF Energy in consolidation. 

On May 14, 2014, PBFX completed its initial public offering (the &#8220;PBFX Offering&#8221;). Subsequent to the PBFX Offering, PBF LLC transferred additional logistical assets to PBFX in three separate transactions in exchange for cash and equity consideration. As of December 31, 2015 , PBF LLC held a 53.7% &#32;limited partner interest (consisting of 2,572,944 &#32;common units and 15,886,553 subordinated units) in PBFX, with the remaining 46.3% &#32;limited partner interest held by the public unit holders. PBF LLC also owns all of the incentive distribution rights ("IDRs") and indirectly owns a non-economic general partner interest in PBFX through its wholly-owned subsidiary, PBF Logistics GP LLC (&#8220;PBF GP&#8221;), the general partner of PBFX. During the subordination period (as set forth in the partnership agreement of PBFX) holders of the subordinated units are not entitled to receive any distribution of available cash until the common units have received the minimum quarterly distribution plus any arrearages in the payment of the minimum quarterly distribution from prior quarters. If PBFX does not pay distributions on the subordinated units, the subordinated units will not accrue arrearages for those unpaid distributions. Each subordinated unit will convert into one common unit at the end of the subordination period. 

See &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8221; and &#8220;Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence.&#8221; 

Recent Developments 

Pending Torrance Acquisition 

On September 29, 2015, PBF Holding entered into a definitive Sale and Purchase Agreement (the &#8220;Torrance Sale and Purchase Agreement&#8221;) with ExxonMobil Oil Corporation ("ExxonMobil") and its subsidiary, Mobil Pacific Pipeline Company (together, the "Torrance Sellers"), to purchase the Torrance refinery, and related logistics assets (collectively, the "Torrance Acquisition"). The Torrance refinery, located on 750 acres in Torrance, California, is a high-conversion 155,000 bpd, delayed-coking refinery with a Nelson Complexity of 14.9. The facility is strategically positioned in Southern California with advantaged logistics connectivity that offers flexible raw material sourcing and product distribution opportunities primarily in the California, Las Vegas and Phoenix area markets. The Torrance Acquisition is expected to further increase the Company's total throughput capacity to approximately 900,000 bpd. 

In addition to refining assets, the Torrance Acquisition includes a number of high-quality logistics assets including a sophisticated network of crude and products pipelines, product distribution terminals and refinery crude and product storage facilities. The most significant of the logistics assets is a 171-mile crude gathering and transportation system which delivers San Joaquin Valley crude oil directly from the field to the refinery. Additionally, included in the transaction are several pipelines which provide access to sources of crude oil including the Ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles, as well as clean product outlets with a direct pipeline supplying jet fuel to the Los Angeles airport. The Torrance refinery also has crude and product storage facilities with approximately 8.6 million barrels of shell capacity. 

The purchase price for the Torrance Acquisition is $ 537.5 million , plus inventory and working capital to be valued at closing. The purchase price is also subject to other customary purchase price adjustments. The Torrance Acquisition is expected to close in the second quarter of 2016, subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions. Additionally, as a condition of closing, the Torrance refinery is required to be restored to full working 

order with respect to the event that occurred on February 18, 2015 resulting in damage to the electrostatic precipitator and related systems, and shall have operated as required under the Torrance Sale and Purchase Agreement for a period of at least fifteen days after such restoration. PBF Energy expects to finance the transaction with a combination of cash on hand and proceeds from our October 2015 Equity Offering and 2023 Senior Secured Notes offering. Following the expected completion of the Torrance Acquisition, our weighted average Nelson Complexity Index will increase to 12.2. 

Pending PBFX Plains Asset Purchase 

On February 2, 2016, PBFX announced that one of its wholly-owned subsidiaries has entered into an agreement to purchase the assets of four refined product terminals located in the greater Philadelphia region from an affiliate of Plains All American Pipeline, L.P. for total cash consideration of $100.0 million (the "PBFX Plains Asset Purchase"). The acquisition is expected to close in the second quarter of 2016, subject to customary closing conditions.

The diagram below depicts our organizational structure as of December 31, 2015 : 

Operating Segments 

The Company operates in two reportable business segments: Refining and Logistics. The Company&#8217;s four oil refineries are all engaged in the refining of crude oil and other feedstocks into petroleum products, and are aggregated into the Refining segment. PBFX operates logistics assets such as crude oil and refined products terminaling, pipeline and storage assets, previously operated and owned by PBF Holding's subsidiaries DCR, TRC and PBF Holding's previously held subsidiary, Delaware Pipeline Company LLC, which were acquired by PBFX in a series of transactions during 2014 and 2015. PBFX is reported in the Logistics segment. PBFX currently does not generate third party revenue and as such intersegment related revenues are eliminated in consolidation. Prior to the PBFX Offering, PBFX's assets were operated within the refining operations of the Company's Delaware City and Toledo refineries. The assets, did not generate third party revenue nor, apart from Delaware Pipeline Company LLC, any intra-entity revenue and were not considered to be a separate reportable segment. See Note 21 "Segment Information" of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for detailed information on our operating results by business segment. 

Refining Segment 

We own and operate four refineries in PADDs 1, 2 and 3 providing geographic and market diversity. We produce a variety of products at each of our refineries, including gasoline, ULSD, heating oil, jet fuel, lubricants, petrochemicals and asphalt. We sell our products throughout the Northeast, Midwest and Gulf Coast of the United States, as well as in other regions of the United States and Canada, and are able to ship products to other international destinations. 

Delaware City Refinery 

Acquisition and Re-Start. &#32;Through our subsidiaries, Delaware City Refining and Delaware Pipeline Company LLC, we acquired the idle Delaware City refinery and its related assets, including a petroleum product terminal, a petroleum products pipeline and an electric generation facility, on June 1, 2010 from affiliates of Valero for approximately $220.0 million in cash, consisting of approximately $170.0 million for the refinery, terminal and pipeline assets and $50.0 million for the power plant complex located on the property. 

At the time of acquisition, we reached an agreement with the State of Delaware that provided for a five-year operating permit and up to approximately $45.0 million of economic support to re-start the facility, and negotiated a new long-term contract with the relevant union at the refinery. As of December 31, 2015 , we had received $41.4 million &#32;in economic support from the State of Delaware under this agreement. We believe that the refinery&#8217;s ability to process lower quality crudes allows us to capture a higher margin as these lower quality crudes are typically priced at discounts to benchmark crudes, and to compete effectively in a region where product demand currently significantly exceeds refining capacity. 

We completed the restart of the Delaware City Refinery in October 2011. Since our acquisition through December 31, 2015 , we have invested in turnaround and re-start projects at Delaware City, as well as in the strategic development of crude rail unloading facilities. Crude delivered by rail to Delaware City can also be transported via barge to our Paulsboro refinery of other third party destinations. The Delaware City rail unloading facility, which was transferred to PBFX in 2014, allows our East Coast refineries to source WTI-based crudes from Western Canada and the Mid-Continent, which we believe, at times, may provide cost advantages versus traditional Brent-based international crudes. 

Overview. &#32;The Delaware City refinery is located on an approximately 5,000-acre site, with access to waterborne cargoes and an extensive distribution network of pipelines, barges and tankers, truck and rail. Delaware City is a fully integrated operation that receives crude via rail at its crude unloading facilities, or ship or barge at its docks located on the Delaware River. The crude and other feedstocks are transported, via pipes, to an extensive tank farm where they are stored until processing. In addition, there is a 17-bay, 50,000 bpd capacity truck loading rack located adjacent to the refinery and a 23-mile interstate pipeline that are used to distribute clean products, 

which were transferred to PBFX in conjunction with its acquisition of the Delaware City Products Pipeline and Truck Rack (as defined below) in May 2015. 

The Delaware City refinery has a throughput capacity of 190,000 bpd and a Nelson Complexity Index of 11.3. As a result of its configuration and process units, Delaware City has the capability of processing a slate of heavy crudes with a high concentration of high sulfur crudes and is one of the largest and most complex refineries on the East Coast. The Delaware City refinery is one of two heavy crude coking refineries, the other being Paulsboro, on the East Coast of the United States with coking capacity equal to approximately 25% of crude capacity. 

The Delaware City refinery primarily processes a variety of medium to heavy, sour crude oils, but can run light, sweet crude oils as well. The refinery has large conversion capacity with its 82,000 bpd FCC unit, 47,000 bpd FCU and 18,000 bpd hydrocracking unit with vacuum distillation. Hydrogen is provided via the refinery&#8217;s steam methane reformer and continuous catalytic reformer. The Delaware City refinery predominantly produces gasoline, diesel fuels and heating oil as well as certain lower value products such as petroleum coke and LPGs. 

The following table approximates the Delaware City refinery&#8217;s major process unit capacities. Unit capacities are shown in barrels per stream day.

Feedstocks and Supply Arrangements. &#32;In April 2011, we entered into a crude and feedstock supply agreement with Statoil that expired on December 31, 2015. Pursuant to the agreement as amended in October 2012, we directed Statoil to purchase waterborne crude and other feedstocks for Delaware City and Statoil purchased these products on the spot market or through term agreements. Accordingly, Statoil entered into, on our behalf, hedging arrangements to protect against changes in prices between the time of purchase and the time of processing the feedstocks. In addition to procurement, Statoil arranged transportation and insurance for these waterborne deliveries of crude and feedstock supply and we paid Statoil a per barrel fee for their procurement and logistics services. Subsequent to the termination of the Statoil supply agreement, we purchase all of our crude and feedstock needs independently from a variety of suppliers on the spot market or through term agreements. 

Product Offtake. &#32;We currently market and sell all of our refined products independently to a variety of customers on the spot market or through term agreements. Prior to June 30, 2013, we sold the bulk of Delaware City&#8217;s clean products to MSCG through an offtake agreement. Under the offtake agreement, MSCG purchased 100% of our finished clean products at Delaware City, which included gasoline, heating oil and jet fuel, as well as our intermediates. During the term of the offtake agreement, we sold the remainder of our refined products directly to a variety of customers on the spot market or through term agreements. 

Inventory Intermediation Agreement. On June 26, 2013, we entered into an Inventory Intermediation Agreement with J. Aron ("Inventory Intermediation Agreement") to support the operations of the Delaware City refinery, which commenced upon the termination of the product offtake agreement with MSCG. Pursuant to the Inventory Intermediation Agreement, J. Aron purchased certain of the finished and intermediate products (collectively the &#8220;Products&#8221;) located at the refinery upon termination of the MSCG product offtake agreement. J. Aron purchases the Products produced and delivered into the refinery's storage tanks on a daily basis. J. Aron further agrees to sell to us on a daily basis the Products delivered out of the refinery's storage tanks. On May 29, 2015, we entered into amended and restated inventory intermediation agreements for both the Delaware City and Paulsboro refineries (the "A&#38;R Intermediation Agreements") with J. Aron pursuant to which certain terms of the existing Inventory Intermediation Agreements were amended, including, among other things, pricing and an extension of the term for a period of two years from the original expiry date of July 1, 2015, subject to certain early termination rights. In addition, the A&#38;R Intermediation Agreements include one-year renewal clauses by mutual consent of both parties. 

Tankage Capacity. &#32;The Delaware City refinery has total storage capacity of approximately 10.0 million barrels. Of the total, 18 tanks with approximately 3.6 million barrels of storage capacity are dedicated to crude oil and other feedstock storage with the remaining approximately 6.4 million barrels allocated to finished products, intermediates and other products. 

Energy and Other Utilities. &#32;Under normal operating conditions, the Delaware City refinery consumes approximately 65,000 MMBTU per day of natural gas. The Delaware City refinery has a 280 MW power plant located on-site that consists of two natural gas-fueled turbines with combined capacity of approximately 140 MW and four turbo-generators with combined nameplate capacity of approximately 140 MW. Collectively, this power plant produces electricity in excess of Delaware City&#8217;s refinery load of approximately 90 MW. Excess electricity is sold into the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland, or PJM, grid. Steam is primarily produced by a combination of three dedicated boilers and supplemented by secondary boilers at the FCC and coker. 

Paulsboro Refinery 

Acquisition. &#32;We acquired the entities that owned the Paulsboro refinery (including an associated natural gas pipeline) on December 17, 2010, from Valero for approximately $357.7 million, excluding working capital. The purchase price excludes inventory purchased on our behalf by MSCG and Statoil. 

Overview. &#32;Paulsboro has a throughput capacity of 180,000 bpd and a Nelson Complexity Index of 13.2. The Paulsboro refinery is located on approximately 950 acres on the Delaware River in Paulsboro, New Jersey, just south of Philadelphia and approximately 30 miles away from Delaware City. Paulsboro receives crude and feedstocks via its marine terminal on the Delaware River. Paulsboro is one of two operating refineries on the East Coast with coking capacity, the other being Delaware City. Major units at the Paulsboro refinery include crude distillation units, vacuum distillation units, an FCC unit, an Alkylation unit, a delayed coking unit, lube oil processing units and a propane deasphalting unit. 

The Paulsboro refinery primarily processes a variety of medium and heavy, sour crude oils but can run light, sweet crude oils as well. The Paulsboro refinery predominantly produces gasoline, diesel fuels and jet fuel and also manufactures Group I base oils or lubricants. In addition to its finished clean products slate, Paulsboro produces asphalt and petroleum coke.

Feedstocks and Supply Arrangements . We have a contract with Saudi Aramco pursuant to which we have been purchasing up to approximately 100,000 bpd of crude oil from Saudi Aramco that is processed at Paulsboro. The crude purchased under this contract is priced off ASCI. 

Product Offtake. &#32;Prior to June 30, 2013, we sold the bulk of Paulsboro&#8217;s clean products to MSCG through an offtake agreement. With the exception of certain jet fuel and lubricant sales, MSCG purchased 100% of our finished clean products and intermediates under the offtake agreement. During the term of the offtake agreement, we sold the remainder of our refined products directly to a variety of customers on the spot market or through term agreements. Subsequent to the termination of the offtake agreement, we market and sell all of our refined products independently to a variety of customers on the spot market or through term agreements under which we sell approximately 35% of our Paulsboro refinery's gasoline production. 

Inventory Intermediation Agreement. On June 26, 2013, the Company entered into an Inventory Intermediation Agreement with J. Aron to support the operations of the Paulsboro refinery, which commenced upon the termination of the product offtake agreement with MSCG. Pursuant to the Inventory Intermediation Agreement, J. Aron purchases the Products produced and delivered into the refinery's storage tanks on a daily basis. J. Aron further agrees to sell to us on a daily basis the Products delivered out of the refinery's storage tanks. On May 29, 2015, the Company and J. Aron amended the Inventory Intermediation Agreement pursuant to which certain terms of the existing inventory intermediation agreements were amended, including, among other things, pricing and an extension of the term for a period of two years from the original expiry date of July 1, 2015, subject to certain early termination rights. In addition, the A&#38;R Intermediation Agreements include one-year renewal clauses by mutual consent of both parties. 

Tankage Capacity. &#32;The Paulsboro refinery has total storage capacity of approximately 7.5 million barrels. Of the total, approximately 2.1 million barrels are dedicated to crude oil storage with the remaining 5.4 million barrels allocated to finished products, intermediates and other products. 

Energy and Other Utilities. &#32;Under normal operating conditions, the Paulsboro refinery consumes approximately 30,000 MMBTU per day of natural gas. The Paulsboro refinery is virtually self-sufficient for its electrical power requirements. The refinery supplies approximately 90% of its 63 MW load through a combination of four generators with a nameplate capacity of 78 MW, in addition to a 30 MW gas turbine generator and two 15 MW steam turbine generators located at the Paulsboro utility plant. In the event that Paulsboro requires additional electricity to operate the refinery, supplemental power is available through a local utility. Paulsboro is connected to the grid via three separate 69 KV aerial feeders and has the ability to run entirely on imported power. Steam is primarily produced by three boilers, each with continuous rated capacity of 300,000-lb/hr at 900-psi. In addition, Paulsboro has a heat recovery steam generator and a number of waste heat boilers throughout the refinery that supplement the steam generation capacity. Paulsboro&#8217;s current hydrogen needs are met by the hydrogen supply from the reformer. In addition, the refinery employs a standalone steam methane reformer that is capable of 

producing 10 MMSCFD of 99% pure hydrogen. This ancillary hydrogen plant is utilized as a back-up source of hydrogen for the refinery&#8217;s process units. 

Toledo Refinery 

Acquisition. &#32;Through our subsidiary, Toledo Refining, we acquired the Toledo refinery on March 1, 2011, from Sunoco for approximately $400.0 million, excluding working capital. We also purchased refined and certain intermediate products inventory for approximately $299.6 million, and MSCG purchased the refinery&#8217;s crude oil inventory on our behalf. Additionally, included in the terms of the sale was a five-year participation payment of up to $125.0 million payable to Sunoco based upon post-acquisition earnings of the refinery, which was paid in full. 

Overview . Toledo has a throughput capacity of approximately 170,000 bpd and a Nelson Complexity Index of 9.2. Toledo primarily processes a slate of light, sweet crudes from Canada, the Mid-Continent, the Bakken region and the U.S. Gulf Coast. Toledo produces finished products including gasoline and ULSD, in addition to a variety of high-value petrochemicals including benzene, toluene, xylene, nonene and tetramer. 

The Toledo refinery is located on a 282-acre site near Toledo, Ohio, approximately 60 miles from Detroit. Major units at the Toledo refinery include a crude unit, an FCC unit, an alkylation unit, a hydrocracker and a UDEX unit. Crude is delivered to the Toledo refinery through three primary pipelines: (1) Enbridge from the north, (2) Capline from the south and (3) Mid-Valley from the south. Crude is also delivered to a nearby terminal by rail and from local sources by truck to a truck unloading facility within the refinery. 

The following table approximates the Toledo refinery&#8217;s major process unit capacities. Unit capacities are shown in barrels per stream day.

Feedstocks and Supply Arrangements. &#32;We currently fully source our own crude oil needs for Toledo. Prior to July 31, 2014, we had a crude oil acquisition agreement with MSCG pursuant to which we directed MSCG to purchase crude and other feedstocks for Toledo. MSCG purchased crude and feedstocks on the spot market. Accordingly, MSCG entered into, on our behalf, hedging arrangements to protect against changes in prices between the time of purchase and the time of processing the feedstocks. In addition to procurement, MSCG arranged transportation and insurance for the crude and feedstock supply and we paid MSCG a per barrel fee for their procurement and logistics services. We paid MSCG on a daily basis for the corresponding volume of crude or feedstocks two days after they were consumed in conjunction with the refining process. 

Product Offtake. &#32;Toledo is connected, via pipelines, to an extensive distribution network throughout Ohio, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. The finished products are transported on pipelines owned by Sunoco Logistics Partners L.P. and Buckeye Partners. In addition, we have proprietary connections to a variety of smaller pipelines and spurs that help us optimize our clean products distribution. A significant portion of Toledo&#8217;s gasoline and ULSD are distributed through the approximately 28 terminals in this network. 

In March 2011, we entered into an agreement with Sunoco whereby Sunoco purchases gasoline and distillate products representing approximately one-third of the Toledo refinery&#8217;s gasoline and distillates production. The agreement had a three year term, subject to certain early termination rights. In March 2014, the agreement was renewed and extended for another three year term. We sell the bulk of the petrochemicals produced at the Toledo refinery through short-term contracts or on the spot market and the majority of the petrochemical distribution is done via rail. 

Tankage Capacity. &#32;The Toledo refinery has total storage capacity of approximately 4.5 million barrels. The Toledo refinery receives its crude through pipeline connections and a truck rack. Of the total, approximately 1.3 million barrels are dedicated to crude oil storage with the remaining 3.2 million barrels allocated to intermediates and products. A portion of storage capacity dedicated to crude oil and finished products was transferred to PBFX in conjunction with its acquisition of the Toledo Storage Facility (as defined below) in December 2014. 

Energy and Other Utilities. &#32;Under normal operating conditions, the Toledo refinery consumes approximately 17,000 MMBTU per day of natural gas. The Toledo refinery purchases its electricity from a local utility and has a long-term contract to purchase hydrogen and steam from a local third party supplier. In addition to the third party steam supplier, Toledo consumes a portion of the steam that is generated by its various process units. 

Chalmette Refinery 

Acquisition. &#32;On November 1, 2015, we acquired from ExxonMobil Oil Corporation ("ExxonMobil"), Mobil Pipe Line Company and PDV Chalmette, L.L.C. (collectively, the "Chalmette Sellers"), the ownership interests of Chalmette Refining, L.L.C. (&#8220;Chalmette Refining&#8221;), which owns the Chalmette refinery and related logistics assets. Subsequent to the closing of the Chalmette Acquisition, Chalmette Refining is a wholly-owned subsidiary of PBF Holding. The aggregate purchase price for the Chalmette Acquisition was $322.0 million in cash, plus estimated inventory and working capital of $243.3 million, which is subject to final valuation upon agreement by both parties. 

Overview . The Chalmette refinery is located on a 400-acre site outside of New Orleans, Louisiana. It is a dual-train coking refinery with a Nelson Complexity Index of 12.7 and is capable of processing both light and heavy crude oil though its 189,000 bpd crude unit and downstream Coker, FCC and alkylation units. Chalmette Refining owns 100% of the MOEM Pipeline, providing access to the Empire Terminal, as well as the CAM Connection Pipeline, providing access to the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port facility through a third party pipeline. Chalmette Refining also owns 80% of each of the Collins Pipeline Company and T&#38;M Terminal Company, both located in Collins, Mississippi, which provide a clean products outlet for the refinery to the Plantation and Colonial Pipelines. Also included in the acquisition are a marine terminal capable of importing waterborne feedstocks and loading or unloading finished products; a clean products truck rack which provides access to local markets; and a crude and product storage facility with approximately 7.5 million barrels of shell capacity. 

The Chalmette refinery primarily processes a variety of light and heavy crude oils. The Chalmette refinery predominantly produces gasoline, diesel fuels and jet fuel and also manufactures high-value petrochemicals including benzene and xylene. 

The following table approximates the Chalmette refinery&#8217;s major process unit capacities. Unit capacities are shown in barrels per stream day.

Feedstocks and Supply Arrangements. &#32;In connection with the Chalmette Acquisition on November 1, 2015, we assumed a crude supply arrangement with PDVSA that has a ten year term with a renewal option for an additional five years, subject to certain early termination rights. The pricing for the crude supply is market based and is agreed upon on a quarterly basis by both parties. Additionally, we obtain crude and feedstocks from other sources through connections to the CAM and MOEM Pipelines as well as ship docks and truck racks. 

Product Offtake. &#32;Products produced at the Chalmette refinery are transferred to customers through pipelines, the marine terminal and truck rack. The majority of their clean products are delivered to customers via pipelines. The Chalmette refinery's ownership of the Collins Pipeline and T&#38;M Terminal provide it with strategic access to Southeast and East Coast markets through third party logistics. The Chalmette refinery has an offtake agreement for its truck rack whereby ExxonMobil purchases approximately 50% of the 14,000 barrel per day capacity. 

Tankage Capacity. &#32;Chalmette has a total tankage capacity of approximately 7.5 million barrels. Of this total, approximately 2.1 million barrels are allocated to crude oil storage with the remaining 5.4 million barrels allocated to intermediates and products. 

Energy and Other Utilities. &#32;Under normal operating conditions, the Chalmette refinery consumes approximately 30,000 MMBTU per day of natural gas. The Chalmette refinery purchases its electricity from a local utility and has a long-term contract to purchase hydrogen and steam from a third party supplier. 

Logistics Segment 

We formed PBFX, a publicly traded master limited partnership, to own or lease, operate, develop and acquire crude oil and refined petroleum products terminals, pipelines, storage facilities and similar logistics assets. PBFX's operations are aggregated into the Logistics segment. PBFX engages in the receiving, handling and transferring of crude oil and the receipt, storage and delivery of crude oil, refined products and intermediates from sources located throughout the United States and Canada for PBF Energy in support of its refineries. PBFX's revenues are generated from agreements it has with PBF Energy and its subsidiaries for such services. PBFX currently does not generate third party revenue and therefore intersegment related revenues are eliminated in consolidation by PBF Energy. Prior to their acquisition by PBFX, PBFX's assets were operated within the refining operations of the Company's Delaware City and Toledo refineries. The assets did not generate third party or intra-entity revenue and were not considered to be a separate reportable segment. 

PBFX's assets consist of the following: 

&#8226; 

The DCR Rail Terminal &#32;- A 130,000 &#32;bpd light crude oil rail unloading terminal which commenced operations in February 2013 and serves PBF Energy&#8217;s Delaware City and Paulsboro refineries. 

&#8226; 

The DCR West Rack &#32;- A 40,000 &#32;bpd heavy crude oil unloading rack which commenced operations in August 2014 and serves PBF Energy&#8217;s Delaware City refinery. 

&#8226; 

The Toledo Truck Terminal &#32;- A truck terminal currently comprised of six lease automatic custody transfer (&#8220;LACT&#8221;) units, with unloading capacity of 22,500 &#32;bpd. 

&#8226; 

The Toledo Storage Facility &#32;- A storage facility which services PBF Energy's Toledo refinery and consists of 30 tanks for storing crude oil, refined products and intermediates with aggregate capacity of 3.9 &#32;million barrels as well as a propane storage and unloading facility consisting of 27 &#32;propane storage bullets and a truck loading facility with a throughput capacity of 11,000 &#32;bpd.

The Delaware City Truck Rack consists of a 15-lane, 76,000 bpd capacity truck loading rack utilized to distribute gasoline and distillates. 

Initial Public Offering of PBFX and Subsequent Drop-Down Transactions 

On May 14, 2014, PBFX completed its initial public offering of 15,812,500 &#32;common units (including 2,062,500 &#32;common units issued pursuant to the exercise of the underwriters' over-allotment option). 

Effective September 30, 2014, PBF Holding distributed to PBF LLC all of the equity interests of Delaware City Terminaling Company II LLC ("DCT II"), which assets consist solely of the Delaware City heavy crude unloading rack (the "DCR West Rack"). PBF LLC then contributed to PBFX all of the equity interests of DCT II for total consideration of $150.0 million consisting of $135.0 million of cash and $15.0 million of PBFX common units, or 589,536 common units (the "DCR West Rack Acquisition"). The DCR West Rack has an estimated throughput capacity of at least 40,000 bpd. 

Effective December 11, 2014, PBF LLC contributed to PBFX all of the issued and outstanding limited liability company interests of Toledo Terminaling Company LLC ("Toledo Terminaling"), whose assets consist of a tank farm and related facilities located at our Toledo refinery, including a propane storage and loading facility (the "Toledo Storage Facility"), for total consideration payable to PBF LLC of $150.0 million consisting of $135.0 million of cash and $15.0 million of PBFX common units, or 620,935 common units (the "Toledo Storage Facility Acquisition"). 

Effective May 14, 2015, PBF LLC contributed to PBFX all of the issued and outstanding limited liability company interests of Delaware Pipeline Company LLC and Delaware City Logistics Company LLC, whose assets consist of the Delaware City Products Pipeline and Truck Rack (collectively referred to as the &#8220;Delaware City Products Pipeline and Truck Rack&#8221;), for total consideration of $143.0, consisting of $112.5 million of cash and $30.5 million of PBFX common units, or 1,288,420 common units. The Delaware City Products Pipeline is a 23.4 mile, 16-inch interstate petroleum products pipeline with capacity in excess of 125,000 bpd and the Delaware City Truck Rack is a 15-lane, 76,000 bpd truck loading rack. 

Subsequent to the transactions described above, as of December 31, 2015 , PBF LLC holds a 53.7% &#32;limited partner interest in PBFX consisting of 2,572,944 &#32;common units and 15,886,553 &#32;subordinated units. PBF LLC also owns all of the incentive distribution rights and indirectly owns a non-economic general partner interest in PBFX. The IDRs entitle PBF LLC to receive increasing percentages, up to a maximum of 50.0%, of the cash PBFX distributes from operating surplus in excess of $0.345 per unit per quarter. 

Principal Products 

Our refineries make various grades of gasoline, distillates (including diesel fuel, jet fuel and ULSD) and other products from crude oil, other feedstocks, and blending components. We sell these products through our commercial accounts, and sales with major oil companies. For the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , gasoline and distillates accounted for 88.0% , 86.0% &#32;and 88.6% &#32;of our revenues, respectively. 

Customers 

We sell a variety of refined products to a diverse customer base. The majority of our refined products are primarily sold through short-term contracts or on the spot market. However, we do have product offtake arrangements for a portion of our clean products. For the years ended December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , no &#32;single customer accounted for 10% or more of our revenues, respectively. Following the Chalmette Acquisition on November 1, 2015, ExxonMobil and its affiliates represented approximately 18% &#32;of our total trade accounts receivable as of December 31, 2015 . As of December 31, 2014 , no single customer accounted for 10% or more of our total trade accounts receivable. 

For the year ended December 31, 2013 , MSCG and Sunoco accounted for 29% &#32;and 10% &#32;of our revenues, respectively. 

&#160; 

Seasonality 

Demand for gasoline and diesel is generally higher during the summer months than during the winter months due to seasonal increases in highway traffic and construction work. Decreased demand during the winter months can lower gasoline and diesel prices. As a result, our operating results for the first and fourth calendar quarters may be lower than those for the second and third calendar quarters of each year. Refining margins remain volatile and our results of operations may not reflect these historical seasonal trends. Most of the effects of seasonality on PBFX's operating results are mitigated through fee-based commercial agreements with us that include minimum volume commitments. 

Competition 

The refining business is very competitive. We compete directly with various other refining companies on the East and Gulf Coasts and in the Mid-Continent, with integrated oil companies, with foreign refiners that import products into the United States and with producers and marketers in other industries supplying alternative forms of energy and fuels to satisfy the requirements of industrial, commercial and individual consumers. Some of our competitors have expanded the capacity of their refineries and internationally new refineries are coming on line which could also affect our competitive position. 

Profitability in the refining industry depends largely on refined product margins, which can fluctuate significantly, as well as crude oil prices and differentials between the prices of different grades of crude oil, operating efficiency and reliability, product mix and costs of product distribution and transportation. Certain of our competitors that have larger and more complex refineries may be able to realize lower per-barrel costs or higher margins per barrel of throughput. Several of our principal competitors are integrated national or international oil companies that are larger and have substantially greater resources. Because of their integrated operations and larger capitalization, these companies may be more flexible in responding to volatile industry or market conditions, such as shortages of feedstocks or intense price fluctuations. Refining margins are frequently impacted by sharp changes in crude oil costs, which may not be immediately reflected in product prices. 

The refining industry is highly competitive with respect to feedstock supply. Unlike certain of our competitors that have access to proprietary controlled sources of crude oil production available for use at their own refineries, we obtain substantially all of our crude oil and other feedstocks from unaffiliated sources. The availability and cost of crude oil is affected by global supply and demand. We have no crude oil reserves and are not engaged in the exploration or production of crude oil. We believe, however, that we will be able to obtain adequate crude oil and other feedstocks at generally competitive prices for the foreseeable future. 

Corporate Offices 

We lease approximately 53,000 square feet for our principal corporate offices in Parsippany, New Jersey. The lease for our principal corporate offices expires in 2017. Functions performed in the Parsippany office include overall corporate management, refinery and HSE management, planning and strategy, corporate finance, 

commercial operations, logistics, contract administration, marketing, investor relations, governmental affairs, accounting, tax, treasury, information technology, legal and human resources support functions. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015 , we had approximately 2,270 &#32;employees. At Paulsboro, 286 &#32;of our 454 &#32;employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. In addition, 927 &#32;of our 1,584 employees at Delaware City, Toledo and Chalmette are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. None of our corporate employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relations with the represented employees to be satisfactory. At Delaware City, Toledo and Chalmette, most hourly employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement through the United Steel Workers ("USW"). The agreements with the USW covering Delaware City and Toledo are scheduled to expire in February 2018 while the agreement with the USW covering Chalmette is scheduled to expire in January 2019. Similarly, at Paulsboro hourly employees are represented by the Independent Oil Workers ("IOW") under a contract scheduled to expire in March 2018.

Environmental, Health and Safety Matters 

The Company's refinery, pipeline and related operations are subject to extensive and frequently changing federal, state and local laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, those relating to the discharge of matter into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, waste management and the characteristics and the compositions of fuels. Compliance with existing and anticipated laws and regulations can increase the overall cost of operating the refineries, including remediation, operating costs and capital costs to construct, maintain and upgrade equipment and facilities. Permits are also required under these laws for the operation of our refineries, pipelines and related operations and these permits are subject to revocation, modification and renewal. Compliance with applicable environmental laws, regulations and permits will continue to have an impact on our operations, results of operations and capital requirements. We believe that our current operations are in substantial compliance with existing environmental laws, regulations and permits. 

Our operations and many of the products we manufacture are subject to certain specific requirements of the Clean Air Act, or CAA, and related state and local regulations. The CAA contains provisions that require capital expenditures for the installation of certain air pollution control devices at our refineries. Subsequent rule making authorized by the CAA or similar laws or new agency interpretations of existing rules, may necessitate additional expenditures in future years. 

In 2010, New York State adopted a Low-Sulfur Heating Oil mandate that, beginning July 1, 2012, requires all heating oil sold in New York State to contain no more than 15 parts per million ("PPM") sulfur. Since July 1, 2012, other states in the Northeast market began requiring heating oil sold in their state to contain no more than 15 PPM sulfur. Currently, six Northeastern states require heating oil with 15 PPM or less sulfur. By July 1, 2016, two more states are expected to adopt this requirement and by July 1, 2018 most of the remaining Northeastern states (except for Pennsylvania and New Hampshire) will require heating oil with 15 PPM or less sulfur. All of the heating oil the Company currently produces meets these specifications. The mandate and other requirements do not currently have a material impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 

The EPA issued the final Tier 3 Gasoline standards on March 3, 2014 under the Clean Air Act. This final rule establishes more stringent vehicle emission standards and further reduces the sulfur content of gasoline starting in January of 2017. The new standard is set at 10 PPM sulfur in gasoline on an annual average basis starting January 1, 2017, with a credit trading program to provide compliance flexibility. The EPA responded to industry comments on the proposed rule and maintained the per gallon sulfur cap on gasoline at the existing 80 PPM cap. The standards set by the new rule are not expected to have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 

The EPA was required to release the final annual standards for the Reformulated Fuels Standard ("RFS") for 2014 no later than Nov 29, 2013 and for 2015 no later than Nov 29, 2014. The EPA did not meet these requirements but did release proposed standards for 2014. The EPA did not finalize this proposal in 2014. However, in May 2015, the EPA re-proposed annual standards for RFS 2 for 2014, and proposed new standards for 2015 and 2016 and biomass-based diesel volumes for 2017. The final standards were issued on November 30, 2015. The standards issued by the EPA include volume requirements in the annual standards which, while below the volumes originally set by Congress, increased renewable fuel use in the U.S. above historical levels and provide for steady growth over time. The EPA also increased the required volume of biomass-based diesel in 2015, 2016, and 2017 while maintaining the opportunity for growth in other advanced biofuels. The Company is currently evaluating the final standards and they may have a material impact on the Company's cost of compliance with RFS 2. 

On December 1, 2015 the EPA finalized revisions to an existing air regulation concerning Maximum Achievable Control Technologies ("MACT") for Petroleum Refineries. The regulation requires additional continuous monitoring systems for eligible process safety valves relieving to atmosphere, minimum flare gas heat (Btu) content, and delayed coke drum vent controls to be installed by January 30, 2019. In addition, a program for ambient fence line monitoring for benzene will need to be implemented by January 30, 2018. The Company is currently evaluating the final standards to evaluate the impact of this regulation, and at this time does not anticipate it will have a material impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 

As of January 1, 2011, we are required to comply with the EPA&#8217;s Control of Hazardous Air Pollutants From Mobile Sources, or MSAT2, regulations on gasoline that impose reductions in the benzene content of our produced gasoline. We purchase benzene credits to meet these requirements. Our planned capital projects will reduce the amount of benzene credits that we need to purchase. In addition, the renewable fuel standards mandate the blending of prescribed percentages of renewable fuels (e.g., ethanol and biofuels) into our produced gasoline and diesel. These new requirements, other requirements of the CAA and other presently existing or future environmental regulations may cause us to make substantial capital expenditures as well as the purchase of credits at significant cost, to enable our refineries to produce products that meet applicable requirements. 

Our operations are also subject to the federal Clean Water Act, or the CWA, the federal Safe Drinking Water Act, or the SDWA, and comparable state and local requirements. The CWA, the SDWA and analogous laws prohibit any discharge into surface waters, ground waters, injection wells and publicly-owned treatment works except in strict conformance with permits, such as pre-treatment permits and discharge permits, issued by federal, state and local governmental agencies. Federal waste-water discharge permits and analogous state waste-water discharge permits are issued for fixed terms and must be renewed. 

We generate wastes that may be subject to the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, or RCRA, and comparable state and local requirements. The EPA and various state agencies have limited the approved methods of disposal for certain hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. 

The EPA published a Final Rule to the CWA Section 316(b) in August 2014 regarding cooling water intake structures, which includes requirements for petroleum refineries. The purpose of this rule is to prevent fish from being trapped against cooling water intake screens (impingement) and to prevent fish from being drawn through cooling water systems (entrainment). Facilities will be required to implement Best Technology Available (BTA) as soon as possible, but gives state agencies the discretion to establish implementation time lines. We continue to evaluate the impact of this regulation, and at this time do not anticipate it having a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 

The federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, or CERCLA, also known as &#8220;Superfund,&#8221; imposes liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a &#8220;hazardous substance&#8221; into the environment. These persons include the current or former owner or operator of the disposal site or sites where the release occurred and companies that disposed of or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances. 

Under CERCLA, such persons may be subject to joint and several liability for investigation and the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. As discussed more fully below, certain of our sites are subject to these laws and we may be held liable for investigation and remediation costs or claims for natural resource damages. It is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances or other pollutants released into the environment. Analogous state laws impose similar responsibilities and liabilities on responsible parties. In our current normal operations, we have generated waste, some of which falls within the statutory definition of a &#8220;hazardous substance&#8221; and some of which may have been disposed of at sites that may require cleanup under Superfund. 

As is the case with all companies engaged in industries similar to ours, we face potential exposure to future claims and lawsuits involving environmental matters. These matters include soil and water contamination, air pollution, personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by substances which we manufactured, handled, used, released or disposed of. 

Current and future environmental regulations are expected to require additional expenditures, including expenditures for investigation and remediation, which may be significant, at our refineries and at our other facilities. To the extent that future expenditures for these purposes are material and can be reasonably determined, these costs are disclosed and accrued. 

Our operations are also subject to various laws and regulations relating to occupational health and safety. We maintain safety training and maintenance programs as part of our ongoing efforts to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Compliance with applicable health and safety laws and regulations has required and continues to require substantial expenditures. 

In connection with each of our acquisitions, we assumed certain environmental remediation obligations. In the case of the Paulsboro refinery, a self-guarantee is in place to meet state financial assurance requirements, in the amount of approximately $12.1 million, the estimated cost of the remediation obligations. Both the short and long-term portions of this environmental liability are recorded in accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities, respectively. In connection with the acquisition of the Chalmette refinery, the Company obtained $3.9 &#32;million in financial assurance (in the form of surety bond) to cover estimated potential site remediation costs associated with an agreed to Administrative Order of Consent with the EPA. The estimated cost assumes remedial activities will continue for a minimum of 30 years. 

In connection with the acquisition of the Delaware City refinery, the prior owners remain responsible, subject to certain limitations, for certain environmental obligations including ongoing remediation of soil and groundwater contamination at the site. Further, in connection with the Delaware City and Paulsboro acquisitions, we purchased two individual ten-year, $75.0 million environmental insurance policies to insure against unknown environmental liabilities at each refinery. In connection with the acquisition of the Toledo refinery, the seller, subject to certain limitations, initially retains remediation obligations which will transition to us over a 20-year period. However, there can be no assurance that any available indemnity, self-guarantee or insurance will be sufficient to cover any ultimate environmental liabilities we may incur with respect to our refineries, which could be significant. In connection with the acquisition of the Chalmette refinery, the Company purchased a ten year, $100.0 &#32;million environmental insurance policy to insure against unknown environmental liabilities at the refinery. 

We cannot predict what additional health, safety and environmental legislation or regulations will be enacted or become effective in the future or how existing or future laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted with respect to our operations. Compliance with more stringent laws or regulations or adverse changes in the interpretation of existing requirements or discovery of new information such as unknown contamination could have an adverse effect on the financial position and the results of our operations and could require substantial expenditures for the installation and operation of systems and equipment that we do not currently possess.

&#8220;Nelson Complexity Index&#8221; &#32;refers to the complexity of an oil refinery as measured by the Nelson Complexity Index, which is calculated on an annual basis by the Oil and Gas Journal. The Nelson Complexity Index assigns a complexity factor to each major piece of refinery equipment based on its complexity and cost in comparison to crude distillation, which is assigned a complexity factor of 1.0. The complexity of each piece of refinery equipment is then calculated by multiplying its complexity factor by its throughput ratio as a percentage of crude distillation capacity. Adding up the complexity values assigned to each piece of equipment, including crude distillation, determines a refinery&#8217;s complexity on the Nelson Complexity Index. A refinery with a complexity of 10.0 on the Nelson Complexity Index is considered ten times more complex than crude distillation for the same amount of throughput.
