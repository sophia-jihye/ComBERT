 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

COMPANY BACKGROUND 

&#160; 

Plantronics, Inc. (&#8220;Plantronics,&#8221; &#8220;Company,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;our,&#8221; or &#8220;us&#8221;) is a leading global designer, manufacturer, and marketer of lightweight communications headsets, telephone headset systems, other communication endpoints, and accessories for the business and consumer markets under the Plantronics brand. We operate our business as one segment. 

Our headsets are communications tools providing a hands-free connection to communication or entertainment devices, while also allowing freedom of movement for our users. We use a variety of technologies to develop high quality products that meet the needs of our customers, whether for communications or personal entertainment. Our headsets are widely used for applications such as Unified Communications (&#8220;UC&#8221;), in contact centers, in the office and in the home, with mobile devices and Internet telephony, for gaming, and for other specialty applications. Our major product categories include Enterprise, which includes corded and cordless communication headsets, audio processors, and telephone systems; and Consumer, which includes Bluetooth and corded products for mobile device applications, personal computer ("PC") and gaming headsets, and specialty products marketed for hearing impaired individuals (through our Clarity brand). 

We ship our products to approximately 80 countries through a network of distributors, retailers, wireless carriers, original equipment manufacturers (&#8220;OEMs&#8221;), and telephony and other service providers. We have well-developed distribution channels in North America, Europe, and in some parts of the Asia Pacific region where use of our products is widespread. Our distribution channels in other geographic regions are less mature, and while we primarily serve the Enterprise markets in those regions, we continue to expand into mobile, gaming and computer audio, and specialty telephone categories in those regions and other international locations. While not always the case, revenues from our Consumer category are typically seasonal, with the December quarter (our third fiscal quarter) typically being the strongest. 

Plantronics was founded and incorporated in 1961 and most recently became a public company in 1994. Plantronics is incorporated in the State of Delaware and is listed on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") under the ticker symbol "PLT". 

&#160; 

Our principal executive offices are located at 345 Encinal Street, Santa Cruz, California, 95060. Our telephone number is (831) 426-5858. Our Company website is www.plantronics.com .

MARKET INFORMATION 

&#160; 

General Industry Background 

&#160; 

Plantronics operates predominantly in the electronics industry and focuses on the design, manufacture, and distribution of headsets for business and consumer applications, and other specialty products for the hearing impaired. We develop enhanced communication products for offices and contact centers, mobile devices, cordless phones, and computers and gaming consoles. We offer our products under two brands &#8211; Plantronics &#32;and Clarity . 

The proliferation of voice communications applications across much of people's daily lives make communications headsets a key driver of efficiency, ergonomic comfort, and safety for our users. The increased adoption of new and existing technologies, such as UC, Bluetooth, Voice over Internet Protocol ("VoIP"), Digital Signal Processing ("DSP"), and Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications (&#8220;DECT&#8482;&#8221;), each of which is described below, has contributed to increased demand for our headsets and audio solutions: 

&#8226; 

UC &#32;is the integration of voice, data, and video-based communications systems enhanced with software applications and IP networks. It may include the integration of devices and media associated with a variety of business workflows and applications, including e-mail, instant messaging, presence, audio, video conferencing, and unified messaging. UC seeks to provide seamless connectivity and user experience for enterprise workers regardless of their location and environment, improving overall business efficiency and providing more effective collaboration among an increasingly distributed workforce. 

&#8226; 

Bluetooth wireless technology is a short-range communications protocol intended to replace the cables connecting portable and/or fixed devices while maintaining high levels of security. The key features of Bluetooth technology are ubiquity, low power, and low cost. The Bluetooth specification defines a uniform structure for a wide range of devices to connect and communicate with each other. Bluetooth standard has achieved global acceptance such that any Bluetooth enabled device, almost anywhere in the world, can connect to other Bluetooth enabled devices in proximity. 

&#8226; 

VoIP is a technology that allows a person to communicate using a broadband Internet connection instead of a regular (or analog) telephone line. VoIP converts the voice signal into a digital signal that travels over the Internet or other packet-switched networks and then converts it back at the other end so that the caller can speak to anyone with another VoIP connection or a regular (or analog) phone line. 

&#8226; 

DSP is a technology that delivers acoustic protection and optimal sound quality through noise reduction, echo cancellation, and other algorithms to improve both transmit and receive quality. 

&#8226; 

DECT is a wireless communications technology that optimizes audio quality, lowers interference with other wireless devices, and is digitally encrypted for heightened call security. 

Solutions 

&#160; 

UC solutions continue to represent our primary focus area. Our portfolio of solutions, which combines hardware with highly innovative sensor technology and software functionality, provides the ability to reach people using the mode of communication that is most effective, on the device that is most convenient, and with control over when and how they can be reached. For example, the advanced sensor technology in our UC solutions can detect a user's presence, including proximity to the user's PC and whether the headset is being worn, and can share this information with others to make them aware of the user's presence and availability. Using this same technology, our solutions can automatically pause audio applications during an incoming call, change the default audio selection to the user's headset, and then answer the call; all of this is achieved without manual intervention. Finally, our solutions allow users to transition calls seamlessly between PCs, smartphones, tablets, and desk phones, without interruption in the conversation or loss in audio quality. We believe we are early in the UC solutions market adoption cycle and that UC systems will become more commonly adopted by enterprises to reduce costs and improve collaboration. We believe our solutions will be an important part of the UC environment through the offering of contextual intelligence. 

&#32;2 

Our products enhance communications by providing the following benefits: 

&#8226; 

Sensor technology that allows calls to be answered automatically when the user attaches the headset, switches the audio from the headset to the mobile device when the user removes the headset and, with some softphone applications, updates the user's presence 

&#8226; 

Smarter Working capability through seamless communications and high quality audio across a mobile device, desk phone, and PC, thereby allowing users to communicate more flexibly from a wide array of physical locations and be more productive when away from a traditional office environment 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

A convenient means for connecting between various applications and voice networks, whether between land lines and mobile devices, or between PC-based communications and other networks 

&#8226; 

Better sound quality that provides clearer conversations on both ends of a call through a variety of features and technologies, including noise-canceling microphones, DSP, and more 

&#8226; 

Wireless freedom, allowing people to take and make calls as they move freely without cords or cables around their office or home, or easily from public to private space when privacy is required 

&#8226; 

Multi-tasking benefits that allow people to use computers and mobile devices, including smartphones or other devices, while talking hands-free 

&#8226; 

UC integration of telephony, mobile technologies, cloud-based communications, and PC applications, and by providing greater privacy than traditional speakerphones 

&#8226; 

Generating analytics related to headset usage, communications quality and other similar data our customers desire 

&#8226; 

Compliance with hands-free legislation and enhanced roadway safety by allowing users to have both hands free to drive while talking on a mobile phone 

&#8226; 

Voice command and control that allow people to take advantage of voice dialing and/or other voice-based features to make communications and the human/electronic interface more natural and convenient 

Product Categories 

Our products are designed to meet the needs of offices (ranging from enterprise to home offices), contact centers, mobile devices (such as mobile phones, smartphones, and tablets), computer and gaming, residential, and other specialty applications. These applications are increasingly overlapping as work styles and lifestyles change, and people use devices for multiple functions such as communication, music, and video entertainment. We serve these markets through our product categories listed below. 

&#160; 

Enterprise 

&#160; 

The Enterprise market comprises our largest revenue stream and we believe it also represents our largest revenue and profit growth opportunity. We offer a broad range of communications headsets, including high-end, ergonomically designed headsets, audio processors, and telephone systems. Our end-users consist of enterprise employees and small office, home office, and remote workers. Growth in this category comes from the following three main factors: 

&#8226; 

Increasing deployment of UC solutions 

&#8226; 

Robust job market 

&#8226; 

Growing awareness of the benefits of using headsets, including the benefits of wireless solutions 

The contact center category is the most mature in which we participate, and we expect this category to grow slowly over the long-term. Contact centers have begun to adopt UC to help improve productivity and reduce costs. We expect this trend to continue. We develop audio endpoints tailored specifically to UC, and as UC adoption continues to increase, we expect to continue to lead in new product performance by creating solutions that combine hardware and software for an improved customer experience. 

&#160; 

&#32;3 

Consumer 

&#160; 

We believe the mobile headset category will continue to grow as individuals use the technology for both communications and entertainment. The use of headsets designed for mobile devices represents a high volume opportunity and is our second largest revenue stream. The use of mono headsets typically used with mobile devices has experienced a sharp decline over the past year, while the use of stereo Bluetooth technology has increased as individuals want to remain wireless without compromising on stereo sound quality. Our mono and stereo Bluetooth mobile headsets merge technological innovations with style, because we believe that style has become as important as functionality in shaping consumers' purchasing decisions in the wearable technology space. While growth in the mono mobile headset market has slowed and continues to mature, we believe future growth will be driven primarily by demand for stereo Bluetooth technology. 

&#160; 

Gaming and computer audio headsets, whether used for interactive on-line or console gaming, or switching between music and phone calls for multi-functional devices, represent an emerging opportunity for us. As devices providing these users' needs converge, our headsets need to be compatible with PCs, mobile phones, tablets, gaming consoles, and various combinations of these. We believe our product development roadmaps address the convergence brought about by these needs and we are currently investing in this area to enable future growth. 

&#160; 

FOREIGN OPERATIONS 

&#160; 

In fiscal years 2016 , 2015 , and 2014 , net revenues outside the U.S. accounted for approximately 44% , 44% , and 42% , respectively, of our total net revenues. Revenues derived from foreign sales are generally subject to additional risks, such as fluctuations in exchange rates, increased tariffs, the imposition of other trade restrictions or barriers, the impact of adverse global economic conditions, and potential currency restrictions. In fiscal year 2016 , international revenues were reduced by approximately $27 million , net of the effects of hedging, due to unfavorable foreign exchange fluctuations in the other foreign currencies in which we sell. 

We continue to engage in hedging activities to limit our transaction and economic exposures, and to mitigate our exchange rate risks. We manage our economic exposure by hedging a portion of our anticipated Euro ("EUR") and British Pound Sterling ("GBP") denominated sales and our Mexican Peso ("MXN") denominated expenditures, which together constitute the most significant portion of our currency exposure. In addition, we manage our balance sheet exposure by hedging EUR, GBP, Australian Dollar ("AUD"), and Canadian Dollar ("CAD") denominated cash, accounts receivable, and accounts payable balances. Excess foreign currencies not required for local operations are converted into U.S. Dollars ("USD"). While our existing hedges cover a certain amount of exposure for fiscal year 2017 , long-term strengthening of the USD relative to the currencies of other countries in which we sell may have a material adverse impact on our financial results. In addition, our results may be adversely impacted by future changes in foreign currency exchange rates relative to original hedging contracts generally secured 12 to 24 months prior. See further discussion on our business risks associated with foreign operations under the risk titled, " We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, which may adversely affect our revenues, gross profit, and profitability" &#32;within Item 1A Risk Factors in this Form 10-K. 

Further information regarding our foreign operations, as required by Item 101(d) of Regulation S-K, can be found in Note 18 , Geographic Information , of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. 

COMPETITION 

&#160; 

The market for our products is very competitive and some of our competitors have greater financial resources than we do, as well as more substantial production, marketing, engineering and other capabilities to develop, manufacture, market, and sell their products. 

&#160; 

One of our primary competitors is GN Netcom, a subsidiary of GN Store Nord A/S., a Danish telecommunications conglomerate that competes with us in the office, contact center, and mobile categories and, on a limited scale, in the gaming and computer audio categories. In addition, Motorola, Samsung, and LG are significant competitors in the consumer mono Bluetooth headset category. Sennheiser Communications, VXI, and regional companies are competitors in the computer, office, and contact center categories, while Beats, Skullcandy, and LG are competitors in the stereo Bluetooth headset category. In addition, Turtle Beach, Skullcandy, and Razer are competitors in the gaming category. 

&#32;4 

We believe the principal factors to be successful and competitive in each of the markets we serve are as follows: 

&#8226; 

Understanding of emerging trends and new communication technologies, such as UC, and our ability to react quickly to the opportunities they provide 

&#8226; 

Alliances and integration/compatibility with major UC vendors 

&#8226; 

Ability to design, manufacture, and sell products that deliver on performance, style, comfort, features, sound quality, simplicity, price, and reliability 

&#8226; 

Brand name recognition and reputation 

&#8226; 

Superior global customer service, support, and warranty terms 

&#8226; 

Effective and efficient global distribution channels 

&#8226; 

Global reach 

We believe that our products and strategy enable us to compete based on these factors. 

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT 

&#160; 

The success of our new product introductions is dependent on a number of factors, including appropriate new product selection, timely completion and introduction, cost-effective manufacturing, quality, acceptance of new technologies, and general market acceptance. See further discussion regarding our business risks associated with our manufacturers under the risk titled, "Our business will be materially adversely affected if we are unable to develop, manufacture, and market new products in response to changing customer requirements and new technologies" within Item 1A Risk Factors in this Form 10-K. 

During fiscal years 2016 , 2015 , and 2014 , we incurred approximately $90.4 million , $91.6 million , and $84.8 million , respectively, in research, development, and engineering expenses. Historically, we have conducted most of our research, development, and engineering with an in-house staff and the limited use of contractors. Key locations for our research, development, and engineering staff are in the U.S., Mexico, China, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. 

During fiscal year 2016 , we developed and introduced innovative products that enabled us to better address changing customer demands and emerging trends. Our goal is to bring the right products to customers at the right time and have best-in-class development processes. 

&#160; 

In fiscal year 2017 , we will continue to focus our core research and development efforts on UC, which will require incremental investments in firmware and software engineering to enhance the broad compatibility of our products with the enterprise systems into which they will be deployed and to develop value-added software applications for business users. In addition, in fiscal year 2017 we are launching new peripheral "as-a-service" offerings which we anticipate will complement our existing suite of product offerings as we move toward a hybrid business model of hardware, software, and services. 

The products we are developing require significant technological knowledge and speed to market. Separately or together, this technological knowledge and our intellectual property gives us a competitive advantage. We continually strive to improve the efficiency of our development processes through, among other things, strategic architecting, common platforms, and increased use of software and test tools. 

SALES AND DISTRIBUTION 

&#160; 

We maintain a worldwide sales force to provide ongoing customer support and service globally. To support our customers' needs, we have a well-established, multi-level distribution network in North America, Europe, and in some parts of the Asia Pacific region where use of our products is widespread. Our distribution channels in other regions are less mature, and while we primarily serve the Enterprise market in those regions, we are expanding into the Consumer market in those locations. 

Our global commercial sales channel includes technology and electronics distributors, and national and regional resellers. The resellers typically offer a wide variety of products from multiple vendors to both other resellers and end users. Our commercial distribution channel generally maintains an inventory of our products. Our distribution of specialty products includes distributors, retail, government programs, and health care professionals. 

&#160; 

Our retail channel consists of both traditional and online consumer electronics retailers, consumer product retailers, office supply distributors, wireless carriers, catalog and mail order companies, and mass merchants. Our headsets are sold through retailers to corporate customers, small businesses, and to individuals who use them for a variety of personal and professional purposes. Revenues from this channel are seasonal, with our third fiscal quarter typically being the strongest quarter due to holiday seasonality. 

&#32;5 

We have a diverse group of customers located throughout the world. Our principal channel partners are distributors, retailers, and carriers. Our commercial distributors and retailers represent our first and second largest sales channels in terms of net revenues, respectively. No customer accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated net revenues in fiscal years 2016 , 2015 , or 2014 . 

Our distributors, resellers, system integrators, e-commerce partners, telephony and computer equipment providers resell our commercial headsets and end point products. Wireless carriers, retailers, and e-commerce partners also sell our consumer headsets as Plantronics-branded products and in some cases, in their private label packaging. Carriers purchase headset products from us for use by their own agents and in some cases, also offer headsets to their customers. 

We also make direct sales as a General Services Administration (&#8220;GSA&#8221;) contractor to certain government agencies in the U.S. These sales did not comprise a significant portion of our net revenues in fiscal years 2016 , 2015 , or 2014 . In addition, certain distributors are authorized resellers under a GSA schedule price list and sell our products to government customers pursuant to that agreement. 

We have also established strong UC alliances with leading providers of UC software solutions, and these alliances enhance the sales and distribution of our products to large enterprises deploying UC solutions. In some cases, these partners also resell our solutions to customers as part of a broader communications solution. 

Our products may also be purchased directly from our website at www.plantronics.com . 

We continue to evaluate our logistics processes and implement new strategies to further reduce our transportation costs and improve lead-times to customers. Currently, we have distribution centers in the following locations: 

&#8226; 

Tijuana, Mexico, which provides logistics services for products destined for customers in the U.S., Canada, Asia Pacific, Middle East, and Latin America regions 

&#8226; 

Prague, Czech Republic, which provides logistics services for products shipped to customers in our Europe and Africa regions 

&#8226; 

Suzhou, China, which provides logistics services for products shipped to customers in Mainland China 

&#8226; 

Melbourne, Australia, which provides logistics services for products shipped to the retail channel in Australia and New Zealand 

&#8226; 

Sao Paulo, Brazil, which provides logistics services for products shipped to customers in Brazil 

&#8226; 

Tokyo, Japan, which provides logistics services for products shipped to customers in Japan 

With respect to the above locations, we use third party warehouses in the Czech Republic, Australia, Brazil, and Japan. We operate warehouse facilities in Mexico and China. 

BACKLOG 

&#160; 

Our backlog of unfilled orders was $23.4 million and $24.3 million at March 31, 2016 &#32;and 2015 , respectively. We include all purchase orders scheduled for future delivery in backlog. We have a &#8220;book and ship&#8221; business model whereby we fulfill the majority of orders within 48 hours of receipt of the order. As a result, our net revenues in any fiscal year depend primarily on orders booked and shipped in that year. In addition, our backlog is occasionally subject to cancellation or rescheduling by the customer on short notice with little or no penalty. Therefore, there is a lack of meaningful correlation between backlog at the end of a fiscal year and the following fiscal year's net revenues. Similarly, there is a lack of meaningful correlation between year-over-year changes in backlog as compared with year-over-year changes in net revenues. As a result, we do not believe that backlog information is material to an understanding of our overall business. 

&#160; 

MANUFACTURING AND SOURCES OF MATERIALS 

&#160; 

Our manufacturing operations consist primarily of assembly and testing, both of which are performed in our manufacturing facility in Tijuana, Mexico. We outsource the manufacturing of our Bluetooth products to third party manufacturers in China. We also outsource the manufacturing of a limited number of our other products to third parties, typically in China and other countries in Asia. For a further discussion of the business risks associated with our manufacturers see the risk titled, &#8220; We have significant foreign manufacturing operations and rely on third party manufacturers located outside the U.S., and a significant amount of our revenues are generated internationally, which subjects our business to risks of international operations&#8221; &#32;within Item 1A Risk Factors in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

&#32;6 

We purchase the components for our products primarily from suppliers in Asia, Mexico, the U.S., and Europe, including proprietary semi-custom integrated circuits, amplifier boards, and other electrical components. The majority of the components and sub-assemblies used in our manufacturing operations are obtained, or are reasonably available, from dual-source suppliers, although we do have a number of sole-source suppliers. 

We procure materials to meet forecasted customer requirements. Special products and certain large orders are quoted for delivery after receipt of orders at specific lead times. We maintain minimum levels of finished goods based on estimated market demand, in addition to inventories of raw materials, work in process, sub-assemblies, and components. In addition, a substantial portion of the raw materials, components, and sub-assemblies used in our products are provided by our suppliers on a consignment basis. Refer to &#8220; Off Balance Sheet Arrangements&#8221; , within Item 7 Management's Discussion and Analysis, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional details regarding consigned inventories. We write-down inventory items determined to be either excess or obsolete to their net realizable value. 

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS 

&#160; 

We are subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign environmental laws and regulations, including those governing the use, discharge, and disposal of hazardous substances in the ordinary course of our manufacturing process. We believe that our current manufacturing and other operations comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations. We are required to comply and we believe are currently in compliance with the European Union (&#8220;EU&#8221;) and other Directives on the Restrictions of the use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment (&#8220;RoHS&#8221;) and on Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (&#8220;WEEE&#8221;) requirements. Additionally, we believe we are compliant with the RoHS initiatives in China and Korea; however, it is possible that future environmental legislation may be enacted or current environmental legislation may be interpreted to create an environmental liability with respect to our facilities, operations, or products. See further discussion of our business risks associated with environmental legislation under the risk titled, " We are subject to environmental laws and regulations that expose us to a number of risks and could result in significant liabilities and costs " within Item 1A Risk Factors of this Form 10-K. 

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 

&#160; 

We maintain a program of seeking patent protection for our technologies when we believe it is commercially appropriate. As of March 31, 2016 , we had approximately 775 worldwide patents in force, expiring between calendar years 2016 and 2040. 

We intend to continue seeking patents on our inventions when commercially appropriate. Our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain patents and preserve other intellectual property rights covering the design and operation of our products. See further discussion of our business risks associated with our intellectual property under the risk titled, "Our intellectual property rights could be infringed on by others, and we may infringe on the intellectual property rights of others resulting in claims or lawsuits. Even if we prevail, claims and lawsuits are costly and time consuming to pursue or defend and may divert management's time from our business" &#32; within Item 1A Risk Factors of this Form 10-K. 

&#160; 

We own trademark registrations in the U.S. and a number of other countries with respect to the Plantronics and Clarity trademarks, as well as the names of many of our products and product features. We currently have pending U.S. and foreign trademark applications in connection with certain new products and product features and may seek copyright protection where we believe it is applicable. We own a number of domain name registrations and intend to seek more as appropriate. We also attempt to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information through comprehensive security measures, including agreements with customers and suppliers, and proprietary information agreements with employees and consultants. See further discussion of our business risks associated with intellectual property under the risk titled " Our intellectual property rights could be infringed on by others, and we may infringe on the intellectual property rights of others resulting in claims or lawsuits. Even if we prevail, claims and lawsuits are costly and time consuming to pursue or defend and may divert management&#8217;s time from our business ." 

EMPLOYEES 

&#160; 

On March 31, 2016 , we employed approximately 3,398 &#32;people worldwide, including approximately 2,326 employees at our manufacturing facility in Tijuana, Mexico. To our knowledge, no employees are currently covered by collective bargaining agreements.
