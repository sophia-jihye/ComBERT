 Item 1. Business 

OVERVIEW 

The Company designs, sources and sells branded kitchenware, tableware and other products used in the home and markets its products under a number of widely-recognized brand names and trademarks, which are either owned or licensed by the Company, or through retailers&#146; private labels and their licensed brands. The Company&#146;s products, which are targeted primarily towards consumer purchases of moderately priced kitchenware, tableware and housewares, are sold through virtually every major level of trade. The Company generally markets several lines within each of its product categories under more than one brand. The Company sells its products directly to retailers (including through their Internet websites) and, to a lesser extent, to distributors. The Company also sells a limited selection of its products directly to consumers through its own Internet websites. At the heart of the Company is a culture of innovation. The Company brought over 5,500 new or redesigned products to market in 2015 and expects to introduce approximately 5,500 new or redesigned products in 2016. Historically, new products generally reach their peak sales in 12 to 18 months following introduction. 

The Company&#146;s product categories include two categories of products used to prepare, serve and consume foods, Kitchenware (kitchen tools and gadgets, cutlery, cutting boards, shears, cookware and bakeware) and Tableware (dinnerware, stemware, flatware and giftware); and one category, Home Solutions, which comprises other products used in the home (pantryware, spice racks, thermal beverageware, food storage, neoprene travel products and home d&#233;cor). 

The Company has a presence in international markets through subsidiaries and affiliate companies that are based outside of the United States. The Company has two wholly-owned businesses based in the United Kingdom (&#147;U.K&#148;). One is Kitchen Craft, acquired in 2014, a leading supplier of kitchenware products and accessories in the U.K. and in over 70 countries. The other is Creative Tops, acquired in 2011, a supplier of private label and branded tableware (including La Cafeti&#232;re and Randwyck brands, acquired in 2014) products in the U.K. other countries in Europe. The Company also has a subsidiary in China to supply kitchenware and tableware products to the market and a subsidiary based in Hong Kong to facility the sale of its products to other parts of Asia and smaller markets elsewhere in the world. The Company has a presence in Mexico and other parts of Latin America (excluding Brazil) through its 30% equity interest in Grupo Vasconia, S.A.B. (&#147;Vasconia&#148;), a housewares company and aluminum manufacturer based in Mexico; a presence in Brazil through a 40% equity interest in GS Internacional S/A (&#147;GSI&#148;) a wholesale distributor of branded housewares products in Brazil; and a strategic alliance with a Canadian company to distribute many of the Company&#146;s products in Canada. 

The Company continually evaluates opportunities to expand the reach of its brands and to invest in other companies that operate principally outside the United States and that own or license complementary brands. These opportunities involve risks as the industry and foreign markets may not evolve as anticipated and the Company&#146;s objectives may not be achieved. 

In addition to seeking opportunities to expand the Company&#146;s international footprint, the Company regularly evaluates potential acquisitions of businesses or product lines to grow its product offerings and distribution in the United States market. In December 2012, the Company acquired Fred &#174; &#160;&#38; Friends, a business which designs and markets novelty housewares and other products under the Fred &#174; brand. The acquisition resulted in an expansion of the Company&#146;s Kitchenware product category to include novelty kitchen tools, tableware accessories, party goods, personal accessories and other products. In 2014, the Company acquired certain assets of Built NY, a designer and distributor of brightly colored, uniquely patterned neoprene travel products, including bags, totes, cases and sleeves, and acquired the business and assets of Empire Silver Company, a manufacturer of sterling silver and pewter giftware products. 

The Company is a Delaware corporation, incorporated on December 22, 1983.

The Company generally collaborates with its largest wholesale customers and in many instances produces specific versions of the Company&#146;s product lines with exclusive designs and/or packaging for their stores. 

DESIGN AND INNOVATION 

At the heart of the Company is a culture of innovation and new product development. The Company&#146;s in-house design and development teams currently consist of 122 professional designers, artists and engineers. Utilizing the latest available design tools, technology and materials, these teams create new products, redesign existing products and create packaging and merchandising concepts. 

SOURCES OF SUPPLY

The Company also sources products from suppliers in Hong Kong, the United States, the United Kingdom, Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia, India, Slovakia, Canada, Czech Republic, Taiwan, Mexico, France, Poland, Italy, Japan, American Samoa, Brazil, Korea, Thailand, Portugal, Slovenia, Portugal, Germany, Netherlands, Belgium and Israel. The Company orders products substantially in advance of the anticipated time of their sale by the Company. The Company does not have any formal long-term arrangements with any of its suppliers and its arrangements with most manufacturers allow for flexibility in modifying the quantity, composition and delivery dates of orders. 

&#160;

MANUFACTURING 

The Company manufactures its sterling silver products at its leased manufacturing facility in San Germ&#225;n, Puerto Rico and fills jars and other canisters with spices and assembles spice racks at the Company&#146;s owned Winchendon, Massachusetts distribution facility. The Company does not manufacture any of its other products. 

COMPETITION 

The markets for kitchenware, tableware and other products used in the home including home d&#233;cor products are highly competitive and include numerous domestic and foreign competitors, some of which are larger than the Company. The primary competitive factors in selling such products to retailers are innovative products, brand, quality, aesthetic appeal to consumers, packaging, breadth of product line, distribution capability and selling price. 

PATENTS 

The Company owns approximately 320 design and utility patents. The Company believes that the expiration of any of its patents would not have a material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s business. 

BACKLOG 

Backlog is not material to the Company&#146;s business, because actual confirmed orders from the Company&#146;s customers are typically received within close proximity to the required shipment dates. 

EMPLOYEES 

At December 31, 2015, the Company had a total of 1,414 full-time employees, of whom 215 were located in Asia and 303 in Europe.

&#160;

SEASONALITY 

The Company&#146;s business and working capital needs are highly seasonal, with a majority of sales occurring in the third and fourth quarters. In 2015, net sales in the third and fourth quarters accounted for 59% of total annual net sales. In anticipation of the pre-holiday shipping season, inventory levels increase primarily in the June through October time period. 

GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION 

Geographic information concerning the Company&#146;s revenues and long-lived assets is contained in Note J of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 15 of this annual report. 

RESTRUCTURING 

In the fourth quarter of 2015, a restructuring plan relating primarily to the U.S. Wholesale segment commenced. The restructuring plan is intended to realign product categories to best achieve the Company&#146;s strategic plan and implement cost reduction initiatives. The Company recorded a charge of $437,000 in the year ended December 31, 2015 and expects to record an additional $0.5 million, primarily for severance, in fiscal 2016 related to this plan. The Company&#146;s 2015 results do not present the realignment of product categories within the U.S. Wholesale segment. The realignment includes grouping certain pantryware products and spice racks within the Kitchenware product category. The Company does not expect this restructuring plan to impact total net sales of the U.S. Wholesale segment.
