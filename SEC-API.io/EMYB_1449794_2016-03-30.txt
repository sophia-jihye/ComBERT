 Item 1 . BUSINESS. 

&#160; 

General 

&#160; 

Embassy Bancorp, Inc. (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) is a Pennsylvania corporation organized in 2008 and registered as a bank holding company pursuant to the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the &#8220;BHC Act&#8221;). The Company was formed for purposes of acquiring Embassy Bank For The Lehigh Valley (the &#8220;Bank&#8221;) in connection with the reorganization of the Bank into a bank holding company structure, which was consummated on November 11, 2008. Accordingly, the Company owns all of the capital stock of the Bank, giving the organization more flexibility in meeting its capital needs as the Company continues to grow. 

&#160; 

The Bank, which is the Company&#8217;s principal operating subsidiary, was originally incorporated as a Pennsylvania bank on May 11, 2001 and opened its doors on November 6, 2001. It was formed by a group of local business persons and professionals with significant prior experience in community banking in the Lehigh Valley area of Pennsylvania, the Bank&#8217;s primary market area. 

&#160; 

Mission 

&#160; 

The Company provides a traditional range of financial products and services to meet the depository and credit needs of individual consumers, small and medium sized businesses and professionals in its market area. As a locally owned and operated community bank, there is a strong focus on service that is highly personalized, efficient and responsive to local needs. It is the intention of the Company to deliver its products and services with the care and professionalism expected of a community bank and with a special dedication to personalized service. To create this environment, the Company employs a well-trained, highly motivated staff, all with previous banking experience, and interested in building quality client relationships using state-of-the-art delivery systems and client service facilities. The Company&#8217;s senior management has extensive banking experience. The Company&#8217;s goal is to serve the financial needs of its clients and provide a profitable return to its investors, consistent with safe and sound banking practices. The Company focuses on establishing and retaining customer relationships by offering a broad range of financial services, competitively-priced and delivered in a responsive manner. Correspondent relationships are utilized where it is cost beneficial. The specific objectives of the Company are: 1) to provide individuals, professionals and local businesses with the highest standard of relationship banking in the local market; 2) to attract deposits and loans by offering state of the art products and services with competitive pricing; 3) to provide a reasonable return to shareholders on capital invested; and 4) to attract, train and retain a happy, motivated and team oriented group of banking professionals dedicated to meeting the Company&#8217;s objectives. 

&#160; 

Market &#8220;Niche&#8221; 

&#160; 

The Company provides the traditional array of commercial banking products and services emphasizing one-on-one delivery to consumers and businesses located in Lehigh and Northampton Counties in Pennsylvania. In the Company&#8217;s primary market area, which is dominated by offices of large statewide, regional and interstate banking institutions, banking services that are furnished in a friendly and courteous manner with a timely response to customer needs fill a &#8220;niche&#8221; that arises due to the loss of local institutions through merger and acquisitions. 

&#160; 

Deposits 

&#160; 

The Company offers small business cash management services to help local companies better manage their cash flow, in order for the Company to attract and retain stable deposit relationships. The expertise and experience of the Company&#8217;s management coupled with the latest technology accessed through third party providers enables the Company to maximize the growth of business-related deposits. 

&#160; 

As for consumers, deposit growth is driven by a variety of factors including, but not limited to, population growth, bank and non-bank competition, increase in household income, interest rates, accessibility of location and the sales efforts of Company personnel. Time deposits can be attracted and/or increased by paying an interest rate higher than 

&#160;

Embassy Bancorp, Inc. 

that offered by competitors, but they are the most costly type of deposit. The most profitable type of deposits are non-interest bearing demand (checking) accounts which can be attracted by offering free checking. However, both high interest rates and free checking accounts generate certain expenses for a bank and the desire to increase deposits must be balanced with the need to be profitable. The deposit services of the Company are generally comprised of demand deposits, savings deposits, money market deposits, time deposits and Individual Retirement Accounts. 

&#160; 

Loans 

&#160; 

The loan portfolio of the Company consists primarily of secured fixed-rate and variable-rate loans, with a significant concentration in commercial-purpose transactions and consumer residential mortgage and home equity loans. While most credit facilities are appropriately collateralized, major emphasis is placed upon the financial condition of the borrower and evaluating the borrower&#8217;s cash flow versus debt service requirements. The Company has an experienced lending team. The Company believes that the familiarity of its experienced management team and members of the Company&#8217;s Loan Committee with prospective local borrowers enables the Company to better evaluate the character, integrity and creditworthiness of the prospective borrowers. 

&#160; 

Loan growth is driven by customer demand, which in turn is influenced by individual and business indebtedness and consumer demand for goods. The Company&#8217;s loan officers call upon accountants, financial planners, attorneys, local realtors and others to generate loan referrals. A performing loan is a loan which is being repaid according to its original terms and is the most desirable type of loan that a bank seeks to make. Again, a balancing act is required for the Company inasmuch as loaning money will always entail some risk. Without loaning money, however, a bank cannot generate enough earnings to be profitable. The risk involved in each loan must, therefore, be carefully evaluated before the loan is made. The interest rate at which the loan is made should always reflect the risk factors involved, including the term of the loan, the value of collateral, if any, the reliability of the projected source of repayment and the amount of the loan requested. Credit quality will always be the Company&#8217;s most important factor. 

&#160; 

The Company has not been involved in any &#8220;sub-prime&#8221; mortgage lending and has not purchased or invested in any securities backed by or which include sub-prime loans. 

&#160; 

Business Lending 

&#160; 

The Company is generally targeting businesses with annual revenues of less than $10 million. These customers tend to be ignored by the larger institutions and have felt the most negative effects of the recent bank consolidations. The Company offers responsiveness, flexibility and local decision making for loan applications of small business owners thereby eliminating delays caused by non-local management. The Company participates in l ocal, state and federal loan programs . 

&#160; 

Consumer Lending 

&#160; 

The Company offers its retail customer base a product line of consumer loan services including mortgage loans, secured home equity loans, lines of credit, auto loans, and to a much lesser extent, unsecured personal loans. 

&#160; 

Residential Mortgage Loans 

&#160; 

The Company offers a range of specialty home equity and mortgage products at competitive rates. The Company seeks to capitalize on its policy of closing loans in a time frame that will meet the needs of its borrowers. 

&#160; 

Commercial Mortgage/Construction Loans 

&#160; 

The Company originates various types of loans secured by real estate, including, to a limited extent, construction loans. Construction loans are generally priced at floating rates tied to current market rates. Upon completion of construction, these loans may be converted into permanent commercial and residential loans. Construction lending is expected to constitute a minor portion of the Company&#8217;s loan portfolio. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Embassy Bancorp, Inc. 

In some cases, the Company originates loans larger than its lending limit and enters into participation arrangements for those loans with other banks. 

&#160; 

As an independent community bank, the Company serves the special needs of legal, medical, accounting, financial service providers and other professionals. C ommercial mortgages, lines of credit, term loans and demand loans are tailored to meet the needs of the Company&#8217;s customers in the professional community. In addition to the usual criteria for pricing credit-related products, the Company takes into consideration the overall customer relationship to establish credit pricing. Deposit relationships in demand, savings, money market, and certificate accounts are considered in loan pricing along with the credit worthiness of the borrower. 

&#160; 

Other Services 

&#160; 

To further attract and retain customer relationships, the Company provides or will provide the standard array of financial services expected of a community bank, which include the following: 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Treasurer Checks 

Remote Deposit Capture 

Certified Checks 

Mobile Banking 

Gift Cards 

Night Depository Services 

Wire Transfers 

Bond Coupon Redemptions 

Savings Bond Redemptions 

Bank by Mail 

Credit/Debit Card Merchant Processing 

Automated Teller Machines 

Direct Deposit/ACH Services 

On-Line Banking and Bill Pay 

Cash Management Services 

Commercial Credit Cards 

Escrow Management Services 

Safe Deposit Boxes 

ATM and Debit Cards 

&#160; 

Fee Income 

&#160; 

Fee income is non-interest related. The Company earns fee income by charging customers for banking services, credit card and merchant processing, treasurer&#8217;s checks, overdrafts, wire transfers, bond coupon redemptions, and check orders, as well as other deposit and loan related fees. 

&#160; 

Community Reinvestment Act 

&#160; 

The Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (&#8220;CRA&#8221;) is designed to create a system for bank regulatory agencies to evaluate a depository institution&#8217;s record in meeting the credit needs of its community. The Company had its last CRA examination in 201 5 and received a &#8220;satisfactory&#8221; rating. 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s Directors and Officers are committed to reaching out to the community in which they live and work. The personal, business and community rewards for helping local residents and businesses are numerous. The Board is dedicated to recognizing an ongoing commitment and understanding of the Company&#8217;s responsibility under the CRA. The Company is committed to providing access to credit and deposit products for all members of the communities that it serves. 

&#160; 

Service Area 

&#160; 

The Company draws its primary deposits and business from areas immediately surrounding its principal office in Hanover Township, Pennsylvania and its branch offices in South Whitehall Township, Lower Macungie Township, the City of Bethlehem, Salisbury Township, Lower Saucon Township, Lower Nazareth Township and Borough of Nazareth, Pennsylvania, as well as the remainder of Lehigh and Northampton Counties in Pennsylvania. 

&#160;

Embassy Bancorp, Inc. 

Bank Premises 

&#160; 

The Company leases each of its bank operations premises, situated at the following locations: 

&#160; 

1. 

Hanover Township, Northampton County 

2. 

South Whitehall Township, Lehigh County 

3. 

Salisbury Township, Lehigh County 

4. 

Lower Macungie Township, Lehigh County 

5. 

City of Bethlehem, Lehigh County 

6. 

Lower Saucon Township, Northampton County 

7. 

Lower Nazareth Township, Northampton County 

8. 

Borough of Nazareth, Northampton County 

&#160; 

The Company pays certain additional expenses of occupying these spaces including, but not necessarily limited to, real estate taxes, insurance, utilities and repairs. The Company is obligated under the leases to maintain the premises in good order, condition and repair. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015 , the Company had a total of 76 full-time equivalent employees. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

The banking business is highly competitive. The Company competes with local banks as well as numerous regionally based commercial banks, most of which have assets, capital and lending limits far larger than those of the Company. The Company also competes with savings banks, savings and loan associations, money market funds, insurance companies, stock brokerage firms, regulated small loan companies, credit unions and with the issuers of commercial paper and other securities. The industry competes primarily in the area of interest rates, products offered, customer service and convenience. 

&#160; 

Among the advantages many of the Company&#8217;s competitors have over the Company are larger asset and capital bases, the ability to finance wide-ranging advertising campaigns and to allocate their investment assets to regions of highest yield and demand. Larger companies have market presence in the form of more branch offices. The Company&#8217;s growth in number of offices has improved its ability to compete in the market. The Company believes it is able to compete with the market in terms of interest rate and level of customer service, as reflected in growth in market share. Many competitors offer certain services such as trust services, investment services and international banking that are not offered directly by the Company and, by virtue of their greater capital, most competitors will have substantially higher lending limits than those of the Company. 

&#160; 

Segments 

&#160; 

The Company acts as an independent community financial services provider and offers traditional banking and related financial services to individual, business and government customers. The Company offers a full array of commercial and retail financial services, including the taking of time, savings and demand deposits; the making of commercial, consumer, residential mortgage and home equity loans; and the providing of other financial services. 

&#160; 

Management does not separately allocate expenses, including the cost of funding loan demand, between commercial and retail operations of the Company. As such, discrete financial information is not available and segment reporting would not be meaningful. 

&#160; 

Seasonality 

&#160; 

Management does not feel that the deposits, loans, or the business of the Company are seasonal in nature. Deposit and loan generation may, however, vary with local and national economic and market conditions, but should not have a material effect on planning and policy making. 

&#160;

Embassy Bancorp, Inc. 

Supervision and Regulation 

&#160; 

The Company is subject to extensive regulation under federal and Pennsylvania banking laws, regulations and policies, including prescribed standards relating to capital, earnings, dividends, the repurchase or redemption of shares, loans or extensions of credit to affiliates and insiders, internal controls, information systems, internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, asset growth, impaired assets and loan-to-value ratios. The B ank regulatory framework is intended primarily for the protection of depositors, federal deposit insurance funds and the banking systems as a whole, and not for the protection of security holders. 

&#160; 

The following summary sets forth certain of the material elements of the regulatory framework applicable to bank holding companies and their bank subsidiaries and provides certain specific information about the Company and the Bank. It does not describe all of the provisions of the statutes, regulations and policies that are identified. To the extent that the following information describes statutory and regulatory provisions, it is qualified in its entirety by express reference to each of the particular statutory and regulatory provisions. A change in applicable statutes, regulations or regulatory policy may have a material effect on the business of the Company. 

Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act 

&#160; 

As a result of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the &#8220;Dodd-Frank Act&#8221;), which became law on July 21, 2010, there is additional regulatory oversight and supervision of the Company and the Bank. The Dodd-Frank Act significantly changed the regulation of financial institutions and the financial services industry. The Dodd-Frank Act includes, and the regulations being developed thereunder will include, provisions affecting large and small financial institutions alike, including several provisions that affect the regulations of community banks and bank holding companies. 

The Dodd-Frank Act, among other things, imposed new capital requirements on bank holding companies; changed the base for FDIC insurance assessments to a bank&#8217;s average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity, rather than upon its deposit base; permanently raised the current standard deposit insurance limit to $250,000; and expanded the FDIC&#8217;s authority to raise insurance premiums. The legislation also calls for the FDIC to raise its ratio of reserves to deposits from 1.15% to 1.35% for deposit insurance purposes by September 30, 2020 and to &#8220;offset the effect&#8221; of increased assessments on insured depository institutions with assets of less than $10 billion. 

The Dodd-Frank Act also includes provisions that affect corporate governance and executive compensation at all publicly-traded companies and allows financial institutions to pay interest on business checking accounts. The legislation also restricts proprietary trading, places restrictions on the owning or sponsoring of hedge and private equity funds, and regulates the derivatives activities of banks and their affiliates. The Dodd-Frank Act also establishes the Financial Stability Oversight Council to identify threats to the financial stability of the U.S., promote market discipline, and respond to emerging threats to the stability of the U.S. financial system. 

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau 

The Dodd-Frank Act also establishes the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the &#8220;CFPB&#8221;) as an independent entity within the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the &#8220;Federal Reserve Board&#8221;). The CFPB has broad rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement authority over consumer financial products and services, including deposit products, residential mortgages, home-equity loans and credit cards. The CFPB&#8217;s rules contain provisions on mortgage-related matters such as steering incentives, and determinations as to a borrower&#8217;s ability to repay, loan servicing, and prepayment penalties. 

On January 10, 2013, the CFPB issued a final regulation defining a &#8220;qualified mortgage&#8221; for purposes of the Dodd-Frank Act, and setting standards for mortgage lenders to determine whether a consumer has the ability to repay the mortgage. This regulation, which became effective on January 10, 2014, also affords safe harbor legal protections for lenders making qualified loans that are not &#8220;higher priced.&#8221; On January 17, 2013, the CFPB issued a final regulation containing new mortgage servicing rules applicable to our bank subsidiary, which took effect on January 10, 2014. The announced goal of the CFPB is to bring greater consumer protection to the mortgage servicing market. These changes affect notices to be given to consumers as to delinquency, foreclosure alternatives, modification applications, 

&#160;

Embassy Bancorp, Inc. 

interest rate adjustments and options for avoiding &#8220;force-placed&#8221; insurance. Servicers are prohibited from processing foreclosures when a loan modification is pending, and must wait until a loan is more than 120 days delinquent before initiating a foreclosure action. 

The servicer must provide direct and ongoing access to its personnel, and provide prompt review of any loss mitigation application. Servicers must maintain accurate and accessible mortgage records for the life of a loan and until one year after the loan is paid off or transferred. We expect these new standards to add to the cost of conducting our mortgage servicing business. 

Capital Adequacy 

In July 2013, the FDIC and the Federal Reserve approved a new rule that will substantially amend the regulatory risk based capital rules applicable to the Bank and the Company. The final rule implements the &#8220;Basel III&#8221; regulatory capital reforms and changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act. 

&#160; 

The final rule includes new minimum risk-based capital and leverage ratios, which became effective for the Bank and the Company on January 1, 2015, and refines the definition of what constitutes &#8220;capital&#8221; for purposes of calculating these ratios. The new minimum capital requirements are: (i) a new common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 to risk-based assets capital ratio of 6% (increased from 4%); (iii) a total capital ratio of 8% (unchanged from current rules); and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%. The final rule also establishes a &#8220;capital conservation buffer&#8221; of 2.5%, and will result in the following minimum ratios: (i) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.0%; (ii) a Tier 1 to risk-based assets capital ratio of 8.5%; and (iii) a total capital ratio of 10.5%. In January 2016 , t he new capital conservation buffer requirement started being phased in at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and will increase each year until fully implemented in January 2019. An institution will be subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses if its capital level falls below the buffer amount. These limitations will establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that can be utilized for such actions. 

&#160; 

In addition to the risk-based capital guidelines, the federal banking regulators established minimum leverage ratio (Tier 1 capital to total assets) guidelines for bank holding companies. These guidelines provide for a minimum leverage ratio of 3% for those bank holding companies which have the highest regulatory examination ratings and are not contemplating or experiencing significant growth or expansion. All other bank holding companies are required to maintain a leverage ratio of at least 4%. 

&#160; 

The capital ratios to be considered &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; under the new capital rules are: common equity of 6.5%, Tier 1 leverage of 5%, Tier 1 risk-based capital of 8%, and Total Risk-Based capital of 10%. 

&#160; 

At December 31, 201 5 , the Company qualified as &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; under the foregoing regulatory capital standards. See Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report. 

&#160; 

Federal Deposit Insurance (&#8220;FDI&#8221;) Act and Part 363 of the FDIC Regulations 

&#160; 

Section 36 of the FDI Act and Part 363 of the FDIC's regulations, as amended, require insured depository institutions with at least $500 million in total assets to file a Part 363 Annual Report with the applicable bank regulatory agencies, which, among other things, requires that the Company establish and mainta in an effective inte rnal control structure over financial reporting and provide an assessment by management of the institution's compliance with the designated laws and regulations pertaining to insider loans and dividend restrictions. 

&#160; 

Bank Holding Company Regulation 

&#160; 

As a bank holding company, the Company is subject to regulation and examination by the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities (the &#8220;Pennsylvania Department of Banking&#8221;) and the Federal Reserve Board. The Company is required to file with the Federal Reserve Board an annual report and such additional information as the Federal Reserve Board may require pursuant to the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the &#8220;BHC Act&#8221;). The BHC Act requires each bank holding company to obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve Board before it may acquire substantially all the assets of any bank, or before it may acquire ownership or control of any voting 

&#160;

Embassy Bancorp, Inc. 

shares of any bank if, after such acquisition, it would own or control, directly or indirectly, more than five percent of the voting shares of such bank. Such a transaction may also require approval of the Pennsylvania Department of Banking. Pennsylvania law permits Pennsylvania bank holding companies to control an unlimited number of banks. 

&#160; 

Pursuant to provisions of the BHC Act and regulations promulgated by the Federal Reserve Board thereunder, the Company may only engage in or own companies that engage in activities deemed by the Federal Reserve Board to be so closely related to the business of banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto, and the holding company must obtain permission from the Federal Reserve Board prior to engaging in most new business activities. 

&#160; 

A bank holding company and its subsidiaries are subject to certain restrictions imposed by the BHC Act on any extensions of credit to the bank or any of its subsidiaries, investments in the stock or securities thereof, and on the taking of such stock or securities as collateral for loans to any borrower. A bank holding company and its subsidiaries are also prevented from engaging in certain tie-in arrangements in connection with any extension of credit, lease or sale of property or furnishing of services. 

&#160; 

Under the Dodd-Frank Act and Federal Reserve Board regulations, a bank holding company is required to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary banks and may not conduct its operations in an unsafe or unsound manner. In addition, in serving as a source of strength to its subsidiary banks, a bank holding company should stand ready to use available resources to provide adequate capital funds to its subsidiary banks during periods of financial stress or adversity and should maintain the financial flexibility and capital-raising capacity to obtain additional resources for assisting its subsidiary banks. A bank holding company&#8217;s failure to meet its obligations to serve as a source of strength to its subsidiary banks will generally be considered by the Federal Reserve Board to be an unsafe and unsound banking practice or a violation of the Federal Reserve Board regulations or both. This doctrine is commonly known as the &#8220;source of strength&#8221; doctrine. 

&#160; 

Regulation of Embassy Bank for the Lehigh Valley 

&#160; 

Embassy Bank for the Lehigh Valley is a Pennsylvania-chartered banking institution and is subject to regulation, supervision and regular examination by the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (&#8220;FDIC&#8221;). Federal and state banking laws and regulations govern, among other things, the scope of a bank&#8217;s business, the investments a bank may make, the reserves against deposits a bank must maintain, the loans a bank makes and collateral it takes, the maximum interest rates a bank may pay on deposits, the activities of a bank with respect to mergers and consolidations, and the establishment of branches, and management practices and other aspects of banking operations. 

&#160;

Embassy Bancorp, Inc. 

Dividend Restrictions 

&#160; 

The Company is a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank. Declaration and payment of cash dividends depends upon cash dividend payments to the Company by the Bank, which is the Company&#8217;s primary source of revenue and cash flow. Accordingly, the right of the Company, and consequently the right of our creditors and shareholders, to participate in any distribution of the assets or earnings of any subsidiary is necessarily subject to the prior claims of creditors of the subsidiary, except to the extent that claims of the Company in its capacity as a creditor may be recognized. 

&#160; 

As a Pennsylvania chartered bank, the Bank is subject to regulatory restrictions on the payment and amounts of dividends under the Pennsylvania Banking Code. Further, the ability of banking subsidiaries to pay dividends is also subject to their profitability, financial condition, capital expenditures and other cash flow requirements. See Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included at Item 8 of this Report. 

&#160; 

The payment of dividends by the Bank and the Company may also be affected by other factors, such as the requirement to maintain adequate capital above regulatory guidelines. The federal banking agencies have indicated that paying dividends that deplete a depository institution&#8217;s capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice. Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991, a depository institution may not pay any dividend if payment would cause it to become undercapitalized or if it already is undercapitalized. Moreover, the federal agencies have issued policy statements that provide that bank holding companies and insured banks should generally only pay dividends out of current operating earnings. Federal banking regulators have the authority to prohibit banks and bank holding companies from paying a dividend if the regulators deem such payment to be an unsafe or unsound practice. 

&#160; 

Capital Adequacy and Operations 

&#160; 

Enacted in 1991, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (&#8220;FDICIA&#8221;) contains provisions limiting activities and business methods of depository institutions. FDICIA required the primary federal banking regulators to promulgate regulations setting forth standards relating to, among other things, internal controls and audit systems; credit underwriting and loan documentation; interest rate exposure and other off-balance sheet assets and liabilities; and compensation of directors and officers. FDICIA also provided for expanded regulation of depository institutions and their affiliates, including parent holding companies, by such institutions&#8217; primary federal banking regulator. Each primary federal banking regulator is required to specify, by regulation, capital standards for measuring the capital adequacy of the depository institutions it supervises and, depending upon the extent to which a depository institution does not meet such capital adequacy measures, the primary federal banking regulator may prohibit such institution from paying dividends or may require such institution to take other steps to become adequately capitalized. 

&#160; 

FDICIA established five capital tiers, ranging from &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; to &#8220;critically under-capitalized&#8221;. A depository institution is well capitalized if it significantly exceeds the minimum level required by regulation for each relevant capital measure. Under FDICIA, an institution that is not well capitalized is generally prohibited from accepting brokered deposits and offering interest rates on deposits higher than the prevailing rate in its market; in addition, &#8220;pass through&#8221; insurance coverage may not be available for certain employee benefit accounts. FDICIA also requires an undercapitalized depository institution to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan to the appropriate federal bank regulatory agency. One requisite element of such a plan is that the institution&#8217;s parent holding company must guarantee compliance by the institution with the plan, subject to certain limitations. In the event of the parent holding company&#8217;s bankruptcy, the guarantee, and any other commitments that the parent holding company has made to federal bank regulators to maintain the capital of its depository institution subsidiaries, would be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to priority in payment. 

&#160; 

At December 31, 2015 , the Bank qualified as &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; under these regulatory capital standards. See Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included at Item 8 of this Report. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Embassy Bancorp, Inc. 

Community Reinvestment Act 

&#160; 

Under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (&#8220;CRA&#8221;), the FDIC is required to assess the record of all financial institutions regulated by it to determine if these institutions are meeting the credit needs of the community (including low and moderate income neighborhoods) which they serve. CRA performance evaluations are based on a four-tiered rating system: Outstanding, Satisfactory, Needs to Improve and Substantial Noncompliance. CRA performance evaluations are considered in evaluating applications for such things as mergers, acquisitions and applications to open branches. The Bank has a current CRA rating of &#8220;Satisfactory.&#8221; 

Restrictions on Transactions with Affiliates and Insiders 

&#160; 

The Bank also is subject to the restrictions of Sections 23A, 23B, 22(g) and 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation O adopted by the Federal Reserve Board. Section 23A requires that loans or extensions of credit to an affiliate, purchases of securities issued by an affiliate, purchases of assets from an affiliate (except as may be exempted by order or regulation), the acceptance of securities issued by an affiliate as collateral and the issuance of a guarantee or acceptance of letters of credit on behalf of an affiliate (collectively, &#8220;Covered Transactions&#8221;) be on terms and conditions consistent with safe and sound banking practices. Section 23A also imposes quantitative restrictions on the amount of and collateralization requirements on such transactions. Section 23B requires that all Covered Transactions and certain other transactions, including the sale of securities or other assets to an affiliate and the payment of money or the furnishing of services to an affiliate, be on terms comparable to those prevailing for similar transactions with non-affiliates. 

&#160; 

Section 22(g) and 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act impose similar limitations on loans and extensions of credit from the bank to its executive officers, directors and principal shareholders and any of their related interests. The limitations restrict the terms and aggregate amount of such transactions. Regulation O implements the provisions of Sections 22(g) and 22(h) and requires maintenance of records of such transactions by the bank and regular reporting of such transactions by insiders. The FDIC also requires the bank, upon request, to disclose publicly loans and extensions of credit to insiders in excess of certain amounts. 

&#160; 

Deposit Insurance and Premiums 

&#160; 

The deposits of the Bank are insured up to applicable limits per insured depositor by the FDIC. In October 2008, the FDIC increased FDIC deposit insurance coverage per separately insured depositor for all account types to $250,000. While initially stipulated to be in effect through December 31, 2009, this increase has been subsequently extended permanently through the Dodd-Frank Act. 

&#160; 

As a FDIC member institution, the Bank&#8217;s deposits are insured to a maximum of $250,000 per depositor through the Deposit Insurance Fund (&#8220;DIF&#8221;) that is administered by the FDIC and each institution is required to pay semi-annual deposit insurance premium assessments to the FDIC. 

&#160; 

The Deposit Insurance Funds Act of 1996 recapitalized the Savings Association Insurance Fund (&#8220;SAIF&#8221;) and provided that DIF deposits would be subject to one-fifth of the assessment to which SAIF deposits are subject for FICO bond pay ments. Beginning in 2000, DIF deposits and SAIF deposits were subject to the same assessment for FICO bonds. The FICO assessment for the Bank for 2015 was $0.01 for each $100 of DIF deposits. 

&#160; 

In February 2011, the FDIC adopted final rules to implement changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act with respect to the FDIC assessment rules. In particular, the definition of an institution&#8217;s deposit insurance assessment base changed from total deposits to total assets less tangible equity. In addition, the FDIC decreased deposit insurance assessment rates, effective April 1, 2011. The revised initial base assessment rates range from 5 to 9 basis points for Risk Category I banks to 35 basis points for risk category IV banks. Risk Category II and III banks will have an initial base assessment rate of 14 or 23 basis points, respectively. The revised rates and assessment base had a positive effect by lowering the FDIC insurance assessment rate paid by the Bank. However, if the risk category of the Bank changes adversely, FDIC insurance premiums paid by the Bank could increase.

&#160; 

&#183; 

Privacy provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and related regulations, which require the Company to maintain privacy policies intended to safeguard customer financial information, to disclose the policies to the Company&#8217;s customers and to allow customers to &#8220;opt out&#8221; of having their financial service providers disclose their confidential financial information to non-affiliated third parties, subject to certain exceptions;

Effective July 1, 2010, a new federal banking rule under the Electronic Fund Transfer Act prohibited financial institutions from charging consumers fees for paying overdrafts on automated teller machines (&#8220;ATM&#8221;) and one-time debit card transactions, unless a consumer consents, or opts in, to the overdraft service for those type of transactions. If a consumer does not opt in, any ATM transaction or debit that overdraws the consumer&#8217;s account will be denied. Overdrafts on the payment of checks and regular electronic bill payments are not covered by this new rule. Before opting in, the consumer must be provided a notice that explains the financial institution&#8217;s overdraft services, including the fees associated with the service, and the consumer&#8217;s choices. Financial institutions must provide consumers who do not opt in with the same account terms, conditions and features (including pricing) that they provide to consumers who do opt in. The Company did not charge customers for these transactions, nor provide these types of services.

Governmental Policies 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s earnings are significantly affected by the monetary and fiscal policies of governmental authorities, including the Federal Reserve Board. Among the instruments of monetary policy used by the Federal Reserve Board to implement these objectives are open-market operations in U.S. Government securities and federal funds, changes in the discount rate on member bank borrowing s and changes in reserve requirements against member bank deposits. These instruments of monetary policy are used in varying combinations to influence the overall level of bank loans, investments and deposits, and the interest rates charged on loans and paid for deposits. The Federal Reserve Board frequently uses these instruments of monetary policy, especially its open-market operations and the discount rate, to influence the level of interest rates and to affect the strength of the economy, the level of inflation or the price of the dollar in foreign exchange markets. The monetary policies of the Federal Reserve Board have had a significant effect on the operating results of banking institutions in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future. It is not possible to predict the nature of future changes in monetary and fiscal policies, or the effect which they may have on the Company&#8217;s business and earnings. 

Other Legislative Initiatives 

&#160; 

Proposals may be introduced in the United States Congress and in the Pennsylvania Legislature and before various bank regulatory authorities which would alter the powers of, and restrictions on, different types of banking organizations and which would restructure part or all of the existing regulatory framework for banks, bank holding companies and other providers of financial services. Moreover, other bills may be introduced in Congress which would further regulate, deregulate or restructure the financial services industry, including proposals to substantially reform the regulatory framework. It is not possible to predict whether these or any other proposals will be enacted into law or, even if enacted, the effect which they may have on the Company&#8217;s business and earnings.
