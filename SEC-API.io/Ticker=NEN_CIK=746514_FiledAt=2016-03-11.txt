 ITEM 1. BUSINES S 

General 

New England Realty Associates Limited Partnership (&#8220;NERA&#8221; or the &#8220;Partnership&#8221;), a Massachusetts Limited Partnership, was formed on August 12, 1977 as the successor to five real estate limited partnerships (collectively, the &#8220;Colonial Partnerships&#8221;), which filed for protection under Chapter XII of the Federal Bankruptcy Act in September 1974. The bankruptcy proceedings were terminated in late 1984. In July 2004, the General Partner extended the termination date of the Partnership until 2057, as allowed in the Partnership Agreement. 

The authorized capital of the Partnership is represented by three classes of partnership units (&#8220;Units&#8221;). There are two categories of limited partnership interests (&#8220;Class A Units&#8221; and &#8220;Class B Units&#8221;) and one category of general partnership interests (the &#8220;General Partnership Units&#8221;). The Class A Units were initially issued to creditors and limited partners of the Colonial Partnerships and have been registered under Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;). Each Class A Unit is exchangeable for 30 publicly traded depositary receipts (&#8220;Receipts&#8221;), which are currently listed on the NYSE Amex Exchange and are registered under Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act. The Class B Units were issued to the original general partners of the Partnership. The General Partnership Units are held by the current general partner of the Partnership, NewReal, Inc. (the &#8220;General Partner&#8221;). The Class A Units represent an 80% ownership interest, the Class B Units represent a 19% ownership interest, and the General Partnership Units represent a 1% ownership interest. 

The Partnership is engaged in the business of acquiring, developing, holding for investment, operating and selling real estate. The Partnership, directly or through 25 subsidiary limited partnerships or limited liability companies, owns and operates various residential apartment buildings, condominium units and commercial properties located in Massachusetts and New Hampshire. As used herein, the Partnership&#8217;s subsidiary limited partnerships and limited liabilities companies are each referred to as a &#8220;Subsidiary Partnership&#8221; and are collectively referred to as the &#8220;Subsidiary Partnerships.&#8221; 

The Partnership owns between a 99.67 % and 100% interest in each of the Subsidiary Partnerships, except in nine limited liability companies (the &#8220;Investment Properties&#8221; or &#8220;Joint Ventures&#8221;) in which the Partnership has between a 40% and 50% ownership interest. The majority shareholder of the General Partner indirectly owns between 43.2 % and 57 %, the President of Hamilton owns between 2.5 % and 4.5 %, and five other management employees of Hamilton own collectively between 0% and 2.3 %, respectively of Joint Ventures . The Partnership&#8217;s interest in the Investment Properties is accounted for on the equity method in the Consolidated Financial Statements. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements&#8212;&#8220;Principles of Consolidation.&#8221; See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements&#8212;&#8220;Investment in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures&#8221; for a description of the properties and their operations. Of those Subsidiary Partnerships not wholly owned by the Partnership, except for the Investment Properties, the remaining ownership interest is held by an unaffiliated third party. In each such case, the third party has entered into an agreement with the Partnership, pursuant to which any benefit derived from its ownership interest in the applicable Subsidiary Partnerships will be returned to the Partnership. &#160; 

The long &#8209;term goals of the Partnership are to manage, rent and improve its properties and to acquire additional properties with income and capital appreciation potential as suitable opportunities arise. When appropriate, the Partnership may sell or refinance selected properties. Proceeds from any such sales or refinancing will be used to reduce debt, reinvested in acquisitions of other properties, distributed to the partners, repurchase equity interests, or used for operating expenses or reserves, as determined by the General Partner. 

&#160;

Operations of the Partnership 

The Partnership is managed by the General Partner, NewReal, Inc., a Massachusetts corporation wholly owned by Harold Brown and Ronald Brown. The General Partner has engaged The Hamilton Company, Inc. (the &#8220;Hamilton Company&#8221; or &#8220;Hamilton&#8221;) to perform general management functions for the Partnership&#8217;s properties in exchange for management fees. The Hamilton Company is wholly owned by Harold Brown and employs Ronald Brown and Harold Brown. The Partnership, Subsidiary Partnerships, and the Investment Properties currently contract with the management company for 52 individuals at the Properties and 10 individuals at the Joint Ventures who are primarily involved in the supervision and maintenance of specific properties. The General Partner has no employees. 

As of February 1, 201 6 , the Partnership and its Subsidiary Partnerships owned 2,506 residential apartment units in 2 1 residential and mixed &#8209;use complexes (collectively, the &#8220;Apartment Complexes&#8221;). The Partnership also owns 19 condominium units in a residential condominium complex, all of which are leased to residential tenants (collectively referred to as the &#8220;Condominium Units&#8221;). The Apartment Complexes, the Condominium Units and the Investment Properties are located primarily in the metropolitan Boston area of Massachusetts. 

As of February 1, 201 6 , the Subsidiary Partnerships also owned a commercial shopping center in Framingham, Massachusetts, one commercial building in Newton and one in Brookline, Massachusetts and commercial space in mixed &#8209; use buildings in Boston, Brockton and Newton, Massachusetts. These properties are referred to collectively as the &#8220;Commercial Properties.&#8221; See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included as a part of this Form 10 &#8209;K. 

Additionally, as of February 1, 201 6 , the Partnership owned a 40 &#8209;50% interest in 9 residential and mixed use complexes, the Investment Properties, with a total of 788 residential units, one commercial unit, and a 50 car parking lot. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these investments. 

The Apartment Complexes, Investment Properties, Condominium Units and Commercial Properties are referred to collectively as the &#8220;Properties.&#8221; 

Harold Brown and, in certain cases, Ronald Brown, and officers and employees of the Hamilton Company own or have owned interests in certain of the Properties, Subsidiary Partnerships and Joint Ventures. See &#8220;Item 13. Certain Relationships, Related Transactions and Director Independence.&#8221; 

The leasing of real estate in the metropolitan Boston area of Massachusetts is highly competitive. The Apartment Complexes, Condominium Units and the Investment Properties must compete for tenants with other residential apartments and condominium units in the areas in which they are located. The Commercial Properties must compete for commercial tenants with other shopping malls and office buildings in the areas in which they are located. Thus, the level of competition at each Property depends on how many other similarly situated properties are in its vicinity. See &#8220;Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Factors that May Affect Future Results.&#8221; 

The Second Amended and Restated Contract of Limited Partnership of the Partnership (the &#8220;Partnership Agreement&#8221;) authorizes the General Partner to acquire real estate and real estate related investments from or in participation with either or both of Harold Brown and Ronald Brown, or their affiliates, upon the satisfaction of certain terms and conditions, including the approval of the Partnership&#8217;s Advisory Committee and limitations on the price paid by the Partnership for such investments. The Partnership Agreement also permits the Partnership&#8217;s limited partners and the General Partner to make loans to the Partnership, subject to certain limitations on the rate of interest that may be charged to the Partnership. Except for the foregoing, the Partnership does not have any policies prohibiting any limited partner, General Partner or any other person from having any direct or indirect pecuniary interest in any investment to be acquired or disposed of by the Partnership or in any transaction to which the Partnership is a party or has an interest in or from engaging, for their own account, in business activities of the types conducted or to be conducted by the Partnership. The General Partner is not limited in the number or amount of mortgages which may be placed on any Property, nor is there a policy limiting the percentage of Partnership assets which may be invested in any specific Property. 

&#160;

In February 201 6 , the Partnership approved a quarterly distribution of $7.50 per Unit ($0.25 per Receipt), payable on March 31, 201 6 . In 201 5 the Partnership paid four quarterly distributions of an aggregate $30.00 per Unit ($1.00 per Receipt) for a total payment of $ 3,785,883 &#160; in 201 5 . In 201 4 , the Partnership paid four quarterly distributions of an aggregate of $30.00 per Unit ($1.00 per Receipt) for a total payment of $ 3,858,386 . 

On August 20, 2007, NewReal, Inc., the General Partner authorized an equity repurchase program (&#8220;Repurchase Program&#8221;) under which the Partnership was permitted to purchase, over a period of twelve months, up to 300,000 Depositary Receipts (each of which is one &#8209;tenth of a Class A Unit). On January 15, 2008, the General Partner authorized an increase in the Repurchase Program from 300,000 to 600,000 Depositary Receipts. On January 30, 2008 the General Partner authorized an increase in the Repurchase Program from 600,000 to 900,000 Depositary Receipts. On March 6, 2008, the General Partner authorized the increase in the total number of Depositary Receipts that could be repurchased pursuant to the Repurchase Program from 900,000 to 1,500,000. On August 8, 2008, the General Partner reauthorized and renewed the Repurchase Program for an additional 12 &#8209;month period ended August 19, 2009. On March 22, 2010, the General Partner re &#8209;authorized and renewed the Repurchase Program that expired on August 19, 2009. Under the terms of the renewed Repurchase Program, the Partnership may purchase up to 1,500,000 Depositary Receipts from the start of the program in 2007 through March 31, 2015. On March 10, 2015, the General Partner authorized an increase in the Repurchase Program from 1,500,000 to 2,000,000 Depository Receipts and extended the Program for an additional five years from March 31, 2015 until March 31, 2020. The Repurchase Program requires the Partnership to repurchase a proportionate number of Class B Units and General Partner Units in connection with any repurchases of any Depositary Receipts by the Partnership based upon the 80%, 19% and 1% fixed distribution percentages of the holders of the Class A, Class B and General Partner Units under the Partnership&#8217;s Second Amended and Restate Contract of Limited Partnership. Repurchases of Depositary Receipts or Partnership Units pursuant to the Repurchase Program may be made by the Partnership from time to time in its sole discretion in open market transactions or in privately negotiated transactions. From August 20, 2007 through December 31, 201 5 , the Partnership has repurchased 1,341,598 Depositary Receipts at an average price of $ 26.63 per receipt (or $ 798.90 &#160; per underlying Class A Unit), 2,88 5 &#160; Class B Units and 152 General Partnership Units, both at an average price of $ 877.1 4 &#160; per Unit, totaling approximately $ 38,596 ,000 including brokerage fees paid by the Partnership. 

Property Transactions 

In May 2013 the Partnership sold the Nashoba Apartments located in Acton, Massachusetts. The sale price was $4,300,000; the net proceeds of approximately $2,100,000 were transferred to Investment Property Exchange Services, Inc. a Qualified Intermediary. These funds were held by the intermediary in order to maintain the Partnership&#8217;s ability to structure a tax free exchange in accordance with the Internal Revenue Service&#8217;s rules under Sec. 1031. The gain on the sale in accordance with GAAP is approximately $3,679,000. The proceeds were subsequently used in the acquisition of the Hamilton Green apartments described below. 

On July 15, 2013, Hamilton Green Apartments, LLC, a newly formed subsidiary of the Partnership, purchased Windsor Green at Andover, a 193 unit apartment complex located at 311 and 319 Lowell Street, Andover, Massachusetts. The purchase price was $62,500,000. From the purchase price, the Partnership allocated approximately $1,656,000 to the value of the in &#8209;place leases and approximately $96,000 to the value of the tenant relationships. These amounts are amortized over 12 and 36 months respectively. To fund this purchase, the Partnership obtained short term financing of approximately $40,000,000, used the funds of approximately $2,100,000 from the like kind exchange of the Nashoba Apartments, and the balance from the Partnership&#8217;s cash reserves. The closing costs associated with this short term financing were approximately $38,000. The original mortgage matured in November 2013. On December 20, 2013, the Partnership refinanced the mortgage on Hamilton Green. The current mortgage is $38,500,000; interest is fixed at 

&#160;

4.67% for 15 years, interest only for 2 years and is amortized on a 30 year schedule for the balance of the term. This refinancing required an additional $1,846,000 in capital from the Partnership. The closing costs associated with this refinancing were approximately $346,000. 

On September 18, 2015, Residences at Captain Parkers LLC, a newly formed subsidiary of the Partnership, purchased the Residence at Captain Parkers, a 94 unit apartment complex located at 125 Worthen Road and Ryder Lane in Lexington, Massachusetts. The purchase price was $31,600,000 and the closing costs were approximately $49,000. From the purchase price, the Partnership allocated approximately $474,000 for in-place leases, and approximately $31,000 to the value of tenant relationships. These amounts are being amortized over 12 and 24 months respectively. To fund the purchase, the Partnership utilized the available line of credit of $25,000,000, and the balance from the Partnership&#8217;s cash reserves. 

&#160; 

During 201 5 , the Partnership and its Subsidiary Partnerships completed improvements to certain of the Properties at a total cost of approximately $ 6,694 ,000. These improvements were funded from cash reserves and, to some extent, escrow accounts established in connection with the financing or refinancing of the applicable Properties. These sources have been adequate to fully fund improvements. The most significant improvements were made at Westgate Apartments, 62 Boylston Street , Westside Colonial, Executive Apartments, River Drive Apartments, and Hamilton Oaks at a cost of approximately $ 1,349 ,000, $ 697 ,000, $ 647 ,000, $ 632 ,000, $ 603 ,000 and $ 592 ,000 respectively. The Partnership plans to invest approximately $ 3,517 ,000 in capital improvements in 201 6 . 

Line of Credit 

On July 31, 2014, the Partnership entered into an agreement for a $25,000,000 revolving line of credit. The term of the line is three years with a floating interest rate equal to a base rate of the greater of (a) the Prime Rate (b) the Federal Funds Rate plus one &#8209;half of one percent per annum, or (c) the LIBOR Rate for a period of one month plus 1% per annum, plus an applicable margin of 2.5% to 3.5%. The costs associated with the line of credit were approximately $1 25 ,000 . &#160; As of December 31, 2015, &#160; the credit line had a balance of $25,000,000. The interest rate on the line of credit at December 31, &#160; 2015 is 3.875%. 

On September 15, 2015, the Partnership, in connection with the purchase of the Residence at Captain Parker Apartments, used the entire line of credit, along with cash reserve s , to purchase the property. (See Note 2: Rental Properties, for the details of the transaction.) In January, 2016, the Partnership obtained a mortgage on the Residences at Captain Parker. The Partnership used the proceeds from the loan and cash reserves to pay down the line of credit balance to zero. See Note 18, SUBSEQUENT EVENTS, for the details of the repayment. 

The line of credit may be used for acquisition, refinancing, improvements, working capital and other needs of the Partnership. The line may not be used to pay distributions, make distributions or acquire equity interests of the Partnership. 

The line of credit is collateralized by varying percentages of the Partnership&#8217;s ownership interest in 23 of its subsidiary properties and joint ventures. Pledged interests range from 49% to 100% of the Partnership&#8217;s ownership interest in the respective entities. 

The Partnership paid fees to secure the line of credit. Any unused balance of the line of credit is subject to a fee ranging from 15 to 20 basis points per annum. The Part nership paid approximately $36,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015. 

The line of credit agreement has several covenants, such as providing cash flow projections and compliance certificates, as well as other financial information. The covenants include, but are not limited to the following: maintain a leverage ratio that does not exceed 65%; aggregate increase in indebtedness of the subsidiaries and joint ventures should not exceed $15,000,000; maintain a tangible net worth (as defined in the agreement) of a minimum of $150,000,000; a minimum ratio of net operating income to total indebtedness of at least 9.5%; debt service coverage ratio of at least 1.6 to 1, as well as other items. 

&#160;

The Partnership is in compliance with these covenants as of December 31, 2015.
