 Item 1. Business. 

The Company. We are an internally managed and self-advised real estate investment trust, or REIT, engaged in the ownership and operation primarily of office buildings throughout the United States. We were formed in 1986 under Maryland law and we have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code). 

At December 31, 2015 , our portfolio included 65 &#32;properties ( 127 &#32;buildings) with a combined 24.0 million &#32;square feet for a total investment of $3.9 billion &#32;at cost and a depreciated book value of $3.0 billion . Following our transition from external management to internal management in 2014, we undertook a comprehensive review of our portfolio and our operations and developed a strategy that focuses on reshaping our portfolio to higher quality assets. We are in the process of executing this strategy and disposed of 91 &#32;properties ( 135 &#32;buildings) and one land parcel during 2015, with a combined 18.9 million &#32;square feet for an aggregate gross sales price of $2.0 billion, excluding closing costs. As a result of these dispositions, we have concentrated our portfolio, exiting 68 cities, seven states and one country. 

We have generated significant proceeds from dispositions and have a cash balance of $1.8 billion as of December 31, 2015. We are seeking to reinvest capital in opportunities that offer a compelling risk-reward profile in order to create a foundation for long-term growth. We also remain focused on creating value through proactive asset management and improving operating results. 

As of December 31, 2015, we had 66 full-time employees. 

Our principal executive offices are located at Two North Riverside Plaza, Suite 2100, Chicago, Illinois 60606, and our telephone number is (312) 646-2800. 

Policies with Respect to Certain Activities 

The discussion below sets forth certain additional information regarding our investment, disposition and financing policies. These policies are established by our Board of Trustees and may be changed by our Board of Trustees at any time without shareholder approval. 

Investment Policies. In evaluating potential investments and asset sales, we consider various factors, including but not limited to the following: 

&#8226; 

the historical and projected rents received and likely to be received from the property; 

&#8226; 

the historical and expected operating expenses, including real estate taxes, incurred and expected to be incurred at the property; 

&#8226; 

the growth, tax and regulatory environments of the market in which the property is located; 

&#8226; 

the quality, experience and credit worthiness of the property's tenants; 

&#8226; 

occupancy and demand for similar properties in the same or nearby markets; 

&#8226; 

the construction quality, physical condition and design of the property, and expected capital expenditures that may be needed to be made to the property; 

&#8226; 

the location and type of property; and 

&#8226; 

the pricing of comparable properties as evidenced by recent market sales. 

We have no policies which specifically limit the percentage of our assets which may be invested in any individual property, in any one type of property, in properties in one geographic area, in properties leased to any one tenant or in properties leased to an affiliated group of tenants. 

We generally prefer 100% owned investments in fee interests. However, circumstances may arise in which we may invest in leaseholds, joint ventures, mortgages and other real estate interests. We may invest in real estate joint ventures if we conclude 

that by doing so we may benefit from the participation of co-venturers or that our opportunity to participate in the investment is contingent on the use of a joint venture structure. We may invest in participating, convertible or other types of mortgages if we conclude that by doing so we may benefit from the cash flow or appreciation in the value of a property which is not available for purchase. Further, we have in the past provided seller financing for properties we have sold and may do so again in the future. 

In the past, we have considered the possibility of entering into mergers or strategic combinations with other companies. We may undertake such considerations in the future. A principal goal of any such transaction will be to increase our profits and diversify their sources. 

Disposition Policies. We have completed a significant number of dispositions over the past two years and currently anticipate disposing of a significant number of our properties as part of our business strategy to reposition our portfolio. 

Our Board of Trustees adopted a strategy to consider disposing of assets that have one or more of the following attributes: 

&#8226; 

assets that do not offer an opportunity to create a competitive advantage, 

&#8226; 

assets that are less than 150,000 square feet, 

&#8226; 

assets that are not office buildings, 

&#8226; 

assets that are not located in the U.S., or 

&#8226; 

assets that produce a low cash yield or require significant capital expenditures. 

Disposition decisions are made based on a number of factors including those set forth above and the following: 

&#8226; 

the proposed sale price; and 

&#8226; 

the existence of alternative sources, uses or needs for capital. 

The ability of our management team to implement this business strategy depends substantially on identifying and completing dispositions at favorable prices and successfully redeploying the capital received from dispositions. We expect to reinvest capital received from dispositions we complete but cannot provide any assurances that we will be successful. In addition, it may take a long period of time before we are able to reposition our portfolio. 

Financing Policies. Our revolving credit facility and term loan agreements and our debt indenture and its supplements contain financial covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to incur indebtedness and require us to maintain certain financial ratios and a minimum net worth. Our Board of Trustees may determine to seek additional capital through equity offerings, debt financings, retention of cash flows in excess of distributions to shareholders or a combination of these methods. Some of our properties are encumbered by mortgages. To the extent that our Board of Trustees decides to obtain additional debt financing, we may do so on an unsecured basis or a secured basis, subject to limitations in existing financing or other contractual arrangements; we may seek to obtain other lines of credit or to issue securities senior to our common and/or preferred shares, including preferred shares or debt securities which may be convertible into common shares or be accompanied by warrants to purchase common shares; or we may engage in transactions which involve a sale or other conveyance of properties to affiliated or unaffiliated entities. We may finance acquisitions by an exchange of properties, by borrowing under our credit facility, by assuming outstanding mortgage debt on the acquired properties, by the issuance of additional equity or debt securities or by using retained cash flow from operations which may exceed our earnings. The proceeds from any of our financings may be used to pay distributions, to provide working capital, to refinance existing indebtedness or to finance acquisitions and expansions of existing or new properties. We may from time to time re-evaluate and modify our financing policies in light of then current market conditions, relative availability and costs of debt and equity capital, the changing values of properties, growth and acquisition opportunities and other factors, and we may increase or decrease our ratio of debt to total capitalization. 

Competition. Investing in and operating office real estate is a highly competitive business. We compete against other REITs, numerous financial institutions, individuals and public and private companies who are actively engaged in this business. Also, we compete for tenants and investments based on a number of factors including pricing, underwriting criteria and reputation. Our ability to successfully compete is also impacted by economic and population trends, availability of acceptable investment opportunities, our ability to negotiate beneficial leasing and investment terms, availability and cost of capital and new and existing laws and regulations. Some of our competitors are dominant in selected geographic markets, including in markets in which we operate. Many of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we have. 

For additional information on competition and the risks associated with our business, please see "Risk Factors" in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Environmental and Climate Change Matters. Under various environmental, health and safety laws, owners and operators, including tenants of real estate may be subject to liabilities resulting from the presence of hazardous substances, waste or petroleum products at, on, under, or emanating from such property, including costs for investigating and remediating or removing hazardous substances present at or migrating from such properties, liabilities for property damage or personal injuries, natural resource damages, and costs and losses arising from property use restrictions or diminution in value. We, or our tenants, also may incur liability for failing to comply with environmental, health and safety laws. We do not believe that there are environmental conditions or issues at any of our properties that have had or will have a material adverse effect on us. However, no assurances can be given that conditions or issues are not present at our properties or that costs we may be required to incur in the future to remediate contamination or comply with environmental, health and safety laws will not have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition. 

We estimate the cost to remove hazardous substances or address environmental issues at some of our properties based in part on environmental surveys conducted on our properties. 

Some of our properties have been or may be impacted by releases of hazardous substances or petroleum products. Such contamination may arise from a variety of sources, including historic uses of our properties for commercial or industrial purposes, spills of such materials at adjacent properties, or releases from tanks used on our properties to store petroleum or hazardous substances. In addition, certain of our properties are on sites upon which or are adjacent to or near other properties upon which others, including former owners or tenants, have engaged, or may in the future engage, in activities that may release petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances. Though we have reviewed these and our other properties for potential environmental liabilities, we cannot assure that we have identified all potential environmental liabilities. 

Certain of our buildings contain asbestos. We believe any asbestos in our buildings is contained in accordance with current regulations. If we remove the asbestos or renovate or demolish these properties, certain environmental regulations govern the manner in which the asbestos must be handled and removed, which could result in increased costs. 

For more information regarding environmental matters and their possible adverse impact on us, see "Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business-We could incur significant costs and liabilities with respect to environmental matters&#8221; in Part I, Item 1A. 

The current political debate about climate change has resulted in various treaties, laws and regulations which are intended to limit carbon emissions. We believe these laws being enacted or proposed may cause energy costs at our properties to increase, but we do not expect the direct impact of these increases to be material to our results of operations because the increased costs either would be the responsibility of our tenants directly or in large part may be passed through by us to our tenants as additional lease payments. Although we do not believe it is likely in the foreseeable future, laws enacted to mitigate climate change may make some of our buildings obsolete or cause us to make material investments in our properties which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition. We continuously study ways to improve the energy efficiency at all of our properties. For more information regarding climate change matters and their possible adverse impact on us, see "Risk Factors&#8212;Risks Related to Our Business&#8212;We may be adversely affected by laws, regulations or other issues related to climate change" in Part I, Item 1A and "Management's Discussion and Analysis&#8212;Impact of Climate Change" in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
