 Item 1. Business 

&#160;

Kaanapali Land, LLC (&#34;Kaanapali Land&#34;), a Delaware limited liability company, is the reorganized entity resulting from the Joint Plan of Reorganization of Amfac Hawaii, LLC (now known as KLC Land Company, LLC (&#34;KLC Land&#34;)), certain of its subsidiaries (together with KLC Land, the &#34;KLC Debtors&#34;) and FHT Corporation (&#34;FHTC&#34; and, together with the KLC Debtors, the &#34;Debtors&#34;) under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, dated June 11, 2002 (as amended, the &#34;Plan&#34;). As indicated in the Plan, Kaanapali Land has elected to be taxable as a corporation.

&#160;

The Plan was confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court by orders dated July 29, 2002 and October 30, 2002 (collectively, the &#34;Order&#34;) and became effective November 13, 2002 (the &#34;Plan Effective Date&#34;). During August 2005, pursuant to a motion for entry of final decree, the bankruptcy cases were closed. References in this Form 10-K to Kaanapali Land or the Company for dates on or after the Plan Effective Date are to the entity surviving the Plan Effective Date under the Plan and for dates before the Plan Effective Date are to predecessor entities, unless otherwise specified.

&#160;

KLC Land (formerly known as Amfac Hawaii, LLC and, previously, Amfac/JMB Hawaii, LLC) is a Hawaii limited liability company that is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Kaanapali Land. KLC Land and Kaanapali Land have continued the businesses formerly conducted by KLC Land and Northbrook Corporation, a Delaware corporation (&#34;Northbrook&#34;) and their subsidiaries prior to the bankruptcy, although some of such businesses have been discontinued or reduced in scope as described herein.

&#160;

Northbrook was formed in 1978 as a holding company to facilitate the purchase of a number of businesses, generally relating to short line railroads, rail car leasing and light manufacturing. Over 90% of the stock of Northbrook was purchased by persons and entities affiliated with JMB Realty Corporation, through a series of stock purchases in 1987 and 1988. One of Northbrook's subsidiaries (later merged into Northbrook) purchased the stock of Amfac, Inc. (&#34;Amfac&#34;), in 1988, pursuant to a public tender offer, and thus Amfac became an indirect subsidiary of Northbrook at such time. As a consequence of the merger of Amfac into Northbrook in 1995, KLC Land, FHTC and Amfac's other direct subsidiaries became direct subsidiaries of Northbrook. All existing shareholders of Northbrook contributed their shares to Pacific Trail Holdings, LLC (&#34;Pacific Trail&#34;) in 2000. Pursuant to the Plan, Northbrook was merged into FHTC and FHTC was thereafter merged into Kaanapali Land in November 2002.

&#160;

Kaanapali Land's subsidiaries include the Debtors as reorganized under the Plan, certain subsidiaries of KLC Land that were not debtors (the &#34;Non-Debtor KLC Subsidiaries&#34;) and other former subsidiaries of Northbrook (collectively with Kaanapali Land, all the Reorganized Debtors, the Non-Debtor KLC Subsidiaries and such other subsidiaries are referred to herein as the &#34;Company&#34;).

&#160;

The Company operates in two primary business segments: (i) Property and (ii) Agriculture. The Company operates through a number of subsidiaries, each of which is owned directly or indirectly by Kaanapali Land, LLC.

&#160;

Material aspects of the history and business of the Company, the Plan, the procedures for consummating the Plan and the risks attendant thereto were set forth in a Second Amended Disclosure Statement With Respect to Joint Plan of Reorganization of Amfac Hawaii, LLC, Certain of Its Subsidiaries and FHT Corporation Under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, dated June 11, 2002 (the &#34;Disclosure Statement&#34;). The Disclosure Statement and the Plan are each filed as Exhibits to Kaanapali Land's Form 10 filed on May 1, 2003 and incorporated herein by reference.

4&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

All claims against the Debtors were deemed discharged as of the Plan Effective Date.

&#160;

The Limited Liability Company Agreement of Kaanapali Land (the &#34;LLC Agreement&#34;) provided for two classes of membership interests, &#34;Class A Shares&#34; and &#34;Class B Shares&#34;, which had substantially identical rights and economic value under the LLC Agreement; except that holders of Class A Shares were represented by a &#34;Class A Representative&#34; who was required to approve certain transactions proposed by Kaanapali Land before they could be undertaken. The Class A Representative was further entitled to receive certain reports from the Company and meet with Company officials on a periodic basis. Reference is made to the LLC Agreement for a more detailed discussion of these provisions. Class B Shares were held by Pacific Trail and various entities and individuals that are affiliated or otherwise associated with Pacific Trail. Class A Shares were issued under the Plan to claimants who had no such affiliation. Reference is made to Item 10 below for a further explanation of the LLC Agreement.

&#160;

Kaanapali Land distributed in the aggregate, approximately $1.8 million in cash and approximately 161,100 Class A Shares on account of the claims that were made under the Plan and has no further obligations to make any further distributions under the Plan.

&#160;

Kaanapali Land issued all Class B Shares required to be issued under the Plan to Pacific Trail and those entities and individuals that were entitled to Class B Shares. As a consequence, Kaanapali Land had approximately 1,631,513 Class B Shares outstanding.

&#160;

Pursuant to the LLC Agreement, the Class A Shares and Class B Shares were automatically redesignated as Common Shares on November 15, 2007. Accordingly, the Company's Class A Shares and Class B Shares ceased to exist separately on November 15, 2007. On April 15, 2008, the Company entered into an agreement with Stephen Lovelette (&#34;Lovelette&#34;), an executive vice president of the Company in charge of the Company's development activities, whereby the Company agreed to issue up to 52,000 shares of a new class of common shares (the &#34;Class C Shares&#34;) in consideration for his services to the Company. The Class C Shares have the same rights as the Shares except that the Class C Shares will not participate in any distributions until the holders of the Shares have received aggregate distributions equal to $19 per Share, subject to customary antidilution adjustments. As of December 31, 2015, the Company had 1,792,613 Common shares and 52,000 Class C Shares Outstanding.

&#160;

KLC Land is the direct subsidiary of Kaanapali Land through which the Company conducts substantially all of its remaining operations. KLC Land conducts substantially all of its business through various subsidiaries. Those with remaining assets of significant net value include KLC Holding Corp. (&#34;KLC&#34;), Pioneer Mill Company, LLC (&#34;PMCo&#34;), Kaanapali Land Management Corp. (&#34;KLM&#34; fka Kaanapali Development Corp.) and PM Land Company, LLC. In 2013, the Kaanapali Coffee Farms Lot Owners&#8217; Association was consolidated with the interests of third party owners reflected as non controlling interests.

&#160;

All dollar amounts are in thousands of dollars unless otherwise noted.

&#160;

Property 

&#160;

On January 7, 2016 KLC Holding Corp. (&#8220;KLC&#8221;) and various of its subsidiaries (&#8220;KLC Subsidiaries&#8221;) entered into a sales agreement (&#8220;KLC Sales Agreement&#8221;) with an unrelated third party for the sale of substantially all of the remaining real property and related assets of the Registrant on the island of Maui, along with the stock and membership interests of certain KLC Subsidiaries (the &#8220;KLC Sales Property&#8221;). The KLC Sales Agreement called for a scheduled sales price for the KLC Sales Property of approximately $95 million, before costs of sale, as adjusted for certain revenues and expenditures of the KLC Subsidiaries.

&#160;

By virtue of the buyer&#8217;s failure to deliver its &#8220;Acceptance Notice&#8221; prior to the expiration of the &#8220;Due Diligence Period&#8221; in accordance with the terms of the KLC Sales Agreement, the KLC Sales Agreement terminated. On July 8, 2016, the buyer asked the escrow agent to return buyer&#8217;s deposit.

&#160;

On December 23, 2015 Pioneer Mill Company, LLC entered into a property sales agreement with an unrelated third party for the sale of the Pioneer Mill Site (&#8220;Mill Site Sales Agreement&#8221;) which called for a sales price of $20.5 million (before costs of sale, including commissions) and had a scheduled closing date of May 31, 2016, as extended. On April 19, 2016, the buyer gave notice they would not be proceeding with the purchase and thereby terminated the Mill Site Sales Agreement.

&#160;

Project Planning and Development. The Company's real estate development approach, for land that it holds for development rather than investment, is designed to enhance the value of its properties in phases. In most instances, the process begins with the preparation of market and feasibility studies that consider potential uses for the property, as well as costs associated with those uses. The studies consider factors such as location, physical characteristics, demographic patterns, anticipated absorption rates, transportation, infrastructure costs, both on site and offsite, and regulatory and environmental requirements.

&#160;

For any property targeted for development, the Company will generally prepare a land plan that is consistent with the findings of the studies and then commence the process of applying for the entitlements necessary to permit the use of the property in accordance with the land plan. The length and difficulty of obtaining the requisite entitlements by government agencies, as well as the cost of complying with any conditions attached to the entitlements, are significant factors in determining the viability of the Company's projects. Applications for entitlements may include, among other things, applications for state land use reclassification, county community plan amendments, changes in zoning, and if applicable, subdivision.

6&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Kaanapali 2020. The Company's developable lands are located on the west side of the Island of Maui in the State of Hawaii. The majority of the developable lands are located near to the Kaanapali resort area. The Kaanapali development lands have been the subject of a community-based planning process that commenced in 1999 for the Kaanapali 2020 Development Plan. The Kaanapali 2020 Development Plan includes a mix of residential (including workforce affordable housing), commercial, quasi-public facilities, recreation, agriculture, rural, and open space. While the oceanfront resort properties have been sold, most of the other Kaanapali 2020 lands continue to be owned by the Company. Any development plan for any of the Company's land, including the Kaanapali 2020 Development Plan and the Wainee development, will be subject to approval and regulation by various state and county agencies and governing entities, especially insofar as the nature and extent of zoning, and improvements necessary for site infrastructure, building, transportation, water management, environmental and health are concerned. In Hawaii, the governmental entities may impose limits or controls on growth in their communities during the review and consideration of the various entitlement process mainly through restrictive conditions, including limitations on density, impact fees, infrastructure contribution, among others, all of which may materially affect utilization of the land and the costs associated with developing the land. In addition, Maui County currently requires certain percentages and levels of affordability to be included in proposed residential developments or subdivisions of land, thereby affecting the feasibility of these projects. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in obtaining the necessary zoning and related entitlements for development of any currently unentitled Maui lands. At this time, the only Kaanapali 2020 lands that have sufficient entitlements to commence development are those in Phase I of the Kaanapali Coffee Farms development and the Puukolii Village development, as described below.

&#160;

The current regulatory approval process for a development project takes a number of years or more and involves substantial expense. The applications generally require the submission of comprehensive plans that involve the use of consultants and other professionals. A substantial portion of the Company's Kaanapali 2020 land will require state district boundary amendments and county general plan and community plan amendments, as well as rezoning approvals. There is no assurance that all necessary approvals and permits will be obtained with respect to the current projects or future projects of the Company. Generally, entitlements are extremely difficult to obtain in Hawaii. There is often significant opposition to proposed developments from numerous local groups, environmental organizations, various community and civic groups, condominium associations and politicians advocating no-growth policies, among others. Any such group with standing can challenge submitted applications, which may substantially delay the process. Generally, once the applications are deemed acceptable, the various governing agencies involved in the entitlement process commence consideration of the requested entitlements. The applicable agencies often impose conditions, which may be costly and time consuming, on any approvals of the entitlements. The substantial time and expense of obtaining entitlements and the uncertainty of success in obtaining the entitlements could have a material adverse effect on the Company's success.

&#160;

At the state level, all land in Hawaii is divided into four land use classifications: urban, rural, agricultural and conservation. The majority of the Kaanapali 2020 Development Plan land is currently classified as either agricultural or conservation.

&#160;

7&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

A relatively small portion (approximately 300 acres) of the Kaanapali 2020 Development Planning area owned by the Company, known as Puukolii Village, comprised of two parcels known as the Puukolii Triangle and Puukolii Mauka, received entitlements in 1993 under the terms of a superseded law that fast tracked entitlements for planned mixed use developments that contained the requisite percentage of affordable housing units. The requirements imposed on the Company relative to these entitlements proved uneconomic and thus the developments were not pursued. The Company proposed revisions to certain entitlement conditions as well as the development agreement with the applicable state agencies and is beginning to plan for the development of the Puukolii Mauka area, which will, if ultimately developed, include certain affordable and market housing units, a small commercial area, a school, a park and associated improvements. From 2007 through 2009, the Company received various approvals of its proposed revisions of entitlement conditions and of the development agreement including the addition of the County housing department as an added party.

&#160;

Despite the hurdles mentioned above, the Company remains hopeful that it will generally be able to develop that portion of its land for which it can obtain classification as an urban district from the State Land Use Commission. However, it is uncertain whether the Company will be able to obtain all necessary entitlements or, if so, how long it will take, and it cannot be predicted what the market will be for such land (or the associated development costs) at such time. Conservation land is land that has been considered by the state as necessary for preserving natural conditions as well as to protect water resources and cannot be developed. Lands within agricultural and rural districts have limited development potential, especially as it relates to density and use. Pursuant to the Kaanapali 2020 Development Plan, the Company intends to apply to the State Land Use Commission for reclassification of a portion of the agricultural lands to urban, and perhaps some rural, but does not intend to apply for reclassification of the conservation lands.

&#160;

During 2012, Maui County updated its General Plan which projects general growth of the County over the next few decades. This update included a new component with maps which show directed growth areas. The County of Maui recognized the Kaanapali 2020 Development Plan and Wainee Development Plan to be within the urban growth limits identified in these directed growth maps. Development of the Kaanapali 2020 lands in accordance with the Kaanapali 2020 Development Plan will require, in addition to State Land Use reclassification of some of the land from agriculture to urban, appropriate designation under County community plan, and the appropriate County zoning designation included in the Maui County General Plan noting it as an urban growth area. Obtaining any and all of these approvals can involve a substantial amount of time and expense, and approvals may need to be resubmitted if there is any subsequent, material deviation in current approved plans or significant objections by the responsible government agencies.

&#160;

In connection with any successful petition to change any of the various land use classifications (state land use district, county community plan, county zoning) of the Kaanapali 2020 Development Plan, the Company may be required to make significant improvements in public facilities (such as roads), to dedicate property for public use, to provide employee/affordable housing units and to make other concessions, monetary or otherwise. The ability of the Company to perform its development activities may also be adversely affected by restrictions that may be imposed by government agencies and the surrounding communities because of inadequate public facilities, such as roads, water management areas and sewer facilities, and by local opposition to continued growth. However, as part of the Kaanapali 2020 Development Plan, the Company has included a number of community members and local government officials in the development planning process and has earned significant community support for its preliminary Kaanapali 2020 and Wainee development plans. It also believes that it enjoys general local community support for its new Puukolii Mauka concept. The Company hopes that carrying on with this process will continue to generate substantial support from local government and the community for the Company's development plans.

8&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

There can be no assurance that all necessary approvals will be obtained, that modifications to those plans will not require additional approvals, or that such additional approvals will be obtained, nor can there be any assurance as to the timing of such events.

&#160;

In September 2014, Kaanapali Land Management Corp. (&#8220;KLMC&#8221;), pursuant to a property and option purchase agreement with an unrelated third party, closed on the sale of an approximate 14.9 acre parcel in West Maui. The purchase price was $3,300, paid in cash at closing. The agreement commits KLMC to fund up to between $803 and $1,008, depending on various factors, for off-site roadway, water, sewer and electrical improvements that will also provide service to other KLMC properties. The purchaser was also granted an option for the purchase of an adjacent site of approximately 18.5 acres for $4,078, of which $525 was paid in cash upon the closing of the 14.9 acre site. The nonrefundable $525 option payment can be applied to the purchase of the 18.5 acre site. The option expires in September 2017. The 14.9 acre site is intended to be used for a hospital, skilled nursing facility, assisted living facility, and medical offices, and the option site is intended to be used for other medical and health related facilities.

&#160;

In October 2014, through a limited liability company of which KLMC was the manager, a sale was made to an unrelated third party of an approximate 7.65 acre parcel in West Maui commonly referred to as Lot 10-H. KLMC received proceeds from the sale of approximately $1,300.

&#160;

Kaanapali Land Management Corp. (KLMC) is a party to an agreement with the State of Hawaii for the development of the Lahaina Bypass Highway. An approximate 2.4 mile portion of this two lane state highway has been completed. The more significant portion remains uncompleted. Under certain circumstances, which have not yet occurred, KLMC remains committed for approximately $1.1 million of various future costs relating to the planning and design of the uncompleted portion of the Bypass Highway. Under certain conditions, which have not yet been met, KLMC has agreed to contribute an amount not exceeding $6.7 million toward construction costs. Any such amount contributed would be reduced by the value of KLMC&#8217;s land actually contributed to the State for the Bypass Highway.

&#160;

These potential commitments have not been reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. While the completion of the Bypass Highway would add value to KLMC&#8217;s lands north of the town of Lahaina, there can be no assurance that it will be completed or when any future phases will be undertaken.

&#160;

During the first quarter of 2006, the Company received final subdivision approval on an approximate 336 acre parcel in the region &#34;mauka&#34; (toward the mountains) from the main highway serving the area. This project, called Kaanapali Coffee Farms, consists of 51 agricultural lots, which are currently being offered to individual buyers. The land improvements were completed during 2008. As of December 31, 2015, the Company sold thirty-five lots at Kaanapali Coffee Farms including one during the third quarter 2015, one during the second quarter 2015, two during the first quarter 2015 and thirteen in 2014. In conjunction with the sale of four of the lots sold in 2014, in addition to cash proceeds, the Company received promissory notes. As of December 31, 2015, $1,779 remains outstanding.

&#160;

Other Maui Property. The Company owns approximately 19 acres in Lahaina, known as the Pioneer Mill Site, which is zoned primarily industrial. This is the former site of Pioneer Mill's sugar mill on Maui and continues to be the site of the coffee mill operation. In addition, portions of this parcel are subject to various short-term license agreements with third parties that generate minor amounts of income for the Company.

9&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

The Company also owns several parcels, known collectively as the &#34;Wainee Lands&#34;, which are located in Lahaina south of the mill site. The Wainee Lands include approximately 235 acres and are classified and zoned for agricultural use and will need to obtain land use and zoning reclassification in order to proceed with any development. Most of the Wainee Lands have been included in the Maui County General Plan. The Company is conducting various meetings with the West Maui community, public officials and consultants to determine a plan for a portion of their lands. While it is likely that this development, if pursued, will contain a significant affordable housing component as required by county ordinance, the Company believes that these lands may be available for a number of uses compatible with the close proximity of them to the center of Lahaina, including both affordable and market housing and certain recreational and service uses. However, government planned infrastructure in this area is necessary, particularly a major storm drainage improvement referred to as the Lahaina Flood Control Channel, for which there is currently no government commitment of construction funding. Therefore, the Company is considering several options for this land. The Company has been engaged in numerous legal actions to quiet title to its Wainee lands as a necessary predicate to such development. While such cases have generally been contested, the Company has been successful in the cases completed so far. There can be no assurances that any actions, not yet filed, will permit the Wainee development to go forward on an economic basis.

&#160;

Agriculture 

&#160;

Historic Operations. A significant portion of the Company's revenues were formerly derived from agricultural operations primarily consisting of the cultivation, milling and sale of raw sugar. The last remaining operating sugar plantation of the Company, owned by a subsidiary of Kaanapali Land, was shut down at the end of 2000.

&#160;

Coffee Operations. Agricultural operations now consist of cultivation, milling and sale of coffee. The Company has entered into certain consulting and marketing arrangements in this regard.

&#160;

Seed Crop Operations. The Company's seed crop operations (primarily corn but also other crops such as soy beans) were located on former Maui sugar lands that are now part of the Kaanapali 2020 area. The Company earned a modest income, under a contract with Monsanto Seed Company to grow seed corn according to Monsanto's specifications. The contract expired June 30, 2012. The Company is exploring alternative agricultural operations, but there can be no assurances that replacement operations at any level will result.

&#160;

For a description of financial information by segment, please read Note 8 to the attached consolidated financial statements, which information is incorporated herein by reference.

&#160;

Significant Asset Sales 

&#160;

The Company has in the past consummated various strategic sales of bulk land. These transactions were generally pursued in order to raise additional cash that would enhance the Company's ability to fund the Kaanapali 2020 developments including, but not limited to Kaanapali Coffee Farms, and other Company overhead costs. While this is not the current focus of the Company, it has from time to time in the ordinary course of business engaged in discussions with third parties who may be interested in certain parcels.

10&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Employees 

&#160;

At August 1, 2016, Kaanapali Land and its subsidiaries had employed 26 full time employees. Certain corporate services are provided by Pacific Trail and its affiliates. Kaanapali Land reimburses for these services and related overhead at cost.

&#160;

Trademarks and Service Marks 

&#160;

The Company maintains a variety of trademarks and service marks that support each of its business segments. These marks are filed in various jurisdictions, including the United States Patent and Trademark Office, the State of Hawaii Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs and foreign trademark offices. The trademarks and service marks protect, among other things, the use of the term &#34;Kaanapali&#34; and related names in connection with the developments in the vicinity of the Kaanapali Resort area on Maui and the various trade names and service marks obtained in connection with the Company's coffee operations. Certain trademarks, trade names and service marks have also been registered in connection with the Kaanapali Coffee Farms development. Also protected are certain designs and logos associated with the names protected. Certain marks owned by the Company have been licensed to third parties, however, the income therefrom is not material to the Company's financial results. To the extent deemed advantageous in connection with the Company's ongoing businesses, to satisfy contractual commitments with respect to certain marks or where the Company believes that there are future licensing opportunities with respect to specific marks, the Company intends to maintain such marks to the extent necessary to protect their use relative thereto. The Company also intends to develop and protect appropriate marks in connection with its future land development and agricultural activities.

&#160;

Market Conditions and Competition 

&#160;

There are a number of factors that historically have negatively impacted Kaanapali Land's property activities, including market conditions, the difficulty in obtaining regulatory approvals, the high cost of required infrastructure and the Company's operating deficits in its other business segments. As a result, the planned use of many of the Company's land holdings and the ability to generate cash flow from these land holdings have become long-term in nature, and the Company has found it necessary to sell certain parcels in order to raise cash rather than realize their full economic potential through the entitlement process.

&#160;

Maui's residential real estate market experienced a dramatic slow down beginning in the latter part of 2005. The international credit crisis resulted in both national and global economic downturns and had a significant adverse impact on the Hawaiian economy. Market conditions have moved in a positive direction from 2014 and to date in 2016, however, there can be no assurance that such conditions will continue. A weakening of the Maui real estate market would negatively impact the Company.

&#160;

There are several developers, operators, real estate companies and other owners of real estate that compete with the Company in its property business on Maui, many of which have greater resources. The number of competitive properties in a particular market could have a material adverse effect on the Company's success. In addition, many properties previously purchased by retail buyers are listed for resale and provide additional competition to the Company.

11&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Government Regulations and Approvals 

&#160;

The current regulatory approval process for a project can take many years and involves substantial expense. There is no assurance that all necessary approvals and permits will be obtained with respect to the Company's current and future projects. Generally, entitlements are extremely difficult to obtain in Hawaii. Many different agencies at the state and county level are involved in the entitlement process. There is often significant opposition from numerous local groups - including environmental organizations, various community and civic groups, condominium associations and politicians advocating no-growth policies, among others. Certain ordinances adopted by the County of Maui have placed additional requirements on developers, some of which may be difficult or expensive to satisfy. Other proposed ordinances that have not yet passed may place moratoria on new development. It is currently unknown to what extent new legislative initiatives will impact the cost or timing of the Company's planned developments.

&#160;

Currently, Kaanapali Land is preparing applications for the necessary entitlements to carry out the Kaanapali 2020 plan. While some of these lands have some form of entitlements, it is anticipated that at least a substantial portion of the land will require state district boundary amendments and Community Plan amendments, as well as rezoning approvals. In January 2009 the Company received approval of revisions to its development plans for the Puukolii Village Mauka parcel. Entitlements for an agricultural subdivision were received during the first quarter of 2006. The Kaanapali 2020 Development Plan and most of the Wainee Lands are recognized within the urban growth areas identified in the growth maps of the Maui County General Plan. Approximately 1,500 acres of the Company's Maui land which is contiguous to Kaanapali 2020 land is located toward the top of mountain ridges and in gulches is classified as conservation, which precludes most other use. This conservation land, and other land that will be designated as open space, is an important component of the overall project, allowing for the protection of water and other natural resources, and its existence is expected to influence obtaining the entitlements for the remaining land.

&#160;

Environmental Matters 

&#160;

The Company is subject to environmental and health safety laws and regulations related to the ownership, operation, development and acquisition of real estate, or the operation of former business units. Under those laws and regulations, the Company may be liable for, among other things, the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous substances. In addition, the Company may find itself having to defend against personal injury lawsuits based on exposure to such substances including asbestos related liabilities. Those laws and regulations often impose liability without regard to fault. The Company is now engaged in work at a site on the Waipio Peninsula consisting of, among other things, performing testing at the site pursuant to an order discussed in Item 3. Legal Proceedings . The Company believes that the cost of this work pursuant to the order will not be material to the Company as a whole; however, in the event that the EPA were to issue an order requiring remediation of the site, there can be no assurance that the cost of remediation of the site would not ultimately have a material adverse effect on the Company. In addition, if there is litigation regarding the site, there can be no assurance that the cost of such litigation will not be material or that such litigation will result in a judgment in favor of the Company. With regard to other environmental matters as generally described in the risk factors set forth below, no assurance can be given that those matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial position or results of operations. Reference is made to Item 1A. Risk Factors and Item 3. Legal Proceedings for a description of certain legal proceedings related to environmental conditions.
