&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

Blue Spa will occupy a unique market position. No other brand offers a specialty line that includes skin care, cosmetics, fitness apparel and accessories. However, within each category significant brands do exist with quality and price varying widely within each category. Blue Spa&#8217;s competitive advantage will be the positioning as a quality brand. 

&#160; 

In the skin care and cosmetics category the competition can be divided into three groups: 

&#160; 

(1) Commercial - i.e. MAC, Origins, Philosophy, Erno Laslo and Shesheido; 

&#160; 

(2) Clinical - i.e. Kiehl&#8217;s, Clinique, Clarins and Dr. Hauscha; and 

&#160; 

(3) Spa - private label brands associated with spas. 

&#160; 

The commercial brands are primarily sold through department stores. They vary widely in quality from Origins to Shesheido. They also vary widely in price. The major advantage of these competitors is their financial strength and their department store relationships. 

&#160; 

The clinical brands are perceived to be &#8220;authentic&#8221;. Their image is based upon the perception of treatment qualities verses purely cosmetic benefits. These brands are sold through their own retail outlets, specialty stores, department stores and/or health food stores. Kiehl&#8217;s is perceived as one of the most authentic of the clinical brand. 

&#160; 

The spa brands are sold almost exclusively at the spas they are associated with. This close affiliation provides a validation for the products but limits their ability to achieve wide market distribution. Bliss and Aveda are notable exceptions. These two brands have achieved wide market distribution and brand recognition. 

&#160; 

Competition in the fitness apparel industry is principally on the basis of brand image and recognition as well as product quality, innovation, style, distribution and price. Management believes that Blue Spa will successfully compete on the basis of its unique brand image, its focus on women, and its technical product innovation. 

&#160; 

Nike operates a women&#8217;s division as a separate business unit. While this offers the possibility of a major competitor in the women&#8217;s fitness category, it also highlights the opportunity. Puma is the only brand that has developed a line of fitness apparel focused specifically at this consumer. They have positioned this line to sell through women&#8217;s specialty stores rather than traditional sport retailers. 

&#160; 

The market for fitness apparel is highly competitive. It includes increasing competition from established companies who are expanding their production and marketing of performance products, as well as from frequent new entrants to the market. Blue Spa will be in direct competition with wholesalers and direct sellers of athletic apparel, such as Nike, Inc., adidas AG, which includes the adidas and Reebok brands, and Under Armour, Inc. Blue Spa also competes with retailers specifically focused on women&#8217;s fitness apparel including lululemon athletica inc, Lucy Activewear Inc., The Gap, Inc. (including the Athleta collection), and bebe stores, inc. (including the BEBE SPORT collection). 

&#160; 

Raw Materials 

&#160; 

The principal raw materials to be used in the manufacture of Blue Spa&#8217;s skin care products are essential oils, herbal compounds, marine minerals, and algae. For its fitness apparel, Blue Spa will use technical and natural fabrics.

Dependence on Major Customers 

&#160; 

Blue Spa has no customers. 

&#160; 

Patents/Trade Marks/Licences/Franchises/Concessions/Royalty Agreements or Labour Contracts 

&#160; 

Blue Spa has no intellectual property such as patents or trademarks. Additionally, Blue Spa has no royalty agreements or labor contracts. 

&#160; 

Government Controls and Regulations 

&#160; 

Currently, Blue Spa is in compliance with all business and operations licenses that are typically applicable to most commercial ventures. However, there can be no assurance that existing or new laws or regulations that may be adopted in various jurisdictions in the future, will not impose additional fees and taxes on Blue Spa and its business operations. Management is not aware of any such revisions to existing laws and regulations nor new laws or regulations that could have a negative impact on Blue Spa&#8217;s business and add additional costs to Blue Spa&#8217;s business operations. 

&#160; 

Also, Blue Spa and its products will be subject to regulation by the Food and Drug Administration and the Federal Trade Commission in the United States, as well as by various other Federal, state, local and international regulatory authorities and the regulatory authorities in the countries in which its products are manufactured or sold. Such regulations principally relate to the ingredients, labeling, packaging and marketing of the products. Management believes that Blue Spa will be able to comply with such regulations, as well as with applicable Federal, state, local and international and other countries&#8217; rules and regulations governing the discharge of materials hazardous to the environment. There are no significant capital expenditures for environmental control matters either planned in the current year or expected in the near future. 

&#160; 

Expenditures on Research and Development During the Last Two Fiscal Years 

&#160; 

Since September 4, 2009, Blue Spa has not spent any funds on either company-sponsored research and development activities or customer-sponsored research activities relating to the development of new products, services or techniques or the improvement of existing products, services, or techniques 

&#160; 

Number of Total Employees and Number of Full Time Employees 

&#160; 

Blue Spa currently does not have any employees. In each phase of its plan of operations, Blue Spa intends to retain the services of key management to assist in the various aspects of its business operations, such as product development, retail operations, finance, and administration. In the first years of development of Blue Spa&#8217;s business operations these people will all fill multiple rolls. Also, in Phase 5 of Blue Spa&#8217;s plan of operation management intends to identify and appoint industry advisors to provide management with a valuable sounding board for strategic and creative decisions and to assist in increasing the brand awareness of Blue Spa&#8217;s business model and its products.
