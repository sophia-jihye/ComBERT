 Item 1. Business and Properties 

GENERAL 

Denbury Resources Inc., a Delaware corporation, is an independent oil and natural gas company with 288.6 &#32;MMBOE of estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves as of December 31, 2015 , of which 98% &#32;is oil. Our operations are focused in two key operating areas: the Gulf Coast and Rocky Mountain regions. Our goal is to increase the value of our properties through a combination of exploitation, drilling and proven engineering extraction practices, with the most significant emphasis relating to CO 2 enhanced oil recovery operations. 

As part of our corporate strategy, we are committed to strong financial discipline, efficient operations and creating long-term value for our shareholders through the following key principles: 

&#8226; 

target specific regions where we either have, or believe we can create, a competitive advantage as a result of our ownership or use of CO 2 &#32;reserves, oil fields and CO 2 &#32;infrastructure; 

&#8226; 

secure properties where we believe additional value can be created through tertiary recovery operations and a combination of other exploitation, development, exploration and marketing techniques; 

&#8226; 

acquire properties that give us a majority working interest and operational control or where we believe we can ultimately obtain it; 

&#8226; 

maximize the value and cash flow generated from our operations by increasing production and reserves while controlling costs; 

&#8226; 

optimize the timing and allocation of capital among our investment opportunities to maximize the rates of return on our investments; 

&#8226; 

exercise financial discipline by attempting to balance our development capital expenditures with our cash flows from operations; and 

&#8226; 

attract and maintain a highly competitive team of experienced and incentivized personnel. 

Denbury has been publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange since 1997. Our corporate headquarters is located at 5320 Legacy Drive, Plano, Texas 75024, and our phone number is 972-673-2000. At December 31, 2015 , we had 1,356 &#32;employees, 743 of whom were employed in field operations or at our field offices. We make our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports, filed or furnished pursuant to section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, available free of charge on or through our website, www.denbury.com , as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the SEC. The public may read and copy any materials we file with the SEC at the SEC&#8217;s Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, NE, Washington, DC 20549. The public may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. The SEC also maintains a website, http://www.sec.gov , which contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information filed by Denbury. Throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K (&#8220;Form 10-K&#8221;) we use the terms &#8220;Denbury,&#8221; &#8220;Company,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;our&#8221; and &#8220;us&#8221; to refer to Denbury Resources Inc. and, as the context may require, its subsidiaries. 

2015 &#32;BUSINESS DEVELOPMENTS 

Oil prices generally constitute the single largest variable in our operating results. Oil prices have historically been volatile, with NYMEX oil prices ranging from $35 &#32;to $111 &#32;per Bbl over the last three calendar years, and prices have declined dramatically since the fourth quarter of 2014 to less than $27 &#32;per Bbl in January 2016 , the lowest level in over 13 years . In response to the decline in oil prices, we made adjustments to our business to preserve financial strength and flexibility. These adjustments included reducing our 2015 development capital spending levels, reducing costs, identifying new innovation and improvement ideas for our fields and suspending our quarterly cash dividend. Our 2015 &#32;business developments included the following: 

&#8226; 

Generated $864.3 million &#32;of cash flow from operations (which amount includes $511.7 million &#32;of receipts on settlements of commodity derivatives) in 2015, which was $391.7 &#32;million higher than the total of our incurred development capital expenditures ( $407.2 million ) and dividends ( $65.4 million ). 

&#32;5 

Denbury Resources Inc. 

&#8226; 

Utilized excess cash flow from operations to pay down borrowings on our bank credit facility, with a total reduction of $220.0 million from the level outstanding as of December 31, 2014. As a result of the reduction in our average debt outstanding, cash interest expense also decreased $11.4 million &#32;between 2014 and 2015. 

&#8226; 

Increased our average tertiary oil production to 41,602 &#32;Bbls/d in 2015 , a 1% &#32; increase &#32;from average tertiary oil production in 2014 . 

&#8226; 

Reduced our 2015 development capital spending to approximately 39% &#32;of 2014 levels. 

&#8226; 

Generated average total production of 72,861 &#32;BOE/d in 2015, a 2% &#32; decrease &#32;from 2014 production, despite the significant reduction in our 2015 development capital spending. 

&#8226; 

Reduced our operating costs and identified new innovation and improvement ideas for our fields, which has resulted in meaningful decreases to most categories of our lease operating expenses and general and administrative expenses, and cost savings on capital projects. 

&#8226; 

Modified certain of our bank covenants applicable to the 2016, 2017 and 2018 periods to help mitigate concern around our ability to access our bank credit line if oil prices remain low for an extended period of time. 

&#8226; 

On September 21, 2015, in light of the continuing low oil price environment and our desire to maintain our financial strength and flexibility, the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors suspended our quarterly cash dividend effective after payment of our third quarter dividend on September 29, 2015. 

2016 BUSINESS OUTLOOK 

With the further decline in early 2016 in already depressed oil and natural gas prices, as well as our reduced hedging levels in 2016 and uncertainty around future prices, we are continuing to make adjustments to our business to preserve financial strength and flexibility. To accommodate our lower projected cash flow from operations, our 2016 capital spending has been budgeted at approximately $200 million, excluding capitalized interest and acquisitions, which is less than half of 2015 levels, and is not adequate to maintain current production levels. Therefore, we currently anticipate production declines in 2016 in the range of approximately seven to twelve percent &#32;from average 2015 levels, approximately 60% of which relates to natural production declines, with the remainder related to wells that are uneconomic to either produce or repair in the current price environment. We currently expect oil prices would need to average within a per-barrel range in the upper $30&#8217;s during 2016 for cash flow from operations to balance with our anticipated $200 million development capital budget, based upon our current production forecast and hedges currently in place. We currently intend to fund any potential shortfall with incremental borrowings on our bank credit facility, and as of December 31, 2015, we had ample availability on our bank credit facility to cover any foreseeable cash flow shortfall. In light of our current 2016 capital budget, we have deferred certain development projects that are uneconomic at current prices and slowed the development pace of many fields, anticipating that we have the ability to increase our capital spending when commodity prices return to higher levels that provide an acceptable rate of return. In late 2015 and early 2016, we shut-in certain wells that have become uneconomic to either produce or repair in the current price environment. 

During this period of reduced capital spending, we have continued to evaluate our assets with a goal of increasing the value of both existing assets and future projects by optimizing field operational and development plans, reducing CO 2 &#32;injection volumes due to increased efficiency and reducing costs. These initiatives aim to increase the profitability of our assets, making them more resilient to lower oil prices, and we will continue to evaluate the timing of development of our inventory of fields and related pipelines and facilities. Therefore, planned development activities presented in the discussions that follow may be delayed or modified during the course of 2016 depending primarily upon oil prices and our level of cash flow to fund such development, as well as the availability of CO 2 . Our capital spending during 2016 will focus on the continued development of our current tertiary floods, with less focus on the development of unproved reserves. Together, we believe these initiatives will help us manage through this low oil price environment and provide us with liquidity for the foreseeable future. 

OIL AND NATURAL GAS OPERATIONS 

Summary. &#32;&#32;Our oil and natural gas properties are concentrated in the Gulf Coast and Rocky Mountain regions of the United States. Currently our properties with proved and producing reserves in the Gulf Coast region are situated in Mississippi, Texas, Louisiana and Alabama, and in the Rocky Mountain region are situated in Montana, North Dakota and Wyoming. Our primary 

&#32;6 

Denbury Resources Inc. 

focus is using CO 2 in EOR, and our current portfolio of CO 2 &#32;EOR projects provides us significant oil production and reserve growth potential in the future, assuming crude oil prices are at levels that support the development of those projects. 

We have been conducting and expanding EOR operations on our assets in the Gulf Coast region since 1999, and as a result, we currently have many more CO 2 &#32;EOR projects in this region than in the Rocky Mountain region. In the Gulf Coast region, we own what is, to our knowledge, the region&#8217;s only significant naturally occurring source of CO 2 , and these large volumes of naturally occurring CO 2 &#32;give us a significant competitive advantage in this area. In addition to the sources of CO 2 &#32;we currently own, we purchase and use CO 2 captured from industrial sources which could otherwise be released into the atmosphere (sometimes referred to as anthropogenic, man-made or industrial-source CO 2 ) in our tertiary operations. These industrial sources of CO 2 help us recover additional oil from mature oil fields and, we believe, also provide an economical way to reduce atmospheric CO 2 emissions through the concurrent underground storage of CO 2 &#32;which occurs as part of our oil-producing EOR operations. 

We began operations in the Rocky Mountain region in 2010 in connection with, and following, our merger with Encore Acquisition Company (&#8220;Encore&#8221;). We completed construction of the first section of the 20-inch Greencore Pipeline (our first CO 2 &#32;pipeline in the Rocky Mountain region) in late 2012. During 2013, we received our first CO 2 &#32;deliveries from the ConocoPhillips-operated Lost Cabin gas plant in central Wyoming, started CO 2 injection at our Bell Creek Field in Montana, and commenced tertiary oil production from this field. In addition to our current tertiary flood in the Rocky Mountain region, we currently have long-term plans to flood Hartzog Draw Field, Grieve Field, and the Cedar Creek Anticline (&#8220;CCA&#8221;) with CO 2 . CCA is a geological structure over 126 miles in length consisting of 14 different operating areas. Our Riley Ridge Field acquisition (completed in two stages) in 2010 and 2011, the acquisition of an interest in CO 2 &#32;reserves in LaBarge Field from Exxon Mobil Corporation (&#8220;ExxonMobil&#8221;) in 2012, and the previously mentioned deliveries from the ConocoPhillips-operated Lost Cabin gas plant are expected to provide us the CO 2 &#32;necessary for our current inventory of CO 2 &#32;EOR projects in the Rocky Mountain region. 

Field Summary Table. &#32;&#32;The following table provides a summary by field and region of selected proved oil and natural gas reserve information, including total proved reserve quantities and the associated PV-10 Value of those reserves as of December 31, 2015 , and average daily production for 2015 , all based on Denbury&#8217;s net revenue interest (&#8220;NRI&#8221;). The reserve estimates presented were prepared by DeGolyer and MacNaughton (&#8220;D&#38;M&#8221;), independent petroleum engineers located in Dallas, Texas. We serve as operator of virtually all of our significant properties, in which we also own most of the interests, although typically less than a 100% working interest, and a lesser NRI due to royalties and other burdens. 

Proved oil and natural gas reserve quantities and PV-10 Values presented in the table reflect the significant decline in commodity prices between December 31, 2015 and 2014, whereby the average first-day-of-the-month NYMEX oil price used in estimating our proved reserves declined from $94.99 &#32;per Bbl at December 31, 2014, to $50.28 &#32;per Bbl at December 31, 2015, and for natural gas declined from $4.30 &#32;per MMBtu at December 31, 2014, to $2.63 &#32;per MMBtu at December 31, 2015. These commodity price changes resulted in a decline of approximately 126 &#32;MMBOE ( 29% ) in our proved reserves from December 31, 2014, through December 31, 2015, a significant portion of which was attributable to natural gas reserves at Riley Ridge that were reclassified and are no longer considered proved reserves, and which reserves totaled approximately 368 Bcf &#32;( 61 MMBOE ) as of December 31, 2014, or approximately 81% of our total proved natural gas reserves at that date. Reserve quantities and PV-10 Values presented in the table do not reflect the continued oil price declines in late 2015 and early 2016. Sustained prices at these recent or lower levels would result in additional decreases in the PV-10 Values, and to a lesser degree, additional reductions in our proved reserve volumes. Conversely, a sustained increase in commodity prices could lead to higher PV-10 Values and recovery of volumes lost due to lower prices. For additional oil and natural gas reserves information, see Estimated Net Quantities of Proved Oil and Natural Gas Reserves and Present Value of Estimated Future Net Revenues &#32;below and Supplemental Oil and Natural Gas Disclosures (Unaudited) &#32;to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

PV-10 Value is a non-GAAP measure and is different from the GAAP measure, the Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows (&#8220;Standardized Measure&#8221;), in that PV-10 Value is a pre-tax number and the Standardized Measure is an after-tax number. The Standardized Measure was $1.9 billion &#32;at December 31, 2015 . A comparison of PV-10 Value to the Standardized Measure is included in the reserves table in Estimated Net Quantities of Proved Oil and Natural Gas Reserves and Present Value of Estimated Future Net Revenues &#32;below. The information used to calculate the PV-10 Value is derived directly from data determined in accordance with FASC Topic 932. See the definition of PV-10 Value in the Glossary and Selected Abbreviations .

The Cedar Creek Anticline consists of a series of 14 different operating areas. 

Enhanced Oil Recovery Overview . &#32;&#32;CO 2 &#32;used in EOR is one of the most efficient tertiary recovery mechanisms for producing crude oil. When injected under pressure into underground, oil-bearing rock formations, CO 2 &#32;acts somewhat like a solvent as it travels through the reservoir rock, mixing with and modifying the characteristics of the oil so it can be produced and sold. The terms &#8220;tertiary flood,&#8221; &#8220;CO 2 &#32;flood&#8221; and &#8220;CO 2 &#32;EOR&#8221; are used interchangeably throughout this document.

Denbury Resources Inc. 

While enhanced oil recovery projects utilizing CO 2 &#32;have been successfully performed by numerous oil and gas companies in a wide range of oil-bearing reservoirs in different oil-producing basins, we believe our investments, experience and acquired knowledge give us a strategic and competitive advantage in the areas in which we operate. We apply what we have learned and developed over the years to improve and increase sweep efficiency within the CO 2 &#32;EOR projects we operate. 

We began our CO 2 &#32;operations in August 1999, when we acquired Little Creek Field, followed by our acquisition of Jackson Dome CO 2 &#32;reserves and the NEJD pipeline in 2001. Based upon our success at Little Creek and the ownership of the CO 2 &#32;reserves, we began to transition our capital spending and acquisition efforts to focus more heavily on CO 2 &#32;EOR and, over time, transformed our strategy to focus primarily on owning and operating oil fields that are well suited for CO 2 &#32;EOR projects. Prior to tertiary flooding, we strive to maximize the currently sizeable primary and secondary production from our prospective tertiary fields and from fields in which tertiary floods have commenced but still contain significant non-tertiary production. Our asset base today almost entirely consists of, or otherwise relates to, oil fields that we are currently flooding with CO 2 &#32;or plan to flood with CO 2 &#32;in the future, or assets that produce CO 2 . 

Our tertiary operations have grown so that (1) 57% &#32;of our proved reserves at December 31, 2015 &#32;are proved tertiary oil reserves; (2) 57% &#32;of our 2015 &#32;production was related to tertiary oil operations (on a BOE basis); and (3) 70% &#32;of our 2015 &#32;capital expenditures (excluding acquisitions) were related to our tertiary oil operations. At year-end 2015 , the proved oil reserves in our tertiary recovery oil fields had an estimated PV-10 Value of approximately $1.5 billion , or 63% &#32;of our total PV-10 Value. In addition, there are significant probable and possible reserves at several other fields for which tertiary operations are underway or planned. 

Although the up-front cost of tertiary production infrastructure and time to construct pipelines and production facilities is greater than in primary oil recovery in most circumstances, we believe tertiary recovery has several favorable, offsetting and unique attributes, including (1) a lower exploration risk, as we are operating oil fields that have significant historical production and reservoir and geological data, (2) an industry-competitive rate of return, depending on the specific field and area, (3) limited competition for this recovery method in our geographic regions, (4) our EOR operations are generally less disruptive to new habitats in comparison to other oil and natural gas development because we further develop existing (as opposed to new) oil fields, and (5) through our oil-producing EOR operations, we concurrently store CO 2 captured from industrial sources in the same underground formations that previously trapped and stored oil and natural gas. 

Tertiary Oil Properties 

Gulf Coast Region 

CO 2 &#160; Sources and Pipelines 

Jackson Dome. &#160; Our primary Gulf Coast CO 2 &#32;source, Jackson Dome, located near Jackson, Mississippi, was discovered during the 1970s by oil and gas companies that were exploring for hydrocarbons. This large and relatively pure source of naturally occurring CO 2 &#32;(98% CO 2 ) is, to our knowledge, the only significant underground deposit of CO 2 &#32;in the United States east of the Mississippi River. Together with the related CO 2 &#32;pipeline infrastructure, Jackson Dome provides us a significant strategic advantage in the acquisition of properties in Mississippi, Louisiana and southeastern Texas that are well suited for CO 2 &#32;EOR. 

We acquired Jackson Dome in February 2001 in a purchase that also gave us ownership and control of the NEJD CO 2 &#32;pipeline and provided us with a reliable supply of CO 2 &#32;at a reasonable and predictable cost for our Gulf Coast CO 2 &#32;tertiary recovery operations. Since February 2001, we have acquired and drilled numerous CO 2 -producing wells, significantly increasing our estimated proved Gulf Coast CO 2 &#32;reserves from approximately 800 Bcf at the time of acquisition of Jackson Dome to approximately 5.5 &#32;Tcf as of December 31, 2015 . The proved CO 2 &#32;reserve estimates are based on a gross (8/8ths) basis, of which our net revenue interest is approximately 4.4 Tcf , and is included in the evaluation of proved CO 2 &#32;reserves prepared by D&#38;M, an independent petroleum engineering consulting firm. In discussing our available CO 2 &#32;reserves, we make reference to the gross amount of proved and probable reserves, as this is the amount that is available both for our own tertiary recovery programs and for industrial users who are customers of Denbury and others, as we are responsible for distributing the entire CO 2 &#32;production stream. 

In addition to our proved reserves, we estimate that we have 1.3 Tcf of probable CO 2 &#32;reserves at Jackson Dome. While the majority of these probable reserves are located in structures that have been drilled and tested, such reserves are still considered probable reserves because (1) the original well is plugged; (2) they are located in fault blocks that are immediately adjacent to fault blocks with proved reserves; or (3) they are reserves associated with increasing the ultimate recovery factor from our existing 

&#32;9 

Denbury Resources Inc. 

reservoirs with proved reserves. In addition, a significant portion of these probable reserves at Jackson Dome are located in undrilled structures where we have sufficient subsurface and seismic data indicating geophysical attributes that, coupled with our historically high drilling success rate, provide a reasonably high degree of certainty that CO 2 &#32;is present. 

Although our current proved CO 2 &#32;reserves are sizeable, in order to continue our tertiary development of oil fields in the Gulf Coast region, incremental deliverability of CO 2 &#32;is required. In order to obtain additional CO 2 &#32;deliverability, we have conducted several 3D seismic surveys in the Jackson Dome area over the past several years. 

In addition to our drilling at Jackson Dome, we continue to expand our processing and dehydration capacities, and we continue to install pipelines and/or pumping stations necessary to transport the CO 2 &#32;through our controlled pipeline network. As part of our innovation and improvement initiative, we have identified fields where we have been able to reduce CO 2 &#32;injections without significantly impacting production. As such, we have been able to reduce injected CO 2 &#32;volumes in the Gulf Coast region by 30% when comparing injection levels in the fourth quarter of 2015 to those in the prior year fourth quarter. We expect our current proved reserves of CO 2 , coupled with a risked drilling program at Jackson Dome and CO 2 &#32;expected to be captured from industrial sources, to provide sufficient quantities of CO 2 &#32;for us to develop our proved and probable EOR reserves in the Gulf Coast region. In the future, we believe that once a CO 2 &#32;flood in a field reaches its productive economic limit, we could recycle a portion of the CO 2 &#32;that remains in that field&#8217;s reservoir and utilize it for oil production in another field&#8217;s tertiary flood. 

In the Gulf Coast region, approximately 88% of our average daily CO 2 &#32;produced from Jackson Dome or captured from industrial sources in 2015 &#32;and 91% in 2014 &#32;and 2013 &#32;was used in our tertiary recovery operations, with the balance delivered to third-party industrial users. During 2015 , we used an average of 684 MMcf/d of CO 2 &#32;(including CO 2 &#32;captured from industrial sources) for our tertiary activities. 

Gulf Coast CO 2 &#32; Captured from Industrial &#32; Sources. In addition to our natural source of CO 2 , we are currently party to three long-term contracts to purchase CO 2 &#32;from industrial plants. We have purchased CO 2 &#32;from an industrial facility in Port Arthur, Texas since 2012 and from an industrial facility in Geismar, Louisiana since 2013, which currently supply approximately 60 MMcf/d of CO 2 &#32;to our EOR operations. Additionally, we are in ongoing discussions with other parties who have plans to construct plants near the Green Pipeline. The expansion of industrial sources of CO 2 &#32;from which we could capture CO 2 &#32;for use in our tertiary recovery projects has developed more slowly than we previously expected. Several projects remain in the development stage, although we continue to anticipate completion and startup of Mississippi Power&#8217;s Kemper County Energy Facility for which we have contracted, which could more than double the amount of CO 2 &#32;we currently utilize from industrial sources. In October 2015, the Environmental Protection Agency (&#8220;EPA&#8221;) finalized a rule &#8211; Carbon Pollution Emission Guidelines for Existing Stationary Sources: Electric Utility Generating Units (also known or commonly referred to as the &#8220;Clean Power Plan&#8221;) &#8211; that would impose limits on greenhouse gas emissions from new and existing U.S. electric generation units. The Clean Power Plan in its current form contains requirements which will likely impact our ability to purchase power plant CO 2 &#32;for our EOR operations due to a number of operational and legal issues. The Clean Power Plan has been challenged by various states, trade associations, companies, including Denbury, and environmental groups. On February 9, 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court stayed the implementation of the Clean Power Plan pending resolution of various challenges to the rule. 

In addition to the potential CO 2 &#32;sources discussed above, we continue to have ongoing discussions with owners of existing plants of various types that emit CO 2 &#32;that we may be able to purchase and/or transport. In order to capture such volumes, we (or the plant owner) would need to install additional equipment, which includes, at a minimum, compression and dehydration facilities. Most of these existing plants emit relatively small volumes of CO 2 , generally less than our contracted sources, but such volumes may still be attractive if the source is located near CO 2 &#32;pipelines. The capture of CO 2 &#32;could also be influenced by potential federal legislation, which could impose economic penalties for atmospheric CO 2 emissions. We believe that we are a likely purchaser of CO 2 &#32;captured in our areas of operation because of the scale of our tertiary operations and our CO 2 &#32;pipeline infrastructure. 

Gulf Coast CO 2 &#32; Pipelines. &#32;&#32;We acquired the 183-mile NEJD CO 2 &#32;pipeline that runs from Jackson Dome to near Donaldsonville, Louisiana, as part of the 2001 acquisition of our Jackson Dome CO 2 &#32;source. Since 2001, we have acquired or constructed over 750 miles of CO 2 &#32;pipelines, and as of December 31, 2015 , we have access to nearly 950 miles of CO 2 &#32;pipelines, which gives us the ability to deliver CO 2 &#32;throughout the Gulf Coast region. In addition to the NEJD CO 2 pipeline, the major pipelines in the Gulf Coast region are the Free State Pipeline (90 miles), the Delta Pipeline (110 miles), the Green Pipeline Texas (120 miles), and the Green Pipeline Louisiana (200 miles). 

Completion of the Green Pipeline allowed for the first CO 2 &#32;injection into Hastings Field, located near Houston, Texas, in 2010, and gives us the ability to deliver CO 2 &#32;to oil fields all along the Gulf Coast from Baton Rouge, Louisiana, to Alvin, Texas. At 

&#32;10 

Denbury Resources Inc. 

the present time, most of the CO 2 &#32;flowing in the Green Pipeline is delivered from the Jackson Dome area, but we began receiving CO 2 &#32;from an industrial facility in Port Arthur, Texas in 2012, and are currently transporting a third party&#8217;s CO 2 &#32;for a fee to the sales point at Hastings Field. In addition, we began receiving CO 2 &#32;from an industrial facility in Geismar, Louisiana in 2013. We expect the volume of CO 2 &#32;transported through the Green Pipeline to increase in future years as we develop our inventory of CO 2 &#32;EOR projects in this area. 

Tertiary Properties with Tertiary Production and Proved Tertiary Reserves at December 31, 2015 

Mature properties. &#32;&#32;Mature properties include our longest-producing properties which are generally located along our NEJD CO 2 &#32;pipeline in southwest Mississippi and Louisiana and our Free State Pipeline in east Mississippi. This group of properties includes our initial CO 2 &#32;field, Little Creek, as well as several other fields (Brookhaven, Cranfield, Eucutta, Lockhart Crossing, Mallalieu, Martinville, McComb and Soso fields). These fields accounted for 26% &#32;of our total 2015 &#32;CO 2 &#32;EOR production and approximately 15% &#32;of our year-end proved tertiary reserves. These fields have been producing for some time, and their production is generally declining. Many of these fields contain multiple reservoirs that are amenable to CO 2 &#32;EOR. 

Delhi Field. &#32;&#32;Delhi Field is located east of Monroe, Louisiana. In May 2006, we purchased our initial interest in Delhi for $50 million. We began well and facility development in 2008 and began delivering CO 2 &#32;to the field in the fourth quarter of 2009 via the Delta Pipeline, which runs from Tinsley Field to Delhi Field. 

First tertiary production occurred at Delhi Field in the first quarter of 2010. Production from Delhi Field in the fourth quarter &#32;of 2015 &#32;averaged 3,898 &#32;Bbls/d, up from 3,743 Bbls/d in the fourth quarter of 2014 . Beginning November 1, 2014, average daily production amounts reflect the contractual reversionary assignment of approximately 25% of our interest to the seller of the field, the effectiveness, timing, and scope of which are subject to ongoing litigation, the ultimate outcome of which cannot be predicted. 

Additionally, our development of Delhi Field has been impacted by a release of well fluids within an area of Delhi Field occurring in the second quarter of 2013 and our subsequent remediation of such release. During the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, we recorded $16.8 million &#32;and $114.0 million , respectively, of lease operating expenses related to this release and its remediation in our Consolidated Statements of Operations, bringing our total cost estimate with respect to these expenses to $130.8 million . We have received a total of $29.5 million &#32;( $27.1 million &#32;net to Denbury) in insurance reimbursements related to the Delhi Field release and remediation. These insurance reimbursements were recognized as a reduction to lease operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015. See Item 7, Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#32; &#8211; &#32;Capital Resources &#32; and Liquidity &#8211; &#32;Insurance Recoveries to Cover Costs of 2013 Delhi Field Release and Note 10 , Commitments and Contingencies &#32;to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of these matters. Our development capital budget includes investing approximately $55 million in this field during 2016 , primarily related to a natural gas liquids extraction plant, which we currently anticipate will be placed into service in late 2016. This plant will provide us with the ability to sell natural gas liquids from the produced stream, improve the efficiency of the flood, and utilize extracted methane to power the plant and reduce field operating expenses. 

Hastings Field. Hastings Field is located south of Houston, Texas. We acquired a majority interest in this field in February 2009 for $247 million. We initiated CO 2 &#32;injection in the West Hastings Unit during the fourth quarter of 2010 upon completion of the construction of the Green Pipeline. Due to the large vertical oil column that exists in the field, we are developing the Frio reservoir using dedicated CO 2 &#32;injection and producing wells for each of the major sand intervals. We began producing oil from our EOR operations at Hastings Field in the first quarter of 2012, and we booked initial proved tertiary reserves for the West Hastings Unit in 2012. During the fourth quarter &#32;of 2015 , tertiary production from Hastings Field averaged 5,082 &#32;Bbls/d, compared to 4,811 Bbls/d in the fourth quarter of 2014 . Our future plans for Hastings Field include additional phased development opportunities. 

Heidelberg Field. Heidelberg Field is located in Mississippi and consists of an East Unit and a West Unit. Construction of the CO 2 &#32;facility, connecting pipeline and well work commenced on the West Heidelberg Unit during 2008, with our first CO 2 &#32;injections into the Eutaw zone in the fourth quarter of 2008. Our first tertiary oil production occurred in the second quarter of 2009, and we began flooding the Christmas and Tuscaloosa zones in 2013 and 2014, respectively. During the fourth quarter &#32;of 2015 , tertiary production at Heidelberg Field averaged 5,635 &#32;Bbls/d, compared to 6,164 Bbls/d in the fourth quarter of 2014 . The decrease in proved reserves at Heidelberg Field between December 31, 2015 and 2014 was primarily related to the reclassification of approximately 11 MMBbls of proved undeveloped reserves to the unproved reserves category pursuant to the five-year development rule established by the SEC due to changes in our development plans. Our future plans for Heidelberg Field include continued development of the East and West Heidelberg Units, including an expansion of our Tuscaloosa development and 

&#32;11 

Denbury Resources Inc. 

Christmas zone and adjustments to our CO 2 &#32;floods of existing zones to better direct the CO 2 &#32;through the zones and optimize oil recovery from the field, the ultimate timing of which will depend upon future oil prices or revised development plans. 

Oyster Bayou Field. We acquired a majority interest in Oyster Bayou Field in 2007. The field is located in southeast Texas, east of Galveston Bay, and is somewhat unique when compared to our other CO 2 &#32;EOR projects because the field covers a relatively small area of 3,912 acres. We began CO 2 &#32;injections into Oyster Bayou Field in the second quarter of 2010, commenced tertiary production in the fourth quarter of 2011 from the Frio A-1 zone, and booked initial proved tertiary reserves for the field in 2012. In 2014, we completed development of the Frio A-2 zone. During the fourth quarter of 2015 , tertiary production at Oyster Bayou Field averaged 5,831 &#32;Bbls/d, compared to 5,638 Bbls/d in the fourth quarter of 2014 . Production from Oyster Bayou Field is believed to have peaked in 2015, with production from the field in 2016 currently expected to be relatively flat or slightly reduced from 2015 levels. As of December 31, 2015, proved reserves at Oyster Bayou Field reflect positive performance revisions during 2015 of approximately 7 MMBOE as a result of increased recovery factors at the field, partially offset by a decrease in volumes of approximately 2 MMBOE due to a decline in the average first-day-of-the-month NYMEX oil price used in estimating our proved reserves. 

Tinsley Field. We acquired Tinsley Field in 2006. This Mississippi field was discovered and first developed in the 1930s and is separated by different fault blocks. As is the case with the majority of fields in Mississippi, Tinsley Field produces from multiple reservoirs. Our CO 2 &#32;enhanced oil recovery operations at Tinsley Field have thus far targeted the Woodruff formation, although there is additional potential in the Perry sandstone and other smaller reservoirs. We commenced tertiary oil production from Tinsley Field in the second quarter of 2008 and substantially completed development of the Woodruff formation during 2014. During the fourth quarter &#32;of 2015 , average tertiary oil production from the field was 7,522 &#32;Bbls/d, compared to 8,767 Bbls/d in the fourth quarter of 2014 . Although production from Tinsley Field is believed to have peaked in 2015, with a modest production decline currently expected in 2016, we continue to evaluate future potential investment opportunities in this field. As of December 31, 2015, proved reserves at Tinsley Field reflect positive performance revisions during 2015 of approximately 7 MMBOE as a result of increased recovery factors at the field, partially offset by a decrease in volumes of approximately 6 MMBOE due to a decline in the average first-day-of-the-month NYMEX oil price used in estimating our proved reserves. 

Future Tertiary Properties with No Tertiary Production or Proved Tertiary Reserves at December 31, 2015 

Webster Field. We acquired our interest in Webster Field in the fourth quarter of 2012 as part of the sale and exchange transaction with ExxonMobil under which we sold to ExxonMobil our Bakken area assets in North Dakota and Montana in exchange for (1) $1.3 billion in cash, (2) operating interests in Hartzog Draw and Webster fields in Wyoming and Texas, respectively, and (3) an overriding royalty interest equivalent to an approximate one-third ownership interest in ExxonMobil&#8217;s CO 2 &#32;reserves in LaBarge Field in Wyoming (the &#8220;Bakken Exchange Transaction&#8221;). The field is located in Texas, approximately eight miles northeast of our Hastings Field which we are currently flooding with CO 2 . At December 31, 2015 , Webster Field had estimated proved non-tertiary reserves of approximately 2.2 MMBOE, net to our interest. During the fourth quarter of 2015 , non-tertiary production at Webster Field averaged 1,001 BOE/d, compared to 1,121 BOE/d in the fourth quarter of 2014 . Webster Field is geologically similar to our Hastings Field, producing oil from the Frio zone at similar depths; as a result, we believe it is well suited for CO 2 &#32;EOR. In 2014, we completed a nine-mile lateral between the Green Pipeline and Webster Field, which will eventually deliver CO 2 &#32;to the field. We currently anticipate completing our plans for optimization of tertiary development of Webster Field during 2016, at which point we will determine the tertiary development schedule for the field, the timing of which could be delayed depending on future oil prices or revised development plans. 

Conroe Field. Conroe Field, our largest potential tertiary flood in the Gulf Coast region, is located north of Houston, Texas. We acquired a majority interest in this field in 2009 for $271 million in cash and 11.6 million shares of Denbury common stock, for a total aggregate value of $439 million. Conroe Field had estimated proved non-tertiary reserves of approximately 5.3 MMBOE at December 31, 2015 , net to our interest, all of which are proved developed. During the fourth quarter &#32;of 2015 , production at Conroe Field averaged 2,889 BOE/d, compared to 3,386 BOE/d in the fourth quarter of 2014 . 

A pipeline must be constructed so that CO 2 &#32;can be delivered to Conroe Field. This pipeline, which is planned as an extension of our Green Pipeline, is preliminarily estimated to cover approximately 90 miles at a cost of approximately $220 million. We currently expect that over the next few years we will begin construction of this pipeline and prepare to commence CO 2 &#32;injections at Conroe Field, the timing of which may change depending on future oil prices. 

Thompson Field. We acquired our interest in Thompson Field in June 2012 for $366 million. The field is located in Texas, approximately 18 miles west of our Hastings Field. Thompson Field had estimated proved non-tertiary reserves of approximately 

&#32;12 

Denbury Resources Inc. 

8.4 MMBOE at December 31, 2015 , net to our interest, of which approximately 82% is proved developed. During the fourth quarter &#32;of 2015 , non-tertiary production at Thompson Field averaged 1,508 BOE/d net to our interest, compared to 1,556 BOE/d in the fourth quarter of 2014 . Thompson Field is geologically similar to Hastings Field, producing oil from the Frio zone at similar depths, and we therefore believe it has CO 2 &#32;EOR potential. Under the terms of the Thompson Field acquisition agreement, after the initiation of CO 2 &#32;injection, the seller will retain approximately a 5% gross revenue interest (less severance taxes) once average monthly oil production exceeds 3,000 Bbls/d. The timing of CO 2 &#32;injections at Thompson Field is currently scheduled several years in the future, the ultimate timing of which is primarily dependent upon future oil prices. 

Rocky Mountain Region 

CO 2 &#160; Sources and Pipelines 

LaBarge Field. We acquired an overriding royalty interest equivalent to an approximate one-third ownership interest in ExxonMobil&#8217;s CO 2 &#32;reserves in LaBarge Field in the fourth quarter of 2012 as part of the Bakken Exchange Transaction. Our interest at Riley Ridge (discussed below) is also produced from the LaBarge Field. LaBarge Field is located in southwestern Wyoming. 

During 2015 , we received an average of approximately 70 MMcf/d of CO 2 &#32;from ExxonMobil&#8217;s Shute Creek gas processing plant at LaBarge Field. Based on current capacity, and subject to availability of CO 2 , we currently expect that we could receive up to 115 MMcf/d of CO 2 &#32;by 2021 from such plant. We pay ExxonMobil a fee to process and deliver the CO 2 , which we use in our Rocky Mountain region CO 2 &#32;floods. As of December 31, 2015 , our interest in LaBarge Field consisted of approximately 1.2 Tcf &#32;of proved CO 2 &#32;reserves. 

Riley Ridge. &#32;&#32;The Riley Ridge Federal Unit is also located in southwestern Wyoming and produces gas from the same LaBarge Field. In a series of two acquisitions in 2010 and 2011, we acquired 100% of the operating interests in Riley Ridge, as well as a gas processing facility that was under construction at the time of purchase, for $347 million. The gas processing facility separates helium and natural gas from the gas stream. During construction of the gas processing facility, we encountered issues related to contractor performance and design failure that resulted in significant delays and incremental costs to complete the facility. We placed the gas processing facility into service during the fourth quarter of 2013 and were successful in running the facility for part of 2014, but encountered additional issues in 2014, which kept the facility from running at optimum levels, as well as additional problems associated with sulfur build-up in the gas supply wells. We are currently working to correct and remedy these issues; however, we currently expect natural gas production at Riley Ridge will remain shut-in for some time due to such issues. 

As of December 31, 2015, Riley Ridge natural gas, CO 2 &#32;and helium reserves were reclassified and are no longer considered proved reserves primarily as a result of the decline in average first-day-of-the-month natural gas prices utilized in preparing our December 31, 2015 reserve report. Proved natural gas, CO 2 &#32;and helium reserves at Riley Ridge previously totaled approximately 368 Bcf , 1.8 Tcf and 13 Bcf, respectively, as of December 31, 2014. As of December 31, 2015, our interest in Riley Ridge and minor surrounding acreage contained probable reserves of 2.8 Tcf of CO 2 , which reserve estimates are based upon the gross (8/8ths) basis of the CO 2 reserves, and in which our net revenue interest is approximately 2.2 Tcf. As of December 31, 2015, we estimated that Riley Ridge contained probable helium reserves of approximately 12 Bcf, which volume estimate is reduced to reflect related fees we will remit to the U.S. government. We also believe there is significant CO 2 reserve potential in other acreage surrounding Riley Ridge in which we also own an interest. 

Initially, the gas processing facility at Riley Ridge was designed to separate for sale the natural gas and helium from the full well stream, with the remaining gases, principally CO 2 , re-injected into the producing formation or a deeper formation. Ultimately, our primary purpose for acquiring Riley Ridge was to gain a source of CO 2 &#32;to utilize in flooding our fields in the Rocky Mountain region. We intend to construct a CO 2 &#32;capture facility and will start to use CO 2 &#32;from Riley Ridge following completion of the capture facility and planned CO 2 &#32;pipeline connecting Riley Ridge to our existing Greencore Pipeline, the timing of which is largely dependent upon future oil prices. 

Other Rocky Mountain CO 2 &#32; Sources. We began purchasing and receiving CO 2 &#32;from the ConocoPhillips-operated Lost Cabin gas plant in central Wyoming in the first quarter of 2013, under a contract that provides us as much as 50 MMcf/d of CO 2 &#32;for use in our Rocky Mountain region CO 2 &#32;floods. Our volumes received from the plant averaged approximately 40 MMcf/d in 2015 .

Greencore Pipeline. The 20-inch Greencore Pipeline in Wyoming is the first CO 2 &#32;pipeline we constructed in the Rocky Mountain region. We plan to use the pipeline as our trunk line in the Rocky Mountain region, eventually connecting our various Rocky Mountain region CO 2 &#32;sources (see Rocky Mountain Region CO 2 &#32; Sources and Pipelines &#32;above) to the Cedar Creek Anticline in eastern Montana and western North Dakota. The initial 232-mile section of the Greencore Pipeline begins at the ConocoPhillips-operated Lost Cabin gas plant in Wyoming and terminates at Bell Creek Field in Montana. We completed construction of this section of the pipeline in the fourth quarter of 2012 and received our first CO 2 &#32;deliveries from the ConocoPhillips-operated Lost Cabin gas plant during the first quarter of 2013. During the first quarter of 2014, we completed construction of an interconnect between our Greencore Pipeline and an existing third-party CO 2 &#32;pipeline in Wyoming, which enables us to transport CO 2 &#32;from LaBarge Field to our Bell Creek Field. 

Tertiary Properties with Tertiary Production and Proved Tertiary Reserves at December 31, 2015 

Bell Creek Field. Bell Creek Field is located in southeast Montana, and we acquired our interest in this field as part of the Encore merger in 2010. The oil-producing reservoir in Bell Creek Field is a sandstone reservoir with characteristics similar to those we have successfully flooded with CO 2 &#32;in the Gulf Coast region. During 2013, we began first CO 2 &#32;injections into Bell Creek Field, recorded our first tertiary oil production, and booked initial proved tertiary reserves. Tertiary production, net to our interest, during the fourth quarter &#32;of 2015 &#32;averaged 2,806 &#32;Bbls/d of oil, compared to 1,659 Bbls/d in the fourth quarter of 2014 , as production has steadily grown from the initial production response in the third quarter of 2013. We expect production from this field will continue to increase during 2016; however, such growth may be at a slower rate in the future due to our slowed development pace as a result of the decline in oil prices. 

Future Tertiary Properties with No Tertiary Production or Proved Tertiary Reserves at December 31, 2015 

Cedar Creek Anticline. CCA is the largest potential EOR property that we own and currently our largest producing property, contributing approximately 25% &#32;of our 2015 &#32;total production. The field is primarily located in Montana but covers such a large area (approximately 126 miles) that it also extends into North Dakota. CCA is a series of 14 different operating areas, each of which could be considered a field by itself. We acquired our initial interest in CCA as part of the Encore merger in 2010 and acquired additional interests (the &#8220;CCA Acquisition&#8221;) from a wholly-owned subsidiary of ConocoPhillips in the first quarter of 2013 for $1.0 billion, adding 42.2 MMBOE of incremental proved reserves at that date. Production from CCA, net to our interest, averaged 17,875 &#32;BOE/d during the fourth quarter &#32;of 2015 , compared to production during the fourth quarter of 2014 &#32;of 18,553 BOE/d. This decline in production includes approximately 250 BOE/d of production that, as of December 31, 2015, we estimated to be attributable to wells shut-in as uneconomic to either produce or repair due to commodity prices at this time. The non-tertiary proved reserves associated with CCA were 90.2 &#32;MMBOE, net to our interest, as of December 31, 2015 . 

CCA is located approximately 110 miles north of Bell Creek Field, and we currently expect to ultimately connect this field to our Greencore Pipeline. In the future, we plan to install an injection facility and perform minor conformance work at the field to minimize production declines, the timing of which will depend on future oil prices. Our current plan for initiating a CO 2 &#32;flood at CCA is scheduled several years from now, the timing of which may change depending on future oil prices, pipeline permitting and operations at the Riley Ridge gas processing facility. 

Hartzog Draw Field. We acquired our interest in Hartzog Draw Field in the fourth quarter of 2012 as part of the Bakken Exchange Transaction. The field is located in the Powder River Basin of northeastern Wyoming, approximately 12 miles from our Greencore Pipeline. Hartzog Draw Field had estimated proved reserves of approximately 4.3 MMBOE at December 31, 2015 , net to our interest, 1.7 MMBOE of which relate to the natural gas producing Big George coal zone. During the fourth quarter &#32;of 2015 , non-tertiary production averaged 2,212 BOE/d, compared to 2,639 BOE/d in the fourth quarter of 2014 . This decline in production includes approximately 300 BOE/d that, as of December 31, 2015, we estimated to be attributable to wells shut-in as uneconomic to either produce or repair due to commodity prices at this time. We successfully completed 5 wells in Hartzog Draw Field in 2014; however, we have temporarily suspended the non-tertiary development of Hartzog Draw Field in light of the recent oil price environment. We believe the oil reservoir characteristics of Hartzog Draw Field make it well suited for CO 2 &#32;EOR in the future. We currently plan to commence CO 2 &#32;injections at Hartzog Draw within five years from now, the timing of which is dependent on future oil prices. 

Other Non-Tertiary Oil Properties 

Despite the majority of our oil and natural gas properties discussed above consisting of either existing or planned future tertiary floods, we do also produce oil and natural gas either from fields in both our Gulf Coast and Rocky Mountain regions that are not 

&#32;14 

Denbury Resources Inc. 

amenable to EOR or from specific reservoirs (within an existing tertiary field) that are not amenable to EOR. For example, at Heidelberg Field, we produce natural gas from the Selma Chalk reservoir, which is separate from the Christmas and Eutaw reservoirs currently being flooded with CO 2 . Production from these other non-tertiary properties totaled 5,340 BOE/d during the fourth quarter of 2015 , compared to 5,747 BOE/d during the fourth quarter of 2014 . In addition to these properties, we acquired two minor fields with future CO 2 &#32;EOR potential during 2015 for a total of approximately $22 million.

(1) 

An exploratory well is a well drilled to find a new field or to find a new reservoir in a field previously found to be productive of oil or natural gas in another reservoir. Generally, an exploratory well is any well that is not a development well, an extension well, a service well or a stratigraphic test well. A development well is a well drilled within the proved area of an oil or gas reservoir to the depth of a stratigraphic horizon known to be productive. 

(2) 

A productive well is an exploratory or development well found to be capable of producing either oil or natural gas in sufficient quantities to justify completion as an oil or natural gas well. 

(3) 

A non-productive well is an exploratory or development well that is not a productive well. 

(4) 

During 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , an additional 6, 43 and 43 wells, respectively, were drilled for water or CO 2 &#32;injection purposes.

Denbury Resources Inc. 

TITLE TO PROPERTIES 

As is customary in the oil and natural gas industry, Denbury conducts a limited title examination at the time of its acquisition of properties or leasehold interests targeted for enhanced recovery, and curative work is performed with respect to significant defects on higher-value properties of the greatest significance. We believe that title to our oil and natural gas properties is good and defensible, subject only to such exceptions that we believe do not materially interfere with the use of such properties, including encumbrances, easements, restrictions and royalty, overriding royalty and other similar interests. 

SIGNIFICANT OIL AND GAS PURCHASERS AND PRODUCT MARKETING 

Oil and natural gas sales are made on a day-to-day basis or under short-term contracts at the current area market price. We would not expect the loss of any single purchaser to have a material adverse effect upon our operations; however, the loss of a large single purchaser could potentially reduce the competition for our oil and natural gas production, which in turn could negatively impact the prices we receive. For the year ended December 31, 2015 , two purchasers accounted for 10% or more of our oil and natural gas revenues: Marathon Petroleum Company ( 28% ) and Plains Marketing LP ( 15% ). For the year ended December 31, &#32; 2014 , three purchasers accounted for 10% or more of our oil and natural gas revenues: Marathon Petroleum Company ( 31% ), Plains Marketing LP ( 13% ), and ConocoPhillips ( 12% ). For the year ended December 31, &#32; 2013 , three purchasers accounted for 10% or more of our oil and natural gas revenues: Marathon Petroleum Company ( 33% ), Plains Marketing LP ( 15% ), and Eighty-Eight Oil LLC ( 10% ). 

Our ability to market oil and natural gas depends on many factors beyond our control, including the extent of domestic production and imports of oil and natural gas, the proximity of our oil and natural gas production to pipelines and corresponding markets, the available capacity in such pipelines, the demand for oil and natural gas, the effects of weather, and the effects of state and federal regulation. As of December 31, 2015 , we have not experienced significant difficulty in finding a market for all of our production as it becomes available or in transporting our production to those markets; however, there is no assurance that we will always be able to market all of our production or obtain favorable prices. 

On December 18, 2015, Congress passed, and the President signed, legislation repealing the ban on the export of crude oil from the United States. Proponents of the legislation believe that repealing the ban should improve the market for domestic oil production by giving U.S. producers access to higher-priced international markets. Given the legislation&#8217;s recent passage, it is premature to predict the nature and extent of its impact, although oil markets are subject to many variables, including global economic conditions, exchange rates, and worldwide oil production levels. 

Oil Marketing 

Prices received in a regional market fluctuate frequently and can differ from NYMEX pricing due to a variety of reasons, including supply and/or demand factors, crude oil quality and location differentials. The oil differentials we received in the Gulf Coast and Rocky Mountain regions are discussed in further detail below. 

Crude oil prices in the Gulf Coast region are impacted significantly by the changes in prices received for our crude oil sold under Light Louisiana Sweet (&#8220;LLS&#8221;) index prices relative to the change in NYMEX prices. Overall, during 2015 , we sold approximately 62% &#32;of our crude oil at prices based on, or partially tied to, the LLS index price, and the balance at prices based on various other indexes tied to NYMEX prices, primarily in the Rocky Mountain region. The average LLS-to-NYMEX differential (on a trade-month basis) was a positive $3.72 per Bbl during 2015, compared to a positive $3.88 per Bbl during 2014 and a positive $11.10 per Bbl in 2013. During 2015 , our light sweet crude oil production in the Gulf Coast region, on average, sold for $0.56 per Bbl over NYMEX compared to $1.80 per Bbl over NYMEX in 2014 &#32;and $7.44 per Bbl over NYMEX in 2013 . Our current markets at various sales points along the Gulf Coast have sufficient demand to accommodate our production, but there can be no assurance of future demand. We are, therefore, monitoring the marketplace for opportunities to strategically enter into long-term marketing arrangements. 

The marketing of our Rocky Mountain region oil production is dependent on transportation through local pipelines to market centers in Guernsey, Wyoming; Clearbrook, Minnesota; Wood River, Illinois; and most recently Cushing, Oklahoma. Shipments on some of the pipelines are at or near capacity and may be subject to apportionment. We currently have access to, or have contracted for, sufficient pipeline capacity to move our oil production; however, there can be no assurance that we will be allocated sufficient pipeline capacity to move all of our oil production in the future. Because local demand for production is small in comparison to current production levels, much of the production in the Rocky Mountain region is transported to markets outside 

&#32;18 

Denbury Resources Inc. 

of the region. Therefore, prices in the Rocky Mountain region are further influenced by fluctuations in prices (primarily Brent and LLS) in coastal markets and by available pipeline capacity in the Midwest and Cushing markets. For the year ended December 31, 2015 , the discount for our oil production in the Rocky Mountain region averaged $5.60 per Bbl, compared to $10.19 per Bbl during 2014 &#32;and $8.10 per Bbl during 2013 . 

Natural Gas Marketing 

Virtually all of our natural gas production in the Gulf Coast region is close to existing pipelines; consequently, we generally have a variety of options to market our natural gas. However, our natural gas production in the Rocky Mountain region, like our oil production, is dependent on, among other factors, limited transportation options that can affect our ability to find markets for it. We sell the majority of our natural gas on one-year contracts, with prices fluctuating month to month based on published pipeline indices and with slight premiums or discounts to the index. 

COMPETITION AND MARKETS 

We face competition from other oil and natural gas companies in all aspects of our business, including acquisition of producing properties, oil and gas leases, drilling rights, and CO 2 &#32;properties; marketing of oil and natural gas; and obtaining and maintaining goods, services and labor. Many of our competitors have substantially larger financial and other resources. Factors that affect our ability to acquire producing properties include available liquidity, available information about prospective properties and our expectations for earning a minimum projected return on our investments. Because of the primary nature of our core assets (our tertiary operations) and our ownership of relatively uncommon significant natural sources of CO 2 &#32;in the Gulf Coast and Rocky Mountain regions, we believe that we are effective in competing in the market and have less competition than our peers in certain aspects of our business. 

The demand for qualified and experienced field personnel to drill wells and conduct field operations and for geologists, geophysicists, engineers and other professionals in the oil and gas industry can fluctuate significantly, often in correlation with commodity prices, causing periodic shortages in such personnel. In recent years, the competition for qualified technical personnel has been extensive, and our personnel costs have been escalating. There have also been periods with shortages of drilling rigs and other equipment, as demand for rigs and equipment has increased along with the number of wells being drilled. These factors also cause significant increases in costs for equipment, services and personnel. We cannot be certain when we will experience these issues, and these types of shortages or price increases could significantly decrease our profit margin, cash flow and operating results, and cause significant delays in our development operations. 

FEDERAL AND STATE REGULATIONS 

Numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations govern the oil and gas industry. Additions or changes to these laws and regulations are often made in response to the current political or economic environment. Compliance with the evolving regulatory landscape is often difficult, and substantial penalties may be incurred for noncompliance. Additionally, the future annual cost of complying with all laws and regulations applicable to our operations is uncertain and will be ultimately determined by several factors, including future changes to legal and regulatory requirements. Management believes that continued compliance with existing laws and regulations applicable to our operations and future compliance therewith will not have a materially adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows, although such laws and regulations, and compliance therewith, could cause significant delays or otherwise impede operations, which may, among other things, cause our expected production rates and cash flows to be less than anticipated. 

The following sections describe some specific laws and regulations that may affect us. We cannot predict the cost or impact of these or other future legislative or regulatory initiatives. 

Regulation of Natural Gas and Oil Exploration and Production 

Our operations are subject to various types of regulation at the federal, state and local levels. Such regulation includes requiring permits for drilling wells; maintaining bonding requirements in order to drill or operate wells and regulating the location of wells; the method of drilling and casing wells; the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled; the plugging and abandoning of wells; and the composition or disposal of chemicals and fluids used in connection with operations. Our operations are also subject to various conservation laws and regulations. These include regulation of the size of drilling, spacing or proration units and the density of wells that may be drilled in those units, and the unitization or pooling of oil and gas properties. In addition, 

&#32;19 

Denbury Resources Inc. 

state conservation laws, which establish maximum rates of production from oil and gas wells, generally prohibit or restrict the venting or flaring of natural gas and impose certain requirements regarding the ratability of production. The effect of these laws and regulations may limit the amount of oil and natural gas we can produce from our wells and may limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill. Regulatory requirements and compliance relative to the oil and gas industry increase our costs of doing business and, consequently, affect our profitability. 

Federal Regulation of Sales Prices and Transportation 

The transportation of, and certain sales with respect to, natural gas in interstate commerce are heavily regulated by agencies of the U.S. federal government and are affected by, among other things, the availability, terms and cost of transportation. Notably, the price and terms of access to pipeline transportation are subject to extensive U.S. federal and state regulation. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (&#8220;FERC&#8221;) is continually proposing and implementing new and/or modified rules and regulations affecting the natural gas industry, some of which may adversely affect the availability and reliability of interruptible transportation service on interstate pipelines. While our sales of crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids are not currently subject to FERC regulation, our ability to transport and sell such products is dependent on certain pipelines whose rates, terms and conditions of service are subject to FERC regulation. Additional proposals and proceedings that might affect the natural gas industry are considered from time to time by Congress, FERC, state regulatory bodies and the courts, and we cannot predict when or if any such proposals or proceedings might become effective and their effect or impact, if any, on our operations. 

Federal Energy and Climate Change Legislation and Regulation 

In early 2012, the President signed the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty and Job Creation Act of 2011. This act, among other things, updates federal pipeline safety standards, increases penalties for violations of such standards, gives the Department of Transportation&#8217;s Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (the &#8220;PHMSA&#8221;) authority for new damage prevention and incident notification, and directs the PHMSA to prescribe new minimum safety standards for CO 2 &#32;pipelines, which safety standards could affect our operations and the costs thereof. While the PHMSA has adopted or proposed to adopt a number of new regulations to implement this act, no new minimum safety standards have been proposed or adopted for CO 2 &#32;pipelines. In the future, Congress may create new incentives for alternative energy sources and may also consider legislation to reduce emissions of CO 2 &#32;or other greenhouse gases. This legislation, if enacted, could (1) impose a tax or other economic penalty on the production of fossil fuels that, when used, ultimately release CO 2 , (2) reduce the demand for, and uses of, oil, gas and other minerals, and/or (3) increase the costs incurred by us in our exploration and production activities. The EPA has promulgated regulations requiring permitting for certain sources of greenhouse gas emissions, and in August 2015, proposed regulations to reduce methane and volatile organic compound emissions from the oil and gas sector. The proposed rule, which the EPA expects to finalize in 2016, would impose additional costs related to compliance with new emission limits, as well as inspections and maintenance of several types of equipment used in our operations. At the same time, legislation or regulation to reduce the emissions of CO 2 &#32;or other greenhouse gases could also create economic incentives for technologies and practices that reduce or avoid such emissions, including processes that recognize the associated storage of CO 2 &#32;in oil and gas reservoirs through CO 2 &#32;EOR operations. 

Natural Gas Gathering Regulations 

State and federal regulation of natural gas gathering facilities generally includes various safety, environmental and, in some circumstances, nondiscriminatory-take requirements. With the increase in construction and operation of natural gas gathering lines in various states, natural gas gathering is receiving greater regulatory scrutiny from state and federal regulatory agencies, which is likely to continue in the future. 

Federal, State or Indian Leases 

Our operations on federal, state or Indian oil and gas leases, especially those in the Rocky Mountain region, are subject to numerous restrictions, including nondiscrimination statutes. Such operations must be conducted pursuant to certain on-site security regulations and other permits and authorizations issued by the Bureau of Land Management, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and other federal and state stakeholder agencies. In 2015, the Department of Interior issued new regulations governing hydraulic fracturing on public and tribal lands, which regulations are currently enjoined pursuant to a court order and are subject to ongoing litigation, thus creating uncertainty regarding the future costs of hydraulic fracturing operations. However, our current hydraulic fracturing activity is limited.

Environmental Regulations 

Our oil and natural gas production, saltwater disposal operations, injection of CO 2 , and the processing, handling and disposal of materials such as hydrocarbons and naturally occurring radioactive materials (&#8220;NORM&#8221;) are subject to stringent regulation. We could incur significant costs, including cleanup costs resulting from a release of product, third-party claims for property damage and personal injuries, or penalties and other sanctions as a result of any violations or liabilities under environmental laws and regulations or other laws and regulations applicable to our operations. Changes in, or more stringent enforcement of, environmental laws and other laws applicable to our operations could also result in delays or additional operating costs and capital expenditures. 

Various federal, state and local laws and regulations controlling the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment and human health, directly impact our oil and gas exploration, development and production operations. These include, among others, (1) regulations adopted by the EPA and various state agencies regarding approved methods of disposal for certain hazardous and nonhazardous wastes; (2) the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act and analogous state laws that regulate the removal or remediation of previously disposed wastes (including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators), property contamination (including groundwater contamination), and remedial plugging operations to prevent future contamination; (3) the Clean Air Act and comparable state and local requirements already applicable to our operations and new restrictions on air emissions from our operations, including greenhouse gas emissions and those that could discourage the production of fossil fuels that, when used, ultimately release CO 2 ; (4) the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, which contains numerous requirements relating to the prevention of, and response to, oil spills into waters of the United States; (5) the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, which is the principal federal statute governing the treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous wastes; (6) the Endangered Species Act and counterpart state legislation, which protects certain species (and their related habitats), including certain species that could be present on our leases, as threatened or endangered; and (7) state regulations and statutes governing the handling, treatment, storage and disposal of NORM and other wastes. 

Management believes that we are currently in substantial compliance with existing applicable environmental laws and regulations, and does not currently anticipate that future compliance will have a materially adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows, although such laws and regulations, and compliance therewith, could cause significant delays or otherwise impede operations, which may, among other things, cause our expected production rates and cash flows to be less than anticipated. 

Hydraulic Fracturing 

During 2015 , we fracture stimulated five existing wells at Hartzog Draw Field and one water source well at Tinsley Field utilizing water-based fluids with no diesel fuel component. We currently have plans to hydraulically fracture one additional water source well at Tinsley Field during 2016. We are familiar with the laws and regulations applicable to hydraulic fracturing operations and take steps to ensure compliance with these requirements. 

ESTIMATED NET QUANTITIES OF PROVED OIL AND NATURAL GAS RESERVES AND PRESENT VALUE OF ESTIMATED FUTURE NET REVENUES 

Internal Controls Over Reserve Estimates 

Reserve information in this report is based on estimates prepared by D&#38;M, an independent petroleum engineering consulting firm located in Dallas, Texas, utilizing data provided by our internal reservoir engineering team and is the responsibility of management. We rely on D&#38;M&#8217;s expertise to ensure that our reserve estimates are prepared in compliance with SEC rules and regulations and that appropriate geologic, petroleum engineering, and evaluation principles and techniques are applied in accordance with practices generally recognized by the petroleum industry as presented in the publication of the Society of Petroleum Engineers entitled &#8220;Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information (Revision as of February 19, 2007)&#8221;. The person responsible for the preparation of the reserve report is a Senior Vice President at D&#38;M; he is a Registered Professional Engineer in the State of Texas. He received a Bachelor of Science degree in Petroleum Engineering at Texas A&#38;M University in 1974, and he has in excess of 41 years of experience in oil and gas reservoir studies and evaluations.

interests, production information, operating costs, planned capital expenditures and other technical data. Our internal reservoir engineering team consists of qualified petroleum engineers who maintain the Company&#8217;s internal evaluation of reserves and compare the Company&#8217;s information to the reserves prepared by D&#38;M. Management is responsible for designing the internal control procedures used in the preparation of our oil and gas reserves, which include verification of data input into reserve forecasting and economics evaluation software, as well as multi-discipline management reviews. The internal reservoir engineering team reports directly to our Chief Operating Officer. In addition, our Board of Directors&#8217; Reserves and Health, Safety and Environmental (&#8220;HSE&#8221;) Committee, on behalf of the Board of Directors, oversees the qualifications, independence, performance and hiring of our independent petroleum engineering firm and reviews the final report and subsequent reporting of our oil and natural gas reserve estimates. The Chairman of the Reserves and HSE Committee holds a Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and bachelor&#8217;s degrees in Chemistry and Mathematics from Capital University in Ohio. He has more than 35 years of industry experience, with responsibilities including reserves preparation and approval. 

Oil and Natural Gas Reserve Estimates 

D&#38;M prepared estimates of our net proved oil and natural gas reserves as of December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 . See the summary of D&#38;M&#8217;s report as of December 31, 2015 , included as an exhibit to this Form 10-K. These estimates of reserves were prepared using an average price equal to the unweighted arithmetic average of hydrocarbon prices on the first day of each month within the 12-month period in accordance with rules and regulations of the SEC. These oil and natural gas reserve estimates do not include any value for probable or possible reserves that may exist, nor do they include any value for undeveloped acreage. The reserve estimates represent our net revenue interest in our properties. During 2015 , we provided oil and natural gas reserve estimates for 2014 &#32;to the United States Energy Information Agency that were substantially the same as the reserve estimates included in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014 . 

Our proved non-producing reserves primarily relate to reserves that are to be recovered from productive zones that currently require a response to performance modifications before they can be classified as proved developed producing. Since a majority of our properties are in areas with multiple pay zones, these properties may have both proved producing and proved non-producing reserves. 

As of December 31, 2015 , our estimated proved undeveloped reserves totaled approximately 59.2 &#32;MMBOE, or approximately 21% &#32;of our estimated total proved reserves, a decline &#32;of 39.7 &#32;MMBOE from December 31, 2014 &#32;levels for these reserves, which changes are discussed below. Approximately 85% (50 MMBOE) of our proved undeveloped oil reserves relate to our CO 2 &#32;tertiary operations. We generally consider the CO 2 &#32;tertiary proved undeveloped reserves to be lower risk than other proved undeveloped reserves that require drilling at locations offsetting existing production, because all of these proved undeveloped reserves are associated with tertiary recovery operations in fields and reservoirs that historically produced substantial volumes of oil under primary production. 

During 2015 , we spent approximately $65 million to convert 10.7 MMBOE of proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves, primarily related to continued tertiary development activities at Bell Creek, Heidelberg, and Brookhaven fields, as well as non-tertiary development at CCA. Other changes during 2015 &#32;included adding 2.2 MMBOE of proved undeveloped reserves primarily related to our non-tertiary operations at CCA; reclassifying 15.4 MMBOE of proved undeveloped reserves to unproved reserves pursuant to the five-year development rule established by the SEC primarily due to changes in our development plans; and recognizing other net downward proved undeveloped reserve revisions of 15.8 MMBOE, primarily the result of reserves that were determined to be uneconomic based on 2015 average oil and natural gas prices used in estimating our proved reserves, including approximately 35 Bcf (6 MMBOE) of Riley Ridge natural gas reserves. Included in the net downward revisions are positive performance revisions partially offsetting the decline in proved undeveloped reserves, primarily related to increased recovery factors at Tinsley and Oyster Bayou fields. 

As of December 31, 2015 , 30.0 MMBOE of our total proved undeveloped reserves are not scheduled to be developed within five years of initial booking, nearly all of which are part of CO 2 &#32;EOR projects. We believe these reserves satisfy the conditions to be included as proved reserves because (1) we have established and continue to follow the previously adopted development plan for each of these projects; (2) we have significant ongoing development activities in each of these CO 2 &#32;EOR projects and (3) we have a historical record of completing the development of comparable long-term projects.

The following table provides certain estimated proved reserve information in total and by category, as well as related pricing information as of December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 . There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves and their values, including many factors beyond our control. Proved oil and natural gas reserve quantities and values presented in the table reflect the significant decline in commodity prices between December 31, 2015 and 2014, whereby the average first-day-of-the-month NYMEX oil price used in estimating our proved reserves declined from $94.99 &#32;per Bbl at December 31, 2014, to $50.28 &#32;per Bbl at December 31, 2015, and for natural gas declined from $4.30 &#32;per MMBtu at December 31, 2014, to $2.63 &#32;per MMBtu at December 31, 2015. These commodity price changes resulted in a decline of approximately 126 &#32;MMBOE ( 29% ) in our proved reserves from December 31, 2014, through December 31, 2015, approximately half of which was attributable to natural gas reserves at Riley Ridge that were reclassified and are no longer considered proved reserves. See also Oil and Natural Gas Operations &#32;&#8211; Field Summary Table , Item 1A, Risk Factors &#8211; Estimating our reserves, production and future net cash flows is difficult to do with any certainty , and Supplemental Oil and Natural Gas Disclosures (Unaudited) &#32;to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of reserve inputs and changes between periods.

The reference prices were based on the arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month NYMEX commodity prices for each month during the respective year. These prices do not reflect adjustments for market differentials by field that are utilized in the preparation of our reserve report to arrive at the appropriate net price we receive, and also do not reflect the continued oil price declines in late 2015 and early 2016. In response to these price decreases, we have deferred our development spending for certain projects in 2016, which has been reflected in our December 31, 2015 reserve report.

(2) 

Determined based on the average first-day-of-the-month prices for each month, adjusted to prices received by field in accordance with standards set forth in the FASC. PV-10 Values and the Standardized Measure are significantly impacted by the oil prices we receive relative to NYMEX oil prices (our NYMEX oil price differential). The weighted-average oil price differentials utilized were $2.17 per Bbl below representative NYMEX oil prices as of December 31, 2015 , compared to $3.10 per Bbl below NYMEX oil prices as of December 31, 2014, and $3.41 per Bbl above NYMEX oil prices as of December 31, 2013 . 

(3) 

PV-10 Value is a non-GAAP measure and is different from the Standardized Measure in that PV-10 Value is a pre-tax number and the Standardized Measure is an after-tax number. The information used to calculate PV-10 Value is derived directly from data determined in accordance with FASC Topic 932. The difference between these two amounts, the discounted estimated future income tax, was $428.4 million &#32;at December 31, 2015 ; $2.84 billion &#32;at December 31, 2014 ; and $3.51 billion &#32;at December 31, 2013 . We believe that PV-10 Value is a useful supplemental disclosure to the Standardized Measure because the Standardized Measure can be impacted by a company&#8217;s unique tax situation, and it is not practical to calculate the Standardized Measure on a property-by-property basis. Because of this, PV-10 Value is a widely used measure within the industry and is commonly used by securities analysts, banks and credit rating agencies to evaluate the estimated future net cash flows from proved reserves on a comparative basis across companies or specific properties. PV-10 Value is commonly used by us and others in our industry to evaluate properties that are bought and sold and to assess the potential return on investment in our oil and natural gas properties. PV-10 Value is not a measure of financial or operating performance under GAAP, nor should it be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the Standardized Measure. Our PV-10 Value and the Standardized Measure do not purport to represent the fair value of our oil and natural gas reserves. See Glossary and Selected Abbreviation s for the definition of &#8220;PV-10 Value&#8221; and see Supplemental Oil and Natural Gas Disclosures (Unaudited) &#32;to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosures about the Standardized Measure.
