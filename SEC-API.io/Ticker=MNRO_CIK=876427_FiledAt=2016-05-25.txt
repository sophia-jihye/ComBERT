GENERAL 

&#65279; 

Monro is a chain of 1,029 Company-operated stores (as of March 2 6 , 201 6 ), 135 franchised location s and 14 dealer-operated stores providing automotive undercar repair and tire services in the United States. At March 2 6, 2016 , Monro operated Company stores in 25 states, including Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Vermont, Virginia, West Virginia and Wisconsin , primarily under the names &#8220;Monro Muffler Brake &#38; Service&#8221;, &#8220;Tread Quarters Discount Tire&#8221;, &#8220;Mr. Tire&#8221;, &#8220;Autotire Car Care Center&#8221;, &#8220;Tire Warehouse&#8221;, &#8220;Tire Barn Warehouse&#8221;, &#8220;Ken Towery&#8217;s Tire &#38; Auto Care&#8221; , &#8220;The Tire Choice&#8221; and &#8220;Car-X&#8221; (together, the &#8220;Company Stores&#8221;). Company Stores typically are situated in high-visibility locations in suburban areas and small towns, as well as in major metropolitan areas. Compa ny &#160; S to res serviced approximately 5.8 &#160; million vehicles in fiscal 201 6 . (References herein to fiscal years are to the Company's year ended fiscal March [e.g., references to "fiscal 201 6 " are to the Company's fiscal year ended March 2 6 , 201 6 ].) 

&#65279; 

The predecessor to the Company was founded by Charles J. August in 1957 as a Midas Muffler franchise in Rochester, New York, specializing in mufflers and exhaust systems. The Company was incorporated in the State of New York in 1959. In 1966, we discontinued our affiliation with Midas Muffler, and began to diversify into a full line of undercar repair services. An investor group led by Peter J. Solomon and Donald Glickman purchased a controlling interest in the Company in July 1984. At that time, Monro operated 59 stores, located primarily in upstate New York, with approximately $21 million in sales in fiscal 1984. Since 1984, we have continued our growth and have expanded our marketing area to include 24 additional states. 

&#65279; 

In December 1998, Monro appointed Robert G. Gross as President and Chief Executive Officer, who began full-time responsibilities on January 1, 1999. Effective October 1, 2012, Mr. Gross assumed the role of Executive Chairman and John W. Van Heel was appointed Chief Executive Officer. 

&#65279; 

The Company's principal executive offices are located at 200 Holleder Parkway, Rochester, New York 14615, and our telephone number is (585) 647-6400. 

&#65279; 

Monro provides a broad range of services on passenger cars, light trucks and vans for brakes; mufflers and exhaust systems; and steering, drive train, suspension and wheel alignment. Monro also provides other products and services, including tires and routine maintenance services, including state inspections. Monro specializes in the repair and replacement of parts which must be periodically replaced as they wear out. Normal wear on these parts generally is not covered by new car warranties. Monro typically does not perform under-the-hood repair services except for oil change services, various &#8220;flush and fill&#8221; services and some minor tune-up services. Monro does not sell parts or accessories to the do-it-yourself market. 

&#65279; 

All of the Company&#8217;s stores, except Tire Warehouse and Tire Barn Warehouse stores, provide the services described above. Tire Warehouse and Tire Barn Warehouse stores only sell tires and tire related services and alignments. However, a growing number of our stores are more specialized in tire replacement and service and, accordingly, have a higher mix of sales in the tire category. These stores are described below as tire stores, whereas the remaining stores are described as service stores. (See additional discussion under &#8220;Operating Strategy&#8221;.) At March 26, 2016, there were 515 stores de signated as service stores and 514 as tire stores. 

&#160;

&#65279; 

Our sales mix for fiscal 201 6 , 201 5 and 201 4 was as follows:

The Company has two wholly-owned subsidiar ies , Monro Service Corporation and Car-X, LLC. 

&#65279; 

Monro Service Corporation, a Delaware corporation qualified to do business in the states of Kentucky, Maryland, New Hampshire, New York and Virginia, holds all assets, rights, responsibilities and liabilities associated with our warehousing, purchasing, advertising, accounting, office services, payroll, cash management and certain other operations that are performed in the aforementioned states. We believe that this structure has enhanced operational efficiency and provides cost savings. 

&#65279; 

On April 25, 2015, we acquired the Car-X b rand, as well as the franchise rights for 146 auto service centers from Car-X Associates Corp. (See additional discussion under Note 2 to the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Financial Statements .) Car-X, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, operates as the franchisor through a standard royalty agreement, while Car-X remains a separate and independent brand and business with franchise operations based in Illinois. 

&#65279; 

A s of March 26, 2016, Monro had 134 Car-X franchised locations. 

&#65279; 

INDUSTRY OVERVIEW 

&#65279; 

According to industry reports, demand for automotive repair services, including undercar repair and tire services, has increased due to the general increase in the number of vehicles registered, the increase in the average age of vehicles and the increased complexity of vehicles, which makes it more difficult for a vehicle owner to perform do-it-yourself repairs. 

&#65279; 

At the same time as demand for automotive repair services has grown, the number of general repair outlets has decreased, principally because fewer gas stations now perform repairs, and because there are fewer new car dealers as a result of dealership closures by car manufacturers, such as Chrysler and General Motors. We believe that these factors present opportunities for increased sales by the Company, even though the number of specialized repair outlets (such as those operated by Monro and our direct competitors) has increased to meet growing demand. 

&#65279; 

EXPANSION STRATEGY 

&#65279; 

Monro has experienced significant growth in recent years due to acquisitions and, to a lesser extent, the opening of new stores. Management believes that the continued growth in sales and profits of the Company is dependent, in large part, upon our continued ability to open/acquire and operate new stores on a profitable basis. Overall profitability of the Company may not meet expectations if acquired or new stores do not attain expected profitability. 

&#65279; 

Monro believes that there are significant expansion opportunities in new as well as existing market areas, which may result from a combination of constructing stores on vacant land and acquiring existing store locations. We believe that, as the industry consolidates due to the increasingly complex nature of automotive repair, the expanded capital requirements for state-of-the-art equipment and aging of existing shop owners, there will be increasing opportunities for acquisitions of existing businesses or store structures. 

&#65279; 

&#160;

In that regard, we have completed several acquisitions, including:

_________________ 

(a) 

Generally, stores were closed because they failed to achieve or maintain an acceptable level of profitability or because a new Company Store was opened in the same market at a more favorable location. Additionally, in fiscal 2015, we closed the 34 remaining stores operated in BJ&#8217;s Wholesale Clubs. In fiscal 2012, we sold all of our seven stores in the Long Island market to Mavis Tire for $2.0 million. 

(b) 

Includes 40 stores acquired in the fiscal 2016 Acquisitions. 

(c) 

Includes 8 5 stores acquired in the fiscal 2015 Acquisitions. (Excludes the Kan Rock and Lentz stores that were never opened.) 

(d) 

Includes 24 stores acquired in the fiscal 2014 Acquisitions. 

(e) 

Includes 140 stores acquired in the fiscal 2013 Acquisitions. 

(f) 

Includes 32 stores acquired in the fiscal 2012 Acquisitions. 

&#65279; 

We plan to add approximately twenty to forty new greenfield stores in fiscal 201 7 and to pursue appropriate acquisition candidates. 

&#65279; 

Key factors in market and site selection for selecting new greenfield store locations include population, demographic characteristics, vehicle population and the intensity of competition. Monro attempts to cluster stores in market areas in order to achieve economies of scale in advertising, supervision and distribution costs. All new greenfield sites presently under consideration are within Monro's established market areas. 

&#65279; 

As a result of extensive analysis of our historical and projected store opening strategy, we have established major market profiles, as defined by market awareness: mature, existing and new markets. Over the next several years, we expect to build a greater percentage of stores in mature and existing markets in order to capitalize on our market presence and consumer awareness. During fiscal 201 6, 47 of the stores added (including acquired stores) were l ocated in existing markets and five stores were added in new markets. 

&#65279; 

We believe that management and operating improvements implemented over the last several fiscal years have enhanced our ability to sustain our growth. Monro has a chain-wide computerized inventory control and electronic point-of-sale (&#8220;POS&#8221;) management information system, which has increased management's ability to monitor operations as the number of stores has grown. 

&#65279; 

We have customized the POS system to specific service and tire store requirements and deploy the appropriate version in each type of store. Being Windows-based, the system has simplified training of new employees. Additionally, the system includes the following: 

&#65279; 

&#183; 

Electronic mail and electronic cataloging, which allows store managers to electronically research the specific parts needed for the make and model of the car being serviced; 

&#183; 

Electronic repair manuals that allow for instant access to a single source of accurate, up-to- date, original equipment manufacturer-direct diagnosis, repair and maintenance information; 

&#183; 

Software which contains data that mirrors the scheduled maintenance requirements in vehicle owner&#8217;s manuals, specifically by make, model, year and mileage for every major automobile brand. Management believes that this software facilitates the presentation and sale of scheduled maintenance services to customers; 

&#183; 

Streamlining of estimating and other processes; 

&#183; 

Graphic catalogs; 

&#183; 

A feature which facilitates tire searches by size; 

&#183; 

Direct mail support; 

&#183; 

Appointment scheduling; 

&#183; 

Customer service history; 

&#183; 

A thermometer graphic which guides store managers on the profitability of each job; 

&#160;

&#183; 

The ability to view inventory of up to the closest 14 stores or warehouse; and 

&#183; 

Expanded monitoring of price changes. This requires more specificity on the reason for a discount, which management believes helps to control discounting. 

&#65279; 

Enhancements will continue to be made to the POS system annually in an effort to increase efficiency, improve the quality and timeliness of store reporting and enable us to better serve our customers. 

&#65279; 

The financing to open a new greenfield service store location may be accomplished in one of three ways: a store lease for the land and building (in which case, land and building costs will be financed primarily by the lessor), a land lease with the building constructed by Monro (with building costs paid by Monro), or a land purchase with the building constructed by Monro. In all three cases, for service stores, each new store also will require approximatel y $ 225,000 for equipment (including a POS system a nd a truck) and approximately $ 55, 000 in inventory. Because we generally do not extend credit to our customers, stores generate almost no receivables and a new store's actual net working capital investment is nominal. Total capital required to open a new greenfield service s tore ranges, on average, from $ 360, 000 to $ 990, 000 depending on the location and which of the three financing methods is used. In general, tire stores are larger and have more service bays than Monro&#8217;s traditional service stores and, as a result, construction costs are at the high end of the range of new store construction costs. Total capital required to open a new greenfield tire (land and building leased) location costs, on average, approximately $ 600, 000, including $ 250, 000 for equipment and $ 150, 000 for inventory. In instances where Monro acquires an existing business, it may pay additional amounts for intangible assets such as customer lists, covenants not-to-compete, trade names and goodwill, but generally will pay less per bay for equipment and real property. 

&#65279; 

At March 2 6 , 201 6 , we leased the land and/or the building at approximately 69 % of our store locations and owned the land and building at the remaining locations. Monro's policy is to situate new stores in the best locations, without regard to the form of ownership required to develop the locations. 

&#65279; 

New service and tire stores, (excluding acquired stores), have a verage sales of approximately $ 40 0, 000 and $ 1,0 50 , 000 , respectively, in their fir st 12 months of operation, or $ 6 7 , 000 and $ 150, 000 , respectively, per bay. 

&#65279; 

STORE OPERATIONS 

&#65279; 

Store Format 

&#65279; 

The typical format for a Monro store is a free-standing building consisting of a sales area, fully-equipped service bays and a parts/tires storage area. Most service bays are equipped with above-ground electric vehicle lifts. Generally, each store is located within 25 miles of a &#8220;key&#8221; store which carries approximately double the inventory of a typical store and serves as a mini-distribution point for slower moving inventory for other stores in its area. Individual store sizes, number of bays and stocking levels vary greatly, even within the service and tire store groups, and are dependent primarily on the availability of suitable store locations, population, demographics and intensity of competition among other factors . (See additional discussion under &#8220;Store Additions and Closings&#8221;). A summary of average store data for service and tire stores is presented below:

&#65279; 

Data for the acquired ProCare service stores has been excluded because the stores&#8217; stock rooms are smaller than those in typical service stores and therefore, they generally carry approximately half the amount of inventory of a typical service store. 

&#65279; 

Data for the Tire Warehouse and Tire Barn Warehouse stores has been excluded because these locations primarily install new tires and wheels and many perform alignments. Additionally, most Tire Warehouse stores have one indoor service bay to perform alignments . The store building houses a waiting room, storage area and an area to mount and balance tires on the car&#8217;s wheels once the wheels and tires have been removed from the car. Removal of old tires and wheels from, and installation of new tires and wheels on, customers&#8217; cars are performed outdoors under a carport. The average inventory carried by the Tire Warehouse and Tire &#160; Barn Warehouse stores is $ 251, 000 per store. 

&#65279; 

Stores generally are situated in high-visibility locations in suburban areas, major metropolitan areas or small towns and offer easy customer access. The typical store is open from 7:30 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. on Monday through Friday and from 7:30 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. on Saturday. A majority of store locations are also open Sundays from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. 

&#160;

&#65279; 

Inventory Control and Management Information System 

&#65279; 

All Company Stores communicate daily with the central office and warehouse by computerized inventory control and electronic POS management information systems, which enable us to collect sales and operational data on a daily basis, to adjust store pricing to reflect local conditions and to control inventory on a near "real-time" basis. Additionally, each store has access, through the POS system, to the inventory carried by up t o the 14 stores o r warehouse nearest to it. Management believes that this feature improves customer satisfaction and store productivity by reducing the time required to locate out-of-stock parts and tires. It also improves profitability because it reduces the amount of inventory which must be purchased outside Monro from local vendors. 

&#65279; 

Quality Control and Warranties 

&#65279; 

To maintain quality control, we conduct audits to rate our employees' telephone sales manner and the accuracy of pricing information given. 

&#65279; 

We have a customer survey program to monitor customer attitudes toward service quality, friendliness, speed of service, and several other factors for each store. Customer concerns are addressed by customer service and field management personnel. 

&#65279; 

Monro uses a &#8220;Double Check for Accuracy Program&#8221; as part of our routine store procedures. This quality assurance program requires that a technician and supervisory-level employee independently inspect a customer&#8217;s vehicle, diagnose and document the necessary repairs, and agree on an estimate before presenting it to a customer. This process is formally documented on the written estimate by store personnel. 

&#65279; 

We are an active member of the Automotive Maintenance &#38; Repair Association (&#8220;AMRA&#8221;). AMRA is an organization of automotive retailers, wholesalers and manufacturers which was established as part of an industry-wide effort to address the ethics and business practices of companies in the automotive repair industry through the Motorist Assurance Program (&#8220;MAP&#8221;). Participating companies commit to improving consumer confidence and trust in the automotive repair industry by adopting &#8220;Uniform Inspection Communication Standards&#8221; (&#8220;UICS&#8221;) established by MAP. These &#8220;UICS&#8221; are available in our stores and serve to provide consistent recommendations to customers in the diagnosis and repair of a vehicle. 

&#65279; 

We offer limited warranties on substantially all of the products and services that we provide. We believe that these warranties are competitive with industry practices and serve as a marketing tool to increase repeat business at our stores. 

&#65279; 

Store Personnel and Training 

&#65279; 

Monro supervises store operations primarily through our Divisional Vice Presidents who oversee Zone Managers who, in turn, oversee Market Managers. The typical service store is staffed by a Store Manager and four to six technicians, one of whom serves as the Assistant Manager. The typical tire store, except Tire Warehouse and Tire Barn stores, is staffed by a Store Manager, an Assistant Manager and/or Service Manager, and four to eight technicians. Larger volume service and tire stores may also have one or two sales people. The higher staffing level at many tire stores is necessary to support their higher sales volume. Tire Warehouse and Tire Barn stores are generally staffed by a Store Manager and two to four technicians, one of whom serves as the Assistant Manager. All Store Managers receive a base salary and Assistant Managers receive either hourly or salaried compensation. In addition, Store Managers and Assistant Managers may receive other compensation based on their store's customer relations, gross profit, labor cost controls, safety, sales volume and other factors via a monthly or quarterly bonus based on performance in these areas. 

&#65279; 

We believe that the ability to recruit and retain qualified technicians is an important competitive factor in the automotive repair industry, which has historically experienced a high turnover rate. We make a concerted effort to recruit individuals who will have a long-term commitment to the Company and offer an hourly rate structure and additional compensation based on productivity; a competitive benefits package including health, dental, life and disability insurance; a 401(k)/profit-sharing plan; as well as the opportunity to advance within the Company. Many of our Store Managers and Market Managers started with the Company as technicians. 

&#65279; 

Many of our new technicians join the Company in their early twenties as trainees or apprentices. As they progress, many are promoted to technician and eventually master technician, the latter requiring Automotive Service Excellence (&#8220;ASE&#8221;) certification in eight different categories . We offer a tool purchase program through which trainee technicians can acquire their own set of tools. We also will reimburse technicians for the cost of ASE certification registration fees and test fees and encourage all technicians to become certified by providing a higher hourly wage rate following their certification. 

&#65279; 

Our training program provides multiple training sessions to both Store Managers and technicians in each store, each year. 

&#65279; 

&#160;

Management training courses are developed and delivered by our dedicated training department and Operations management, and are supplemented with live and on-line vendor training courses. Management training covers safety, customer service, sales, human resources (counseling, recruiting, interviewing, etc.), leadership, scheduling, financial and operational areas, and is delivered on a regular basis. We believe that involving Operations management in the development and delivery of these sessions results in more relevant and actionable training for Store Managers, and helps to improve overall performance and staff retention. 

&#65279; 

Our training department develops and coordinates technical training courses on critical areas of automotive repair to Monro technicians (e.g. Antilock braking systems (&#8220;ABS&#8221;) brake repair, drivability, tire pressure monitoring system (&#8220;TPMS&#8221;), etc.) and also conducts required technical training to maintain compliance with state inspection licenses, where applicable, and AMRA/MAP accreditation. Additionally, our training department holds periodic field technical clinics for store personnel and coordinates technician attendance at technical clinics offered by our vendors. We have electronic repair manuals installed in all of our stores for daily reference. We also issue technical bulletins to all stores on innovative or complex repair processes, and maintain a centralized database for technical repair problems. In addition, Monro has established a telephone technical help line to provide assistance to store personnel in resolving problems encountered while diagnosing and repairing vehicles. The help line is available during all hours of store operation. 

&#65279; 

Monro also maintains an employee website that contains many resources for both managers and technicians to reference including Human Resource information and forms. Additionally, there is a Facilities section containing important environmental and equipment information, as well as a Training section that contains training programs and documents for both managers and technicians. 

&#65279; 

OPERATING STRATEGY 

&#65279; 

Monro's operating strategy is to provide our customers with a wide range of dependable, high-quality automotive services at a competitive price by emphasizing the following key elements. 

&#65279; 

Products and Services 

&#65279; 

The typical store provides a full range of undercar repair services for brakes, steering, mufflers and exhaust systems, drive train, suspension and wheel alignment, as well as tire replacement and service. These services apply to all makes and models of domestic and foreign cars, light trucks and vans. As a percentage of sales, the service stores provide significantly more brake and exhaust service s than tire stores, and tire stores provide substantially more tire replacement and related services than service stores. 

&#65279; 

Stores generally provide many of the routine maintenance services (except engine diagnostic), which automobile manufacturers suggest or require in the vehicle owner&#8217;s manuals, and which fulfill manufacturers&#8217; requirements for new car warranty compliance. We offer "Scheduled Maintenance" services in our stores whereby the aforementioned services are packaged and offered to consumers based upon the year, make, model and mileage of each specific vehicle. Management believes that we are able to offer this service in a more convenient and cost competitive fashion than auto dealers can provide. 

&#65279; 

Included in maintenance services are oil change services, heating and cooling system "flush and fill" service, belt installation, fuel system service and a transmission "flush and fill" service. Additionally, most stores replace and service batteries, starters and alternators. Stores in Georgia, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Missouri, New Hampshire, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, West Virginia and Wisconsin perform annual sta te inspections. Approximately 63 % of our stores also offer air conditioning services. 

&#65279; 

The format of the Tire Warehouse and Tire Barn Warehouse stores are slightly different from Monro&#8217;s typical service or tire stores (as described a bove) in that, generally, over 9 3 % of the stores&#8217; sales involve tire services, including the mounting and balancing of tires, and the sale of road hazard warranties. Most of these stores also provide the installatio n of wiper blades. Currently, 70% of Tire Warehouse and 87% of Tire Barn Warehouse stores perform alignments. In fiscal year 201 7 , Monro plans to expand the number of Tire Warehouse and Tire Barn Warehouse stores offering alignme nt services to 83% of total stores. 

&#65279; 

Customer Satisfaction 

&#65279; 

Monro&#8217;s vision of being the dominant auto service provider in the markets we serve is supported by a set of values displayed in each Company Store emphasizing TRUST: 

&#65279; 

&#183; 

T otal Customer Satisfaction 

&#183; 

R espect, Recognize and Reward (employees who are committed to these values) 

&#183; 

U nparalleled Quality and Integrity 

&#183; 

S uperior Value and 

&#183; 

T eamwork 

&#65279; 

&#160;

Also displayed in each Company Store are guiding principles in support of our commitment to customer service: only present needed work; fix vehicles right the first time; complete vehicle service on time; and exceed the customer&#8217;s expectations. 

&#65279; 

Additionally, each Company-operated store operates under the following set of customer satisfaction principles: free inspection of brakes, tires, shocks, front end and exhaust systems (as applicable); item-by-item review with customers of problem areas; free written estimates; written guarantees; drive-in service without an appointment; fair and reasonable prices; a 30-day best price guarantee; and repairs by professionally-trained undercar and tire specialists. (See additional discussion under &#8220;Store Operations: Quality Control and Warranties&#8221;.) 

&#65279; 

Competitive Pricing, Advertising and Co-branding Initiatives 

&#65279; 

Monro seeks to set competitive prices for quality services and products. &#160; We support our pricing strategy with special offers and coupon s distributed through a variety of channels including: &#160; direct mail , email, digital advertising, newspaper, p romotional store signage and in- store displays. In addition, to increase consumer awareness of the services we offer, Monro advertises through radio, cable television and yellow page advertising . &#160; Our digital marketing efforts include paid and organic search on all major sea rch engines, search remarketing and banner and mobile advertising. &#160; We also manage social media profiles on a variety of platforms. &#160; 

&#65279; 

Our websites include www.Monro.com , www.MrTire.com , www.TQTire.com , www.AutoTire.com , www.TireWarehouse.net , www.KenTowery.com , www.TireBarn.com , www.CurrysAuto.com , and www.TheTireChoice.com . These sites help customers search for store locations, print coupons, make service appointments, shop for tires and access information on our services and products, as well as car care tips. 

&#65279; 

Monro currently maintains mobile apps on the iPhone and Android platforms for the Monro, Mr. Tire , Tire Warehouse , &#160; and The Tire Choice brands. &#160; Our mobile apps enable customers to manage vehicle service records on their smart phones and access information, coupons and specials, as they do on our websites. 

&#65279; 

Centralized Control 

&#65279; 

While we both operate and franchise stores, we believe that direct operation of stores enhances our ability to compete by providing centralized control of such areas of operations as service quality, store appearance, promotional activity and pricing. We also believe our experience in operating stores makes us a more valuable partner to our franchisees. A high level of competence is maintained throughout the Company, as we require, as a condition of employment, that employees participate in periodic training programs, including sales, management, customer service and changes in automotive technology. Additionally, purchasing, distribution, merchandising, advertising, accounting and other store support functions are centralized primarily in Monro's corporate headquarters in Rochester, New York, and are provided through our subsidiary, Monro Service Corporation. The centralization of these functions results in efficiencies and gives management the ability to closely monitor and control costs. 

&#65279; 

Comprehensive Training 

&#65279; 

We provide ongoing, comprehensive training to our store employees. We believe that such training provides a competitive advantage by enabling our technicians to provide quality service to our customers in all areas of undercar repair and tire service. (See additional discussion under &#8220;Store Operations: Store Personnel and Training&#8221;.) 

&#65279; 

PURCHASING AND DISTRIBUTION 

&#65279; 

Through our wholly-owned subsidiary Monro Service Corporation, we select and purchase tires, parts and supplies for all Company-operated stores on a centralized basis through an automatic replenishment system. Although purchases outside the centralized system (&#8220;outside purchases&#8221;) are made when needed at the store level, these purchases are low by industry standards, a nd accounted for approximately 2 2 % of all parts and tires used in fiscal 201 6 . 

&#65279; 

Our ten largest vendo rs accounted for approximately 76 % of our parts and tire purchases, with the largest vendo r accounting for approximately 22 % of total stocking purchases in fiscal 201 6 . In fiscal 201 6 , Monro imported approximately 27 % of our parts , oil and tire purchases. We purchase part s and tires from approximately 110 vendors. Management believes that our relationships with vendors are excellent and that alternative sources of supply exist, at comparable cost, for substantially all parts used in our business. We routinely obtain bids from vendors to ensure we are receiving competitive pricing and terms. 

&#65279; 

&#160;

Most parts are shipped by vendors to our primary warehouse facility in Rochester, New York, and are distributed to stores by the Monro-operated tractor/trailer fleet. The majority of tires are shipped to our stores directly by vendors pursuant to orders placed by our headquarters staff. During fiscal 2013, we completed an expansion of our Rochester warehouse from 80,000 square feet to 135,000 square feet. Stores are replenished at least bi-weekly from this warehouse, and such re plenishment fills, on average, 97 % of all items ordered by the stores' automatic POS-driven replenishment system. The Rochester wa rehouse stocks approximately 3,7 00 SKUs. Monro also operates warehouses in Maryland, Virginia, New Hampshire and Kentucky. These warehouses carry, on average, 1,100; 2 00; 7 00 and 4 00 SKUs, respectively. 

&#65279; 

We enter into contracts with certain parts and tire suppliers, some of which require us t o buy (at market prices) up to 1 0 0% of our annual purchases of specific products. These agreements expire at various dates through July 2017. We believe these agreements provide us with high quality, branded merchandise at preferred pricing, along with strong marketing and training support. 

&#65279; 

COMPETITION 

&#65279; 

Monro competes in the retail automotive service and tire industry. This industry is generally highly competitive and fragmented, and the number, size and strength of competitors vary widely from region to region. We believe that competition in this industry is based on customer service and reputation, store location, name awareness and price. Monro's primary competitors include national and regional undercar, tire specialty and general automotive service chains, both franchised and company-operated; car dealerships, mass merchandisers&#8217; operating service centers; and, to a lesser extent, gas stations, independent garages and Internet tire sellers. Monro considers TBC Corporation (operating under the NTB, Merchant&#8217;s Tire, Midas and Tire Kingdom brands), Firestone Complete Auto Care service stores and Meineke Discount Mufflers Inc. to be direct competitors. In most of the new markets that we have entered, at least one competitor was already present. In identifying new markets, we analyze, among other factors, the intensity of competition. (See "Expansion Strategy&#8221; and &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations".) 

&#65279; 

EMPLOYEES 

&#65279; 

As of March 2 6 , 201 6, Monro had 6,725 employees, of whom 6,347 were emplo yed in the field organization, 116 we re employed at the warehouses, 213 were employed at our corporate headqua rters and 49 were employed in other offices. Monro's employees are not members of any union. We believe that our relations with our employees are good. 

&#65279; 

REGULATION 

&#65279; 

We are subject to various federal, state and local laws and governmental regulations relating to the operation of our business, including those governing workplace safety, zoning and the handling, storage and disposal of hazardous substances contained in the products that we sell and use in our service bays, the recycling of batteries, tires and used lubricants, and the ownership and operation of real property. We maintain programs to facilitate compliance with these laws and regulations. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with all applicable environmental and other laws and regulations , and that the cost of such compliance is not material to the Company. 

&#65279; 

Monro stores new oil and recycled antifreeze and generates and/or handles used tires and automotive oils, antifreeze and certain solvents, which are disposed of by licensed third-party contractors. In certain states, as required, we also recycle oil filters. Thus, we are subject to a number of federal, state and local environmental laws including the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (&#8220;CERCLA&#8221;). In addition, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (the "EPA"), under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ("RCRA"), and various state and local environmental protection agencies regulate our handling and disposal of waste. The EPA, under the Clean Air Act, also regulates the installation of catalytic converters by Monro and all other repair stores by periodically spot checking repair jobs, and has the power to fine businesses that use improper procedures or materials. The EPA has the authority to impose sanctions, including civil penalties up to $ 37,5 00 per violation (or up to $ 37,5 00 per day for certain willful violations or failures to cooperate with authorities), for violations of RCRA and the Clean Air Act. 

&#65279; 

Monro is environmentally conscious, and takes advantage of recycling opportunities at our offices, warehouses and stores. Cardboard, plastic shrink wrap and parts&#8217; cores are returned to the warehouse by the stores on Monro stock trucks. There, they are accumulated for sale to recycling companies or returned to parts manufacturers for credit. 

&#65279; 

SEASONALITY 

&#65279; 

Although our business is not highly seasonal, customers do purchase more undercar service during the period of March through October than the period of November through February, when miles driven tend to be lower. In the tire stores, the better sales months are typically May through August, and October through December. The slowest months are typically January through April and September. As a result, profitability is typically lower during slower sales months, or months where mix is more heavily weighted toward tires, which is a lower margin category. Additionally, since our stores are primarily located in the northeastern and midwestern United States, profitability tends to be lower in the winter months when certain costs, such as utilities and snow plowing, are typically higher. 

&#160;

&#65279;
