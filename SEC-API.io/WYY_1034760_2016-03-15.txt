Cert-on-Device enables an enterprise to attain a greater level of network security than user authentication alone by ensuring that only authorized devices connect to an organization's IT infrastructure. We believe that Cert-on-Device presents us with a unique opportunity to expand our business as we transition into the sales and implementation stage of the opportunity following delays in product development. We are currently working with leading suppliers and manufacturers of mobile devices to develop and demonstrate mobile devices with this capability built-in as a ready feature and to accommodate other device operating systems and working to generate sales.

Strategic Vision 

&#160;

Our objective is to grow our business profitably as a premier technology-based provider of both product and service enterprise solutions to the public and private sectors. We are working to improve our profitability and cash flows by focusing our efforts on selling our higher margin services and de-emphasizing some of our lower margin services. We are also working to develop a more streamlined sales process in order to increase our market penetration.

&#160;

Recent advances in communications technology have significantly improved the storage, speed and frequency of communications and the complexity of these devices and enabled rapid proliferation of mobile computing and communications devices. These technological advances increased the speed of business transactions across the globe, but it also introduced many security threats to an organizations critical data and communications infrastructure. The number of security incidents across the globe are affecting small and large organizations and these incidents are growing in frequency and causing financial and reputational harm for many companies. This presents a significant opportunity for us to provide a solution.

&#160;

&#160; 3 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

We believe our portfolio of solutions including Cert-on-Device, Derived Credentialing and other mobile credentialing solutions address access to multi-level secure resources and message traffic based on entity identity, roles and privileges that can be validated by any logical and/or physical access point on a multitude of devices. We have partnered with several key communications equipment manufacturers, telecommunications carriers and other IT based partners to improve our reach into our target markets and to provide a more integrated market-ready solution that is accessible by our end users and compliant with our customers security and information requirements.

&#160;

Our challenge is reaching potential customers and in order to gain market penetration as an organization capable of meeting commercial and government clients technology asset and risk management objectives without significantly increasing their operating costs and allowing these organizations to focus on running their business.

&#160;

Our strategies for achieving our objective to grow our business profitably include the following:

&#160;

1. Focus on Selling Higher Margin Services. While we have been successful in the past of growing our revenues and increasing our market penetration, our growth has largely been driven by low margin services. We intend to re-focus our business efforts to pursue and focus our organization on driving sales of higher margin services. &#160;

2. Gain Market Acceptance of Cert-on-Device. We are working to gain market acceptance of our Cert-on-Device product, which we believe is a significant opportunity for us. We have been working to establish key partnerships with device manufacturers, telecommunication carriers and other IT solution providers in order to have such as Cert-on-Device and our other products included in product offerings. &#160;

3. Retain and Cross-Sell Existing Customer Base. Many of our professional staff work on-site or work in close proximity with our customers and we develop close customer relationships and are often able to enhance our customers&#8217; operations by rapidly identifying and developing solutions for customer-specific requirements. We intend to continue to deliver product and service solutions to meet or exceed customer expectations and recommend complementary product and service solutions that will meet the business objectives of our customers. &#160;

4. Attract New Customers by Referral and Expertise. We intend to leverage our long-term relationships with our existing customers to reach new customers in our target markets. We also intend to use our past performance reputation within the federal, state and local government agencies and corporate customers to attract new customers. We also are working to grow our distribution channels and reach through alliances with telecommunications carriers and organizations that feature national or transnational sales and marketing networks and resources that can feature our unique offerings as part of their respective products and services portfolios. &#160;

5. Improving Our Sales Process. We are working to improve our sales process in order to generate additional sales leads and efficiently pursue opportunities in order to focus our efforts on genuine sales opportunities. We have been working to train our staff on the technical aspects of our product offerings in order to penetrate the IT departments of organizations. &#160;

&#160; 4 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

6. Attracting, Training and Retaining Highly Skilled Professionals. We continue to attract, train and retain highly skilled professionals, including engineers, scientists, analysts, technicians and support specialists, to ensure that we have the capabilities to fulfill our customers&#8217; requirements. We target candidates who have served in the military or as civilian experts, as well as those who are leading specialists in their technology disciplines. We believe we can continue to retain our employees by offering competitive compensation and benefit plans, opportunities for career growth through company-supported education programs and diverse and challenging assignments. &#160;

7. Pursuing Strategic Acquisitions. We may strategically acquire businesses that provide value-added solutions for our present service offerings and customer base. We will also selectively pursue strategic acquisitions of businesses that can cost-effectively further broaden our domain expertise and service solutions to our customers and allow us to establish relationships with new customers or enter new target markets. &#160; 

Competition 

&#160;

Our competitive market is highly fragmented and subject to rapid technological change driven in part by periodic introductions of new technologies and devices. We compete with companies from a variety of market sectors, including publicly and privately held firms, large accounting and consulting firms, systems consulting and implementation firms, application software firms, service groups of computer equipment companies and other general management consulting firms. We also compete regularly with offshore outsourcing companies, and we expect competition from these companies to increase in the future, especially on development, application management services and outsourcing engagements. In addition, we and other technology and outsourced service providers compete with internally developed communications management solutions. We believe that the major competitive factors in our marketplace are distinctive technical competencies, governmental certifications and approvals to operate within this space, successful past contract performance, price of services, reputation for quality, and key management personnel with domain expertise.

&#160;

Our key competitors currently include Tangoe, Inc., Calero, KEYW Holding Corporation, Verisign, Identrust, SureID, DigiCert, Entrust, and other organizations; all of which have varying specialties within the telecommunications market place. Due to our significant federal government contract concentrations we also experience competition from a variety of both large and small companies, including divisions of large federal government integrators such as Lockheed Martin Corporation, Northrop Grumman Corporation, and other large and mid-sized federal contractors, as well as a limited number of small to mid-sized subject matter expert organizations offering specialized capabilities within the identity management space. The same companies that are our competitors will, at times, team with us or subcontract with us in the pursuit of new business.

&#160;

Many of our competitors have greater resources than us and are often able to offer more scale, which in some instances has enabled them to significantly discount their services in exchange for revenues in other areas or at later dates. Many of our competitors are heavily discounting their services to unprofitable levels in an effort to maintain market share and push other competitors out of the market and then turn around and raise prices for its captive customer base. This type of pricing behavior affects the entire market, creates a commodity pricing environment that directly affects the level of services that can be delivered to meet the customers&#8217; requirements and ensure a reasonable return for the service provider. If we are unable to keep pace with the intense competition in our marketplace, deliver cost-effective and relevant solutions to our target market, our business, financial condition and results of operations will suffer.

Marketing and Sales 

&#160;

We engage in a wide variety of marketing activities designed to broaden market awareness of our solutions, including e-mail and direct mail campaigns, co-marketing strategies designed to leverage existing strategic relationships, website marketing, topical webcasts, public relations campaigns, speaking engagements and forums and industry analyst visibility initiatives. We participate in and sponsor conferences that cater to our target market and demonstrate and promote our software and services at trade shows targeted to information technology and finance executives. We also publish white papers relating to communications life cycle management issues and develop customer reference programs, such as customer case studies, in an effort to promote better awareness of industry issues and demonstrate that our solutions can address many of these risks to an organization.

&#160;

In the U.S. market we market and sell our solutions primarily through our direct sales force and through indirect distribution channel partners. Outside of the U.S. we market and sell our solutions through indirect distribution channel partners. We market our solutions through our direct sales force and alliances with several strategic partners in specific industries. The direct sales force, in concert with our operations managers, is responsible for providing highly responsive, quality service and ensuring client satisfaction. Strategic partnerships and alliances provide us with additional access to potential clients. Our marketing strategy is to build our brand and increase market awareness of our solutions in our target markets and to generate qualified sales leads that will allow successfully build strong relationships with key decision markers involved in the sales process on the customer side that typically consists of information technology executives, finance executives and managers of communications assets and networks. The sales process can take a year or more to cultivate and close depending on the prospective customer&#8217;s timetable and urgency.

&#160;

Our marketing and sales team has a wide variety of skills and expertise to cultivate qualified leads and guide our prospective customers towards finding a solution that meets their organization&#8217;s goals and objectives.

&#160; 

Clients 

&#160;

We derive a significant amount of our revenues from contracts funded by federal government agencies for which we act in capacity as the prime contractor, or as a subcontractor. We believe that contracts with federal government agencies in particular, will be a significant source of our revenues for the foreseeable future although we are working as part of our strategic re-focus to increase our footprint with non-government clients. Accordingly, changes in federal government fiscal or spending policies or the U.S. defense budget could directly affect our financial performance. Additionally, certain factors outside of our control including but not limited to potential delays in receiving task orders against our U.S Department of Homeland Security Blanket Purchase Agreement may materially affect the amount and timing of revenues we recognize and cause variability in our earnings in the short term.

&#160;

We expect our federal customers to be motivated to meet their organizational missions and objectives and also minimize costs in this challenging environment. We believe these actions may result in lower profit margins across the federal contracting industry in whole if government spending in all areas is reduced. We believe that the federal government&#8217;s spending will remain stable in key areas in which we are well positioned, including mobile telecommunications capabilities that serve to reduce and optimize spending; and in select cyber security initiatives that support trusted, cloud-based, secured-transmission solutions to both protect critical communications and infrastructure, and to do so in a cost-justified manner.

&#160;

Our government client base is located predominantly in the Mid-Atlantic region of the U.S. while our commercial client base is located throughout the continental U.S., Europe and the Middle East. Historically, we have derived, and may continue to derive in the future, a significant percentage of our total revenues from a relatively small number of federal government contracts.

&#160;

Due to the nature of our business and the relative size of certain contracts which are entered into in the ordinary course of business, the loss of any single significant customer would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In future periods, we will continue to focus on diversifying our revenue by increasing the number of commercial customer contracts.

&#160;

&#160;

Government Contracts 

&#160;

We have numerous government contracts and contract vehicles. Contract vehicles include Government Wide Acquisition Contracts (&#8220;GWACs&#8221;), Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (&#8220;ID/IQ&#8221;) contracts, and Blanket Purchase Agreements (&#8220;BPAs&#8221;) based upon General Services Administration (&#8220;GSA&#8221;) Schedule rates. Our major prime contracts are with various departments of the Department of Defense (&#8220;DoD&#8221;), the Department of Homeland Security (&#8220;DHS&#8221;), the Centers for Disease Control (&#8220;CDC&#8221;), and Department of Health and Human Services (&#8220;DHHS&#8221;). We also hold a number of ID/IQ contracts that extend our capability to expand our revenue base, including, but not limited to:

&#160;

&#167; Federal Supply Schedule for Management, Organizational and Business Improvement Services (&#8220;MOBIS&#8221;), the Federal Supply Schedule for Professional Engineering Services (&#8220;PES&#8221;), and the Solutions and More (&#8220;SAM&#8221;) contract. &#160;

&#167; DHHS Telecommunications Inventory and Expense Management Solutions contract. &#160;

&#167; The Department of Justice (&#8220;DOJ&#8221;) Information Technology Support Services (&#8220;ITSS&#8221;) 3 contract. &#160;

&#167; The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Explosive Reference Tool (EXPeRT). &#160;

&#167; Subsidiaries of WidePoint are approved subcontractors for the following ID/IQ contracts: &#160;

o GSA Alliant Small Business o GSA Networx o GSA Connections II o National Institutes of Health Chief Information Officer Solutions and Partners (CIO-SP3) o Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Program Management and Support Services (PMSS) o Solutions for Enterprise-Wide Procurement (SEWP) &#160;

We also have various relationships with other contractors that allow us to act as a subcontractor, thereby providing us access to various other contracts and contract vehicles in biometrics and identity management infrastructure support, and Information Technology Support Services.

&#160;

Our contracts with the federal government, and many contracts with other entities, permit the government client to modify, curtail or terminate the contract at any time for the convenience of the government, or for default by the contractor. If a contract is terminated for convenience, we are generally reimbursed for our allowable costs through the date of termination and are paid a proportionate amount of the stipulated profit or fee attributable to the work actually performed.

&#160; 

Product Development and Technology Solution Enhancements 

&#160;

We may fund certain product development initiatives to enhance or customize existing client facing platforms and software solutions. These initiatives are aimed at improving the efficiency and effectiveness of our software solutions and our customizing a solution to meet our customer&#8217;s organizational requirements, if necessary. We determine which enhancements to further develop after assessing the market capabilities sought by potential customers, considering technological advances, feedback on enhancements from our current customer user groups and other factors. Our current research and development activities are focused on the integration of our software based platforms, certain enhancements to improve the delivery of our information technology services delivered through these platforms and Cert-on-Device.

&#160;

&#160; 7 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

We utilized our proven federally authorized credentialing infrastructure to develop a mobile certificate solution that enables an organization to assign different levels of access to employees, consultants, and trading partners, based on the specific BYOD device being used to establish a connection with an organizations infrastructure. Our Cert-on-Device and other device oriented credentialing service enables an organization to provide secure virtual private network access through a mobile device, prohibit sensitive data downloads to unauthorized devices and prevent downloads from protected devices, and enable remote revocation of credentials that have been lost or stolen or being to an individual no longer with the organization the credential is linked.

&#160;

We utilize a standard architecture with centralized technology oversight to ensure enhancements are subject to appropriate oversight and scrutiny and a consistent and efficient process. Our development team is comprised of professionals with hands-on technical and practical client-side development experience. We believe this allows us to design and deploy enhancements that can resolve real-world problems in a timely manner.

&#160;

We funded and expensed strategic product development initiatives including Certificate-on-Device, derived credentialing and other credentialing offerings as well as platform and portal integrations and other product and portal enhancements totaling approximately $673,000 in 2015, $480,100 in 2014 and $74,000 in 2013. In 2016, we will continue to work with our strategic partners to continue and focus our product development efforts as well as with client integrations.

&#160;

Data Centers 

&#160;

We host our proprietary solutions and operate all servers, systems and networks at 5 data centers located in Ohio, North Carolina and Virginia. Our agreements with our customers contain guarantees regarding specified levels of system availability, and we regularly provide our customers with performance reports against those standards. We deploy monitoring technology that continuously checks the servers and key underlying components at regular intervals for availability and performance, ensuring availability to our customers. Each data center provides security measures, redundant environmental controls, fire suppression systems and redundant electrical generators. To facilitate data loss recovery, we operate a multi-tiered system configuration with load-balanced web server pools, replicated database servers and fault-tolerant storage devices. The architecture is designed to ensure near real-time data recovery in the event of a malfunction of a primary server. Based on customer requirements, we can also provide near real-time asynchronous data replication between operational and disaster recovery backup sites.

&#160;

Intellectual Property 

&#160;

Our intellectual property rights are important to our business. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, service mark, trade secret and other rights in the United States and other jurisdictions, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology, processes and other intellectual property. We protect our intellectual property rights in a number of ways including entering into confidentiality and other written agreements with our employees, customers, consultants and partners in an attempt to control access to and distribution of our software, documentation and other proprietary technology and other information. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, third parties may, in an unauthorized manner, attempt to use, copy or otherwise obtain and market or distribute our intellectual property rights or technology or otherwise develop software or services with the same functionality as our software and services.

&#160;

&#160; 8 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

U.S. patent filings are intended to provide the holder with a right to exclude others from making, using, selling or importing in the United States the inventions covered by the claims of granted patents. Our patents, including our pending patents, if granted, may be contested, circumvented or invalidated. Moreover, the rights that may be granted in those issued and pending patents may not provide us with proprietary protection or competitive advantages, and we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing those patents. Therefore, the exact benefits of our issued patents and, if issued, our pending patents and the other steps that we have taken to protect our intellectual property cannot be predicted with certainty.

&#160; 

Seasonality 

&#160;

Our business is not seasonal. However, our revenues and operating results may vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter, due to revenues earned on contracts, the number of billable days in a quarter, the timing of the pass-through of other direct costs, the commencement and completion of contracts during any particular quarter; as well as the schedule of the government agencies for awarding contracts, the term of each contract that we have been awarded and general economic conditions. Because a significant portion of our expenses, such as personnel and facilities costs, are fixed in the short term, successful contract performance and variation in the volume of activity as well as in the number of contracts commenced or completed during any quarter may cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter.

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately 300 full-time employees. We periodically engage additional consultants and employ temporary employees. The majority of our offices are located in areas populated by military personnel (both retired and active duty), and highly-skilled civilian personnel. Potential employees possessing the unique qualifications required are readily available for both part-time and full-time employment. The primary method of soliciting personnel is through recruiting resources directly utilizing all known sources including electronic databases, public forums, and personal networks of friends and former co-workers.

&#160;

We believe that our future success will depend in part on our continued ability to offer market competitive compensation packages to attract and retain highly skilled, highly motivated and disciplined managerial, technical, sales and support personnel. We generally do not have employment contracts with our employees, but we do selectively maintain employment agreements with key employees. In addition, confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements are in place with many of our customer, employees and consultants and such agreements are included in our policies and procedures. None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that our relations with our employees are good.

&#160;
