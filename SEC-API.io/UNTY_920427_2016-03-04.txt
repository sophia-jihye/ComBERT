Gene ral 

&#160; 

Unity Bancorp, Inc., (the "Company" or "Registrant"), is a bank holding company incorporated under the laws of the State of New Jersey to serve as a holding company for Unity Bank (the &#8220;Bank&#8221;). The Company was organized at the direction of the Board of Directors of the Bank for the purpose of acquiring all of the capital stock of the Bank. Pursuant to the New Jersey Banking Act of 1948 (the "Banking Act"), and pursuant to approval of the shareholders of the Bank, the Company acquired the Bank and became its holding company on December 1, 1994. The only significant activity of the Company is ownership and supervision of the Bank. The Company also owns 100% of the common equity of Unity (NJ) Statutory Trust II and Unity (NJ) Statutory Trust III. The trusts have issued $10.3 million and $5.2 million of preferred securities to investors, respectively. 

&#160; 

The Bank opened for business on September 16, 1991. The Bank received its charter from the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance on September 13, 1991. The Bank is a full-service commercial bank, providing a wide range of business and consumer financial services through its main office in Clinton, New Jersey and fourteen New Jersey branches located in Clinton, Edison, Flemington, Highland Park, Linden, Middlesex, North Plainfield, Phillipsburg, Scotch Plains, Somerset, South Plainfield, Union, Washington and Whitehouse. In addition, the Bank has one Pennsylvania branch located in Forks Township. The Bank's primary service area encompasses the Route 22/Route 78 corridors between the Forks Township, Pennsylvania office and its Linden, New Jersey branch. 

&#160; 

The principal executive offices of the Company are located at 64 Old Highway 22, Clinton, New Jersey 08809, and the telephone number is (800) 618-2265. The Company&#8217;s website address is www.unitybank.com. 

&#160; 

Business of the Company 

&#160; 

The Company's primary business is ownership and supervision of the Bank. The Company, through the Bank, conducts a traditional and community-oriented commercial banking business and offers services, including personal and business checking accounts, time deposits, money market accounts and regular savings accounts. The Company structures its specific services and charges in a manner designed to attract the business of the small and medium sized business and professional community, as well as that of individuals residing, working and shopping in its service area. The Company engages in a wide range of lending activities and offers commercial, Small Business Administration (&#8220;SBA&#8221;), consumer, mortgage, home equity and personal loans. 

&#160; 

Service Areas 

&#160; 

The Company's primary service area is defined as the neighborhoods served by the Bank's offices. The Bank's main office, located in Clinton, NJ, in combination with its Flemington and Whitehouse offices, serves the greater area of Hunterdon County. The Bank's North Plainfield and Somerset offices serve those communities located in the northern, eastern and central parts of Somerset County and the southernmost communities of Union County. The Bank's Scotch Plains, Linden, and Union offices serve the majority of the communities in Union County and the southwestern communities of Essex County. The offices in Middlesex, South Plainfield, Highland Park, and Edison extend the Company's service area into Middlesex County. The Bank&#8217;s Phillipsburg and Washington offices serve Warren County. The Bank&#8217;s Forks Township office serves Northampton County, Pennsylvania. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

The Company is located in an extremely competitive area. The Company's service area is also serviced by national banks, major regional banks, large thrift institutions and a variety of credit unions. In addition, since passage of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Financial Modernization Act of 1999 (the &#8220;Modernization Act&#8221;), securities firms and insurance companies have been allowed to acquire or form financial institutions, thereby increasing competition in the financial services market. Most of the Company's competitors have substantially more capital, and therefore greater lending limits than the Company. The Company's competitors generally have established positions in the service area and have greater resources than the Company with which to pay for advertising, physical facilities, personnel and interest on deposited funds. The Company relies on the competitive pricing of its loans, deposits and other services, as well as its ability to provide local decision-making and personal service in order to compete with these larger institutions. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Employees 

&#160; 

At December 31, 2015, the Company employed 150 full-time and 23 part-time employees. None of the Company's employees are represented by any collective bargaining units. The Company believes that its relations with its employees are good.

SUPERVISION AND REGULATION 

&#160; 

General Supervision and Regulation 

&#160; 

Bank holding companies and banks are extensively regulated under both federal and state law, and these laws are subject to change. As an example, in the summer of 2010, Congress passed, and the President signed, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the &#8220;Dodd-Frank Act&#8221;) (discussed below). These laws and regulations are intended to protect depositors, not stockholders. To the extent that the following information describes statutory and regulatory provisions, it is qualified in its entirety by reference to the particular statutory and regulatory provisions. Any change in the applicable law or regulation may have a material effect on the business and prospects of the Company and the Bank. Management of the Company is unable to predict, at this time, the impact of future changes to laws and regulations. 

&#160; 

General Bank Holding Company Regulation 

&#160; 

General: As a bank holding company registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, (the "BHCA"), the Company is subject to the regulation and supervision of the Federal Reserve Board (the &#8220;FRB&#8221;). The Company is required to file with the FRB annual reports and other information regarding its business operations and those of its subsidiaries. Under the BHCA, the Company's activities and those of its subsidiaries are limited to banking, managing or controlling banks, furnishing services to or performing services for its subsidiaries or engaging in any other activity which the FRB determines to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be properly incident thereto. 

&#160; 

The BHCA requires, among other things, the prior approval of the FRB in any case where a bank holding company proposes to; (i) acquire all or substantially all of the assets of any other bank; (ii) acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the outstanding voting stock of any bank (unless it owns a majority of such bank's voting shares); or (iii) merge or consolidate with any other bank holding company. The FRB will not approve any acquisition, merger or consolidation that would have a substantially anti-competitive effect, unless the anti-competitive impact of the proposed transaction is clearly outweighed by a greater public interest in meeting the convenience and needs of the community to be served. The FRB also considers capital adequacy and other financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the companies and the banks concerned, together with the convenience and needs of the community to be served, when reviewing acquisitions or mergers. 

&#160; 

The BHCA also generally prohibits a bank holding company, with certain limited exceptions, from; (i) acquiring or retaining direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the outstanding voting stock of any company which is not a bank or bank holding company; or (ii) engaging directly or indirectly in activities other than those of banking, managing or controlling banks, or performing services for its subsidiaries, unless such non-banking business is determined by the FRB to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be properly incident thereto. In making such determinations, the FRB is required to weigh the expected benefits to the public such as greater convenience, increased competition or gains in efficiency, against the possible adverse effects such as undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interest or unsound banking practices. 

&#160; 

&#160;

The BHCA was substantially amended through the Modernization Act. The Modernization Act permits bank holding companies and banks, which meet certain capital, management and Community Reinvestment Act standards, to engage in a broader range of non-banking activities. In addition, bank holding companies, which elect to become financial holding companies, may engage in certain banking and non-banking activities without prior FRB approval. Finally, the Modernization Act imposes certain privacy requirements on all financial institutions and their treatment of consumer information. At this time, the Company has elected not to become a financial holding company. 

&#160; 

There are a number of obligations and restrictions imposed on bank holding companies and their depository institution subsidiaries by law and regulatory policy that are designed to minimize potential loss to the depositors of such depository institutions and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the &#8220;FDIC&#8221;) insurance fund in the event the depository institution becomes in danger of default. Under regulations of the FRB, a bank holding company is required to serve as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary depository institutions and to commit resources to support such institutions in circumstances where it might not do so absent such policy. The FRB also has the authority under the BHCA to require a bank holding company to terminate any activity or to relinquish control of a non-bank subsidiary upon the FRB's determination that such activity or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial soundness and stability of any bank subsidiary of the bank holding company. 

&#160; 

Capital Adequacy Guidelines 

&#160; 

In December 2010 and January 2011, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the &#8220;Basel Committee&#8221;) published the final texts of reforms on capital and liquidity generally referred to as &#8220;Basel III.&#8221; In July 2013, the FRB, the FDIC and the Comptroller of the Currency adopted final rules (the &#8220;New Rules&#8221;), which implement certain provisions of Basel III and the Dodd-Frank Act. The New Rules replaced the existing general risk-based capital rules of the various banking agencies with a single, integrated regulatory capital framework. The New Rules require higher capital cushions and more stringent criteria for what qualifies as regulatory capital. The New Rules were effective for the Bank and the Company on January 1, 2015. 

&#160; 

Under the New Rules, the Company and the Bank are required to maintain the following minimum capital ratios, expressed as a percentage of risk-weighted assets: 

&#160; 

&#8226; Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio of 4.5% ( the &#8220;CET1&#8221;); 

&#160; &#8226; Tier 1 Capital Ratio (CET1 capital plus &#8220;Additional Tier 1 capital&#8221;) of 6.0%; and 

&#8226; Total Capital Ratio (Tier 1 capital plus Tier 2 capital) of 8.0%. 

&#160; 

In addition, the Company and the Bank will be subject to a leverage ratio of 4% (calculated as Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets as reported on the consolidated financial statements). 

The New Rules also require a &#8220;capital conservation buffer.&#8221; When fully phased in on January 1 2019, the Company and the Bank will be required to maintain a 2.5% capital conservation buffer, which is composed entirely of CET1, on top of the minimum risk-weighted asset ratios described above, resulting in the following minimum capital ratios: 

&#160; 

&#8226; CET1 of 7%; 

&#160; &#8226; Tier 1 Capital Ratio of 8.5%; and 

&#160; &#8226; Total Capital Ratio of 10.5%. 

&#160; 

The purpose of the capital conservation buffer is to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Banking institutions with a CET1, Tier 1 Capital Ratio and Total Capital Ratio above the minimum set forth above but below the capital conservation buffer will face constraints on their ability to pay dividends, repurchase equity and pay discretionary bonuses to executive officers, based o n the amount of the shortfall. The implementation of the capital conservation buffer began on January 1, 2016 at the 0.625% level, and it increases by 0.625% on each subsequent January 1 until it reaches 2.5% on January 1, 2019. 

&#160; 

The New Rules provide for several deductions from and adjustments to CET1, which are being phased in between January 1, 2015 and January 1, 2018. For example, mortgage servicing rights, deferred tax assets dependent upon future taxable income and significant investments in common equity issued by nonconsolidated financial entities must be deducted from CET1 to the extent that any one of those categories exceeds 10% of CET1 or all such categories in the aggregate exceed 15% of CET1. 

&#160; 

Under the New Rules, banking organizations such as the Company and the Bank may make a one-time permanent election regarding the treatment of accumulated other comprehensive income items in determining regulatory capital ratios. Effective as of January 1, 2015, the Company and the Bank elected to exclude accumulated other comprehensive income items for purposes of determining regulatory capital. 

&#160; 

&#160;

While the New Rules generally require the phase-out of non-qualifying capital instruments such as trust preferred securities and cumulative perpetual preferred stock, holding companies with less than $15 billion in total consolidated assets as of December 31, 2009, such as the Company, may permanently include non-qualifying instruments that were issued and included in Tier 1 or Tier 2 capital prior to May 19, 2010 in Additional Tier 1 or Tier 2 capital until they redeem such instruments or until the instruments mature. 

&#160; 

The New Rules prescribe a standardized approach for calculating risk-weighted assets. Depending on the nature of the assets, the risk categories generally range from 0% for U.S. Government and agency securities, to 600% for certain equity exposures, and result in higher risk weights for a variety of asset categories. In addition, the New Rules provide more advantageous risk weights for derivatives and repurchase-style transactions cleared through a qualifying central counterparty and increase the scope of eligible guarantors and eligible collateral for purposes of credit risk mitigation. 

&#160; 

Consistent with the Dodd-Frank Act, the New Rules adopt alternatives to credit ratings for calculating the risk-weighting for certain assets. 

&#160; 

Pursuant to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (&#8220;FDICIA&#8221;), each federal banking agency has promulgated regulations, specifying the levels at which an insured depository institution such as the Bank would be considered &#8220;well capitalized,&#8221; &#8220;adequately capitalized,&#8221; &#8220;undercapitalized,&#8221; &#8220;significantly undercapitalized,&#8221; or &#8220;critically undercapitalized,&#8221; and to take certain mandatory and discretionary supervisory actions based on the capital level of the institution. To qualify to engage in financial activities under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, all depository institutions must be &#8220;well capitalized.&#8221; 

&#160; 

The New Rules also revised the regulations implementing these provisions of FDICIA, to change the capital levels applicable to each designation. Under the New Rules, an institution will be classified as &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; if it (i) has a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10.0 percent, (ii) has a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 8.0 percent, (iii) has a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5.0 percent, (iv) has a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 6.5%, and (v) meets certain other requirements. An institution will be classified as &#8220;adequately capitalized&#8221; if it (i) has a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 8.0 percent, (ii) has a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 6.0 percent, (iii) has a Tier 1 leverage rati o of at least 4.0 percent, has a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 4.5%, and (v) does not meet the definition of &#8220;well capitalized.&#8221; An institution will be classified as &#8220;undercapitalized&#8221; if it (i) has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8.0 percent, (ii) has a Tier 1 risk-based capital r atio of less than 6.0 percent, (iii) has a Tier 1 leverage ratio of less than 4.0 percent, or (iv) has a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of less than 4.5%. An institution will be classified as &#8220;significantly undercapitalized&#8221; if it (i) has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0 percent, (ii) has a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0 percent, (iii) has a Tier 1 leverage ratio of less than 3.0 percent, or (iv) has a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of less 3.0%. An institution will be classified as &#8220;critically undercapitalized&#8221; if it has a tangible equity to total assets ratio that is equal to or less than 2.0 percent. An insured depository institution may be deemed to be in a lower capitalization category if it receives an unsatisfactory examination r ating. 

&#160; 

General Bank Regulation 

&#160; 

As a New Jersey-chartered commercial bank, the Bank is subject to the regulation, supervision, and control of the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance (the &#8220;Department&#8221;). As an FDIC-insured institution, the Bank is subject to regulation, supervision and control of the FDIC, an agency of the federal government. The regulations of the FDIC and the Department affect virtually all activities of the Bank, including the minimum level of capital that the Bank must maintain, the ability of the Bank to pay dividends, the ability of the Bank to expand through new branches or acquisitions and various other matters. 

&#160; 

Insurance of Deposits : The Dodd-Frank Act has caused significant changes in the FDIC&#8217;s insurance of deposit accounts. Among other things, the Dodd-Frank Act permanently increased the FDIC deposit insurance limit to $250 thousand per depositor. 

&#160; 

On February 7, 2011 the FDIC announced the approval of the assessment system mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act. Dodd-Frank required that the base on which deposit insurance assessments are charged be revised from one based on domestic deposits to one based on assets. The FDIC&#8217;s rule to base the assessment on average total consolidated assets minus average tangible equity instead of domestic deposits lowered assessments for many community banks with less than $10 billion in assets and reduced the Company&#8217;s costs. 

&#160; 

Dividend Rights : Under the Banking Act, a bank may declare and pay dividends only if, after payment of the dividend, the capital stock of the bank will be unimpaired and either the bank will have a surplus of not less than 50% of its capital stock or the payment of the dividend will not reduce the bank's surplus. Unless and until the Company develops other lines of business, payments of dividends from the Bank will remain the Company&#8217;s primary source of income and the primary source of funds for dividend payments to the shareholders of the Company. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act 

&#160; 

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the &#8220;Dodd-Frank Act&#8221;), enacted on July 21, 2010, significantly changed the bank regulatory landscape and has impacted and will continue to impact the lending, deposit, investment, trading and operating activities of insured depository institutions and their holding companies. The Dodd-Frank Act requires various federal agencies to adopt a broad range of new rules and regulations. The Dodd-Frank Act, among other things: 

&#215; 

capped debit card interchange fees for institutions with $10 billion in assets or more at $0.21 plus 5 basis points times the transaction amount, a substantially lower rate than the average rate in effect prior to adoption of the Dodd-Frank Act; 

&#215; 

provided for an increase in the FDIC assessment for depository institutions with assets of $10 billion or more, increases in the minimum reserve ratio for the DIF from 1.15% to 1.35% and changes the basis for determining FDIC premiums from deposits to assets; 

&#215; 

permanently increased the deposit insurance coverage to $250 thousand and allowed depository institutions to pay interest on checking accounts; 

&#215; 

created a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (&#8220;CFPB&#8221;) that has rulemaking authority for a wide range of consumer financial protection laws that apply to all banks and has broad authority to enforce these laws; 

&#215; 

provided for new disclosure and other requirements relating to executive compensation and corporate governance; 

&#215; 

changed standards for Federal preemption of state laws related to federally-chartered institutions and their subsidiaries; 

&#215; 

provided mortgage reform provisions regarding a customer&#8217;s ability to repay, restricting variable rate lending by requiring the ability to repay to be determined for variable rate loans by using the maximum rate that will apply during the first five years of a variable rate loan term, and making more loans subject to provisions for higher cost loans, new disclosures, and certain other revisions; and 

&#215; 

created a financial stability oversight council that will recommend to the Federal Reserve increasingly strict rules for capital, leverage, liquidity, risk management and other requirements as companies grow in size and complexity. 

The Dodd-Frank Act also imposes new obligations on originators of residential mortgage loans, such as the Bank. Among other things, the Dodd-Frank Act requires originators to make a reasonable and good faith determination based on documented information that a borrower has a reasonable ability to repay a particular mortgage loan over the long term. If the originator cannot meet this standard, the loan may be unenforceable. The Dodd-Frank Act contains an exception from this ability-to-repay rule for &#8220;Qualified Mortgages&#8221;. A rule issued by the CFPB in January 2013, and effective January 10, 2014, sets forth specific underwriting criteria for a loan to qualify as a Qualified Mortgage. The criteria generally exclude loans that (1) are interest-only, (2) have excessive upfront points or fees, or (3) have negative amortization features, balloon payments, or terms in excess of 30 years. The underwriting criteria also impose a maximum debt to income ratio of 43%, based upon documented and verifiable information. If a loan meets these criteria and is not a &#8220;higher priced loan&#8221; as defined in FRB regulations, the CFPB rule establishes a safe harbor preventing a consumer from asserting the failure of the originator to establish the consumer&#8217;s ability to repay. However, a consumer may assert the lender&#8217;s failure to comply with the ability-to-repay rule for all residential mortgage loans other than Qualified Mortgages, and may challenge whether a loan in fact qualified as a Qualified Mortgage. 

Although the majority of residential mortgages historically originated by the Bank would be considered Qualified Mortgages, the Bank has and may continue to make residential mortgage loans that would not qualify. As a result of such rules, the Bank might experience increased compliance costs, loan losses, litigation related expenses and delays in taking title to real estate collateral, if these loans do not perform and borrowers challenge whether the Bank satisfied the ability-to-repay rule upon originating the loan. 

&#160; 

The requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act and other regulatory reforms continue to be implemented. It is difficult to predict at this time what specific impact certain provisions and yet-to-be-finalized rules and regulations will have on us, including any regulations promulgated by the CFPB. Financial reform legislation and rules could have adverse implications on the financial industry, the competitive environment, and our ability to conduct business. Management will have to apply resources to ensure compliance with all applicable provisions of regulatory reforms, including the Dodd-Frank Act and any implementing rules, which may increase our costs of operations and adversely impact our earnings.
