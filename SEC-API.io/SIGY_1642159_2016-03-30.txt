Background 

&#160;

Business Overview 

&#160;

Reign Sapphire Corporation was established as a vertically integrated &#8220;mine-gate to retail&#8221; model for sapphires&#8212;rough sapphires to finished jewelry; a color gemstone brand; and a jewelry brand featuring Australian sapphires. We are not an exploration or mining company and are not engaged in exploration or mining activities. We purchase rough sapphires in bulk, directly from commercial miners in Australia, and we intend to oversee each step of the process as the stones go from the miners-gate to the consumer as Reign Sapphire jewelry.

&#160;

The term mine-gate to retail refers to sapphires and sapphire jewelry offered from the miner&#8217;s gate to consumers without any middlemen. We are not an exploration or mining company and we oversee the processing of material procured directly from commercial miners in Australia. The vertical integration process includes processing bulk quantities (1kg bags) of rough Australian sapphires, sizing and sorting the rough (uncut) parcels of sapphires and overseeing the cutting and polishing of the rough stones in contract cutting factories in Asia. This is followed by an in house design process and outsourced manufacturing process in the USA. 

&#160;

Reign Sapphires is our color gemstone brand and we intend to launch our inaugural jewelry collection via our website www.reignsapphires.com in the second quarter of 2016. The sample jewelry collection has been designed and manufactured and is ready for production. 

&#160;

Our core values are to offer consumers conflict free sapphires; sapphires that are mined from a verified source; sapphires that have been procured directly from miners, sapphires that are ethically processed and sapphires that are natural (not synthetic). In addition, we intend to feature exclusively Australian sapphires in our initial jewelry collections. The Company has sufficient inventory to launch the sample collection. 

&#160;

The design direction for the collection we intend to offer is reflective of old Hollywood glamour meeting turn of the century. The inaugural collections we intend to offer are Reign Day-to-Night; featuring classic &#38; timeless pieces designed to complement versus take over and Reign Red-Carpet; featuring bold designs, made for the stars to hold a time and place in Hollywood&#8217;s history. 

&#160;

We intend to position Reign Sapphires as a premium brand in the price point and company of competitors such as Cartier; Harry Winston; Roberto Coin; Van Cleef &#38; Arpels and Bvlgari. We believe that our competitors have certain existing advantages such as history and heritage; strong E-commerce and mobile presence; wholesale and flagship retail presence; strong social presence; a wide range of ancillary product offerings; strong public relations and marketing efforts; a balanced range of price points across the board; and consumer trust &#38; recognition. However, we intend to set ourselves apart with strong brand identity and visuals, unique design and quality and brand awareness through traditional and social media.

&#160;

The Company intends to focus its marketing initiatives on: (1) Business-to-Consumer (&#8220;B2C&#8221;) marketing to attract customers to the reignsapphires.com website, (2) Business-to-Business (&#8220;B2B&#8221;) marketing and sales efforts, to establish distribution partners such as high-end fashion retailers, and eventually (3) building a strong retail presence to market the products directly to consumers on a retail level. The Company intends to initially focus marketing efforts in the U.S. and upon encountering significant success in the U.S. with online, wholesale, and retail sales, the Company intends to expand its marketing efforts internationally.

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s intends to launch collections, which include rings, bracelets, and necklaces; featuring predominantly 1.5mm to 2.5mm diamond and princess cut sapphire melees. The Company intends to market the Red Carpet collection to households with annual income of $100,000 and greater and the Day-to-Night collection to households with income of $60,000 to $100,000.

Development of Our Business 

&#160;

Reign Sapphire Corporation is incorporated in the State of Delaware as a fine jewelry company. RSC intends to offer a vertically integrate model for sapphires direct from the mine&#8217;s gate to the retail supply chain including processing rough sapphires and gem cutting and designing and manufacturing fine jewelry.

&#160;

Strategy 

&#160;

Reign Sapphire Corporation intends to set itself apart from its competition by actively promoting our three core offerings: a vertically integrated &#8220;mine-gate to retail&#8221; model for sapphires - rough sapphires to finished jewelry; a color gemstone brand; and a jewelry brand featuring Australian sapphires.

&#160;

We intend to promote Reign Sapphires as conflict free, ethically processed and natural. We also intend to make video footage and pictures of the process available to consumers via our website www.reignsapphires.com

&#160;

The Company intends to focus primarily on quality and design and secondly on strategic pricing methods in order to compete in the U.S. market.

&#160;

While all of our competitors have established themselves uniquely within sectors of the market, none have marketed themselves as mine-gate to consumers with a vertical integration of processing, cutting and shaping, manufacturing, and sales of sapphires. We believe there is a strong market opportunity for the Company&#8217;s products as there is currently growth in U.S. and global jewelry sales. We believe that we have the knowledge and expertise to capitalize on this opportunity and to capitalize upon the uniquely powerful internationally recognized Australian brand image and appeal and become the leading player in this fragmented cottage industry.

&#160;

We have no intentions or plans to merge with an unidentified company.

&#160;

Products 

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s initial product line, consist of rings, bracelets, necklaces. The Company intends to eventually manufacture pendants and watches. The sapphires used are predominantly 1.5mm to 2.5mm diamond and princess cut melees.

&#160;

Aspects of processing, manufacturing and sales of the Company: 

&#160;

&#183; Gem Shaping, Cutting, &#38; Processing: The Company&#8217;s contract gem design team cut, shape, and process rough sapphire material into gem stones. &#183; Jewelry Manufacturing: The Company&#8217;s has outsourced the manufacturing to a quality U.S. provider &#183; Sales: The Company intends to launch its ecommerce site www.reignsapphires.com in early 2016. &#183; Packaging: Each jewelry item will be accompanied by a high quality, durable jewelry box, gift bag, certificate of authenticity and warranty. &#183; The Company&#8217;s products feature sapphires that have been procured in the rough from commercial miners in New South Wales, Australia and processed by the company. The company does not have an exclusive supplier rather a number of commercial miners in the region that have been supplying the company with run-of-mine material for a number of years. &#183; The Company intends to eventually after a number of years of retail operation to acquire its own mining assets to ensure long-term supply. &#160;

The Company does not rely on any principal suppliers and does not have any formal contracts with its suppliers. The Company&#8217;s business dealing with suppliers are based solely on long-standing personal relationships between them and Mr. Segelman, our President and CEO. In the event that we are unable to conduct business on satisfactory terms with any of these suppliers, we believe that an extensive number of alternative sources will be available to the Company and that our business can continue without disruption or adverse change in terms of pricing and availability.

&#160;

Market Overview 

&#160;

Opportunities 

&#160;

Demand for the industry&#8217;s products is largely driven by the needs and preferences of consumers, along with variations in the level of disposable income allocated toward their purchases. The Company intends to launch a high-end his and hers&#8217; jewelry line that uses fine blue pave sapphires, as well as an extremely high-end couture brand that uses the finest sapphires available from the Company&#8217;s Australian miners, cut by expert cutters, and set in fine custom jewelry.

&#160;

The primary audience for the brand is women - they are the market, in general. However, while women may make the choices, men often oversee the purchase. Speaking to both women and men will be an important aspect of any program. There are 3 main stages of life where a jewelry purchase will come into play:

&#160;

&#183; Single &#8220;The Self Purchaser&#8221; (I Love Being Me) &#160;

&#183; Married (Engagement/Wedding/Children - Push Present) &#160;

&#183; Retired (Gift Giver) &#160;

More specific age segmentation within these life stages includes:

&#160;

&#183; 18-25 coming of age/first job &#160;

&#183; 25-35 career development/children &#160;

&#183; 35-45 family/career advancement (self-purchaser) &#160;

&#183; 45-55 self-actualization/empty nest (gift giver to self and others) &#160;

An example of women&#8217;s networks and influencers include:

&#160;

&#183; Friends (word-of-mouth) &#160;

&#183; Celebrities (aspirational) &#160;

&#183; Bloggers/online platforms (trusted network) &#160;

&#183; Media (3 rd party endorsement) &#160;

&#183; Peers in business &#160;

Understanding how the various targets receive information and are influenced in making jewelry purchases helps direct various streams of communication.

&#160;

Because of the flexibility inherent in its model, RSC can adjust its brand voice specifically to reach a variety of women and men desiring a sapphire option in fine jewelry. The ability to promote the mine-gate to retail model should separate the brand from its competitors.

&#160;

Marketing and Sales 

&#160;

Marketing Overview &#38; Strategy 

&#160;

The Company intends to focus its marketing initiatives on: (1) Business-to-Consumer (&#8220;B2C&#8221;) marketing to attract customers to the reignsapphires.com website, (2) Business-to-Business (&#8220;B2B&#8221;) marketing and sales efforts, to establish distribution partners such as high-end fashion retailers, and eventually (3) building a strong retail presence to market the products directly to consumers on a retail level. The Company intends to initially focus marketing efforts in the U.S. and upon encountering significant success in the U.S. with online, wholesale, and retail sales, the Company intends to expand its marketing internationally.

&#160;

6&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

On a B2C basis, the Company intends to use an array of marketing methods to spread awareness of the Company&#8217;s jewelry products, we intend to include internet marketing, print advertising, promotions, and eventually signage. The Company intends to identify ideal locations that will contain a lot of walk-by traffic in communities with middle to upper income residents.

&#160;

Branding Strategy 

&#160;

Branding will play a critical role in the success of the Company. The Company has performed a capabilities audit and has developed and designed the products.

&#160;

The Company has also performed marketing and capabilities landscape assessments based upon consumer immersion and research and designed to understand consumer purchase behaviors and values, assess short and long term socio-cultural and market trends, and analyze the marketplace and competitive landscape. The Company has collaborated with an assembled team of experts in the naming and development of the brand using expert level product design and marketing strategy. The Company has designed the look and feel of the logo using a palette, style guide, inspiration boards, design renderings, and production images.

&#160;

The Company has developed a comprehensive, consumer-oriented toolkit using consistent language and tone for printed and online media and to target retailers on a sell-in, exclusive basis.

&#160;

The Company intends to develop its website and advertisements for print and online media, and sales materials for retail strategic partners. The Company intends to maintain a graphics library to be used on all touch points.

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s goal is to evolve the brand voice to embody quality, variety, and a strong market position. The Company is in an enviable position in this &#8216;space&#8217; whereby it can position itself and develop its identity as a new (mine-gate to retail) gemstone company that provides a direct bridge between commercial miners and the finished products.

&#160;

With the flexibility and leverage that comes from being vertically integrated, the Company intends to forge its own path with the creation of product segmented by the consumer and eventually the development of multiple, non-competitive streams of distribution.

&#160;

Internet Marketing 

&#160;

The Company intends to establish a presence on Google , Yelp , Bing , Yahoo and all other online search engines that are used to search for jewelry and sapphires. The Company intends to engage in significant SEO marketing efforts to ensure that the Company has strong results upon natural searches related to jewelry and sapphires. The Company intends to utilize PPC advertising, display advertising, and article marketing. The Company&#8217;s website will display a full catalogue of its products, background information regarding the mining of the products, information about the Company and management team, and contact information. The Company will also maintain a social media presence on Facebook, Twitter, and other social media websites to have an interactive presence.

&#160;

Strategic Partnerships with Retailers 

&#160;

The Company intends to form limited strategic partnerships with retailers to sell the products at their retail boutiques. The benefit to us is the promotion of the Company brand at the consumer level until we are in a position to open our own flagship stores. Prior to launching the Company&#8217;s sales campaign, the Company intends to develop and use association strategy to identify appropriate and strategic partners for co-marketing opportunities.

&#160;

The Company intends to develop a retail channel strategy to bolster the retail/direct to consumer sales approach while maintain a point of differentiation within the competitive landscape. Furthermore, the Company intends to develop retail adaptation strategies using in-store promotional and retail tactics using the Company&#8217;s branding strategy.

&#160;

Print Advertising 

&#160;

The Company intends to advertise in lifestyle and fashion magazines that cater to middle to upper income individuals, such as Vogue , Cosmopolitan , and Vanity Fair. 

&#160;

7&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Public Relations 

&#160;

The Company intends to gain public awareness and gain credibility through a public relations (PR) campaign to establish relationships with the local market.

The Company has engaged a PR firm to work to obtain interviews, print articles, and featured spots in leading fashion, luxury, and bridal magazines, industry publications, television news, radio programming, periodicals, and online websites and publications. The Company intends to develop short-lead and long-lead editorials and long lead editorials. The purpose of the PR campaign is to highlight the strength and innovation of the Company&#8217;s products.

&#160;

Sponsorships 

&#160;

The Company intends to sponsor social events that are appropriate to promote jewelry on a consumer level. Examples of such events could be parties, art or photo shows, and charity events.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

The Company intends to develop promotional platforms to include sales during and after holidays, discounted prices on particular products, and discounts for repeat customers.

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

Competitive Analysis and Strategy 

&#160;

The industry in which we compete is highly competitive. We believe that the most important competitive factors in our industry include the ability to control as much as possible of the supply chain.

&#160;

We intend to position Reign Sapphires as a premium brand in the price point and company of competitors such as Cartier; Harry Winston; Roberto Coin; Van Cleef &#38; Arpels and Bvlgari. We believe that our competitors have certain existing advantages such as history and heritage; strong E-commerce and mobile presence; wholesale and flagship retail presence; strong social presence; a wide range of ancillary product offerings; strong public relations and marketing efforts; a balanced range of price points across the board; and consumer trust &#38; recognition. However, we intend to set ourselves apart with strong brand identity and visuals, unique design and quality and brand awareness through traditional and social media.

&#160;

Because we are a small company with a limited operating history, we are at a competitive disadvantage against larger and well-capitalized companies which have a track record of success and operations. Therefore, our primary method of competition involves promoting our direct to consumer offering.

&#160;

Generally Australian miners sell their rough color gemstone material to trader who process the material and then sell the loose gemstones to the wholesale color gemstone market and then further down the supply chain to manufacturers and to retailers. Processors or traders generally don&#8217;t mine the material themselves and also don&#8217;t offer their product directly to manufacturers or retailers. Wholesale jewelers generally do not mine or process material they usually buy in bulk specific pieces of finished jewelry or manufacture the jewelry themselves using fine gemstones purchased from traders.

&#160;

We do not intend to sell rough sapphires neither do we intend to sell the cut stones that we process; we intend to use the material exclusively for our manufacturing purposes. Wholesale revenues currently derived from sales of loose sapphires are attributable only to finished stones and not rough sapphires and the focus of our sales efforts in the future will be exclusively on finished jewelry.

&#160;

In addition, although we will endeavor to secure wholesale partners, we intend to only offer a limited collection and inventory to our wholesale partners and intend to retain as much inventory as possible for own ecommerce site and flagship store.

&#160;

&#160;

We do not require any government approval in order to operate our business. In the event any of our operations or products requires government approval, we will comply with any and all local, state and federal requirements.

&#160;

Other than federal and state securities laws and common business and tax rules and regulations, we are not subject to any material government regulation. However, there is a risk that we could be adversely affected by current laws, regulations or interpretations or that more restrictive laws, regulations or interpretations will be adopted in the future that could make compliance more difficult or expensive. There is also a risk that a change in current laws could adversely affect our business.

&#160;

In addition, regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to grant, renew and revoke licenses and approvals and to implement regulations. Accordingly, such regulatory authorities could prevent or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities or otherwise penalize us if our practices were found not to comply with the then current regulatory or licensing requirements or any interpretation of such requirements by the regulatory authority. Our failure to comply with any of these requirements or interpretations could have a material adverse effect on our operations.

&#160;

&#160;

Our sapphires are from Australia and processed in, Asia, Australia and the U.S, at the present time all of our manufacturing is conducted in the U.S. We have no formal contracts with our suppliers and manufacturers and our business dealings with those parties are based solely on long-standing personal relationships between them and Mr. Segelman, our President and CEO. In the event that we are unable to conduct business on satisfactory terms with any of these suppliers or manufacturers, we believe that an extensive number of alternative sources will be available to the Company and that our business can continue without disruption or adverse change in terms of pricing and availability.

&#160;

Research and Development 

&#160;

Other than time spent researching our business and proposed markets and segmentation, the Company has not spent any funds on research and development activities to date. In the event opportunities arise from our operations, the Company may elect to initiate research and development activities, but the Company has no plans for any activities to date.

&#160;

Our principal executive offices are located at 9465 Wilshire Blvd, Beverly Hills, California. The office space is currently being leased. We believe that our existing facilities are adequate for our current needs and that we will be able to lease suitable additional or alternative space on commercially reasonable terms if and when we need it.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Legal Proceedings 

&#160;

From time to time, we may become party to litigation or other legal proceedings that we consider to be a part of the ordinary course of our business.
