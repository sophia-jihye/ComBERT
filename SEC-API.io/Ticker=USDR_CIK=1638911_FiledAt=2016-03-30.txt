BUSINESS

We are a developer and manufacturer of commercial unmanned aerial systems, or drones, with the goal of providing a superior Quadrotor aerial platform at an affordable price point in the law enforcement and first responder markets.

Our Quadrotor is a proprietary commercial drone platform developed with the specific needs of law enforcement customers in mind. This includes long flight times, ease of use, durability and ruggedness, and high-end sensor and power components. We believe that our Quadrotor is one of the longest flying commercial drones in the sub-$20,000 market, which provides its users with long missions and less down time.

On October 21, 2015, we entered into two agreements with Havis Inc., of Warminster, Pennsylvania, to provide manufacturing and distribution services for our products. Havis is an 80 year-old privately held, ISO 9001:2008 certified company that manufactures in-vehicle mobile computer and workflow solutions for public safety, public works government agencies and mobile professionals. Havis products are distributed through a nationwide network of resellers and sales representatives in the United States.

We intend to manufacture and sell our drone products through our partnership with Havis to law enforcement agencies in the United States. Additionally, we intend on providing additional value-added services to our product offering, including specialized training for police officers and video/data management software and hosting services. Further, we are exploring development or acquisitions of other drone-based technologies that we may be able to offer in the future.

We expect that our initial Quadrotor product may serve as an efficient information gathering tool for government agencies across the United States and internationally. The Law Enforcement sector itself is an industry constantly looking to implement innovative practices to serve citizens to the fullest extent, while increasing safety, and decreasing time and costs of fulfilling their duties. This Quadrotor can provide a swift and convenient aid to search and rescue missions, crime scene investigations, public safety, monitoring traffic for emergency responders, and other similar activities.

Emerging Growth Company 

We are and we will remain an " emerging growth company " as defined under The Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the &#147; JOBS Act &#148;), until the earliest to occur of (i) the last day of the fiscal year during which our total annual revenues equal or exceed $1 billion (subject to adjustment for inflation), (ii) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our initial public offering, (iii) the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt securities, or (iv) the date on which we are deemed a " large accelerated filer " (with at least $700 million in public float) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#147; Exchange Act &#148;). 

As an " emerging growth company ", we may take advantage of specified reduced disclosure and other requirements that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies. These provisions include:

&#183; only two years of audited financial statements in addition to any required unaudited interim financial statements with correspondingly reduced &#147; Management &#146; s Discussion and Analysis &#148; disclosure; 

&#183; reduced disclosure about our executive compensation arrangements; 

&#183; no requirement that we hold non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements; and 

&#183; exemption from the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting. 

We have taken advantage of some of these reduced burdens, and thus the information we provide stockholders may be different from what you might receive from other public companies in which you hold shares.

In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. However, we are choosing to &#147;opt out&#148; of such extended transition period, and as a result, we will comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that our decision to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable.

Notwithstanding the above, we are also currently a &#147; smaller reporting company &#148;, meaning that we are not an investment company, an asset-backed issuer, or a majority-owned subsidiary of a parent company that is not a smaller reporting company and have a public float of less than $75 million and annual revenues of less than $50 million during the most recently completed fiscal year. In the event that we are still considered a &#147; smaller reporting company &#148;, at such time as we cease being an &#147; emerging growth company &#148;, the disclosure we will be required to provide in our SEC filings will increase, but will still be less than it would be if we were not considered either an &#147; emerging growth company &#148; or a &#147; smaller reporting company &#148;. Specifically, similar to &#147; emerging growth companies &#148;, &#147; smaller reporting companies &#148; are able to provide simplified executive compensation disclosures in their filings; are exempt from the provisions of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (&#147;SOX&#148;) requiring that independent registered public accounting firms provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting; and have certain other decreased disclosure obligations in their SEC filings, including, among other things, only being required to provide two years of audited financial statements in annual reports.
