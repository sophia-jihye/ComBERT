Our specific business strategies are influenced by these industry factors and global trends and are focused on leveraging our resources to continue to develop and produce competitive product offerings. We believe the following strategies will allow us to 

maintain a balanced portfolio of commercial truck, industrial and aftermarket businesses covering key global markets. See Item 1A. Risk Factors below for information on certain risks that could have an impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations in the future. 

Successful Achievement of M2016; Foundation for M2019 

The success we had in executing our three-year M2016 strategic plan fundamentally transformed our business for long-term sustainability. The plan, intended to drive value for our shareholders, customers and employees, clearly defined specific financial measures of success, including improved EBITDA margin, reduced debt (including retirement liabilities) and new business wins driven by organic growth, all of which were substantially achieved by the end of fiscal year 2016. 

That plan focused on four major priorities, many of which will carry over into our M2019 strategic plan: 

&#8226; 

Drive operational excellence 

&#8226; 

Focus on customer value 

&#8226; 

Reduce product cost 

&#8226; 

Invest in a high-performing team 

Drive Operational Excellence 

The Operational Excellence priority emphasized our focus on executing the Meritor Production System, a lean manufacturing initiative designed to improve systems, processes, behaviors and capabilities primarily associated with five core metrics: 

&#8226; 

Safety - Total case rate is a measure of recordable workplace injuries normalized per 100 employees per year. We have initiated safety programs throughout our global operations to protect our employees. Our target for M2016 was to achieve a rate of less than 0.8. Our total case rate in fiscal 2016 was 0.76. 

&#8226; 

Quality - Through a focus on products, suppliers, lean operations, systems, people and technology, we are driving toward improving our quality as measured in parts per million (PPM). Our M2016 target was to achieve customer parts per million of less than 75. In fiscal year 2016, we achieved 50 PPM. This improvement was driven by a focus on prevention through robust problem solving, training and development. 

&#8226; 

Delivery - In fiscal year 2016, we achieved our OEM delivery performance goal of a 99 percent on-time delivery rate in our commercial truck business. Our intent is to maintain this high delivery rate for our customers. 

&#8226; 

Cost - Throughout M2016, we targeted - and achieved - net improvements of 2.6 percent each year for labor and burden cost reduction. Major areas of attention included better equipment utilization, reduced changeover time, elimination of waste, improved shift and asset utilization, investing in equipment to improve cycle time and flexibility, and employee involvement. Our work in this area had a significant impact on our financial results during the three-year period. 

&#8226; 

People - We encourage employees in our manufacturing facilities to submit at least three suggestions annually. In North America, we implemented approximately $1.5 million in improvements in fiscal year 2016 based on employee input. We also saw a significant improvement in employee engagement scores year over year from our salaried employees globally. 

Throughout the company, teams are focused on improving workplace safety and quality, implementing cost savings ideas, increasing productivity and efficiency, and streamlining operations. In 2016, our trailer business earned the Platinum Supplier Award from Wabash National Corp. for excellence in supply chain performance. 

Focus on Customer Value 

We established three main goals for improving customer value as part of our M2016 plan. Our first goal was to introduce new products and win new business to drive profitable growth. Second, we worked closely with our customers to achieve the Meritor Value Proposition through pricing for value. Third, we committed to exceed our customer's goals with respect to quality, delivery, innovation, and customer service. During the last three years, the evidence of our success in achieving these goals was demonstrated through our continued ability to renew existing customer relationships and establish new customer relationships. 

In fiscal year 2016, we significantly increased our penetration with PACCAR for rear axles in North America, Australia and Brazil, and we now have standard position on front steer axles with PACCAR. We also renewed our long-term partnership with Navistar upon signing a new five-year agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, Meritor retained standard position for brakes and rear axles with Navistar, as well as standard position for front axles in severe service, medium-duty and bus applications. We now have long-term pricing and positioning agreements with the four largest commercial truck OEMs in North America and our partnerships with each of them have never been stronger. 

For more than 100 years, our products have evolved to meet the changing needs of our customers in all major regions of the world. As technology has advanced, we have designed products that are more fuel efficient, lighter weight, safer, more durable and more reliable. The Meritor brand is well established globally and represents a wide portfolio of high-quality products for many different applications. 

Building upon the strength of our core technologies, we intend to expand our presence globally and continue our growth in complementary product lines. Our strategy involves continuing to capitalize on our geographic diversity and product line capability through our many core competencies, global customer relationships and substantial aftermarket presence. 

In the future, we believe there is significant revenue potential with an expanded product portfolio. Our current launch cycle is one of the most aggressive in our company&#8217;s history. We have worked with our customers to design axles, brakes, drivelines and suspensions that will enhance the value of their vehicles. There were several examples of this in fiscal 2016: 

&#8226; 

We introduced a lighter weight, more efficient axle carrier platform called the 13X, which is designed for Class 6 and 7 applications. Production is scheduled to begin in 2017. The 13X axle meets our OEM customers' requests for an axle that is lighter, more efficient and tailored to meet the needs of medium-duty applications. 

&#8226; 

We launched the MFS+, a lighter-weight, front-steer axle with the recognized performance of the company's MFS&#8482; series while being easier to maintain. This axle, which has integrated components and an optimized design to reduce weight, represents the next step in the evolution of our front-steer axle offering. 

&#8226; 

We announced the expanded availability of the MFS&#8482; Series of front non-drive axles to include a deep-drop axle option that offers end-users greater flexibility in packaging their vehicles. The new option, which includes deep axle drops of 4.76 and 5 inches, is ideal for auto hauling and refuse applications where lower vehicle ride heights are needed. 

&#8226; 

We launched Meritor&#8217;s DUALite Series of integrated systems for the bus and coach market in China which offers on-highway customers in the region fully-dressed axle options that are manufactured locally. 

As industry trends continue to drive the need for equipment that complies with environmental and safety-related regulatory provisions, OEMs select suppliers based not only on the cost and quality of their products but also on their ability to meet stringent environmental and safety requirements and to service and support the customer after the sale. We use our technological and market expertise to develop and engineer products that address mobility, safety, regulatory and environmental concerns. 

One way in which we have worked to address safety is that we have implemented a strategy of focusing on products and technologies that enhance overall vehicle braking performance. Our commitment to designing and manufacturing braking solutions for the commercial vehicle market has resulted in more commercial vehicles in North America having Meritor brakes than any other brake manufacturer. We believe Meritor&#8217;s EX+ air disc brakes are among the highest performing brakes in the marketplace. In Europe, a region where air disc brakes are much more widely adopted, we have sold more than 5 million ELSA air disc brakes - a testament to the quality, reliability and performance of this brake platform. 

We are recognized globally for our capabilities in designing, testing and manufacturing high quality drivetrain and braking products that optimize overall performance. Our manufacturing facility in Lindesberg, Sweden received the Swedish Assembly Award 2016 for advancing assembly technology. Specifically, we consolidated production for all families of bolted carriers into a single universal assembly line that utilizes smart sequencing and material flow enhancements, thus creating a flexible line that supports a wide variety of customer needs. The facility&#8217;s transformation led to best-in-class delivery and productivity and significantly improved quality enabling the plant to produce thousands of different axle configurations on a just-in-time basis for our customers. 

We effectively manage complexity for low volumes and support our customers&#8217; needs during periods of peak volumes. The quality, durability and on-time delivery of our products has earned us strong positions in the markets we support. As we seek to extend and expand our business with existing customers and establish relationships with new ones, our objective is to ensure we are getting a fair value for the recognized benefits of our products and services and the strong brand equity we hold in the marketplace. 

We believe the quality of our core product lines, our ability to service our products through our aftermarket capabilities, and our sales and service support teams give us a competitive advantage. An important element of being a preferred supplier is the ability to deliver service through the entire life cycle of the product. Also, as our industry becomes more global, our manufacturing footprint around the world and our ability to supply customers with regionally-tailored product solutions are competencies of increasing importance. 

Reduce Product Cost 

We instituted a broad collaborative effort among our Purchasing, Engineering, Supply Chain, Quality and Operations departments to manage product costs with a target of achieving annual net material reductions (measured against controllable spend) of 2.5 percent annually, which was achieved each year during M2016. We are driving such material performance using three different approaches: commercial negotiations, best-cost-country sourcing, and technical innovation. 

Increasing inventory turns is an important element of improving our working capital performance. We believe we can improve our inventory turnover rate from our current levels. By reducing inventory, we expect to generate more cash to reinvest in our business, repay debt and/or return value to shareholders. We are employing various approaches including localization of our supply base where possible; warehousing close to our facilities for imported supply; improved demand planning; increased accuracy in production forecasting; and minimizing or eliminating inventory held to support certain low-volume products. 

Invest in a High-Performing Team 

Investing in a high-performing team is fundamental to having an engaged and aligned workforce. As part of our M2016 objectives, we set targets to strengthen the level of engagement from our employees, build a more diverse culture and make additional tools available for career development. 

Our goal for M2016 was to achieve a top quartile score on twelve key engagement factors as measured by a third-party survey administered to a majority of our salaried employees annually. To achieve this, the leadership team made a dedicated effort to improve employee satisfaction in all regions. Some of those initiatives included: 

&#8226; Cross-functional assignments 

&#8226; Mentoring programs 

&#8226; Succession development program 

&#8226; Business resource groups 

&#8226; Training and skill assessment and development 

As a result, we dramatically improved our employee engagement score moving to a top quartile score in eleven of the twelve engagement factors. 

Transition to M2019 Growth-Focused Strategy 

Our M2019 strategic plan reinforces the important elements of M2016 and goes further from a growth perspective. Looking at the strong foundation we have built over the past three years, we are committed to maintaining the operational improvements we have achieved, while simultaneously initiating actions focused on growth. The financial stability driven by M2016 allows for more investment in these strategies, which we anticipate will lead to a rate of return our investors expect over the next three fiscal years. 

The financial targets we set for this three year plan are the following: 

&#8226; Grow revenue at 20 percent above market levels 

&#8226; Increase adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations by $1.25 

&#8226; Reduce the ratio of net debt to Adjusted EBITDA to less than 1.5 

(see Non-GAAP Financial Measures below) 

To achieve these targets, we have now focused the organization on three main priorities: 

&#8226; Exceeding customer expectations 

&#8226; Transforming to a growth-oriented organization 

&#8226; Continuing to invest in employees 

Exceed Customer Expectations 

Over the past three years, we have worked hard to become an innovation partner to our customers. From concept to launch, we work closely together to ensure we are designing reliable and high quality products that meet or exceed their expectations. In our M2019 plan, we have set a quality target of 25 PPM. We believe this will further differentiate us in the commercial vehicle industry. 

We also want to continue the excellent delivery performance we have demonstrated at greater than 99 percent and we will continue our focus on driving down operating costs through material cost-reduction and labor and burden improvements. We are targeting achievement of 1.5 percent improvement per year. 

Transform to a Growth Oriented Organization 

We know that despite changes in global market conditions, we must generate top-line growth. We have designed the M2019 plan to enable us to achieve the growth we seek while operating in a cyclical industry that can be greatly impacted by economic and political factors by initiating actions focused on growth, including increasing rates of new product development, new market development, new business with existing strategic customers, and expansion into adjacent markets. 

We have rapidly increased the pace of product introduction which is a key component to growing revenue. Prior to M2016, we launched approximately three programs annually. For M2019, we expect to introduce seven or more programs per year across our product portfolio and geographic regions. We are developing these jointly with our customers for their future product programs, and we have line of sight to revenue streams for each of these products. 

We expect to continue to broaden our relationships with our global strategic customers, earn the business of new customers, increase aftermarket share in our core product areas, expand our components business by utilizing our time-proven core competencies of forging, machining and gearing, and enter near adjacent markets that we believe will be a good match with our core competencies. While we are planning for the majority of our growth to be organic, we anticipate allocating capital for targeted acquisitions that could be an accelerant in our growth trajectory. 

Invest in Employees 

We will also continue to drive the close alignment of our global Meritor team to the company's objectives, which was a key driver of the success we experienced in our M2016 strategic plan. We believe that our strength to compete in the global market is dependent upon the engagement of every Meritor employee and that a high-performing team is critical to the level of performance we want to achieve. We have a strong and experienced leadership group and a committed team, both of which are focused on sustaining the strong foundation we built in M2016 and delivering on our M2019 performance objectives. We will also continue to diversify our workforce because we recognize the value of different opinions and backgrounds in a company as global as Meritor. 

We have established a variety of development and training programs to help our employees grow as we grow, and we will continue to measure the engagement of our employees to ensure we are building on the competencies that are important to our future. 

Products 

&#160; 

&#32;Meritor designs, develops, manufactures, markets, distributes, sells, services and supports a broad range of products for use in the transportation and industrial sectors. In addition to sales of original equipment systems and components, we provide our original equipment, aftermarket and remanufactured products to vehicle OEMs, their dealers (who in turn sell to motor carriers and commercial vehicle users of all sizes), independent distributors, and other end-users in certain aftermarkets.

Axles, Undercarriage &#38; Drivelines 

&#160; 

We believe we are one of the world's leading independent suppliers of axles for medium- and heavy-duty commercial vehicles, with the leading market position in axle manufacturing in North America, South America and Europe, and are one of the major axle manufacturers in the Asia-Pacific region. Our extensive truck axle product line includes a wide range of front steer axles and rear drive axles. Our front steer and rear drive axles can be equipped with our cam, wedge or air disc brakes, automatic slack adjusters, complete wheel-end equipment such as hubs, rotors and drums, and (through our MeritorWABCO joint venture) anti-lock braking systems (&#8220;ABS&#8221;) and vehicle stability control systems. 

&#160; 

We supply heavy-duty axles in certain global regions for use in numerous off-highway vehicle applications, including construction, material handling, and mining. We also supply axles for use in military tactical wheeled vehicles, principally in North America. These products are designed to tolerate high tonnage and operate under extreme geographical and climate conditions. In addition, we have other off-highway vehicle products that are currently in development for certain other regions. We also supply axles for use in buses, coaches and recreational vehicles, fire trucks and other specialty vehicles in North America, Asia Pacific and Europe, and we believe we are a leading supplier of bus and coach axles in North America. 

&#160; 

We are one of the major manufacturers of heavy-duty trailer axles in North America. Our trailer axles are available in more than 40 models in capacities from 20,000 to 30,000 pounds for virtually all heavy trailer applications and are available with our broad range of suspension modules, brake products, including drum brakes, disc brakes, anti-lock and trailer stability control systems, and ABS (through our MeritorWABCO joint venture). 

&#160; 

We supply universal joints and driveline components, including our Permalube&#8482; universal joint and RPL Permalube&#8482; driveline, which are maintenance free, permanently lubricated designs used often in the high mileage on-highway market. We supply drivelines in a variety of global regions, for use in numerous on-highway vehicle applications, including construction, material handling and mining. We supply transfer cases and drivelines for use in military tactical wheeled vehicles, principally in North America. We also supply transfer cases for use in specialty vehicles in North America. Anti-lock brakes and stability control systems (which we supply through our MeritorWABCO joint venture) are also used in military vehicles and specialty vehicles. In addition, we supply trailer air suspension systems and products with an increasing market presence in North America. We also supply advanced suspension modules for use in light-, medium- and heavy-duty military tactical wheeled vehicles, principally in North America. 

&#160; 

Brakes and &#32; Braking Systems 

&#160; 

We believe we are one of the leading independent suppliers of air brakes to medium- and heavy-duty commercial vehicle manufacturers in North America and Europe. In Brazil, one of the largest truck and trailer markets in the world, we believe that Master Sistemas Automotivos Limitada, our 49%-owned joint venture with Randon S. A. Implementos e Participa&#231;&#245;es, is a leading supplier of brakes and brake-related products. 

&#32;Through manufacturing facilities located in North America, Asia Pacific and Europe, we manufacture a broad range of foundation air brakes, as well as automatic slack adjusters for brake systems. Our foundation air brake products include cam drum brakes, which offer improved lining life and tractor/trailer interchangeability; wedge drum brakes, which are lightweight and provide automatic internal wear adjustment; air disc brakes, which provide enhanced stopping distance and improved fade resistance for demanding applications; and wheel-end components such as hubs, drums and rotors. 

&#160; 

Our brakes and brake system components also are used in military tactical wheeled vehicles, principally in North America. We also supply brakes for use in buses, coaches and recreational vehicles, fire trucks and other specialty vehicles in North America and Europe, and we believe we are the leading supplier of bus and coach brakes in North America. We also supply brakes for commercial vehicles, buses and coaches in Asia Pacific. 

&#160; 

U.S. Federal regulations require that new medium- and heavy-duty vehicles sold in the United States be equipped with ABS. We believe that Meritor WABCO Vehicle Control Systems, our 50%-owned joint venture with WABCO, is a leading supplier of ABS and a supplier of other electronic and pneumatic control systems (such as stability control and collision avoidance systems) for North American heavy-duty commercial vehicles. The joint venture also supplies hydraulic ABS to the North American medium-duty truck market and produces stability control and collision mitigation systems for tractors and trailers, which are designed to help maintain vehicle stability and aid in reducing tractor-trailer rollovers and other incidents. 

Other Products 

&#160; 

In addition to the products discussed above, we sell other complementary products, including third party and private label items, through our aftermarket distribution channels. These products are generally sold under master distribution or similar agreements with outside vendors and include brake shoes and friction materials; automatic slack adjusters; yokes and shafts; wheel-end hubs and drums; ABS and stability control systems; shock absorbers and air springs; air brakes, air systems, air dryers and compressors. 

Customers; Sales and Marketing 

&#160; 

Meritor has numerous customers worldwide and has developed long-standing business relationships with many of these customers. Our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 73 percent of our total sales in fiscal year 2016. Sales to our largest three customers, AB Volvo, Daimler AG and Navistar International Corporation represented approximately 23 percent , 18 percent &#32;and 9 percent , respectively, of our sales in fiscal year 2016. No other customer accounted for 10% &#32;or more of our total sales in fiscal year 2016. 

&#32; Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) 

&#160; 

In North America, we design, engineer, market and sell products principally to OEMs, dealers and distributors. While our North American sales are typically direct to the OEMs, our ultimate commercial truck customers include trucking and transportation fleets. Fleet customers may specify our components and integrated systems for installation in the vehicles they purchase from OEMs. We employ what we refer to as a &#8220;push-pull&#8221; marketing strategy. We &#8220;push&#8221; for being the standard product at the OEM. At the same time, our district field managers then call on fleets and OEM dealers to &#8220;pull-through&#8221; our components on specific truck purchases. For all other markets, we specifically design, engineer, market and sell products principally to OEMs for their market-specific needs or product specifications. 

&#160; 

For certain large OEM customers, our supply arrangements are generally negotiated on a long-term contract basis for a multi-year period that may require us to provide annual cost reductions through price reductions or other cost benefits for the OEMs. If we are unable to generate sufficient cost savings in the future to offset such price reductions, our gross margins will be adversely affected. Sales to other OEMs are typically made through open order releases or purchase orders at market-based prices that do not require the purchase of a minimum number of products. The customer typically has the right to cancel or delay these orders on reasonable notice. We typically compete to either retain business or try to win new business from OEMs when long-term contracts expire. 

&#160; 

We have established leading positions in many of the markets we serve as a global supplier of a broad range of drivetrain systems, brakes and components. Based on available industry data and internal company estimates, our market-leading positions include independent truck drive axles (i.e., those manufactured by an independent, non-captive supplier) in North America, Europe, South America and India through a joint venture; truck drivelines in North America; truck air brakes in North America and South America (through a joint venture); and military wheeled vehicle drivetrains, suspensions and brakes in North America. 

&#160; 

Our global customer portfolio includes companies such as AB Volvo, Daimler AG, Navistar International Corporation, Oshkosh, MAN, Iveco, PACCAR, Ashok Leyland, Scania, XCMG, Wabash National and Ford. 

&#160; 

Aftermarket 

&#160; 

We market and sell truck, trailer, off-highway and other products principally to, and service such products principally for, OEMs, their parts marketing operations, their dealers and other independent distributors and service garages within the aftermarket industry. Our product sales are generated through long-term agreements with certain of our OEM customers and distribution agreements and sales to independent dealers and distributors. Sales to other OEMs are typically made through open order releases or purchase orders at market based prices which do not require the purchase of a minimum number of products. The customer typically has the right to cancel or delay these orders on reasonable notice. 

&#160; 

Our product offerings allow us to service all stages of our customers&#8217; vehicle ownership lifecycle. In North America, we stock and distribute hundreds of parts from top national brands to our customers or what we refer to as our &#8220;all makes&#8221; strategy. Our district field managers call on our OEM and independent customers to market our full product line capabilities on a regular basis to seek to ensure that we satisfy our customers&#8217; needs. Our aftermarket business sells products under the following brand names: Meritor; Meritor Wabco; Euclid; Trucktechnic; Meritor Green; and Meritor AllFit. 

&#160; 

Based on available industry data and internal company estimates, we believe our North America aftermarket business has the overall market leadership position for the portfolio of products that we offer. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

We compete worldwide with a number of North American and international providers of components and systems, some of which are owned by or associated with some of our customers. The principal competitive factors are price, quality, service, product performance, design and engineering capabilities, new product innovation and timely delivery. Certain OEMs manufacture their own components that compete with the types of products we supply. 

&#160; 

Our major competitors for axles are Dana Holding Corp. and, in certain markets, OEMs that manufacture axles for use in their own products. Emerging competitors for axles include Daimler Truck North America&#8217;s Detroit Axle and American Axle Corporation, ZF Friedrichshafen in Europe, and from China, Hande, Fuwa and Ankai. Our major competitors for brakes are WABCO, Bendix/Knorr Bremse and, in certain markets, OEMs that manufacture brakes for use in their own products. Our major competitors for industrial applications are MAN, AxleTech International, Oshkosh, AM General, Marmon-Herrington, Dana Holding Corp., Knorr, Kessler &#38; Co., Carraro, NAF, Sisu and, in certain markets, OEMs that manufacture industrial products for use in their own vehicles. Our major competitors for trailer applications are Hendrickson, BPW and SAF-Holland. 

&#160; 

See Item 1A. Risk Factors &#32;for information on certain risks associated with our competitive environment. 

&#160; 

Raw Materials and Suppliers 

&#160; 

Our purchases of raw materials and parts are concentrated over a limited number of suppliers. We are dependent upon our suppliers' ability to meet cost performance, quality specifications and delivery schedules. The inability of a supplier to meet these requirements, the loss of a significant supplier, or work stoppages, could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our customers' delivery requirements. 

The cost of our core products is susceptible to changes in overall steel commodity prices, including ingredients used for various grades of steel. We have generally structured our major steel supplier and customer contracts to absorb and pass on normal index-related market fluctuations in steel prices. While we have had steel pricing adjustment programs in place with most major OEMs, the price adjustment programs tend to lag behind the movement in steel costs and have generally not contemplated non-steel index related increases. 

Significant future volatility in the commodity markets or a deterioration in product demand may require us to pursue customer increases through surcharges or other pricing arrangements. In addition, if suppliers are inadequate for our needs, or if prices remain at current levels or increase and we are unable to either pass these prices to our customer base or otherwise mitigate the costs, our operating results could be further adversely affected. 

We continuously work to address these competitive challenges by reducing costs and, as needed, restructuring operations. We manage supplier risk by conducting periodic assessments for all major suppliers and more frequent rigorous assessments of high-risk suppliers. On an ongoing basis, we monitor third party financial statements, conduct surveys through supplier questionnaires, and conduct site visits. We have developed a chronic supplier improvement process where we identify and develop actions to address ongoing financial, quality and delivery issues to further mitigate potential risk. We are proactive in managing our supplier relationships to avoid supply disruption. Our process employs dual sourcing and resourcing trigger points that cause us to take aggressive actions and then monitor the progress closely. 

Acquisitions, Divestitures and Restructuring 

&#160; 

As described above, our business strategies are focused on enhancing our market position by continuously evaluating the competitive differentiation of our product portfolio, focusing on our strengths and core competencies, and growing the businesses that offer the most attractive returns. Implementing these strategies involves various types of strategic initiatives. 

&#160; 

As part of our M2019 strategy, we are evaluating acquisition opportunities that fit strategically with our core competencies and growth initiatives and continuously reviewing the prospects of our existing businesses to determine whether any of them should be modified, restructured, sold or otherwise discontinued. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015, we completed the acquisition of the majority of the assets of Sypris Solutions, Inc.&#8217;s Morganton, North Carolina trailer axle beam and carrier manufacturing facility (see Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8. &#32;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data &#32;below). In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014, we completed the disposition of our Mascot all-makes remanufacturing business, which was part of the Aftermarket &#38; Trailer segment (see Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data below). 

Restructuring Actions 

Fourth Quarter 2016 Market Related Actions: In response to the decline in revenue in North America and South America, during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, we approved various headcount reduction plans targeting different areas of the business. We expect to incur an aggregate of $10 million &#32;in restructuring costs associated with these plans, primarily related to a total reduction of approximately 100 &#32;salaried and hourly positions. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, we incurred a total of $5 million &#32;in restructuring costs in the Commercial Truck &#38; Industrial segment, $1 million &#32;in Aftermarket &#38; Trailer segments and $2 million &#32;in their corporate locations. Restructuring actions with these plans are expected to be substantially complete by the first half of fiscal year 2017. 

Aftermarket Actions: &#32;During the third quarter of fiscal year 2016, we approved various restructuring plans in the North American and European aftermarket businesses. We expect to incur an aggregate of approximately $8 million &#32;&#32;in restructuring costs associated with these plans in the Aftermarket &#38; Trailer segment primarily for severance. We recorded $5 million &#32;of restructuring costs during the third quarter of fiscal year 2016. Restructuring actions associated with these plans are expected to be completed by the end of fiscal year 2017. 

Other Fiscal 2016 Actions : During the first half of fiscal year 2016, we recorded restructuring costs of $3 million &#32;primarily associated with a labor reduction program in China in the Commercial Truck &#38; Industrial segment and a labor reduction program in the Aftermarket and Trailer segment. Restructuring actions with these plans were substantially complete as of September 30, 2016. 

M2016 Footprint Actions : As part of the our M2016 Strategy, during fiscal year 2013 we announced a North American footprint realignment action and a European shared services reorganization. Restructuring actions associated with these programs were substantially complete as of September 30, 2015. In total, we eliminated approximately 140 &#32;hourly and salaried positions and incurred approximately $7 million &#32;of associated restructuring costs, primarily in the Commercial Truck &#38; Industrial segment in connection with the consolidation of certain gearing and machining operations in North America and the closure of a North America manufacturing facility. 

South America Labor Reduction: During the fiscal years 2014 and 2015, we completed a South America headcount reduction plan intended to reduce labor costs in response to softening economic conditions in the region. In response to decreasing production volumes in South America, we eliminated approximately 420 &#32;hourly and 40 &#32;salaried positions and incurred $13 million &#32;of restructuring costs, primarily severance benefits, in the Commercial Truck &#38; Industrial segment. This plan was substantially complete as of September 30, 2015. 

Closure of a Corporate Engineering Facility: During the second quarter of fiscal year 2015, we notified approximately 30 salaried and contract employees that their positions were being eliminated due to the planned closure of a corporate engineering facility. We recorded severance expenses of $2 million associated with this plan. Restructuring actions associated with this program were substantially complete as of September 30, 2015. 

European Labor Reduction: During the second quarter of fiscal year 2015, we initiated a European headcount reduction plan intended to reduce labor costs in response to continued soft markets in the region. We eliminated approximately 20 hourly and 20 salaried positions and recorded $2 million of expected severance expenses in the Commercial Truck &#38; Industrial segment in fiscal year 2015. Restructuring actions associated with this program were substantially complete as of June 30, 2015. 

See Item 1A. Risk Factors &#32;for information on certain risks associated with strategic initiatives. 

&#160; 

Joint Ventures 

&#160; 

As the industries in which we operate have become more globalized, joint ventures and other cooperative arrangements have become an important element of our business strategies. These strategic alliances provide for sales, product design, development and manufacturing in certain product and geographic areas. As of September 30, 2016, our continuing operations participated in the following non-consolidated joint ventures: 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Key Products 

&#160;

Aggregate sales of our non-consolidated joint ventures were $1,101 million, $1,288 million and $1,268 million in fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. 

&#160; 

In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, our consolidated financial statements include the financial position and operating results of those joint ventures in which we have control. For additional information on our unconsolidated joint ventures and percentage ownership thereof see Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data &#32;below. 

&#160; 

Research and Development 

&#160; 

We have significant research, development, engineering and product design capabilities. We spent $68 million &#32;in fiscal year 2016, $69 million in fiscal year 2015 and $71 million in fiscal year 2014 on company-sponsored research, development and engineering. We employ professional engineers and scientists globally and have additional engineering capabilities through contract arrangements in low-cost countries. We also have advanced technical centers in North America, South America, Europe and Asia Pacific (primarily in India and China). 

Patents and Trademarks 

&#160; 

We own or license many United States and foreign patents and patent applications in our engineering and manufacturing operations and other activities. While in the aggregate these patents and licenses are considered important to the operation of our businesses, management does not consider them of such importance that the loss or termination of any one of them would materially affect a business segment or Meritor as a whole. 

&#160; 

Our registered trademarks for Meritor&#174; and the Bull design are important to our business. Other significant trademarks owned by us include Euclid&#174; and Trucktechnic&#174; for aftermarket products. 

&#160; 

Substantially all of our U.S.-held intellectual property rights are subject to a first-priority perfected security interest securing our obligations to the lenders under our credit facility. See Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data &#32;below. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

At September 30, 2016, we had approximately 8,000 full-time employees (which includes consolidated joint ventures). At that date, no employees in the United States and Canada were covered by collective bargaining agreements. Most of our facilities outside of the United States and Canada are unionized. We believe our relationship with unionized employees is satisfactory. 

&#160; 

Environmental Matters 

&#160; 

Federal, state and local requirements relating to the discharge of substances into the environment, the disposal of hazardous wastes and other activities affecting the environment have, and will continue to have, an impact on our operations. We record liabilities for environmental issues in the accounting period in which they are considered to be probable and the cost can be reasonably estimated. At environmental sites in which more than one potentially responsible party has been identified, we record a liability for our allocable share of costs related to our involvement with the site, as well as an allocable share of costs related to insolvent parties or unidentified shares. At environmental sites in which we are the only potentially responsible party, we record a liability for the total estimated costs of remediation before consideration of recovery from insurers or other third parties. 

&#160; 

We have been designated as a potentially responsible party at nine Superfund sites, excluding sites as to which our records disclose no involvement or as to which our liability has been finally determined. In addition to Superfund sites, various other lawsuits, claims and proceedings have been asserted against us, alleging violations of federal, state and local environmental protection requirements or seeking remediation of alleged environmental impairments, principally at previously disposed-of properties. We have established reserves for these liabilities when they are considered to be probable and reasonably estimable. See Note 23 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data &#32;below for information as to our estimates of the total reasonably possible costs we could incur and the amounts recorded as a liability as of September 30, 2016, and as to changes in environmental accruals during fiscal year 2016. 

&#160; 

The process of estimating environmental liabilities is complex and dependent on physical and scientific data at the site, uncertainties as to remedies and technologies to be used, and the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies. The actual amount of costs or damages for which we may be held responsible could materially exceed our current estimates because of uncertainties, including the financial condition of other potentially responsible parties, the success of the remediation and other factors that make it difficult to predict actual costs accurately. However, based on management's assessment, after consulting with Meritor's General Counsel and with outside advisors who specialize in environmental matters, and subject to the difficulties inherent in estimating these future costs, we believe that our expenditures for environmental capital investment and remediation necessary to comply with present regulations governing environmental protection and other expenditures for the resolution of environmental claims will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, in future periods, new laws and regulations, changes in remediation plans, advances in technology and additional information about the ultimate clean-up remedy could significantly change our estimates. Management cannot assess the possible effect of compliance with future requirements. 

International Operations 

&#160; 

We believe our international operations provide us with geographical diversity and help us to weather the cyclical nature of our business. Approximately 46 percent &#32;of our total assets as of September 30, 2016 and 49 percent &#32;of fiscal year 2016 sales from continuing operations were outside the U.S. See Note 24 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data &#32;below for financial information by geographic area for the three fiscal years ended September 30, 2016. 

&#160; 

Our international operations are subject to a number of risks inherent in operating abroad (see Item 1A. Risk Factors &#32;below). There can be no assurance that these risks will not have a material adverse impact on our ability to increase or maintain our foreign sales or on our financial condition or results of operations. 

&#160; 

Our operations are also exposed to global market risks, including foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We have a foreign currency cash flow hedging program in place to help reduce the company&#8217;s exposure to changes in exchange rates. We use foreign currency forward contracts to manage the company&#8217;s exposures arising from foreign currency exchange risk. Gains and losses on the underlying foreign currency exposures are partially offset with gains and losses on the foreign currency forward contracts. It is our policy not to enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes and, therefore, we hold no derivative instruments for trading purposes. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk &#32;and Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data &#32;below. 

&#160; 

Seasonality; Cyclicality 

&#160; 

We may experience seasonal variations in the demand for our products, to the extent OEM vehicle production fluctuates. Historically, for most of our operations, demand has been somewhat lower in the quarters ended September 30 and December 31, when OEM plants may close for summer shutdowns and holiday periods or when there are fewer selling days during the quarter. Our aftermarket business and our operations in India and China generally experience seasonally higher demand in the quarters ending March 31 and June 30. 

&#160; 

In addition, the industries in which we operate have been characterized historically by periodic fluctuations in overall demand for trucks, trailers and other specialty vehicles for which we supply products, resulting in corresponding fluctuations in demand for our products. Production and sales of the vehicles for which we supply products generally depend on economic conditions and a variety of other factors that are outside of our control, including freight tonnage, customer spending and preferences, vehicle age, labor relations and regulatory requirements. See Item 1A. Risk Factors &#32;below. Cycles in the major vehicle industry markets of North America and Europe are not necessarily concurrent or related. It is part of our strategy to continue to seek to expand our operations globally to help mitigate the effect of periodic fluctuations in demand of the vehicle industry in one or more particular countries. 

See section Trends and Uncertainties &#32;in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis for estimated commercial truck production volumes for selected original equipment ("OE") markets based on available sources and management's estimates.
