 Item 1. Business 

&#160; 

Overview 

&#160; 

We are a leisure travel company focused on providing travel services and products to residents of under-served cities in the United States. We were founded in 1997 and, in conjunction with our initial public offering in 2006, we incorporated in the state of Nevada. Our unique business model provides diversified revenue streams from various travel service and product offerings which distinguish us from other travel companies. We operate a low-cost passenger airline marketed to leisure travelers in under-served cities, allowing us to sell air transportation both on a stand-alone basis and bundled with the sale of air-related and third party services and products. In addition, we provide air transportation under fixed fee flying arrangements. Our developed route network, pricing philosophy, advertising, and product offerings built around relationships with premier leisure companies, are all intended to appeal to leisure travelers and make it attractive for them to purchase air travel and related services and products from us. 

A brief description of the travel services and products we provide to our customers: 

Scheduled service air transportation. We provide scheduled air transportation on limited-frequency nonstop flights predominantly between under-served cities and popular leisure destinations. As of February 1, 2016 , our operating fleet consisted of 51 &#32;MD-80 aircraft, 26 A320 series aircraft, and five &#32;Boeing 757-200 aircraft providing service on 294 &#32;routes to 104 &#32;cities. Based on recent announcements, we expect service will expand to 322 routes and 111 cities by August 2016. 

Air-related ancillary products and services. We provide unbundled air-related services and products in conjunction with air transportation for an additional cost to customers. These optional air-related services and products include a customer convenience fee, baggage fees, advance seat assignments, our own travel protection product, change fees, use of our call center for purchases, priority boarding, food and beverage purchases on board, and other air-related services. 

Third party ancillary products and services. We offer third party travel products such as hotel rooms, ground transportation (rental cars and hotel shuttle products) and attractions (show tickets) for sale to our passengers. 

Fixed fee contract air transportation. We provide air transportation through fixed fee agreements and charter service on a year-round and ad-hoc basis. 

Other revenue. &#32;&#32;We currently, and may choose to in the future, temporarily act as a lessor as an avenue to opportunistically acquire aircraft or engines. Upon the expiration of a lease, we would expect to operate the asset(s) ourselves. 

Our principal executive offices are located at 1201 N. Town Center Drive, Las Vegas, Nevada 89144. Our telephone number is (702) 851-7300. Our website address is http://www.allegiant.com. We have not incorporated by reference into this annual report the information on our website and investors should not consider it to be a part of this document. Our website address is included in this document for reference only. Our annual report, quarterly reports, current reports and amendments to those reports are made available free of charge through the investor relations section on our website as soon as reasonably practicable after electronically filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220;SEC&#8221;). 

Unique Business Model 

We have developed a unique business model that focuses on leisure travelers in small and medium-sized cities. The business model has evolved as our experienced management team has looked differently at the traditional way business has been conducted in the airline and travel industries. Our focus on the leisure customer allows us to eliminate the costly complexities burdening others in our industry in their goal to be all things to all customers, particularly most other airlines which target the business customer.

We have established a route network with a national footprint, providing service on 294 &#32;routes between 87 &#32;under-served cities and 17 &#32;leisure destinations, and serving 41 &#32;states as of February 1, 2016 . In most of these cities, we provide service to more than one of our leisure destinations. We currently provide service to the popular leisure destinations of Las Vegas, NV; Orlando, FL; Phoenix, AZ; Tampa/St. Petersburg, FL; Los Angeles, CA; Ft. Lauderdale, FL; Punta Gorda, FL; the San Francisco Bay Area, CA; Honolulu, HI; Palm Springs, CA; Austin, TX; New Orleans, LA; Jacksonville, FL; Savannah/Hilton Head, GA; and West Palm Beach, FL. We also provide service on a seasonal basis to San Diego, CA, and Myrtle Beach, SC, and will commence service to Baltimore/Washington, DC and Destin, FL in the spring of 2016. 

The geographic diversity of our route network protects us from regional variations in the economy and helps insulate us from competitive actions, as it would be difficult for a competitor to materially impact our business by targeting one city or region. Our widespread route network also contributes to the continued growth of our customer base. 

In developing a unique business model, our ancillary offerings, including the sale of third party products and services, have been a significant source of our total operating revenue growth. We have increased ancillary revenue per passenger from $5.87 in 2004 to $50.72 &#32;in 2015 . We own and manage our own air reservation system, giving us the ability to modify our system to enhance product offerings based on specific needs, without being dependent on non-customized product upgrades from outside suppliers. We believe the control of our automation systems has allowed us to be innovators in the industry by providing our customers with a variety of different travel services and products. 

We believe the following strengths from our unique business model allow us to maintain a competitive advantage in the markets we serve: 

Leisure customers in under-served cities 

We believe small and medium-sized cities represent a large, under-served, market, especially for leisure travel. Prior to the initiation of our service, leisure travelers from these markets had limited desirable options to reach leisure destinations because 

existing carriers are generally focused on connecting business customers through their hub-and-spoke networks. In 2014, we began serving selected medium-sized cities, to which major carriers have reduced service, creating a void for us to fill with limited or no direct nonstop competition on each route. 

We believe our nonstop service, along with our low prices and leisure company relationships, make it attractive for leisure travelers to purchase our travel services and products. The size of the markets we serve, and our focus on the leisure customer, allow us to adequately serve our markets with less frequency, and to vary our air transportation capacity to match seasonal and day of the week demand patterns. 

By focusing on under-served cities and routes, we believe we avoid the intense competition in high traffic domestic air corridors. In most of our small and medium-sized city markets, travelers previously faced high airfares and cumbersome connections or long drives to major airports in order to reach our leisure destinations. Based on published data from the U.S. Department of Transportation (&#8220;DOT&#8221;), we believe the initiation of our service stimulates demand because there is typically a substantial increase in traffic subsequent to new service beginning. Our market strategy is neither hostile to legacy carriers, whose historical focus has been connecting small cities to business markets with regional jets, nor to traditional low cost or ultra-low cost carriers generally focused on larger markets. Additionally, many major carriers have reduced service to medium-sized cities, which are not usually considered core hubs for these carriers. 

Capacity management 

Although the current low cost fuel environment has allowed us to increase flying during periods of lower demand, our core business model manages seat capacity by increased utilization of our aircraft during periods of high leisure demand and decreased utilization in low leisure demand periods. In 2015, during our peak demand period in March, we averaged 6.9 system block hours per aircraft per day while in September, our lowest month for demand, we averaged 4.2 system block hours per aircraft per day. Our management of seat capacity also includes changes in weekly frequency of certain markets based on identified peak and off-peak travel demand throughout the year. For example, the leisure destination of Palm Springs, CA, is more desirable for our customers from Bellingham, WA during winter months. Therefore, we seasonally decrease the frequency of our Bellingham-Palm Springs flights in the summer, and increase flights per week in the winter. Unlike other carriers which provide a fairly consistent number of flights every day of the week, we concentrate our flights on high demand leisure travel days and fly a smaller portion of our schedule on low demand days such as Tuesdays and Wednesdays. 

Our strong ancillary revenue production, coupled with the ability to spread costs over a larger number of passengers, has allowed us to operate profitably throughout periods of high fuel prices and economic recession. We manage our capacity with a goal of being profitable on each route. Low aircraft ownership costs facilitate our ability to adjust service levels quickly, and maintain profitability during difficult economic times. 

Low cost structure 

We believe a low cost structure is essential to competitive success in the airline industry. Excluding a one-time impairment charge of $43.3 million taken in 2014, our operating expense per available seat mile ("CASM") decreased from 10.47&#162; &#32;in 2014 to 8.45&#162; &#32;in 2015 . Excluding the cost of fuel and the above impairment charge, our operating CASM decreased from 6.13&#162; &#32;in 2014 &#32;to 5.81&#162; &#32;in 2015 . 

We continue to focus on maintaining low operating costs through the following tactics and strategies: 

&#160; 

Cost-driven schedule. We design our flight schedule to concentrate our aircraft each night at our crew bases which allows us to better utilize personnel, airport facilities, aircraft, spare parts inventory, and other assets. We believe leisure travelers are generally less concerned about departure and arrival times than business travelers, so we are able to schedule flights at times that enable us to reduce costs while remaining desirable to our leisure customers. 

Low aircraft ownership costs. We believe we properly balance low aircraft ownership costs (we have purchased all of our aircraft used) and operating costs to minimize our total costs. As of February 1, 2016 , our operating fleet consists of 51 &#32;MD-80 series aircraft, 26 &#32;Airbus A320 series aircraft, and five &#32;Boeing 757-200 aircraft. 

&#160; 

We continue to view the used Airbus A320 series aircraft market as being similar to the market we experienced when we began adding MD-80 aircraft to our fleet in 2001. We believe that future availability of used Airbus A320 series aircraft will be driven by high production rates of new current engine option aircraft, and re-fleeting strategies for new engine option ("NEO") narrow body aircraft by both air carriers and aircraft lessors. The addition of used Airbus A320 series aircraft has allowed us to 

maintain low aircraft ownership costs consistent with our business model. In this document, references to Airbus A320 series aircraft are intended to describe Airbus A319 and/or A320 aircraft. 

Simple product. We believe offering a simple product is critical to achieving low operating costs. As such, we sell only nonstop flights; we do not code-share or interline with other carriers; we have a single class cabin; we do not provide any free catered items - everything on board is for sale; we do not overbook our flights; we do not provide cargo or mail services; and we do not offer other perks such as airport lounges. 

Low distribution costs. Our nontraditional marketing approach results in very low distribution costs. We do not sell our product through outside sales channels, thus avoiding the fees charged by travel web sites (Expedia, Orbitz or Travelocity) and traditional global distribution systems (&#8220;GDS&#8221;) (Sabre or Worldspan). Our customers can only purchase travel at our airport ticket counters or, for a fee, on our website or through our telephone reservation center. The purchase of travel through our website is the least expensive form of distribution for us and accounted for 95.1 percent &#32;of our scheduled service revenue during 2015 . 

Small and medium-sized city market airports. Our business model focuses on residents of small and medium-sized cities in the United States. Typically, the airports in these cities have lower operating costs than airports in larger cities. These lower costs are driven by less expensive passenger facilities, landing, and ground service charges. In addition to inexpensive airport costs, many of our airports provide marketing support which results in lower marketing costs. 

Ancillary product offerings 

We believe most leisure travelers are concerned primarily with purchasing air travel for the least expensive price. As such, we have unbundled the air transportation product by charging fees for services many U.S. airlines have historically bundled in their product offering. We offer a simple base product at an attractive low fare, which enables us to stimulate demand and generate incremental revenue as customers pay additional amounts only for conveniences they value. For example, we do not offer complimentary advance seat assignments; however, customers who value this product can purchase advance seat assignments for a small incremental cost. In addition, snacks and beverages are sold individually on the aircraft, allowing passengers to purchase only items they value. 

Our third party product offerings give our customers the opportunity to purchase hotel rooms, rental cars, airport shuttle service, show tickets, and other attractions. Our third party offerings are available to customers based on our agreements with various travel and leisure companies. For example, we have an exclusive agreement with Enterprise Holdings Inc. for the sale of rental cars packaged with air travel, which made up over 50 percent of our third party products ancillary revenue in 2015. The pricing of each product and our margin can be adjusted based on customer demand because our customers purchase travel through our booking engine without any intermediaries. 

Strong financial position 

As of December 31, 2015 , we had $397.4 million &#32;of unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and investment securities, and total debt of $641.7 million . As we have been able to consistently generate cash from operations due to our profitability, we believe we have more than adequate resources to invest in the growth of our fleet, information technology, infrastructure, and development, while meeting short-term obligations. 

Training and development 

We are committed to investing in the development of adaptive learning courses for our employees, with a current focus on our operating groups. This progressive approach to training focuses on concept mastery, recognizing that individuals learn at varying paces, through different styles, and is designed to ensure the trainee fully understands each module before moving on to more advanced training. We also expect program development to facilitate recurrent training and to contribute to cost savings in the future, and we are in the process of seeking approval from the Federal Aviation Administration for various aspects of this training program. 

Routes and schedules 

Our current scheduled air service (including seasonal service) predominantly consists of limited frequency, nonstop flights into Las Vegas, Orlando, Phoenix and other Florida and California destinations from under-served cities across the continental United States. Our scheduled service route network as of February 1, 2016 &#32;is summarized below:

Marketing and Distribution 

Our website is our primary distribution method, and we also sell through our call center and at our airport ticket counters. This distribution mix creates significant cost savings and enables us to continue to build loyalty with our customers through increased interaction with them. We are also able to utilize customer email addresses in our database, which provides multiple cost effective opportunities to market products and services, including at the time of travel purchase, between purchase and travel, and after travel is complete. In addition, we market products and services to our customers during their flight. We believe the breadth of options we offer allows us to provide a &#8220;one-stop&#8221; shopping solution to enhance our customer's travel experience. More recently, we have run a national ad campaign in certain markets. In addition, when we enter new markets, we may advertise in local print publications, radio and/or television to introduce our new service to the community. These activities are sometimes supported by the local airport authority which has sought our initiation of service to the community. 

We continue to enhance our automation, including the upgrade of our current distribution platform, and we have fully integrated all Internet traffic to our booking engine. We expect the continuous improvement to our website and other automation enhancements will create additional revenue opportunities by allowing us to capitalize on customer loyalty with additional product offerings. 

Our low cost distribution strategy results in reduced expenses by avoiding the fees associated with the use of GDS distribution points. This distribution strategy also permits us to closely manage ancillary product offerings and pricing while developing and maintaining a direct relationship with our customers. We believe this continuous communication will result in substantial benefits over time. With our own automation system, we have the ability to continually change ancillary product offerings and pricing points, which allows us to find the optimal pricing levels for our various offerings. We believe this would be difficult and impractical to achieve through the use of the GDS. 

Competition 

&#160; 

The airline industry is highly competitive. Passenger demand and fare levels have historically been influenced by, among other things, the general state of the economy, international events, fuel prices, industry capacity, and pricing actions taken by other airlines. The principal competitive factors in the airline industry are price, schedule, customer service, routes served, types of aircraft, safety record and reputation, code-sharing relationships, and frequent flyer programs. 

&#160; 

Our competitors include legacy airlines, low cost carriers ("LCCs"), ultra-low cost carriers ("ULCC"), regional airlines, and new entrant airlines. Many of these airlines are larger, have significantly greater financial resources, are more well known, and have more established reputations than us. In a limited number of cases, following our entry into a market, competitors have chosen to add service, reduce their fares, or both. In a few cases, other airlines have entered after we have developed a market. 

&#160; 

We believe our under-served city strategy has reduced the intensity of competition we might otherwise face. As of February 1, 2016 , we are the only domestic scheduled carrier operating out of the Orlando Sanford International Airport, Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport, and Punta Gorda Airport. Although no other domestic scheduled carriers operate in these airports, most U.S. airlines serve the major airports for Orlando, Phoenix, and Ft. Myers. In addition, many U.S. airlines serve our other leisure destinations. As a result, there is potential for increased competition on our routes. 

As of February 1, 2016 , we face mainline competition on only 48 of our 294 &#32;routes. We compete with Southwest Airlines on 33 routes, Delta Airlines on eight routes, Frontier Airlines on six routes, American Airlines on five routes, Spirit Airlines on three routes, Hawaiian Airlines and JetBlue Airlines on two routes each, and Alaska Airlines and United Airlines on one route each. We will also experience additional competition on recently announced routes. 

&#160; 

Indirectly, we compete with Southwest, American, Delta, and other carriers that provide nonstop service to our leisure destinations from airports near our markets. We also face indirect competition from legacy carriers offering hub-and-spoke connections to our markets, although these fares tend to be substantially higher, with much longer elapsed travel times. Several airlines also offer competitive one-stop service from the medium-sized cities we serve. 

We also face indirect competition from automobile travel in our short-haul markets, primarily in our Florida leisure destinations. We believe our low cost pricing model and the convenience of air transportation help us compete favorably against automobile travel. 

&#160; 

In our fixed fee operations, we compete with other scheduled airlines in addition to independent passenger charter airlines. We also compete with aircraft owned or controlled by large tour companies. The basis of competition in the fixed fee market is cost, equipment capabilities, service, and reputation. 

Aircraft Fuel 

&#160; 

Fuel has historically been our largest operating expense. The cost of fuel is volatile, as it is subject to many economic and geopolitical factors we can neither control nor predict. Significant increases in fuel costs could materially affect our operating results and profitability. We do not currently use financial derivative products to hedge our exposure to fuel price volatility. 

&#160; 

In an effort to reduce our fuel costs, we have a wholly-owned subsidiary which entered into a limited liability company operating agreement with an affiliate of Orlando Sanford International Airport to engage in contract fueling transactions for the provision of aviation fuel to airline users at that airport. In addition, we have invested in fuel storage units and fuel transportation facilities involved in the fuel distribution process. By reason of these activities, we could potentially incur material liabilities, including possible environmental liabilities, to which we would not otherwise be subject. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015 , we employed 2,846 &#32;full-time equivalent employees, which consisted of 2,674 &#32;full-time and 344 &#32;part-time employees. Full-time equivalent employees consisted of 625 &#32;pilots, 841 &#32;flight attendants, 176 &#32;airport operations personnel, 264 &#32;mechanics, 146 &#32;reservation agents, 72 &#32;flight dispatchers, and 722 &#32;management and other personnel. 

Salary and benefits expense is our second largest expense, having represented approximately 26 percent &#32;of total operating expenses for 2015 , 20 percent in 2014 &#32;and 19 percent in 2013 . 

We have two employee groups which elected union representation, consisting of approximately half of our total employees. We are in negotiations for collective bargaining agreements with the labor organizations representing these employee groups. As of February 2016, the flight attendant group is in the midst of an election to determine whether they will remain unionized. 

Our relations with these labor organizations are governed by the Railway Labor Act ("RLA"). Under this act, if direct negotiations do not result in an agreement, either party may request the National Mediation Board ("NMB") to appoint a federal mediator. If no agreement is reached in these mediated discussions, the NMB may offer binding arbitration to the parties. If either party rejects binding arbitration, a &#8220;cooling off&#8221; period begins. At the end of this &#8220;cooling-off&#8221; period, the parties may engage in self-help, which among other events, could result in a strike from employees or for us to hire new employees to replace any striking workers. The table below identifies the status of these initial collective bargaining agreements:

Transport Workers Union 

&#160; 

Elected representation in December 2010. In mediation phase of the negotiation process. Election pending to determine whether they will remain unionized. Results of election will be known after February 25, 2016. 

In January 2015, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters ("IBT") asked the NMB to make a proffer of arbitration with respect to the pilot negotiations, which is a precursor to the parties being released into self-help. In response, we met with the NMB and expressed our position that the IBT&#8217;s request was unwarranted and an abuse of the NMB's processes, and that the parties should remain in negotiations. The NMB declined to grant the IBT's request and resumed mediated negotiations between the parties. Shortly thereafter, the IBT threatened to call a strike on the ground that Allegiant allegedly was in violation of the RLA's status quo obligations. We successfully requested the United States District Court for the District of Nevada to enjoin the strike. In late September 2015, the IBT renewed its request for a proffer with the NMB, which we, again, opposed. The NMB did not grant IBT&#8217;s request and instead ordered the parties back to negotiations. 

If we are unable to reach a labor agreement with these employee groups, they may seek to institute work interruptions or stoppages. We have not previously experienced any work interruptions or stoppages from our non-unionized or unionized employee groups. 

&#160; 

Aircraft Maintenance 

We have a Federal Aviation Administration ("FAA") approved maintenance program, which is administered by our maintenance department headquartered in Las Vegas. Technicians employed by us have appropriate experience and hold required licenses issued by the FAA. We provide them with comprehensive training and maintain our aircraft in accordance with FAA regulations. The maintenance performed on our aircraft can be divided into three general categories: line maintenance, major maintenance, and component and engine overhaul and repair. Line maintenance is generally performed by our personnel. We contract with outside organizations to provide major maintenance and component and engine overhaul and repair. We have chosen not to invest in facilities or equipment to perform our own major maintenance, engine overhaul or component work. Our management closely supervises all maintenance functions performed by our personnel and contractors employed by us, and by outside organizations. In addition to the maintenance contractors we presently utilize, we believe there are sufficient qualified alternative providers of maintenance services that we can use to satisfy our ongoing maintenance needs. 

Community Involvement 

We have worked with the Make-A-Wish Foundation since 2012 by flying "wish kids" and their families to their desired destinations, at no cost, and donating the proceeds from our in-flight Wingz Snack Pack program to the Foundation. In 2015, we flew approximately 1 million miles in connection with providing travel for granted wishes for these children and their families. 

&#160; 

Insurance 

&#160; 

We maintain insurance policies we believe are of types customary in the airline industry and as required by the DOT, and are in amounts we believe to be adequate to protect us against material loss. The policies principally provide coverage for public liability, passenger liability, baggage and cargo liability, property damage, including coverages for loss or damage to our flight equipment, directors and officers, and workers&#8217; compensation insurance. There is no assurance, however, that the amount of insurance we carry will be sufficient to protect us from material loss in all cases. 

Through the 2003 Emergency Wartime Supplemental Appropriations Act (the &#8220;Wartime Act&#8221;), the federal government has previously provided war-risk insurance coverage to commercial carriers, including coverage for losses from terrorism, for passengers, third parties (ground damage), and the aircraft hull. However, since the government-provided supplemental coverage from the Wartime Act was set to expire on September 30, 2014, we proactively canceled our government provided war-risk insurance coverage prior to that date and purchased comparable coverage via the commercial insurance marketplace. Available commercial insurance in the future could be more expensive, could have material differences in coverage than is currently provided, and may not be adequate to protect us from risk of loss from future acts of terrorism. 

Government Regulation 

&#160; 

We are subject to federal, state and local laws affecting the airline industry and to extensive regulation by the DOT, the FAA, and other governmental agencies. 

&#160; 

DOT. The DOT primarily regulates economic issues affecting air transportation such as certification and fitness of carriers, insurance requirements, consumer protection, competitive practices, and statistical reporting. The DOT also regulates requirements for accommodation of passengers with disabilities. The DOT has the authority to promulgate regulations and to investigate and institute proceedings to enforce its regulations and related federal statutes, and may assess civil penalties, 

suspend or revoke operating authority, and seek criminal sanctions. The DOT also has authority to restrict or prohibit a carrier&#8217;s cessation of service to a particular community if such cessation would leave the community without scheduled airline service. 

&#160; 

We hold DOT certificates of public convenience and necessity authorizing us to engage in scheduled air transportation of passengers, property, and mail within the United States, its territories and possessions, and between the United States and all countries that maintain a liberal aviation trade relationship with the United States (known as &#8220;open skies&#8221; countries). We also hold DOT authority to engage in charter air transportation of passengers, property, and mail on a domestic and international basis. 

&#160; 

FAA. The FAA primarily regulates flight operations and safety, including matters such as airworthiness and maintenance requirements for aircraft, pilot, mechanic, dispatcher and flight attendant training and certification, flight and duty time limitations, and air traffic control. The FAA requires each commercial airline to obtain and hold an FAA air carrier certificate. This certificate, in combination with operation specifications issued to the airline by the FAA, authorizes the airline to operate at specific airports using aircraft certificated by the FAA. We have and maintain in effect FAA certificates of airworthiness for all of our aircraft, and we hold the necessary FAA authority to fly to all of the cities we currently serve. Like all U.S. certificated carriers, our provision of scheduled service to certain destinations may require specific governmental authorization. The FAA has the authority to investigate all matters within its purview, to modify, suspend or revoke our authority to provide air transportation, to approve or disapprove the addition of aircraft to our operation specifications, or to modify, suspend, or revoke FAA licenses issued to individual personnel, for failure to comply with FAA regulations. The FAA can assess civil penalties for such failures and institute proceedings for the collection of monetary fines after notice and hearing. The FAA also has authority to seek criminal sanctions. The FAA can suspend or revoke our authority to provide air transportation on an emergency basis, without notice and hearing, if, in the FAA&#8217;s judgment, safety requires such action. A legal right to an independent, expedited review of such FAA action exists. Emergency suspensions or revocations have been upheld with few exceptions. The FAA monitors our compliance with maintenance, flight operations, and safety regulations on an ongoing basis, maintains a continuous working relationship with our operations and maintenance management personnel, and performs pre-scheduled inspections as well as frequent spot inspections of our aircraft, employees and records. 

The FAA also has the authority to promulgate rules and regulations and issue maintenance directives and other mandatory orders relating to, among other things, inspection, repair and modification of aircraft and engines, increased security precautions, aircraft equipment requirements, noise abatement, mandatory removal and replacement of aircraft parts and components, mandatory retirement of aircraft, and operational requirements and procedures. Such rules, regulations and directives are normally issued after an opportunity for public comment, however, they may be issued without advance notice or opportunity for comment if, in the FAA&#8217;s judgment, safety requires such action. 

We believe we are operating in compliance with applicable DOT and FAA regulations, interpretations and policies and we hold all necessary operating and airworthiness authorizations, certificates, and licenses. 

&#160; 

Security. Within the United States, civil aviation security functions, including review and approval of the content and implementation of air carriers&#8217; security programs, passenger and baggage screening, cargo security measures, airport security, assessment and distribution of intelligence, threat response, and security research and development are the responsibility of the Transportation Security Administration (&#8220;TSA&#8221;) of the Department of Homeland Security. The TSA has enforcement powers similar to the DOT&#8217;s and FAA&#8217;s described above. It also has the authority to issue regulations, including in cases of emergency, the authority to do so without advance notice, including issuance of a grounding order as occurred on September 11, 2001. 

Aviation Taxes and Fees. The authority of the federal government to collect most types of aviation taxes, which are used, in part, to finance the nation&#8217;s airport and air traffic control systems, and the authority of the FAA to expend those funds must be periodically reauthorized by the U.S. Congress. On September 30, 2015, Congress enacted the Airport and Airway Extension Act of 2015, which extended certain commercial aviation taxes (known generally as Federal Excise Taxes or "FET") through March 31, 2016. All carriers are required to collect these taxes from passengers and pass them through to the federal government. 

In addition to FET, there are federal fees related to services provided by the TSA, and, in the case of international flights, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection ("CBP"), the U.S Immigration and Naturalization Service ("INS"), and the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service ("APHIS"). There are also FAA-approved Passenger Facility Charges ("PFCs") imposed by most of the airports we serve. Like FET, air carriers collect these fees from passengers and pass them through to the respective federal agency or airport authority. These fees do not need to be reauthorized, although their amounts may be revised periodically. 

In 2016, Congress may consider reauthorization legislation that could increase the amount of FET and/or one or more of the other government fees identified above. By thus increasing the overall price charged to passengers, such action could lessen demand for air travel or force carriers, including us, to lower fares to maintain demand. Concurrently, Congress also may consider privatization of the U.S air traffic control ("ATC") system with user fee based funding. The effect of such action, if adopted as law, on our operating costs is unknown. Additionally, federal funding to airports and/or airport bond financing could be affected through future deficit reduction legislation, which could result in higher fees, rates, and charges at many of the airports we serve. 

Environmental. We are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and affecting matters such as aircraft engine emissions, aircraft noise emissions, and the discharge or disposal of materials and chemicals, which laws and regulations are administered by numerous state and federal agencies. These agencies have enforcement powers similar to the DOT&#8217;s and FAA&#8217;s described above. In addition, we may be required to conduct an environmental review of the effects projected from the addition of our service at airports. 

&#160; 

Federal law recognizes the right of airport operators with special noise problems to implement local noise abatement procedures so long as those procedures do not interfere unreasonably with interstate and foreign commerce and the national air transportation system. These restrictions can include limiting nighttime operations, directing specific aircraft operational procedures during takeoff and initial climb, and limiting the overall number of flights at an airport. None of the airports we serve currently imposes restrictions on the number of flights or hours of operation that have a meaningful impact on our operations. It is possible one or more such airports may impose additional future restrictions with or without advance notice, which may impact our operations. 

&#160; 

Foreign Ownership. To maintain our DOT and FAA certificates, our airline operating subsidiary and we (as the airline&#8217;s holding company) must qualify continuously as citizens of the United States within the meaning of U.S. aeronautical laws and regulations. This means we must be under the actual control of U.S. citizens and we must satisfy certain other requirements, including that our president/Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") and at least two-thirds of our board of directors and other managing officers are U.S. citizens, and that not more than 25 percent of our voting stock is owned or controlled by non-U.S. citizens. The amount of non-voting stock that may be owned or controlled by non-U.S. citizens is strictly limited as well. We believe we are in compliance with these ownership and control criteria. 

&#160; 

Other Regulations. Air carriers are subject to certain provisions of federal laws and regulations governing communications because of their extensive use of radio and other communication facilities, and are required to obtain an aeronautical radio license from the Federal Communications Commission (&#8220;FCC&#8221;). To the extent we are subject to FCC requirements, we intend to continue to comply with those requirements. 

&#160; 

The quality of water used for drinking and hand-washing aboard aircraft is subject to regulation by the Environmental Protection Agency (&#8220;EPA&#8221;). To the extent we are subject to EPA requirements, we intend to continue to comply with those requirements. 

Working conditions of cabin crewmembers while onboard aircraft are subject to regulation by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration ("OSHA") of the Department of Labor. To the extent we are subject to OSHA requirements, we intend to continue to comply with those requirements. 

Our operations may become subject to additional federal requirements in the future under certain circumstances. During a period of past fuel scarcity, air carrier access to jet fuel was subject to allocation regulations promulgated by the Department of Energy. Changes to the federal excise tax and other government fees imposed on air transportation have been proposed and implemented from time to time and may result in an increased tax burden for airlines and their passengers. 

&#160; 

We are also subject to state and local laws, regulations, and ordinances at locations where we operate and to the rules and regulations of various local authorities that operate the airports we serve. None of the airports in the cities in which we operate have slot control, gate availability, or curfews that pose meaningful limitations on our operations. However, some airports we serve have short runways that require us to operate some flights at less than full capacity. 

International air transportation, whether provided on a scheduled or charter basis, is subject to the laws, rules, regulations, and licensing requirements of the foreign countries to, from and over which the international flights operate. Foreign laws, rules, regulations and licensing requirements governing air transportation are generally similar, in principle, to the regulatory scheme of the United States as described above, although in some cases foreign requirements are comparatively less onerous and in others, more onerous. We must comply with the laws, rules and regulations of each country to, from, or over which we operate. 

International flights are also subject to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Agriculture requirements and the requirements of equivalent foreign governmental agencies. 

&#160; 

Future Laws and Regulations. Congress, the DOT, the FAA, the TSA, and other governmental agencies have under consideration, and in the future may consider and adopt, new laws, regulations, interpretations and policies regarding a wide variety of matters that could affect, directly or indirectly, our operations, ownership, and profitability. We cannot predict what other matters might be considered in the future by the FAA, the DOT, the TSA, other agencies, or Congress, nor can we judge what impact, if any, the implementation of any of these proposals or changes might have on our business. 

&#160; 

Civil Reserve Air Fleet. We are a participant in the Civil Reserve Air Fleet (&#8220;CRAF&#8221;) Program which affords the U.S. Department of Defense the right to charter our aircraft during national emergencies when the need for military airlift exceeds the capability of available military resources. During the Persian Gulf War of 1990-91 and on other occasions, CRAF carriers were required to permit the military to use their aircraft in this manner. As a result of our CRAF participation, we are eligible to bid on and be awarded peacetime airlift contracts with the military.
