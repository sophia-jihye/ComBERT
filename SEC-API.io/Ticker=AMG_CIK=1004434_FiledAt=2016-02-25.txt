 Item 1. 

Business 

We are a global asset management company with equity investments in leading boutique investment management firms, which we refer to as our &#8220;Affiliates.&#8221; Our innovative partnership approach allows each Affiliate&#8217;s management team to own significant equity in their firm and maintain operational autonomy. Our strategy is to generate shareholder value through the growth of existing Affiliates, as well as through investments in new and additional investments in existing Affiliates. In addition, we provide centralized assistance to our Affiliates in strategic matters, marketing, distribution, product development and operations. As of December 31, 2015, our aggregate assets under management were $611.3 billion (approximately $628 billion pro forma for investments which have since closed), in more than 500 investment products across a broad range of active return-oriented strategies and distribution channels. 

We hold meaningful equity interests in each of our Affiliates. In certain cases, we own a majority interest while in other cases we own a minority interest. In all cases, Affiliate management retains a significant equity interest in their own firm. Affiliate management equity ownership (along with our ownership) aligns our interests, enhances Affiliate management equity incentives and preserves Affiliate management's opportunity to participate directly in the long-term future growth of their firms. Our innovative partnership approach provides Affiliate management with a degree of liquidity and financial diversification and ensures that our Affiliates maintain investment and operational autonomy in managing their businesses, as well as their unique entrepreneurial culture and independence. 

Given our permanent partnership approach, when we own a majority of the equity interests, we address the ongoing succession planning issues facing the Affiliate&#8217;s principal owners as they transition incentives to future generations by facilitating the transfer of equity over time to the next generation of Affiliate management. In cases in which we own a minority of the equity interests, we typically do not have an obligation to repurchase Affiliate equity interests, but may make additional investments to further facilitate Affiliate ownership transition. 

Although we invest in boutique investment management firms that we anticipate will grow independently, given our permanent partnership approach, we assist our Affiliates with their growth by providing access to the resources and scale of a global asset management company. 

We are focused on investing in the highest quality boutique investment management firms globally, including traditional, alternative and wealth management firms, specializing in an array of active return-oriented investment strategies. We identify high quality boutique firms based on our thorough understanding of the asset management industry and we have developed long-term relationships with a significant number of these firms. Within our target universe, we seek strong and stable boutiques with the best growth prospects, especially with respect to the growth potential for their areas of focus, such as global equities or alternative strategies. These boutiques are typically characterized by a strong multi-generational management team with focused investment discipline, entrepreneurial culture, a commitment to building longer-term success, and active return-oriented strategies sold across multiple distribution channels. We anticipate that we will have significant additional investment opportunities across the global asset management industry, most often in independent boutique investment management firms, 

but also including the potential for investments resulting from subsidiary divestitures, secondary sales and other special situations. 

We are well positioned to execute upon these investment opportunities through our established process of identifying and cultivating investment prospects, our broad industry relationships, and our substantial experience and expertise in structuring and negotiating transactions. We have a strong reputation as an outstanding partner to our existing Affiliates, and are widely recognized in the marketplace as providing an innovative solution for the needs of the highest quality boutique investment management firms in the world. 

Investment Management Operations 

As of December 31, 2015, we managed $611.3 billion in predominately active return-oriented assets in our three principal distribution channels: Institutional, Mutual Fund and High Net Worth. These active return-oriented strategies primarily comprise global equities and alternative products, rather than indexing strategies, exchange traded funds, fixed income or money market products, which generally carry lower fee rates than active return-oriented strategies. Given our strategy to grow our existing Affiliates, as well as partner with additional boutique investment management firms, we expect to continue to grow our business by adding active return-oriented strategies. We believe our geographic diversification across active return-oriented strategies in over 500 products in our three distribution channels helps to mitigate our exposure to risks created by changing market environments. The following table provides information regarding the composition of our total assets under management by active return-oriented strategy: (in billions)

Institutional Distribution Channel 

Through our Affiliates, we manage active return-oriented strategies primarily through separate accounts for large institutional investors world-wide including foundations, endowments, sovereign wealth funds and retirement plans for corporations and municipalities. 

Our Affiliates&#8217; institutional investment services and products are distributed by sales and marketing professionals developing new institutional business through direct sales efforts and established relationships with consultants around the world. Our global distribution platform operates in key markets to extend the reach of our Affiliates&#8217; own business development efforts, including offices in Sydney, serving institutional investors in Australia and New Zealand; London, serving institutional investors in the United Kingdom and continental Europe; Zurich, serving institutional investors in Switzerland; Dubai, serving institutional investors in the Middle East; and Hong Kong, serving institutional investors in Asia. Our global distribution efforts are designed to provide the necessary resources and expertise to ensure that our Affiliates&#8217; products and services are responsive to the evolving demands of the global marketplace. Our Affiliates currently manage assets for non-U.S. clients in more than 50 countries, including all major developed markets. 

Mutual Fund Distribution Channel 

Through our Affiliates and AMG Funds, our U.S. retail platform, we provide advisory or sub-advisory services to active return-oriented mutual funds, UCITS and other retail products. These products are distributed globally to retail and institutional clients directly and through intermediaries, including independent investment advisors, retirement plan sponsors, broker-dealers, major fund marketplaces, wrap sponsor platforms and bank trust departments. 

High Net Worth Distribution Channel 

Through our Affiliates, we provide advisory services to high net worth and ultra-high net worth individuals, families, trusts, foundations, endowments and retirement plans. Direct services to these clients include customized investment counseling, investment management, financial, tax and estate planning and family office services. 

Through our Affiliates, we also provide advisory services to high net worth individuals through managed account relationships with intermediaries such as brokerage firms and, through AMG Funds, provide enhanced managed account distribution and administration capabilities to individual managed account clients. 

Our Innovative Structure and Relationship with Affiliates 

We establish and maintain long-term partnerships with management of our Affiliates, believing that Affiliate management equity ownership (along with our ownership) aligns our interests, enhances Affiliate management equity incentives and preserves management&#8217;s incentive to continue to grow their businesses. Our innovative partnership approach allows for management of our Affiliates to retain equity sufficient to address their particular needs and ensures that our Affiliates maintain investment and operational autonomy in managing their businesses, as well as their unique entrepreneurial culture and independence. Although the equity structure of each investment is tailored to meet the needs of the particular Affiliate, in all cases, we maintain a meaningful equity interest in the firm, with a significant equity interest retained by Affiliate management. 

Each of our Affiliates operates through distinct entities, typically organized as limited liability companies or limited partnerships (or equivalent non-U.S. forms), which affords us the flexibility to design a separate operating agreement for each Affiliate that reflects our arrangements with respect to governance, economic participation, equity incentives and the other terms of our relationship. In each case, the operating agreement provides for a governance structure that gives Affiliate management the authority to manage and operate the business on a day-to-day basis. The operating agreement also reflects the specific terms of our economic participation in the Affiliate, which in each case is structured to ensure alignment of our and Affiliate management&#8217;s economic interests (a &#8220;structured partnership interest&#8221;). Our structured partnership interests consist 

primarily of structures through which we share in the Affiliate&#8217;s revenue without regard to expenses. Our structured partnership interests also include structures through which we share in the Affiliate&#8217;s revenue less certain agreed-upon expenses. 

When we own a majority of the equity interests in an Affiliate and share in the Affiliate&#8217;s revenue without regard to expenses, a set percentage of revenue is allocated to fund operating expenses, including compensation (the &#8220;Operating Allocation&#8221;), while the remaining revenue (the &#8220;Owners&#8217; Allocation&#8221;) is allocated to us and Affiliate management in proportion to our respective ownership interests (see Exhibit 1). We and Affiliate management therefore participate in any increases or decreases in revenue through the Owners&#8217; Allocation, and Affiliate management also participates in any increases or decreases in margin through the Operating Allocation. 

&#32; Exhibit 1 (Typical Structured Partnership Interest) 

When we own a minority of the equity interests in an Affiliate and share in the Affiliate&#8217;s revenue without regard to expenses, we are allocated a set percentage of revenue, with the remaining revenue allocated to fund operating expenses and distributions to Affiliate management. 

In structured partnership interests in which we share in an Affiliate&#8217;s revenue without regard to expenses, our contractual share of revenue generally has priority over distributions to Affiliate management. 

When our structured partnership interest is calculated by reference to an Affiliate&#8217;s revenue less certain agreed-upon expenses, whether we own a majority or minority of the equity interests in the Affiliate, we are allocated a set percentage of revenue net of the agreed categories of expenses, thereby participating in any increases or decreases in both revenue and the expenses that are included in the calculation. 

When we own a majority of the equity interests in an Affiliate, we consolidate the Affiliate&#8217;s financial results in our revenue and operating expenses and primarily use structures in which we share in the Affiliate&#8217;s revenue without regard to expenses. When we own a minority interest, we use the equity method of accounting under which the Affiliate&#8217;s financial results are reported (net of intangible amortization) in Income from equity method investments in our Consolidated Statements of Income, and are not included in our revenue and operating expenses. For these equity method investments, we either share in the Affiliate&#8217;s revenue without regard to expenses or share in the Affiliate&#8217;s revenue less certain agreed-upon expenses. 

From time to time, we may change the structure of our arrangements with an Affiliate in order to better support the Affiliate&#8217;s growth strategy. 

Competition 

In our three principal distribution channels, our Affiliates compete with a large number of other domestic and foreign investment management firms, as well as with subsidiaries of larger financial organizations. These firms may have significantly greater financial, technological and marketing resources, captive distribution and assets under management and many offer an even broader array of investment products and services. Certain Affiliates are active in the same distribution channels and, from time to time, may compete with each other for clients. In addition, there are relatively few barriers to entry for new investment management firms, especially in the Institutional distribution channel. We believe that the most important factors affecting our Affiliates&#8217; ability to compete for clients in our three principal distribution channels are the: 

&#8226; 

performance records, investment style, discipline and reputation of our Affiliates and their management teams; 

&#8226; 

depth and continuity of client relationships; 

&#8226; 

maintenance of strong business relationships with major intermediaries; 

&#8226; 

diversity of products and level of client service offered; 

&#8226; 

continued success of our global distribution platform; and 

&#8226; 

continued development, either organically or through new investments, of investment strategies to meet the changing needs of investors. 

The relative importance of each of these factors can vary depending on the distribution channel and the type of investment management service involved, as well as general market conditions. Our Affiliates&#8217; ability to retain and increase assets under management would be adversely affected if client accounts underperform in comparison to relevant benchmarks or peer groups, or if key personnel leave an Affiliate. The ability to compete with other investment management firms also depends, in part, on the relative attractiveness of our Affiliates&#8217; investment philosophies, methods under then-prevailing market trends, fees or a combination of these factors. Our Affiliates represent a diverse group of boutique investment management firms with predominantly active return-oriented strategies, rather than indexing strategies, exchange traded funds, fixed income or money market products, which generally carry lower fee rates. Changes in investor risk tolerance or investment preferences could result in investor allocation away from active return-oriented products. 

We compete with a number of acquirers of and investors in investment management firms, including other investment management companies, private equity firms, sovereign wealth funds and larger financial organizations. We believe that the most important factors affecting our ability to compete for future investments are the: 

&#8226; 

degree to which target firms view our investment model, equity incentive structures and access to economies of scale as preferable (financially, operationally or otherwise) to acquisition or investment arrangements offered by others; and 

&#8226; 

reputation and performance of our Affiliates, by which target firms may judge us and our future prospects. 

Government Regulation 

Our and our Affiliates&#8217; businesses are subject to complex and extensive regulation by various regulatory authorities and exchanges in jurisdictions around the world. This regulatory environment may be altered without notice by new laws or regulations, revisions to existing laws or regulations or new or revised interpretations or guidance. Global financial regulatory reform initiatives are likely to result in more stringent regulation, and changes in laws or regulations and their application to us or our Affiliates could require that we or our Affiliates incur substantial cost or curtail operations or investment offerings. Our or our Affiliates&#8217; businesses may be subject to regulatory inquiry or scrutiny by regulatory authorities, and regulatory authorities may also conduct examinations or inspections of our operations or those of our Affiliates with or without notice. Any determination of a failure to comply with laws or regulations could result in disciplinary or enforcement action with penalties that may include the disgorgement of fees, fines, suspensions or censure of individual employees or revocation or limitation of business activities or registration. Even in the absence of wrongdoing, regulatory inquiries or proceedings could cause substantial expenditures of time and capital and result in reputational damage. 

AMG Funds is comprised of two advisers registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (Advisers Act), and they collectively sponsor over 70 U.S. mutual funds registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (Investment Company Act) that are managed by Affiliates and unrelated investment managers. A number of our Affiliates also serve as advisers to mutual funds sponsored by them or by third parties. The Advisers Act imposes numerous obligations on registered investment advisers, including fiduciary duties, recordkeeping requirements, operational requirements and compliance and disclosure obligations. The Investment Company Act imposes additional obligations on fund advisers, including investment restrictions and other governance, compliance, reporting and fiduciary obligations relating to the management of mutual funds. Rulemaking proposed by the SEC in 2015 may create additional reporting requirements for advisers and funds, and additional requirements for mutual funds in the areas of liquidity management and the use of derivatives. If adopted as proposed, the derivatives rule could negatively impact our Affiliates&#8217; ability to manage certain products and impose additional compliance and operational costs. 

Outside of the U.S., Affiliated Managers Group Limited (AMG Limited) is regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority in the United Kingdom, and is authorized as a promoter in Ireland by the Central Bank of Ireland. AMG Limited serves as the 

promoter for our Irish UCITS platform, which sponsors UCITS funds managed by Affiliates and marketed by AMG Limited in the UK and Europe. AMG Limited&#8217;s branch, AMG Limited (Dubai), is regulated as a representative office by the Dubai Financial Services Authority. Affiliated Managers Group (Hong Kong) Limited is regulated by the Securities and Futures Commission in Hong Kong, and Affiliated Managers Group Pty Ltd is regulated by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission in Australia. 

Our Affiliates&#8217; investment management operations are also subject to regulation by U.S. and non-U.S. authorities and exchanges. The majority of our Affiliates are registered as investment advisers under the Advisers Act, and many of our Affiliates are also subject to non-U.S. regulatory oversight. We have Affiliates domiciled in a number of jurisdictions, and these Affiliates are subject to extensive regulation under the laws and regulations of and supervision by governmental authorities in each of these jurisdictions. Our Affiliates also offer their products and services in many countries around the world, and are subject to various requirements relating to such activities. Many of our Affiliates also sponsor registered and unregistered funds in the U.S. and in other jurisdictions, including Guernsey, Jersey, Ireland, Luxembourg, British Virgin Islands and the Cayman Islands, and are subject to regulatory requirements in those jurisdictions and in the jurisdictions where those funds may be offered. Our Affiliates invest in publicly-traded securities of issuers across the globe and are subject to requirements in numerous jurisdictions for reporting of beneficial ownership positions and other requirements. Virtually all aspects of the asset management business, including strategy and product-related sales and distribution activities, are subject to regulation. These laws, rules and regulations are primarily intended to protect the clients of asset managers, and generally grant supervisory agencies and regulatory bodies broad administrative powers, including the power to set minimum capital requirements and limit or restrict an investment adviser from conducting its business in the event of a failure to comply with such laws and regulations, to suspend registered employees and to invoke censures or fines for both the regulated business and its employees. 

We and our Affiliates are also subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA), and related regulations, with respect to their retirement plan clients. ERISA imposes duties on persons who are fiduciaries under ERISA, and prohibits certain transactions involving related parties to a retirement plan. The Department of Labor administers ERISA and regulates investment advisers who service retirement plan clients and has been increasingly active in proposing and adopting additional regulations applicable to the asset management industry. 

We and certain of our Affiliates are also members of the National Futures Association and regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) with respect to the management of mutual funds and other products that utilize futures, swaps or other derivative products. The Commodity Exchange Act and CFTC regulations impose additional operational, risk management and compliance burdens. 

In addition, we and certain of our Affiliates are registered broker-dealers and members of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), for the purpose of distributing funds or other asset management products. These broker-dealers are subject to net capital rules that mandate that they maintain certain levels of capital. FINRA has adopted extensive regulatory requirements relating to sales practices, registration of personnel, compliance and supervision, and compensation and disclosure. FINRA and the SEC conduct periodic examinations of member broker-dealers. The SEC, FINRA and state securities commissions may also conduct administrative proceedings that can result in censure, fine, suspension or expulsion of a broker-dealer, its officers or registered employees. These administrative proceedings, whether or not resulting in adverse findings, can require substantial expenditures and can have an adverse impact on the reputation or business of a broker-dealer. 

We and our Affiliates may also be subject to regulatory capital requirements, including those of federal, state and non-U.S. regulatory agencies. Our and our Affiliates&#8217; regulatory capital, as defined, meets or exceeds all minimum requirements. 

Due to the extensive laws and regulations to which we and our Affiliates are subject, we must devote substantial time, expense and effort to remaining current on, and addressing, legal and regulatory compliance matters. We and our Affiliates have experienced legal teams and compliance professionals in place to address the legal, regulatory and compliance requirements relating to our global operations, and have in place relationships with various legal and regulatory advisors in each of the countries where we and our Affiliates have business interests. Each of our Affiliates has established a compliance program to address regulatory compliance requirements for its operations, and provides ongoing reporting to us on compliance matters. 

Employees and Corporate Organization 

As of December 31, 2015 , we had approximately 3,200 employees, the substantial majority of which were employed full-time by our Affiliates. Neither we nor our Affiliates are subject to any collective bargaining agreements, and we believe that our and our Affiliates&#8217; labor relations are good. We were formed in 1993 as a corporation under the laws of the State of Delaware. 

Our Web Site 

Our web site is www.amg.com . Our web site provides information about us, and from time to time we may use it as a distribution channel of material company information.
