Business 

The disclosures set forth in this item are qualified by Item 1A&#8212;Risk Factors and the section captioned &#8220;Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements&#8221; in Item 7&#8212;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this report and other cautionary statements set forth elsewhere in this report. 

Valley National Bancorp, headquartered in Wayne, New Jersey, is a New Jersey corporation organized in 1983 and is registered as a bank holding company with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (&#8220;Holding Company Act&#8221;). The words &#8220;Valley,&#8221; &#8220;the Company,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;our&#8221; and &#8220;us&#8221; refer to Valley National Bancorp and its wholly owned subsidiaries, unless we indicate otherwise. At December 31, 2015 , Valley had consolidated total assets of $21.6 billion , total net loans of $15.9 billion , total deposits of $16.3 billion &#32;and total shareholders&#8217; equity of $2.2 billion . In addition to its principal subsidiary, Valley National Bank (commonly referred to as the &#8220;Bank&#8221; in this report), Valley owns all of the voting and common shares of GCB Capital Trust III and State Bancorp Capital Trusts I and II through which trust preferred securities were issued. These trusts are not consolidated subsidiaries. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements. 

Valley National Bank is a national banking association chartered in 1927 under the laws of the United States. Currently, the Bank has 227 branches serving northern and central New Jersey, the New York City boroughs of Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens and Long Island, and Florida. The Bank provides a full range of commercial, retail, insurance and wealth management financial services products. The Bank provides a variety of banking services including automated teller machines, telephone and internet banking, remote deposit capture, overdraft facilities, drive-in and night deposit services, and safe deposit facilities. The Bank also provides certain international banking services to customers including standby letters of credit, documentary letters of credit and related products, and certain ancillary services such as foreign exchange, documentary collections, foreign wire transfers and the maintenance of foreign bank accounts. 

Valley National Bank&#8217;s wholly-owned subsidiaries are all included in the consolidated financial statements of Valley (See Exhibit 21 at Part IV, Item 15 for a list of subsidiaries). These subsidiaries include: 

&#8226; 

an all-line insurance agency offering property and casualty, life and health insurance; 

&#8226; 

asset management advisers which are Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) registered investment advisers; 

&#8226; 

title insurance agencies in New Jersey, New York and Florida; 

&#8226; 

subsidiaries which hold, maintain and manage investment assets for the Bank; 

&#8226; 

a subsidiary which owns and services auto loans; 

&#8226; 

a subsidiary which specializes in health care equipment lending and other commercial equipment leases; 

&#8226; 

a subsidiary which owns and services existing general aviation aircraft loans and existing commercial equipment leases; and 

&#8226; 

a subsidiary which owns and services New York commercial loans. 

The Bank&#8217;s subsidiaries also include real estate investment trust subsidiaries (the REIT subsidiaries) which own real estate related investments and a REIT subsidiary, which owns some of the real estate utilized by the Bank and related real estate investments. Except for Valley&#8217;s REIT subsidiaries, all subsidiaries mentioned above are directly or indirectly wholly owned by the Bank. Because each REIT must have 100 or more shareholders to qualify as a REIT, each REIT has issued less than 20 percent of their outstanding non-voting preferred stock to individuals, most of whom are current and former (non-executive officer) Bank employees. The Bank owns the remaining preferred stock and all the common stock of the REITs. 

Recent Acquisitions 

Valley has grown significantly in the past five years primarily through bank acquisitions that expanded our branch footprint into Long Island, New York and Florida. Recent bank transactions are discussed further below. 

CNLBancshares, Inc. On December 1, 2015, Valley completed its acquisition of CNLBancshares, Inc. (CNL) and its wholly-owned subsidiary, CNLBank, headquartered in Orlando, Florida, a commercial bank with approximately $1.6 billion &#32;in assets, $825 million &#32;in loans, $1.2 billion &#32;in deposits and 16 &#32;branch offices on the date of its acquisition by Valley. The CNL acquisition increased Valley's Florida branch network (first started with the acquisition of 1st United Bancorp, Inc. in 2014 discussed further 

&#160; 

2015 Form 10-K 

below) to a total of 36 branches covering most major markets in central and southern Florida. The acquired branches will now allow us to service Florida's west coast markets of Naples, Bonita Springs, Fort Myers and Sarasota. We also added three offices in the Jacksonville area and expanded our presence in the Orlando market. The common shareholders of CNL received 0.705 &#32;of a share of Valley common stock for each CNL share they owned prior to the merger. The total consideration for the acquisition was approximately $230 million , consisting of 20.6 million &#32;shares of Valley common stock. The transaction generated approximately $110 million in goodwill and $19 million in core deposit intangible assets subject to amortization. See further details regarding the acquisition of CNL in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. 

1st United Bancorp, Inc. On November 1, 2014, Valley acquired 1st United Bancorp, Inc. (1st United) and its wholly-owned subsidiary, 1st United Bank, a commercial bank with approximately $1.7 billion in assets, $1.2 billion in loans, and $1.4 billion in deposits, after purchase accounting adjustments. The 1st United acquisition gave Valley its first Florida branch network of 20 branch offices covering some of the most attractive urban banking markets in Florida, including locations throughout southeast Florida, the Treasure Coast, central Florida and central Gulf Coast regions. The common shareholders of 1st United received 0.89 of a share of Valley common stock for each 1st United share they owned prior to the merger. The total consideration for the acquisition was approximately $300 million, consisting of 30.7 million shares of Valley common stock and $8.9 million of cash consideration paid to 1st United stock option holders. In conjunction with the merger, Valley shareholders approved an amendment of its certificate of incorporation to increase its authorized common shares by 100 million shares during the third quarter of 2014. 

In connection with the 1st United acquisition, we acquired loans and other real estate owned subject to Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) loss-share agreements (referred to as &#8220;covered loans&#8221; and &#8220;covered OREO&#8221;, together &#8220;covered assets&#8221;). The FDIC loss-share agreements relate to three previous FDIC-assisted acquisitions completed by 1st United from 2009 to 2011. The Bank shares losses on covered assets in accordance with provisions of each loss-share agreement. The vast majority of Valley's covered loans totaling $122.3 million, or 0.8 percent of total loans, at December 31, 2015 are covered by commercial loan and single-family (residential) loss sharing agreements acquired from 1st United that will expire between 2016 and 2021. 

State Bancorp, Inc. On January 1, 2012, Valley acquired State Bancorp, Inc. (State Bancorp), the holding company for State Bank of Long Island, a commercial bank with approximately $1.7 billion in assets, $1.1 billion in loans, and $1.4 billion in deposits and 16 branches in Nassau, Suffolk, Queens, and Manhattan at December 31, 2011. Of the acquired branch offices, 14 remain within our 42 branch network in New York and are located in Long Island and Queens. The common shareholders of State Bancorp received a fixed one- for- one exchange ratio for Valley National Bancorp common stock. The total consideration for the all stock acquisition equaled $208 million. 

Additionally, a warrant issued by State Bancorp (in connection with its previously redeemed preferred stock issuance) to the U.S. Treasury in December 2008 was assumed by Valley as of the acquisition date. The ten-year warrant to purchase up to 489 thousand of Valley common shares has an exercise price of $11.30 per share, and is exercisable on a net exercise basis. At the request of the U.S. Treasury, the warrant shares were individually sold at public auction in May 2015. All of the warrants remained outstanding at December 31, 2015 . 

Business Segments 

Our business segments are reassessed by management, at least on an annual basis, to ensure the proper identification and reporting of our operating segments. Valley currently reports the results of its operations and manages its business through four business segments: commercial lending, consumer lending, investment management, and corporate and other adjustments. Valley&#8217;s Wealth Management Division comprised of trust, asset management and insurance services, is included in the consumer lending segment. See Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements for details of the financial performance of our business segments. We offer a variety of products and services within the commercial and consumer lending segments as described below. 

Commercial Lending Segment 

Commercial and Industrial Loans. &#32;Commercial and industrial loans totaled approximately $2.5 billion &#32;and represented 15.8 percent &#32;of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2015 . We make commercial loans to small and middle market businesses most often located in the New Jersey and New York area, as well as Florida which accounted for approximately 7 percent of the $2.5 billion &#32;in commercial and industrial loans at December 31, 2015 . A significant proportion of Valley&#8217;s commercial and industrial loan portfolio is granted to long-standing customers of proven ability, strong repayment performance, and high character. Underwriting standards are designed to assess the borrower&#8217;s ability to generate recurring cash flow sufficient to meet the debt service requirements of loans granted. While such recurring cash flow serves as the primary source of repayment, most of the loans are collateralized by borrower assets intended to serve as a secondary source of repayment should the need arise. Anticipated cash flows of borrowers, however, may not be as expected and the collateral securing these loans may fluctuate in value, or in the case of loans secured by accounts receivable, the ability of the borrower to collect all amounts due from its customers. Our loan decisions will include consideration of a borrower&#8217;s willingness to repay debts, collateral coverage, standing in the community and other forms of support. Strong consideration is given to long-term existing customers that have maintained a favorable 

&#160; 

2015 Form 10-K 

relationship with the Bank. Commercial loan products offered consist of term loans for equipment purchases, working capital lines of credit that assist our customers&#8217; financing of accounts receivable and inventory, and commercial mortgages for owner occupied properties. Working capital advances are generally used to finance seasonal requirements and are repaid at the end of the cycle. Short-term commercial business loans may be collateralized by a lien on accounts receivable, inventory, equipment and/or partly collateralized by real estate. Short-term loans may also be made on an unsecured basis based on a borrower&#8217;s financial strength and past performance. Whenever possible, we obtain the personal guarantee of the borrower&#8217;s principals to mitigate the risk. Unsecured loans, when made, are generally granted to the Bank&#8217;s most creditworthy borrowers. Unsecured commercial and industrial loans totaled $386.6 million &#32;at December 31, 2015 . In addition, through our subsidiaries we provide financing to the medical equipment leasing market and engage in asset-based accounts receivable and inventory financing. 

The commercial portfolio also includes approximately $159 million of performing taxi medallion loans at December 31, 2015 , most of which consist of loans to fleet owners of New York City medallions. Valley's historical taxi medallion lending criteria has been conservative in regards to capping the loan amounts in relation to market valuations, as well as obtaining personal guarantees whenever possible. While this portion of the portfolio is performing at December 31,2015, Valley continues to closely monitor its performance and the potential impact of changes in market valuations for taxi medallions due to new competing services and ride-sharing companies, as well as other factors. 

Commercial Real Estate Loans. Commercial real estate loans and construction loans totaled $8.2 billion &#32;and represented 51.0 percent &#32;of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2015 . We originate commercial real estate loans that are largely secured by multi-unit residential property and non-owner occupied commercial, industrial, and retail property within New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania and Florida. Loans originated from our Florida lending operations represented 14.5 percent of the $8.2 billion &#32;in total commercial real estate loans at December 31, 2015 . Loans are generally written on an adjustable basis with rates tied to a specifically identified market rate index. Adjustment periods generally range between five to ten years and repayment is generally structured on a fully amortizing basis for terms up to thirty years. Commercial real estate loans are subject to underwriting standards and processes similar to commercial and industrial loans but generally they involve larger principal balances and longer repayment periods as compared to commercial and industrial loans. Commercial real estate loans are viewed primarily as cash flow loans and secondarily as loans secured by real property. Repayment of most loans is dependent upon the cash flow generated from the property securing the loan or the business that occupies the property. Commercial real estate loans may be more adversely affected by conditions in the real estate markets or in the general economy and accordingly, conservative loan to value ratios are required at origination, as well as stress tested to evaluate the impact of market changes relating to key underwriting elements. The properties securing the commercial real estate portfolio represent diverse types, with most properties located within Valley&#8217;s primary markets. With respect to loans to developers and builders, we originate and manage construction loans structured on either a revolving or a non-revolving basis, depending on the nature of the underlying development project. Our construction loans totaling approximately $755 million &#32;at December 31, 2015 &#32;are generally secured by the real estate to be developed and may also be secured by additional real estate to mitigate the risk. Non-revolving construction loans often involve the disbursement of substantially all committed funds with repayment substantially dependent on the successful completion and sale, or lease, of the project. Sources of repayment for these types of loans may be from pre-committed permanent loans from other lenders, sales of developed property, or an interim loan commitment from Valley until permanent financing is obtained elsewhere. Revolving construction loans (generally relating to single-family residential construction) are controlled with loan advances dependent upon the presale of housing units financed. These loans are closely monitored by on-site inspections and are considered to have higher risks than other real estate loans due to their ultimate repayment being sensitive to interest rate changes, governmental regulation of real property, general economic conditions and the availability of long-term financing. 

Consumer Lending Segment 

Residential Mortgage Loans. Residential mortgage loans totaled $3.1 billion &#32;and represented 19.5 percent &#32;of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2015 . We offer a full range of residential mortgage loans for the purpose of purchasing or refinancing one-to-four family residential properties. Our residential mortgage loans include fixed and variable interest rate loans generally located in counties where we have a branch presence in New Jersey, New York and Florida, as well as contiguous counties, if applicable, including eastern Pennsylvania. The loans originated from our Florida lending operations represented 6.4 percent of the $3.1 billion &#32;in total residential mortgage loans at December 31, 2015 . Valley&#8217;s ability to be repaid on such loans is closely linked to the economic and real estate market conditions in our lending markets. We occasionally make mortgage loans secured by homes beyond this primary geographic area; however, lending outside this primary area is generally made in support of existing customer relationships. Mortgage loan originations are based on underwriting standards that generally comply with Fannie Mae and/or Freddie Mac requirements. Appraisals and valuations of real estate collateral are contracted directly with independent appraisers or from valuation services and not through appraisal management companies. The Bank&#8217;s appraisal management policy and procedure is in accordance with regulatory requirements and guidance issued by the Bank&#8217;s primary regulator. Credit scoring, using FICO &#174; &#32;and other proprietary, credit scoring models is employed in the ultimate, judgmental credit decision by Valley&#8217;s underwriting staff. Valley does not use third party contract underwriting services. In deciding whether to originate each residential mortgage, Valley considers the qualifications of the borrower, the value of the underlying property and other factors that we believe 

&#160; 

2015 Form 10-K 

are predictive of future loan performance. Valley originated first mortgages are generally fixed-rate amortizing loans with 10 year to 30 year maturities. Valley's non-amortizing (i.e., interest-only) residential mortgage loan portfolio was immaterial at December 31, 2015. The small amount of interest-only loans is running off year over year, as Valley has no longer originated this type of residential mortgage loan product for many years. 

The Bank is also a servicer of residential mortgage portfolios, and it is compensated for loan administrative services performed for mortgage servicing rights purchased in the secondary market and loans originated and sold by the Bank. See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for further details. 

Other Consumer Loans . Other consumer loans totaled $2.2 billion &#32;and represented 13.7 percent &#32;of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2015 . Our other consumer loan portfolio is primarily comprised of direct and indirect automobile loans, home equity loans and lines of credit, loans secured by the cash surrender value of life insurance, and to a lesser extent, secured and unsecured other consumer loans (including credit card loans). Valley is an auto lender in New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Delaware, and Florida offering indirect auto loans secured by either new or used automobiles. Automobile originations (including light truck and sport utility vehicles) are largely produced via indirect channels, originated through approved automobile dealers. Automotive collateral is generally a depreciating asset and there are times in the life of an automobile loan where the amount owed on a vehicle may exceed its collateral value. Valley acquired an immaterial amount of automobile loans from both the CNL and 1st United acquisitions in 2015 and 2014, respectively, as auto lending was not a focus of the acquired operations. However, we implemented our indirect auto lending model in Florida during 2015 using our New Jersey based underwriting and loan servicing platform. The new Florida auto dealer network generated $11.5 million of auto loan in 2015. Home equity lending consists of both fixed and variable interest rate products mainly to provide home equity loans to our residential mortgage customers or take a secondary position to another lender&#8217;s first lien position within the footprint of our primary lending territory. We generally will not exceed a combined (i.e., first and second mortgage) loan-to-value ratio of 75 percent when originating a home equity loan. Other consumer loans include direct consumer term loans, both secured and unsecured. From time to time, the Bank will also purchase prime consumer loans originated by and serviced by other financial institutions based on several factors, including current secondary market rates, excess liquidity and other asset/liability management strategies. Unsecured consumer loans totaled approximately $18.8 million , including $7.1 million &#32;of credit card loans, at December 31, 2015 . Other consumer loans from our Florida lending operations, including acquired loans, totaled 4.7 percent of the $2.2 billion &#32;in total other consumer loans and mainly consisted of home equity loans. 

Wealth Management. &#32;Our Wealth Management Division provides coordinated and integrated delivery of asset management advisory, trust, general insurance, title insurance, and asset-based lending support services. Trust services include living and testamentary trusts, investment management, custodial and escrow services, and estate administration, primarily to individuals. Asset management advisory services include investment services for individuals and small to medium sized businesses, trusts and custom tailored investment strategies designed for various types of retirement plans. 

Investment Management Segment 

Although we are primarily focused on our lending and wealth management services, a large portion of our income is generated through investments in various types of securities, and depending on our liquid cash position, federal funds sold and interest-bearing deposits with banks (primarily the Federal Reserve Bank of New York), as part of our asset/liability management strategies. As of December 31, 2015 , our total investment securities and interest bearing deposits with banks were $3.1 billion &#32;and $170.2 million , respectively. See the &#8220;Investment Securities Portfolio&#8221; section of &#8220;Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; (MD&#38;A) and Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information concerning our investment securities. 

Changes in Loan Portfolio Composition 

At December 31, 2015 , approximately 74 percent &#32;of Valley&#8217;s $16.0 billion &#32;total loan portfolio consisted of commercial real estate (including construction loans), residential mortgage, and home equity loans as compared to 72 percent at December 31, 2014. The remaining 26 percent at December 31, 2015 consisted of loans not collateralized by real estate. Valley has no internally planned changes that would significantly impact the current composition of our loan portfolio by loan type. However, we have continued to diversify the geographic concentrations (primarily the New Jersey and New York City Metropolitan area) within our loan portfolio through our bank acquisitions in Florida during both 2014 and 2015 (see table and discussion below). Many external factors outlined in &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8221;, the &#8220;Executive Summary&#8221; section of our MD&#38;A, and elsewhere in this report may impact our ability to maintain the current composition of our loan portfolio. See the &#8220;Loan Portfolio&#8221; section of our MD&#38;A in this report for further discussion of our loan composition and concentration risks.

Represents less than one percent of the loan portfolio segment. 

During 2015 , the percentage of total loans from New Jersey decreased by 4 percent to 44 percent at December 31, 2015 &#32;as compared to 48 percent &#32;at December 31, 2014 &#32;mainly due to Florida loans acquired from CNL, and, to a much lesser extent, an increase in New York loans and new loans generated from our Florida operations. As a result, the percentage of total loans from Florida increased by approximately 4 percent to 12 percent at December 31, 2015 &#32;as compared to 8 percent at December 31, 2014 . The percentage of loans by loan portfolio segment and by total loans presented for all other states above did not materially change from December 31, 2014 . 

Risk Management 

Effective risk management is critical to our success. Financial institutions must manage a variety of business risks that can significantly affect their financial performance. Significant risks we confront are credit risks and asset/liability management risks, which include interest rate and liquidity risks. Credit risk is the risk of not collecting payments pursuant to the contractual terms of loan, lease and investment assets. Interest rate risk results from changes in interest rates which may impact the re-pricing of assets and liabilities in different amounts or at different dates. Liquidity risk is the risk that we will be unable to fund obligations to loan customers, depositors or other creditors at a reasonable cost. 

Valley&#8217;s Board performs its risk oversight function primarily through several standing committees, including the Risk Committee, all of which report to the full Board. The Risk Committee assists the Board by, among other things, establishing an enterprise-wide risk management framework that is appropriate for Valley&#8217;s capital, business activities, size and risk appetite. The Risk Committee also reviews and recommends to the Board appropriate risk tolerances and limits for credit, compliance, interest rate, liquidity, operational, strategic and price risk (and ensures that risk is managed within those tolerances), and monitors compliance with laws and regulations. With guidance from and oversight by the Risk Committee, management continually refines and enhances its risk management policies and procedures to maintain effective risk management programs and processes. 

Additionally, The Dodd-Frank Act Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the "Dodd-Frank Act") mandated that stress tests be developed and performed to ensure that financial institutions have sufficient capital to absorb losses and support operations during multiple economic and bank scenarios. On October 9, 2012, the Federal Reserve Board (FRB) published final rules implementing the stress testing requirements for banks, such as the Company, with total consolidated assets of more than $10.0 billion but less than $50.0 billion. These rules set forth the timing and type of stress test activities, as well as rules governing controls, oversight and disclosure. We submitted our latest Dodd-Frank Act company-run annual stress testing results (utilizing data as of December 31, 2014 and projecting over an eight-quarter horizon as instructed by our primary regulators due to the acquisition of 1st United in the fourth quarter of 2014) to the FRB and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) on March 31, 2015. The full disclosure of the stress testing results, including the results for Valley National Bank, a summary of the supervisory severely adverse scenario and additional information regarding the methodologies used to conduct the stress test may be found under the Shareholder Relations section of our website at www.valleynationalbank.com. 

Through the stress testing program that has been implemented and reviewed by the Risk Committee, Valley complies with current regulations. The results of stress testing activities are considered in combination with other risk management and monitoring practices to maintain an effective risk management program.

Credit Risk Management and Underwriting Approach 

Credit risk management. &#32;For all loan types, we adhere to a credit policy designed to minimize credit risk while generating the maximum income given the level of risk. Management reviews and approves these policies and procedures on a regular basis with subsequent approval by the Board of Directors annually. Credit authority relating to a significant dollar percentage of the overall portfolio is centralized and controlled by the Credit Risk Management Division and by a Credit Committee. A reporting system supplements the review process by providing management with frequent reports concerning loan production, loan quality, concentrations of credit, loan delinquencies, non-performing, and potential problem loans. Loan portfolio diversification is an important factor utilized by us to manage the portfolio&#8217;s risk across business sectors and through cyclical economic circumstances. 

Our historical and current loan underwriting practice prohibits the origination of payment option ARMs which allow for negative interest amortization and subprime loans. Virtually all of our loan originations in recent years have conformed to rules requiring documentation of income, assets sufficient to close the transactions and debt to income ratios that support the borrower&#8217;s ability to repay under the loan&#8217;s proposed terms and conditions. These rules are applied to all loans originated for retention in our portfolio or for sale in the secondary market. 

Loan documentation . Loans are well documented in accordance with specific and detailed underwriting policies and verification procedures. General underwriting guidance is consistent across all loan types with possible variations in procedures and due diligence dictated by specific loan requests. Due diligence standards require acquisition and verification of sufficient financial information to determine a borrower&#8217;s or guarantor&#8217;s credit worthiness, capital support, capacity to repay, collateral support, and character. Credit worthiness is generally verified using personal or business credit reports from independent credit reporting agencies. Capital support is determined by acquisition of independent verifications of deposits, investments or other assets. Capacity to repay the loan is based on verifiable liquidity and earnings capacity as shown on financial statements and/or tax returns, banking activity levels, operating statements, rent rolls or independent verification of employment. Finally, collateral valuation is determined via appraisals from independent, bank-approved, certified or licensed property appraisers, valuation services, or readily available market resources. 

Types of collateral. &#32;Loan collateral, when required, may consist of any one or a combination of the following asset types depending upon the loan type and intended purpose: commercial or residential real estate; general business assets including working assets such as accounts receivable, inventory, or fixed assets such as equipment or rolling stock; marketable securities or other forms of liquid assets such as bank deposits or cash surrender value of life insurance; automobiles; or other assets wherein adequate protective value can be established and/or verified by reliable outside independent appraisers. In addition to these types of collateral, we, in many cases, will obtain the personal guarantee of the borrower&#8217;s principals to mitigate the risk of certain commercial and industrial loans and commercial real estate loans. 

Many times, we will underwrite loans to legal entities formed for the limited purpose of the business which is being financed. Credit granted to these entities and the ultimate repayment of such loans is primarily based on the cash flow generated from the property securing the loan or the business that occupies the property. The underlying real property securing the loans is considered a secondary source of repayment, and normally such loans are also supported by guarantees of the legal entity members. Absent such guarantees or approval by our credit committee, our policy requires that the loan to value ratio (at origination) be 60 percent or less of the estimated market value of the property as established by an independent licensed appraiser. 

Reevaluation of collateral values. &#32;Commercial loan renewals, refinancing and other subsequent transactions that include the advancement of new funds or result in the extension of the amortization period beyond the original term, require a new or updated appraisal. Renewals, refinancing and other subsequent transactions that do not include the advancement of new funds (other than for reasonable closing costs) or, in the case of commercial loans, the extension of the amortization period beyond the original term, do not require a new appraisal unless management believes there has been a material change in market conditions or the physical aspects of the property which may negatively impact collectability of our loan. In general, the period of time an appraisal continues to be relevant will vary depending upon the circumstances affecting the property and the marketplace. Examples of factors that could cause material changes to reported values include the passage of time, the volatility of the local market, the availability of financing, the inventory of competing properties, new improvements to, or lack of maintenance of, the subject or competing surrounding properties, changes in zoning and environmental contamination. 

Certain impaired loans are reported at the fair value of the underlying collateral (less estimated selling costs) if repayment is expected solely from the collateral and are commonly referred to as &#8220;collateral dependent impaired loans.&#8221; Collateral values for such loans are typically estimated using individual appraisals performed every 12 months (or 18 months for impaired loans no greater than $1 million with current loan to value ratios less than 75 percent). Between scheduled appraisals, property values are monitored within the commercial portfolio by reference to recent trends in commercial property sales as published by leading industry sources. Property values are monitored within the residential mortgage portfolio by reference to available market indicators, including real estate price indices within Valley&#8217;s primary lending areas.

All refinanced residential mortgage loans require new appraisals for loans held in our loan portfolio. However, certain residential mortgage loans may be originated for sale and sold without new appraisals when the investor (Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac) presents a refinance of an existing government sponsored enterprise loan without the benefit of a new appraisal. Additionally, all loan types are assessed for full or partial charge-off when they are between 90 and 120 days past due (or sooner when the borrowers&#8217; obligation has been released in bankruptcy) based upon their estimated net realizable value. 

See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information concerning our loan portfolio risk elements, credit risk management and our loan charge-off policy. 

Loan Renewals and Modifications 

In the normal course of our lending business, we may renew loans to existing customers upon maturity of the existing loan. These renewals are granted provided that the new loan meets our standard underwriting criteria for such loan type. Additionally, on a case-by-case basis, we may extend, restructure, or otherwise modify the terms of existing loans from time to time to remain competitive and retain certain profitable customers, as well as assist customers who may be experiencing financial difficulties. If the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties and a concession has been made at the time of such modification, the loan is classified as a troubled debt restructured loan (TDR). 

The majority of the concessions made for TDRs involve lowering the monthly payments on loans through either a reduction in interest rate below a market rate, an extension of the term of the loan without a corresponding adjustment to the risk premium reflected in the interest rate, or a combination of these two methods. The concessions rarely result in the forgiveness of principal or accrued interest. In addition, Valley frequently obtains additional collateral or guarantor support when modifying such loans. If the borrower has demonstrated performance under the previous terms and Valley&#8217;s underwriting process shows the borrower has the capacity to continue to perform under the restructured terms, the loan will continue to accrue interest. Non-accruing restructured loans may be returned to accrual status when there has been a sustained period of repayment performance (generally six consecutive months of payments) and both principal and interest are deemed collectible. 

Extension of Credit to Past Due Borrowers 

Loans are placed on non-accrual status generally when they become 90 days past due and the full and timely collection of principal and interest becomes uncertain. Valley&#8217;s historic and current policy prohibits the advancement of additional funds on non-accrual and TDR loans, except under certain workout plans if such extension of credit is intended to mitigate losses. 

Loans Originated by Third Parties 

From time to time, the Bank makes bulk purchases of commercial real estate loans, residential mortgage loans, automobile loans, and other loan types, originated by, and sometimes serviced by, other financial institutions. The purchase decision is usually based on several factors, including current loan origination volumes, market interest rates, excess liquidity, our continuous efforts to meet the credit needs of certain borrowers under Community Reinvestment Act, as well as other asset/liability management strategies. All of the purchased loans are selected using Valley&#8217;s normal underwriting criteria at the time of purchase, or in some cases guaranteed by third parties. Purchased commercial real estate loans, residential mortgage loans and automobile loans (excluding purchased credit-impaired loans acquired in business combinations or FDIC-assisted transactions) totaled approximately $737.2 million, $747.4 million and $11.6 million, respectively, at December 31, 2015 &#32;representing 9.01 percent percent, 23.87 percent and 0.94 percent of our total commercial real estate, residential mortgage and automobile loan portfolios, respectively. At December 31, 2015 , the commercial real estate loans originated by third parties had loans past due 30 days or more totaling 0.24 percent of these loans as compared to 0.47 percent for our total commercial real estate portfolio, including all delinquencies. Residential mortgage loans originated by third parties had loans past due 30 days or more totaling 1.06 percent of these loans at December 31, 2015 &#32;as compared to 0.89 percent for our total residential mortgage portfolio. The purchased automobile portfolio had loans past due 30 days or more totaling 2.06 percent of these loans at December 31, 2015 &#32;as compared to 0.21 percent for our total automobile loan portfolio. 

Additionally, Valley has performed credit due diligence on the majority of the loans acquired in our bank acquisitions and FDIC-assisted transactions (disclosed under the "Recent Acquisitions" section above) in determining the estimated cash flows receivable from such loans. See the "Loan Portfolio" section of Item 7&#8212;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this report below for additional information.

Competition 

Valley National Bank is one of the largest commercial banks headquartered in New Jersey, with its primary markets located in northern and central New Jersey, the New York City boroughs of Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens, Long Island, and Florida. Valley ranked 17th in competitive ranking and market share based on the deposits reported by 219 FDIC-insured financial institutions in the New York, Northern New Jersey and Long Island deposit market as of June 30, 2015. The FDIC also ranked Valley 8th, 36th and 40th in the states of New Jersey, New York and Florida, respectively, based on deposit market share as of June 30, 2015. In December 2015, we enhanced our deposit based market share in Florida through the assumption of $1.2 billion in deposits from the acquisition of CNL. Despite our favorable FDIC rankings, the market for banking and bank-related services is highly competitive and we face substantial competition in all phases of our operations. In addition to the FDIC-insured commercial banks in our principal metropolitan markets, we also compete with other providers of financial services such as savings institutions, credit unions, mutual funds, captive finance companies, mortgage companies, title agencies, asset managers, insurance companies and a growing list of other local, regional and national companies which offer various financial services. Many of these competitors may have fewer regulatory constraints, broader geographic service areas, greater capital, and, in some cases, lower cost structures. 

In addition, competition has further intensified as a result of recent changes in regulation, and advances in technology and product delivery systems. Web-based and other internet companies are providing non-traditional, but increasingly strong, competition for our borrowers, depositors, and other customers. Within our markets, we compete with some of the largest financial institutions in the world that have greater human and financial resources are able to offer a large range of products and services at competitive rates and prices. Nevertheless, we believe we can compete effectively as a result of utilizing various strategies including our long history of local customer service and convenience as part of a relationship management culture, in conjunction with the pricing of loans and deposits. Our customers are influenced by the convenience, quality of service from our knowledgeable staff, personal contacts and attention to customer needs, as well as availability of products and services and related pricing. We provide such convenience through our banking network of 227 branches, an extensive ATM network of 228 locations, and our 24-hour telephone and on-line banking systems. 

We continually review our pricing, products, locations, alternative delivery channels and various acquisition prospects, and periodically engage in discussions regarding possible acquisitions to maintain and enhance our competitive position. 

Personnel 

At December 31, 2015 , Valley National Bank and its subsidiaries employed 2,929 full-time equivalent persons. Management considers relations with its employees to be satisfactory.

SUPERVISION AND REGULATION 

The Banking industry is highly regulated. Statutory and regulatory controls increase a bank holding company&#8217;s cost of doing business and limit the options of its management to deploy assets and maximize income. The following discussion is not intended to be a complete list of all the activities regulated by the banking laws or of the impact of such laws and regulations on Valley or Valley National Bank. It is intended only to briefly summarize some material provisions. 

Bank Holding Company Regulation 

Valley is a bank holding company within the meaning of the Holding Company Act. As a bank holding company, Valley is supervised by the FRB and is required to file reports with the FRB and provide such additional information as the FRB may require. 

The Holding Company Act prohibits Valley, with certain exceptions, from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than five percent of the voting shares of any company which is not a bank and from engaging in any business other than that of banking, managing and controlling banks or furnishing services to subsidiary banks, except that it may, upon application, engage in, and may own shares of companies engaged in, certain businesses found by the FRB to be so closely related to banking 

&#160; 

2015 Form 10-K 

&#8220;as to be a proper incident thereto.&#8221; The Holding Company Act requires prior approval by the FRB of the acquisition by Valley of more than five percent of the voting stock of any other bank. Satisfactory capital ratios, Community Reinvestment Act ratings, and anti-money laundering policies are generally prerequisites to obtaining federal regulatory approval to make acquisitions. The policy of the FRB provides that a bank holding company is expected to act as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary bank and to commit resources to support the subsidiary bank in circumstances in which it might not do so absent that policy. Acquisitions through the Bank require approval of the OCC. The Holding Company Act does not place territorial restrictions on the activities of non-bank subsidiaries of bank holding companies. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, discussed below, allows Valley to expand into insurance, securities and other activities that are financial in nature if Valley elects to become a financial holding company. 

The Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 (&#8220;Interstate Banking and Branching Act&#8221;) enables bank holding companies to acquire banks in states other than its home state, regardless of applicable state law. The Interstate Banking and Branching Act also authorizes banks to merge across state lines, thereby creating interstate banks with branches in more than one state. Under the legislation, each state had the opportunity to &#8220;opt-out&#8221; of this provision. Furthermore, a state may &#8220;opt-in&#8221; with respect to de novo branching, thereby permitting a bank to open new branches in a state in which the Bank does not already have a branch. Without de novo branching, an out-of-state commercial bank can enter the state only by acquiring an existing bank or branch. States generally have not opted out of interstate banking by merger but several states have not authorized de novo branching. The Dodd-Frank Act, discussed below, authorized interstate de novo &#32;branching regardless of state law. 

Regulation of Bank Subsidiary 

Valley National Bank is subject to the supervision of, and to regular examination by, the OCC. Various laws and the regulations thereunder applicable to Valley and its bank subsidiary impose restrictions and requirements in many areas, including capital requirements, the maintenance of reserves, establishment of new offices, the making of loans and investments, consumer protection, employment practices, bank acquisitions and entry into new types of business. There are various legal limitations, including Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, which govern the extent to which a bank subsidiary may finance or otherwise supply funds to its holding company or its holding company&#8217;s non-bank subsidiaries. Under federal law, no bank subsidiary may, subject to certain limited exceptions, make loans or extensions of credit to, or investments in the securities of, its parent or the non-bank subsidiaries of its parent (other than direct subsidiaries of such bank which are not financial subsidiaries) or take their securities as collateral for loans to any borrower. Each bank subsidiary is also subject to collateral security requirements for any loans or extensions of credit permitted by such exceptions. 

Capital Requirements 

Pursuant to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA), each federal banking agency has promulgated regulations, specifying the levels at which a financial institution would be considered &#8220;well capitalized,&#8221; &#8220;adequately capitalized,&#8221; &#8220;undercapitalized,&#8221; &#8220;significantly undercapitalized,&#8221; or &#8220;critically undercapitalized,&#8221; and to take certain mandatory and discretionary supervisory actions based on the capital level of the institution. To qualify to engage in financial activities under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, all depository institutions must be &#8220;well capitalized.&#8221; The financial holding company of a national bank will be put under directives to raise its capital levels or divest its activities if the depository institution falls from that level. 

In July 2013, the FRB, or Federal Reserve, published final rules establishing a new comprehensive capital framework for U.S. banking organizations, referred to herein as the Basel Rules. The FDIC and the OCC have adopted substantially identical rules (in the case of the FDIC, as interim final rules). The Basel Rules implement the Basel Committee&#8217;s December 2010 framework, commonly referred to as Basel III, for strengthening international capital standards as well as certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, as discussed below. The Basel Rules substantially revised the risk-based capital requirements applicable to bank holding companies and depository institutions, including Valley and Valley National Bank, compared to the current U.S. risk-based capital rules. The Basel Rules defined the components of capital and address other issues affecting the numerator in banking institutions&#8217; regulatory capital ratios. The Basel Rules also addressed risk weights and other issues affecting the denominator in banking institutions&#8217; regulatory capital ratios and replaced the existing risk-weighting approach, which was derived from Basel I capital accords of the Basel Committee, with a more risk-sensitive approach based, in part, on the standardized approach in the Basel Committee&#8217;s 2004 Basel II capital accords. The Basel Rules also implemented the requirements of Section 939A of the Dodd-Frank Act to remove references to credit ratings from the federal banking agencies&#8217; rules. The Basel Rules became effective for us on January 1, 2015 (subject to phase-in periods for certain components). 

The Basel Rules (i) introduced a new capital measure called &#8220;Common Equity Tier 1,&#8221; or CET1, (ii) specified that Tier 1 capital consists of CET1 and &#8220;Additional Tier 1 capital&#8221; instruments meeting specified requirements, (iii) applied most deductions/adjustments to regulatory capital measures to CET1 and not to the other components of capital, thus potentially requiring higher levels of CET1 in order to meet minimum ratios, and (iv) expanded the scope of the reductions/adjustments from capital as compared to existing regulations. 

&#160; 

2015 Form 10-K 

Under the Basel Rules, the minimum capital ratios for us and Valley National Bank are as follows: 

&#8226; 

4.5 percent CET1 to risk-weighted assets. 

&#8226; 

6.0 percent Tier 1 capital (i.e., CET1 plus Additional Tier 1) to risk-weighted assets. 

&#8226; 

8.0 percent Total capital (i.e., Tier 1 plus Tier 2) to risk-weighted assets. 

&#8226; 

4.0 percent Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets as reported on consolidated financial statements (known as the &#8220;leverage ratio&#8221;). 

When fully phased in on January 1, 2019, the Basel Rules will also require us and Valley National Bank to maintain a 2.5 percent &#8220;capital conservation buffer&#8221;, composed entirely of CET1, on top of the minimum risk-weighted asset ratios, effectively resulting in minimum ratios of (i) CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 7.0 percent, (ii) Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.5 percent, and (iii) total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 10.5 percent. The capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Banking institutions with a ratio of (i) CET1 to risk-weighted assets, (ii) Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets or (iii) total capital to risk-weighted assets above the respective minimum but below the capital conservation buffer will face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers based on the amount of the shortfall. The implementation of the capital conservation buffer began on January 1, 2016 at the 0.625 percent level and will increase by 0.625 percent on each subsequent January 1st, until it reaches 2.5 percent on January 1, 2019. 

The Basel Rules provide for a number of deductions from and adjustments to CET1. These include, for example, the requirement that mortgage servicing rights, deferred tax assets dependent upon future taxable income and significant investments in common equity issued by nonconsolidated financial entities be deducted from CET1 to the extent that any one such category exceeds 10 percent of CET1 or all such categories in the aggregate exceed 15 percent of CET1. The deductions and other adjustments to CET1 are being phased in incrementally between January 1, 2015 and January 1, 2018. 

Under current capital standards, the effects of accumulated other comprehensive income items included in capital are excluded for the purposes of determining regulatory capital ratios. Under the Basel Rules, the effects of certain accumulated other comprehensive items are not excluded; however, non-advanced approaches banking organizations, including Valley and Valley National Bank, were permitted to make a one-time permanent election to continue to exclude these items effective as of January 1, 2015. We made this one-time election in the applicable bank regulatory reports as of March 31, 2015. 

The Basel Rules with respect to us require that trust preferred securities be phased out from Tier 1 capital between January 1, 2015 (when only 25 percent of the amount may be included) and January 1, 2016 (when 0 percent may be included). Due to such limitations, Valley only included $11 million of trust preferred securities issued by its capital trusts in Tier 1 capital during 2015, and accordingly these trust preferred securities will no longer qualify as Tier 1 capital as of January 1, 2016. 

With respect to Valley National Bank, the Basel Rules also revised the &#8220;prompt corrective action&#8221; regulations pursuant to Section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, by (i) introducing a CET1 ratio requirement at each capital quality level (other than critically undercapitalized); (ii) increasing the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio requirement for each category; and (iii) requiring a leverage ratio of 5 percent to be well-capitalized. The OCC&#8217;s regulations implementing these provisions of FDICIA provide that an institution will be classified as &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; if it (i) has a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10.0 percent, (ii) has a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 8.0 percent, (iii) has a CET1 ratio of at least 6.5 percent, (iv) has a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5.0 percent, and (v) meets certain other requirements. An institution will be classified as &#8220;adequately capitalized&#8221; if it (i) has a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 8.0 percent, (ii) has a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 6.0 percent, (iii) has a CET1 ratio of at least 4.5 percent, (iv) has a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 4.0 percent, and (v) does not meet the definition of &#8220;well capitalized.&#8221; An institution will be classified as &#8220;undercapitalized&#8221; if it (i) has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8.0 percent, (ii) has a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0 percent, (iii) has a CET1 ratio of less than 4.5 percent or (iv) has a Tier 1 leverage ratio of less than 4.0 percent. An institution will be classified as &#8220;significantly undercapitalized&#8221; if it (i) has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0 percent, (ii) has a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0 percent, (iii) has a CET1 ratio of less than 3.0 percent or (iv) has a Tier 1 leverage ratio of less than 3.0 percent. An institution will be classified as &#8220;critically undercapitalized&#8221; if it has a tangible equity to total assets ratio that is equal to or less than 2.0 percent. An insured depository institution may be deemed to be in a lower capitalization category if it receives an unsatisfactory examination rating. Similar categories apply to bank holding companies. When the capital conservation buffer is fully phased in, the capital ratios applicable to depository institutions under the Basel Rules will exceed the ratios to be considered well-capitalized under the prompt corrective action regulations. 

The Basel Rules prescribe a standardized approach for calculating risk-weighted assets that expand the risk-weighting categories from the current four Basel I-derived categories (0 percent, 20 percent, 50 percent and 100 percent) to a much larger and more risk-sensitive number of categories, depending on the nature of the assets, generally ranging from 0 percent for U.S. Government and agency securities, to 600 percent for certain equity exposures, and resulting in higher risk weights for a variety of asset categories. In addition, the Basel Rules also provide more advantageous risk weights for derivatives and repurchase-style 

&#160; 

2015 Form 10-K 

transactions cleared through a qualifying central counterparty and increase the scope of eligible guarantors and eligible collateral for purposes of credit risk mitigation. 

Valley National Bank&#8217;s capital ratios were all above the minimum levels required for it to be considered a &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; financial institution at December 31, 2015 under the &#8220;prompt corrective action&#8221; regulations in effect as of such date. We believe that, as of December 31, 2015, Valley and Valley National Bank would meet all capital adequacy requirements under the Basel Rules on a fully phased-in basis if such requirements were currently effective including after giving effect to the deductions described above. 

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 

The Dodd-Frank Act was signed into law on July 21, 2010. The Dodd-Frank Act significantly changed the bank regulatory landscape and has impacted and will continue to impact the lending, deposit, investment, trading and operating activities of financial institutions and their holding companies. 

On October 9, 2012, the FDIC, the OCC, and the FRB issued separate but similar Dodd-Frank Act-mandated final rules requiring covered banks and bank holding companies with more than $10 billion in total consolidated assets (such as Valley) to conduct annual company-run stress tests. The final rules required banks with more than $50 billion in assets to begin conducting annual stress tests in 2012 and banks with between $10 billion and $50 billion in assets to begin conducting annual stress tests in October 2013. 

In January 2013, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) issued a series of final rules related to mortgage loan origination and mortgage loan servicing. In particular, the CFPB issued a final rule amending Regulation Z to implement certain amendments to the Truth in Lending Act. The rule implements statutory changes that lengthen the time for which a mandatory escrow account established for a higher-priced mortgage loan must be maintained. The rule also exempts certain transactions from the statute&#8217;s escrow requirement. The CFPB issued a final rule implementing amendments to the Truth in Lending Act and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act. The rule amends Regulation Z by expanding the types of mortgage loans that are subject to the protections of the Home Ownership and Equity Protections Act of 1994 (HOEPA), revising and expanding the tests for coverage under HOEPA, and imposing additional restrictions on mortgages that are covered by HOEPA, including a pre-loan counseling requirement. The rule also amends Regulation Z and Regulation X by imposing other requirements related to homeownership counseling. 

In addition, the CFPB amended Regulation B to implement changes to the Equal Credit Opportunity Act. The revisions to Regulation B require creditors to provide applicants with free copies of all appraisals and other written valuations developed in connection with an application for a loan to be secured by a first lien on a dwelling, and require creditors to notify applicants in writing that copies of appraisals will be provided to them promptly. The CFPB also amended Regulation Z to implement requirements and restrictions to the Truth in Lending Act concerning loan originator compensation, qualifications of, and registration or licensing of loan originators, compliance procedures for depository institutions, mandatory arbitration, and the financing of single-premium credit insurance. These amendments revise or provide additional commentary on Regulation Z&#8217;s restrictions on loan originator compensation, including application of these restrictions to prohibitions on dual compensation and compensation based on a term of a transaction or a proxy for a term of a transaction, and to recordkeeping requirements. This rule also establishes tests for when loan originators can be compensated through certain profits-based compensation arrangements. 

The final rules also implement the ability-to-repay and qualified mortgage (QM) provisions of the Truth in Lending Act, as amended by the Dodd-Frank Act (the &#8220;QM Rule&#8221;). The ability-to-repay provision requires creditors to make reasonable, good faith determinations that borrowers are able to repay their mortgages before extending the credit based on a number of factors and consideration of financial information about the borrower from reasonably reliable third-party documents. Under the Dodd-Frank Act and the QM Rule, loans meeting the definition of &#8220;qualified mortgage&#8221; are entitled to a presumption that the lender satisfied the ability-to-repay requirements. The presumption is a conclusive presumption/safe harbor for prime loans meeting the QM requirements, and a rebuttable presumption for higher-priced/subprime loans meeting the QM requirements. The definition of a &#8220;qualified mortgage&#8221; incorporates the statutory requirements, such as not allowing negative amortization or terms longer than 30 years. The QM Rule also adds an explicit maximum 43 percent debt-to-income ratio for borrowers if the loan is to meet the QM definition, though some mortgages that meet GSE, FHA and VA underwriting and eligibility guidelines may, for a period not to exceed seven years, meet the QM definition without being subject to the 43 percent debt-to-income limits. 

The CFPB has continued to issue final rules regarding mortgages. We cannot assure you that existing or future regulations will not have a material adverse impact on our residential mortgage loan business or the housing markets in which we participate. The QM Rule impacted our mortgage originations when it became effective in January 2014. 

The Dodd-Frank Act contains numerous other provisions affecting financial institutions of all types, many of which may have an impact on our operating environment in substantial and unpredictable ways. Consequently, the Dodd-Frank Act is likely to continue to increase our cost of doing business, it may limit or expand our permissible activities, and it may affect the competitive 

&#160; 

2015 Form 10-K 

balance within our industry and market areas. The nature and extent of future legislative and regulatory changes affecting financial institutions, including as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act, remains very unpredictable at this time. 

Volcker Rule 

On December 10, 2013, the FRB, the OCC, the FDIC, the CFTC and the SEC issued final rules to implement the Volcker Rule contained in section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act, generally to become effective on July 21, 2015. The Volcker Rule prohibits an insured depository institution and its affiliates from: (i) engaging in &#8220;proprietary trading&#8221; and (ii) investing in or sponsoring certain types of funds (defined as &#8220;Covered Funds&#8221;) subject to certain limited exceptions. The rule also effectively prohibits short-term trading strategies by any U.S. banking entity if those strategies involve instruments other than those specifically permitted for trading and prohibits the use of some hedging strategies. We identified no investments held as of December 31, 2015 that meet the definition of Covered Funds. Covered Funds held prior to December 31, 2013 are required to be divested by July 21, 2016 under the foregoing rules. In December 2014, the FRB announced its intention to further exercise its statutory authority in 2015 and grant an additional, final, one-year extension, until July 21, 2017 for the divestiture of Covered Funds. 

Incentive Compensation 

The Dodd-Frank Act requires the federal bank regulatory agencies and the SEC to establish joint regulations or guidelines prohibiting incentive-based payment arrangements at specified regulated entities, such as Valley and Valley National Bank, with at least $1 billion in total assets that encourage inappropriate risks by providing an executive officer, employee, director or principal shareholder with excessive compensation, fees, or benefits or that could lead to material financial loss to the entity. In addition, these agencies must establish regulations or guidelines requiring enhanced disclosure to regulators of incentive-based compensation arrangements. The agencies proposed such regulations in April 2011, but the regulations have not been finalized. If the regulations are adopted in the form initially proposed, they will impose limitations on the manner in which Valley may structure compensation for its executives. 

In June 2010, the FRB, OCC and FDIC issued comprehensive final guidance on incentive compensation policies intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risk-taking. The guidance, which covers all employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of an organization, either individually or as part of a group, is based upon the key principles that a banking organization&#8217;s incentive compensation arrangements should (i) provide incentives that do not encourage risk-taking beyond the organization&#8217;s ability to effectively identify and manage risks, (ii) be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management, and (iii) be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the organization&#8217;s board of directors. These three principles are incorporated into the proposed joint compensation regulations under the Dodd-Frank Act, discussed in the immediately preceding paragraph. 

The FRB will review, as part of its regular, risk-focused examination process, the incentive compensation arrangements of banking organizations, such as Valley, that are not &#8220;large, complex banking organizations.&#8221; These reviews will be tailored to each organization based on the scope and complexity of the organization&#8217;s activities and the prevalence of incentive compensation arrangements. The findings of the supervisory initiatives will be included in reports of examination. Deficiencies will be incorporated into the organization&#8217;s supervisory ratings, which can affect the organization&#8217;s ability to make acquisitions and take other actions. Enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements, or related risk-management control or governance processes, pose a risk to the organization&#8217;s safety and soundness and the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies. 

Dividend Limitations 

Valley is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries. Valley&#8217;s revenues (on a parent company only basis) result in substantial part from dividends paid by the Bank. The Bank&#8217;s dividend payments, without prior regulatory approval, are subject to regulatory limitations. Under the National Bank Act, dividends may be declared only if, after payment thereof, capital would be unimpaired and remaining surplus would equal 100 percent of capital. Moreover, a national bank may declare, in any one year, dividends only in an amount aggregating not more than the sum of its net profits for such year and its retained net profits for the preceding two years. However, declared dividends in excess of net profits in either of the preceding two years can be offset by retained net profits in the third and fourth years preceding the current year when determining the Bank&#8217;s dividend limitation. In addition, the bank regulatory agencies have the authority to prohibit the Bank from paying dividends or otherwise supplying funds to Valley if the supervising agency determines that such payment would constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice. 

Loans to Related Parties 

Valley National Bank&#8217;s authority to extend credit to its directors, executive officers and 10 percent shareholders, as well as to entities controlled by such persons, is currently governed by the requirements of the National Bank Act, Sarbanes-Oxley Act 

&#160; 

2015 Form 10-K 

and Regulation O of the FRB thereunder. Among other things, these provisions require that extensions of credit to insiders (i) be made on terms that are substantially the same as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than, those prevailing for comparable transactions with unaffiliated persons and that do not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features and (ii) not exceed certain limitations on the amount of credit extended to such persons, individually and in the aggregate, which limits are based, in part, on the amount of the Bank&#8217;s capital. In addition, extensions of credit in excess of certain limits must be approved by the Bank&#8217;s Board of Directors. Under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, Valley and its subsidiaries, other than the Bank, may not extend or arrange for any personal loans to its directors and executive officers. 

Community Reinvestment 

Under the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA), as implemented by OCC regulations, a national bank has a continuing and affirmative obligation consistent with its safe and sound operation to help meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low and moderate-income neighborhoods. The CRA does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions nor does it limit an institution&#8217;s discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community, consistent with the CRA. The CRA requires the OCC, in connection with its examination of a national bank, to assess the association&#8217;s record of meeting the credit needs of its community and to take such record into account in its evaluation of certain applications by such association. The CRA also requires all institutions to make public disclosure of their CRA ratings. Valley National Bank received a &#8220;satisfactory&#8221; CRA rating in its most recent examination. 

The OCC conditioned its approval of Valley&#8217;s acquisition of 1st United, on the commitment of Valley National Bank to submit to the OCC before the end of 2014 a CRA plan consistent with the correspondence Valley submitted to the OCC during the application process. Valley National Bank submitted its CRA plan to the OCC prior to the end of 2014, and received a "no supervisory objection" to the plan from the OCC during May 2015. While the OCC approval of the most recent acquisition of CNL in December 2015 was unconditional, the OCC noted it will continue to monitor the Bank's progress with the CRA plan, and any necessary enhancements based upon new markets or otherwise, through its normal supervisory reviews. Valley National Bank's CRA plan is available for review on its website at www.valleynationalbank.com. 

Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 added new legal requirements for public companies affecting corporate governance, accounting and corporate reporting, to increase corporate responsibility and to protect investors. Among other things, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 has: 

&#8226; 

required our management to evaluate our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting, and required our auditors to issue a report on our internal control over financial reporting; 

&#8226; 

imposed additional responsibilities for our external financial statements on our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, including certification of financial statements within the Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q by the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer; 

&#8226; 

established independence requirements for audit committee members and outside auditors; 

&#8226; 

created the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board; and 

&#8226; 

increased various criminal penalties for violations of securities laws. 

The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), where Valley common and preferred securities are listed, has corporate governance listing standards, including rules strengthening director independence requirements for boards, and requiring the adoption of charters for the nominating, corporate governance and audit committees. 

USA PATRIOT Act 

As part of the USA PATRIOT Act, Congress adopted the International Money Laundering Abatement and Financial Anti-Terrorism Act of 2001 (the &#8220;Anti Money Laundering Act&#8221;). The Anti Money Laundering Act authorizes the Secretary of the U.S. Treasury, in consultation with the heads of other government agencies, to adopt special measures applicable to financial institutions such as banks, bank holding companies, broker-dealers and insurance companies. Among its other provisions, the Anti Money Laundering Act requires each financial institution: (i) to establish an anti-money laundering program; (ii) to establish due diligence policies, procedures and controls that are reasonably designed to detect and report instances of money laundering in United States private banking accounts and correspondent accounts maintained for non-United States persons or their representatives; and (iii) to avoid establishing, maintaining, administering, or managing correspondent accounts in the United States for, or on behalf of, a foreign shell bank that does not have a physical presence in any country. 

&#160; 

2015 Form 10-K 

Regulations implementing the due diligence requirements require minimum standards to verify customer identity and maintain accurate records, encourage cooperation among financial institutions, federal banking agencies, and law enforcement authorities regarding possible money laundering or terrorist activities, prohibit the anonymous use of &#8220;concentration accounts,&#8221; and requires all covered financial institutions to have in place an anti-money laundering compliance program. 

The OCC, along with other banking agencies, have strictly enforced various anti-money laundering and suspicious activity reporting requirements using formal and informal enforcement tools to cause banks to comply with these provisions. 

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Supervision 

As a financial institution with more than $10 billion in assets, Valley National Bank is supervised by the CFPB for consumer protection purposes. The CFPB&#8217;s regulation of Valley National Bank is focused on risks to consumers and compliance with the federal consumer financial laws and includes regular examinations of the Bank. The CFPB, along with the Department of Justice and bank regulatory authorities also seek to enforce discriminatory lending laws. In such actions, the CFPB and others have used a disparate impact analysis, which measures discriminatory results without regard to intent. Consequently, unintentional actions by Valley could have a material adverse impact on our lending and results of operations if the actions are found to be discriminatory by our regulators. 

Valley National Bank is subject to federal consumer protection statutes and regulations promulgated under those laws, including, but not limited to the following: 

&#8226; 

Truth-In-Lending Act and Regulation Z, governing disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers; 

&#8226; 

Home Mortgage Disclosure Act and Regulation C, requiring financial institutions to provide certain information about home mortgage and refinanced loans; 

&#8226; 

Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Regulation B, prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, creed, or other prohibited factors in extending credit; 

&#8226; 

Fair Credit Reporting Act and Regulation V, governing the provision of consumer information to credit reporting agencies and the use of consumer information; and 

&#8226; 

Fair Debt Collection Act, governing the manner in which consumer debts may be collected by collection agencies. 

Valley National Bank&#8217;s deposit operations are also subject to the following federal statutes and regulations, among others: 

&#8226; 

The Truth in Savings Act and Regulation DD, which requires disclosure of deposit terms to consumers; 

&#8226; 

Regulation CC, which relates to the availability of deposit funds to consumers; 

&#8226; 

The Right to Financial Privacy Act, which imposes a duty to maintain the confidentiality of consumer financial records and prescribes procedures for complying with administrative subpoenas of financial records; and 

&#8226; 

Electronic Funds Transfer Act and Regulation E, governing automatic deposits to, and withdrawals from, deposit accounts and customers&#8217; rights and liabilities arising from the use of automated teller machines and other electronic banking services. 

Many of the foregoing laws and regulations are subject to change resulting from the provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act, which in many cases calls for revisions to implementing regulations, such as the amendments described above in the discussion on the Dodd-Frank Act. 

Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act 

The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Financial Modernization Act of 1999 (Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act) became effective in early 2000. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act provides for the following: 

&#8226; 

allows bank holding companies meeting management, capital and Community Reinvestment Act standards to engage in a substantially broader range of non-banking activities than was previously permissible, including insurance underwriting; 

&#8226; 

allows insurers and other financial services companies to acquire banks; 

&#8226; 

removes various restrictions that previously applied to bank holding company ownership of securities firms and mutual fund advisory companies; 

&#8226; 

establishes the overall regulatory structure applicable to bank holding companies that also engage in insurance and securities operations; and 

&#160; 

2015 Form 10-K 

&#8226; 

modifies other financial laws, including laws related to financial privacy and community reinvestment. 

The OCC adopted rules to allow national banks to form subsidiaries to engage in financial activities allowed for financial holding companies. Electing national banks must meet the same management and capital standards as financial holding companies but may not engage in insurance underwriting, real estate development or merchant banking. Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act apply to financial subsidiaries and the capital invested by a bank in its financial subsidiaries will be eliminated from the Bank&#8217;s capital in measuring all capital ratios. Valley has not elected to become a financial holding company. 

Insurance of Deposit Accounts 

The Bank&#8217;s deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the FDIC. Under the FDIC&#8217;s risk-based system, insured institutions are assigned to one of four risk categories based on supervisory evaluations, regulatory capital levels and certain other factors with less risky institutions paying lower assessments on their deposits. 

In February 2011, as required by the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC approved a final rule that revised the assessment base to consist of average consolidated total assets during the assessment period minus the average tangible equity during the assessment period. In addition, the final revisions eliminated the adjustment for secured borrowings, including Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) advances, and made certain other changes to the impact of unsecured borrowings and brokered deposits on an institution&#8217;s deposit insurance assessment. The final rule, effective on April 11, 2011, also revised the assessment rate schedule to provide initial base assessment rates ranging from 5 to 35 basis points and total base assessment rates ranging from 2.5 to 45 basis points after adjustment. As previously noted above, the Dodd-Frank Act made permanent a $250 thousand limit for federal deposit insurance. 

The FDIC has authority to further increase insurance assessments. A significant increase in insurance premiums may have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of the Bank. Management cannot predict what insurance assessment rates will be in the future.
