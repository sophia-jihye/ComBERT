 ITEM 1. BUSINESS. 

Corporate History 

Our predecessor company, Big Flash Corp., was incorporated in Delaware on July 27, 1999. On April 28, 2006, Big Flash, through its Canadian holding corporation, completed the acquisition of IntelGenx Corp., a Canadian company incorporated on June 15, 2003. The Company did not have any operations prior to the acquisition of IntelGenx Corp. In connection with the acquisition, we changed our name from Big Flash Corp. to IntelGenx Technologies Corp. IntelGenx Corp. has continued operations as our operating subsidiary. 

Overview 

We are a drug delivery company established in 2003 and headquartered in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Our focus is on the development of novel oral immediate-release and controlled-release products for the pharmaceutical market. Our business strategy is to develop pharmaceutical products based on our proprietary drug delivery technologies and, once the viability of a product has been demonstrated, to license the commercial rights to partners in the pharmaceutical industry. In certain cases, we rely upon partners in the pharmaceutical industry to fund development of the licensed products, complete the regulatory approval process with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (&#147;FDA&#148;) or other regulatory agencies relating to the licensed products, and assume responsibility for marketing and distributing such products. 

In addition, we may choose to pursue the development of certain products until the project reaches the marketing and distribution stage. We will assess the potential for successful development of a product and associated costs, and then determine at which stage it is most prudent to seek a partner, balancing such costs against the potential for additional returns earned by partnering later in the development process. 

We have also undertaken a strategy under which we will work with pharmaceutical companies in order to develop new dosage forms for pharmaceutical products for which patent protection is nearing expiration. Under &#167;(505)(b)(2) of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetics Act, the FDA may grant market exclusivity for a term of up to three years of exclusivity following approval of a listed drug that contains previously approved active ingredients but is approved in a new dosage, dosage form, route of administration or combination. The 505(b)(2) pathway is also the regulatory approach to be followed if an applicant intends to file an application for a product containing a drug that is already approved by the FDA for a certain indication and for which the applicant is seeking approval for a new indication or for a new use, the approval of which is required to be supported by new clinical trials, other than bioavailability studies. We have implemented a strategy under which we actively look for such so-called &#147;repurposing opportunities&#148; and determine whether our proprietary VersaFilm&#153; technology adds value to the product. We currently have two such drug repurposing projects in our development pipeline.

We continue to develop the existing products in our pipeline and may also perform research and development on other potential products as opportunities arise.

We are in the process of establishing a state-of-the-art manufacturing facility for the future manufacture of our VersaFilm&#153; products as we believe that this: 

&#160; 1) represents a profitable business opportunity,

&#160; 2) will reduce our dependency upon third-party contract manufacturers, thereby protecting our manufacturing process know- how and intellectual property, and

&#160; 3) allows us to offer our clients and development partners a full service from product conception through to supply of the finished product.

Technology Platforms 

Our product development efforts are based upon three delivery platform technologies: (1) VersaFilm&#153;, an Oral Film technology, (2) VersaTab&#153;, a Multilayer Tablet technology, and (3) AdVersa&#153;, a Mucoadhesive Tablet technology.

VersaFilm&#153; is a drug delivery platform technology that enables the development of oral thin films, improving product performance: 

&#160; &#149; Rapid disintegration without the need for water 

&#160; &#149; Quicker buccal or sublingual absorption 

&#160; &#149; Potential for faster onset of action and increased bioavailability 

&#160; &#149; Potential for reduced adverse effects by bypassing first-pass metabolism 

&#160; &#149; Easy administration for patients who have problems in swallowing: pediatric, geriatric, fear choking and/or suffering from nausea (e.g., nausea resulting from chemotherapy, radiotherapy or any surgical treatment) 

&#160; &#149; Pleasant taste 

&#160; &#149; Small and thin size, making it convenient for consumers 

The VersaFilm&#153; technology consists of a thin (25-35 micron) polymeric film comprised of United States Pharmacopeia (USP) components that are approved by the FDA for use in food, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic products. Derived from the edible film technology used for breath strips and initially developed for the instant delivery of savory flavors to food substrates, the VersaFilm&#153; technology is designed to provide a rapid response compared to existing conventional tablets. The VersaFilm&#153; technology is intended for indications requiring rapid onset of action, such as migraine, opioid dependence, chronic pain, motion sickness, erectile dysfunction, and nausea. 

Our Multilayer Tablet platform technology allows for the development of oral controlled-release products. It is designed to be versatile and to reduce manufacturing costs as compared to competing oral extended-release delivery technologies. The Oral Film technology allows for the instant delivery of pharmaceuticals to the oral cavity, while the Mucoadhesive Tablet allows for the controlled release of active substances to the oral mucosa. 

The Multilayer Tablet platform technology represents a new generation of controlled release layered tablets designed to modulate the release of active compounds. The technology is based on a multilayer tablet with an active core layer and erodible cover layers. The release of the active drug from the core matrix initially occurs in a first-order fashion. As the cover layers start to erode, their permeability for the active ingredient through the cover layers increases. Thus, the Multilayer Tablet can produce quasi-linear (zero-order) kinetics for releasing a chemical compound over a desired period of time. The erosion rate of the cover layers can be customized according to the physico-chemical properties of the active drug. In addition, our multilayer technology offers the opportunity to develop combination products in a regulatory-compliant format. Combination products are made up of two or more active ingredients that are combined into a single dosage form. 

The Mucoadhesive Tablet is a drug delivery system capable of adhering to the oral mucosa and releasing the drug onto the site of application at a controlled rate. The Mucoadhesive Tablet is designed to provide the following advantages relative to competing technologies: (i) it avoids the first pass effect, whereby the liver metabolizes the active ingredient and greatly reduces the level of drug reaching the systemic circulation, (ii) it leads to a higher absorption rate in the oral cavity as compared to the conventional oral route, and (iii) it achieves a rapid onset of action for the drug. The Mucoadhesive Tablet technology is designed to be versatile in order to permit the site of application, residence time, and rate of release of the drug to be modulated to achieve the desired results. 

Product Portfolio 

Our product portfolio includes a blend of generic and branded products based on our proprietary delivery technology (&#147;generic&#148; products are essentially copies of products that have already received FDA approval). Of the thirteen projects currently in our product portfolio, two utilize our VersaTab&#153; technology, ten utilize our VersaFilm&#153; technology, and one utilizes our AdVersa&#153; technology.

INT0001/2004: This is the most advanced generic product involving our multilayer tablet technology. Equivalency with the reference product Toprol XL &#174; and its European equivalent Beloc-ZOK &#174; has been demonstrated in-vitro . The product has been tested in phase I studies. The project is currently on hold.

INT0004/2006: We developed a new, higher strength of the antidepressant Bupropion HCl, the active ingredient in Wellbutrin XL &#174; , and, in November 2011, the FDA approved the drug for patients with Major Depressive Disorder. In February 2012, we entered into an agreement with Edgemont Pharmaceuticals LLC (&#147;Edgemont&#148;) for commercialization of the product in the United States. Under the terms of the agreement, Edgemont obtained certain exclusive rights to market and sell the product in the U.S. In exchange we received a $1.0 million upfront payment, received launch related milestones totaling up to $4.0 million, and are eligible for additional milestones of up to a further $23.5 million upon achieving certain sales and exclusivity targets. We also receive tiered double-digit royalties on the net sales of the product. The agreement has no expiry date but may be terminated in the event of, without limitation (i) failure by either us or Edgemont to perform our respective obligations under the agreement; (ii) if either party files a petition for bankruptcy or insolvency or otherwise winds up, liquidates or dissolves its business, or (iii) otherwise by mutual consent of the parties. The agreement also contains customary confidentiality, indemnification and intellectual property protection provisions. 

The product was launched in the U.S. in October 2012 under the brand name Forfivo XL &#174; . As of December 31, 2015 we have received an upfront payment of $1 million and a $1 million milestone payment related to the launch. The commercialization of Forfivo XL &#174; triggered a launch-related milestone payment of $3 million from IntelGenx&#146; licensing partner Edgemont due to Edgemont reaching in July 2015, $7 million of cumulative net trade sales of Forfivo XL &#174; over the preceding 12 months. From that $3 million milestone payment, $1 million was received in Q3 2015. Of the remaining balance of $2 million, $1 million was received in Q4 2015 and $1 million was received in Q1 2016. We commenced receiving royalty payments in the first quarter of 2013. We recorded $433 thousand for the cost of royalty and license revenue in the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2015 compared with $61 in the same period of 2014.

The level of sales achieved for Forfivo XL &#174; continues to improve significantly. According to Edgemont Pharmaceuticals, net sales of Forfivo XL &#174; totaled $3 million in the fourth quarter ending December 31, 2015 compared to $2.4 million in the third quarter ending September 30, 2015, representing an increase of 24% according to the actual Edgemont Pharmaceutical sales report. For the past twelve months, net sales of Forfivo XL &#174; totaled $9.3 million ($17.4 million gross), an increase of 102% compared to the comparative period of 2014 with net sales of $4.6 million ($7.7 million gross). Management expects the sales trend to continue in fiscal 2016.

In August 2013 we announced receipt of a Paragraph IV Certification Letter from Wockhardt Bio AG, advising of the submission of an Abbreviated New Drug Application ("ANDA") to the FDA requesting authorization to manufacture and market generic versions of Forfivo XL &#174; 450 mg capsules in the United States. In November 2014 we announced that the Paragraph IV litigation with Wockhardt had been settled and that, under the terms of the settlement, Wockhardt has been granted the right, with effect from January 15, 2018, to be the exclusive marketer and distributor of an authorized generic of Forfivo XL &#174; in the U.S. 

In December 2014 we announced that Edgemont had exercised its right to extend the license for the exclusive marketing of Forfivo XL &#174; 450 mg tablets. In exchange, we received milestone payments of $650 thousand in December 2014 and $600 thousand in February 2015. All other financial obligations contained in the license agreement entered into by Edgemont and IntelGenx in February 2012, specifically launch-related and sales milestones, together with the contractual royalty rates on net sales of the product, remain in effect. 

INT0007/2006: We are developing an oral film product based on our VersaFilm&#153; technology containing the active ingredient Tadalafil. The product is intended for the treatment of erectile dysfunction (ED). The results of a phase I pilot study that was conducted in the second quarter of 2015 confirmed that the product is bioequivalent with the brand product, Cialis &#174; . We are currently manufacturing submission batches that are intended to support a 505(b)(2) NDA submission later this year. 

INT0008/2007: In March 2013 we submitted a 505(b)(2) new drug application (&#147;NDA&#148;) to the FDA for our novel oral thin-film formulation of Rizatriptan, the active drug in Maxalt-MLT &#174; orally disintegrating tablets. Maxalt-MLT &#174; is a leading branded anti-migraine product marketed by Merck &#38; Co. The thin-film formulation of Rizatriptan was developed in accordance with a co-development and commercialization agreement with RedHill Biopharma Ltd. (&#147;RedHill&#148;). The product uses our proprietary immediate release VersaFilm&#153; oral drug delivery technology. In December 2011, we received approval by Health Canada to conduct a pivotal bioequivalence study to determine if our product is safe and bioequivalent with the FDA approved reference product, Maxalt-MLT &#174; . The trial was conducted in the second quarter of 2012 and was a randomized, two-period, two-way crossover study in healthy male and female subjects. The study results indicate that the product is safe, and that the 90% confidence intervals of the three relevant parameters Cmax, AUC(0-t) and AUC(0-infinity) are well within the 80 &#150; 125 acceptance range for bioequivalency. 

In June 2013 the FDA assigned a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (&#147;PDUFA&#148;) action date of February 3, 2014 for the review of the NDA for marketing approval and in February 2014 we received a Complete Response Letter (&#147;CRL&#148;) from the FDA informing us that certain questions and deficiencies remain that preclude the approval of the application in its present form. The questions raised by the FDA in the CRL regarding the NDA for our anti-migraine VersaFilm&#153; product primarily relate to third party Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls (&#147;CMC&#148;) and to the packaging and labeling of the product. No questions or deficiencies were raised relating to the product's safety and the FDA's CRL does not require additional clinical studies.

In March 2014 we submitted our response to the FDA's CRL and in April, 2014 the FDA requested additional CMC data. We also reported that the supplier of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (&#147;API&#148;) of the product has been issued with an &#147;Import Alert&#148; by the FDA. The Import Alert bans the import into the USA of all raw materials from the supplier&#146;s manufacturing facility, which therefore prohibits the import of any products using these raw materials, and effectively prevents our VersaFilm&#153; product from being approved by the FDA at this time. We continue to work together with RedHill, our development partner, on a variety of options to ensure continued supply of the raw material. We plan to file a re-submission of the NDA in Q4, 2016 and expect to receive a new PDUFA date later in Q4, 2016. The PDUFA date for FDA approval is expected to be set by Q2 2017.

In October 2014 we announced the submission of a Marketing Authorization Application (&#147;MAA&#148;) to the German Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices (&#147;BfArM&#148;) seeking European marketing approval of our oral thin film formulation of Rizatriptan for acute migraines, under the brand name RIZAPORT &#174; . The brand name RIZAPORT &#174; was also conditionally approved by the FDA as part of the NDA review process in the U.S. The MAA was submitted under the European Decentralized Procedure (DCP) with Germany as the reference member state. The submission is supported by several studies, including a comparative bioavailability study which successfully established the bioequivalence between RIZAPORT &#174; and the European reference drug. BfArM validated the MAA and initiated the formal review process of the application on November 25, 2014. BfArM granted national marketing approval on November 9, 2015 for RIZAPORT &#174; under the DCP.

INT0010/2006: We initially entered into an agreement with Cynapsus Therapeutics Inc. (formerly Cannasat Therapeutics Inc., &#147;Cynapsus&#148;) for the development of a buccal muco-adhesive tablet product containing a cannabinoid-based drug for the treatment of neuropathic pain and nausea in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. A clinical biostudy undertaken in 2009 on the muco-adhesive tablet developed by us and based on our proprietary AdVersa&#153; technology indicated improved bioavailability and reduced first-pass metabolization of the drug. In the fourth quarter of 2010, we acquired from Cynapsus full control of, and interest in, this project going forward. We also obtained worldwide rights to U.S. Patent 7,592,328 and all corresponding foreign patents and patent applications to exclusively develop and further provide intellectual property protection for this project. 

INT0027/2011: In accordance with a co-development and commercialization agreement with Par Pharmaceutical Companies, Inc. (&#147;Par&#148;), we developed an oral film product based on our proprietary VersaFilm&#153; technology. The product is a generic formulation of buprenorphine and naloxone Sublingual Film, indicated for maintenance treatment of opioid dependence. A bioequivalent film formulation was developed, scaled-up, and pivotal batches manufactured and tested during a subsequent pivotal clinical study. An ANDA was filed with the FDA by Par in July 2013.

In August 2013 we were notified that, in response to filing of the ANDA, we were named as a codefendant in a lawsuit pursuant to Paragraph IV litigation filed by Reckitt Benckiser Pharmaceuticals and Monosol RX in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware alleging infringement of U.S. Patent Nos. 8,475,832 and 8,017,150, each of which relate to Suboxone &#174; . We believe the ANDA product does not infringe those or any other patents, and will vigorously defend ourselves in this matter. In accordance with the terms of the co-development and commercialization agreement, Par is financially responsible for the costs of this defense. Since Paragraph IV litigation is a regular part of the ANDA process, we do not expect any unanticipated impact on our already planned development schedule.

INT0036/2013: Loxapine is for the treatment of anxiety and aggression in patients suffering from schizophrenia or bipolar 1 disorder. Loxapine oral film will utilize the company's proprietary VersaFilm&#153; technology, allowing for an improved product to offer patients significant therapeutic benefits compared to existing medications. A fast acting loxapine oral film dosage form that can be used to effectively treat acute agitation associated with schizophrenia or bipolar 1 disorder in non-institutionalized patients while reducing the risk of pulmonary problems is needed as it could substantially reduce the potential risks of violence and injury to patients and others by preventing or reducing the duration and severity of an episode of acute agitation. Our first clinical study on this product, completed in Q4 2014, suggested improved bioavailability compared to the currently approved tablet. A second pilot clinical study confirming the improved bioavailability compared to the current tablet was completed late 2015. Further formulation optimization work is ongoing.

INT0037/2013: A product based on one of our proprietary technologies has been developed and we are currently preparing submission batches in support of a marketing application to the FDA. The product was being developed in accordance with another development and commercialization agreement with Par Pharmaceutical, Inc. On September 18, 2015, Par was acquired by Endo International plc. As a result of this acquisition, there was a conflict for Par to remain as the partner for these products. As such, the product was returned to the Company with full rights and no requirement for any compensation for work paid by Par. We continue to work closely with Par on the opioid dependence product and are pleased the relationship is on excellent terms. IntelGenx is now actively looking for a commercialization partner to conclude an agreement with to finalize the development of this product. Scale-up activities for the product commenced in 2015. 

INT0039/2013: A product based on one of our proprietary technologies is currently in the early development stage. The product was being developed in accordance with another development and commercialization agreement with Par Pharmaceutical, Inc. On September 18, 2015, Par was acquired by Endo International plc. As a result of this acquisition, there was a conflict for Par to remain as the partner for this product. As such, the product was returned to the Company with full rights and no requirement for any compensation for work paid by Par. We continue to work closely with Par on the opioid dependence product and are pleased the relationship is on excellent terms. IntelGenx is now actively looking for a commercialization partner to conclude an agreement with to finalize the development of this product.

Growth Strategy 

Our primary growth strategies include: (1) identifying lifecycle management opportunities for existing market leading pharmaceutical products, (2) developing generic drugs where high technology barriers to entry exist in reproducing branded films, (3) development of new drug delivery technologies, (4) repurposing existing drugs for new indications, and (5) manufacturing our VersaFilm&#153; products for commercial sale. 

Lifecycle Management Opportunities 

We are seeking to position our delivery technologies as an opportunity for lifecycle management of products for which patent protection of the active ingredient is nearing expiration. While the patent for the underlying substance cannot be extended, patent protection can be obtained for a new and improved formulation by filing an application with the FDA under Section 505(b)(2) of the U.S. Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. Such applications, known as a &#147;505(b)(2) NDA&#148;, are permitted for new drug products that incorporate previously approved active ingredients, even if the proposed new drug incorporates an approved active ingredient in a novel formulation or for a new indication. A 505(b)(2) NDA may include information regarding safety and efficacy of a proposed drug that comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant. The first formulation for a respective active ingredient filed with the FDA under a 505(b)(2) application may qualify for up to three years of market exclusivity upon approval. Based upon a review of past partnerships between third party drug delivery companies and pharmaceutical companies, management believes that drug delivery companies which possess innovative technologies to develop these special dosage formulations present an attractive opportunity to pharmaceutical companies. Accordingly, we believe &#147;505(b)(2) products&#148; represent a viable business opportunity for us. 

Generic Drugs with High Barriers to Entry 

We plan to pursue the development of generic drugs that have certain barriers to entry, e.g., where product development and manufacturing is complex and can limit the number of potential entrants into the generic market. We plan to pursue such projects only if the number of potential competitors is deemed relatively insignificant.

Development of New Drug Delivery Technologies 

The rapidly disintegrating film technology contained in our VersaFilm&#153;, and our AdVersa&#153; mucosal adhesive tablet, are two examples of our efforts to develop alternate technology platforms. As we work with various partners on different products, we seek opportunities to develop new proprietary technologies.

Repurposing Existing Drugs 

We are working on the repurposing of already approved drugs for new indications using our VersaFilm&#153; film technology. This program represents a viable growth strategy for us as it will allow for reduced development costs, improved success rates and shorter approval times. We believe that through our repurposing program we will be able minimize the risk of developmental failure and create value for us and potential partners. 

VersaFilm&#153; Manufacturing 

We are in the process of establishing a state-of-the-art manufacturing facility for the future manufacture of our VersaFilm&#153; products. Construction of the manufacturing and laboratories are now completed and equipment is being prepared to begin manufacturing in 2017. We believe that this (1) represents a profitable business opportunity, (2) will reduce our dependency upon third-party contract manufacturers, thereby protecting our manufacturing process know-how and intellectual property, and (3) allows us to offer our development partners a full service from product conception through to supply of the finished product.

Competition 

The pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and is subject to the rapid emergence of new technologies, governmental regulations, healthcare legislation, availability of financing, patent litigation and other factors. Many of our competitors, including Monosol Rx, Tesa-Labtec GmbH, BioDelivery Sciences International, Inc. and LTS Lohmann Therapy Systems Corp., have longer operating histories and greater financial, technical, marketing, legal and other resources than we have. In addition, many of our competitors have significantly greater experience than we have in conducting clinical trials of pharmaceutical products, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of products, and marketing and selling products that have been approved. We expect that we will be subject to competition from numerous other companies that currently operate or are planning to enter the markets in which we compete.

The key factors affecting the development and commercialization of our drug delivery products are likely to include, among other factors:

&#160; &#149; The safety and efficacy of our products; 

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#149; The relative speed with which we can develop products; 

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#149; Generic competition for any product that we develop; 

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#149; Our ability to defend our existing intellectual property and to broaden our intellectual property and technology base; 

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#149; Our ability to differentiate our products; 

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#149; Our ability to develop products that can be manufactured on a cost effective basis; 

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#149; Our ability to manufacture our products in compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (&#147;cGMP&#148;) and any other regulatory requirements; and 

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#149; Our ability to obtain financing. 

In order to establish ourselves as a viable industry partner, we plan to continue to invest in our research and development activities and in our manufacturing technology expertise, in order to further strengthen our technology base and to develop the ability to manufacture our VersaFilm&#153; products ourselves, and our VersaTab&#153; and AdVersa&#153; products through our manufacturing partners, at competitive costs.

Our Competitive Strengths 

We believe that our key competitive strengths include:

&#160; &#149; Our diversified pipeline; 

&#160; &#160; &#160;

&#160; &#149; Our ability to swiftly develop products through to regulatory approval; and 

&#160; &#160; &#160;

&#160; &#149; The versatility of our drug delivery technology. 

Manufacturing Partnership 

We currently manufacture products only for testing purposes in our own laboratories, and we do not manufacture products for pivotal clinical trials or for commercial use. In order to establish ourselves as a full-service partner for our thin film products, we have completed the construction of our new state-of-the-art facility and are in the process of preparing the equipment and finalizing plans to commercially manufacture our VersaFilm&#153; drug delivery technology. VersaFilm&#153; is our proprietary immediate release polymeric film technology. It is comprised of a thin polymeric film using United States Pharmacopeia (USP) components that are safe and approved by the FDA for use in food, pharmaceutical and cosmetic products. VersaFilm&#153; provides a patent-protected method of reformulating approved pharmaceuticals in a more convenient and discrete oral dosage form. We completed construction of our manufacturing facility and expect it to be fully operational in 2017.

We formed a strategic alliance with LTS Lohmann Therapie-Systeme AG ("LTS") for the manufacturing of certain products developed by us using our VersaFilm&#153; technology. LTS is regarded as a pioneer in the development and production of transdermal and film form oral systems and has become one of the world's leading suppliers for the international pharmaceutical industry.

We formed a strategic manufacturing partnership with Pillar5 Pharma Inc. (&#147;Pillar5&#148;). This manufacturing partnership secures the production of clinical test batches and commercial products for our VersaTab&#153; and AdVersa&#153; tablet products.

We are not currently a manufacturer and we do not usually purchase large quantities of raw materials. Our manufacturing partners, however, may purchase significant quantities of raw materials, some of which may have long lead times. If raw materials cannot be supplied to our manufacturing partners in a timely and cost effective manner, our manufacturing partners may experience delays in production that may lead to reduced supplies of commercial products being available for sale or distribution. Such shortages could have a detrimental effect on sales of the products and a corresponding reduction on our royalty revenues earned. 

Dependence on Major Customers 

We currently rely on a few major customers for our end products. We also currently depend upon a limited number of partners to develop our products, to provide funding for the development of our products, to assist in obtaining regulatory approvals that are required in order to commercialize these products, and to market and sell our products. 

Intellectual Property and Patent Protection 

We protect our intellectual property and technology by using the following methods: (i) applying for patent protection in the United States and in the appropriate foreign markets, (ii) non-disclosure agreements, license agreements and appropriate contractual restrictions and controls on the distribution of information, and (iii) trade secrets, common law trademark rights and trademark registrations.

Government Regulation 

The pharmaceutical industry is highly regulated. The products we participate in developing require certain regulatory approvals. In the United States, drugs are subject to rigorous regulation by the FDA. The U.S. Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, record keeping, packaging, labeling, adverse event reporting, advertising, promotion, marketing, distribution, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicially-imposed sanctions and/or the inability to obtain or maintain required approvals or to market drugs. The steps ordinarily required before a new pharmaceutical product may be marketed in the United States include: 

&#149; Preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies under FDA&#146;s good laboratory practices regulations, or GLPs; 

&#160; &#160; 

&#149; The submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application, or IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin; 

&#160; &#160; 

&#149; The completion of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials according to good clinical practice regulations, or GCPs, to establish the safety and efficacy of the product for each indication for which approval is sought; 

&#160; &#160; 

&#149; After successful completion of the required clinical testing, submission to the FDA of a NDA, or an ANDA, for generic drugs. In certain cases, an application for marketing approval may include information regarding safety and efficacy of a proposed drug that comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant. Such applications, known as a 505(b)(2) NDA, are permitted for new drug products that incorporate previously approved active ingredients, even if the proposed new drug incorporates an approved active ingredient in a novel formulation or for a new indication; 

&#160; &#160; 

&#149; Satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with cGMPs to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug&#146;s identity, strength, quality and purity; and 

&#160; &#160; 

&#160; &#160;&#149; FDA review and approval of the NDA or ANDA. 

The cost of complying with the foregoing requirements, including preparing and submitting an NDA or ANDA, may be substantial. Accordingly, we typically rely upon our partners in the pharmaceutical industry to spearhead and bear the costs of the FDA approval process. We also seek to mitigate regulatory costs by focusing on 505(b)(2) NDA opportunities. By applying our drug delivery technology to existing drugs, we seek to develop products with lower research &#38; development (&#147;R&#38;D&#148;) expenses and shorter time-to-market timelines as compared to regular NDA products.

Research and Development Expense 

Our R&#38;D expenses, net of R&#38;D tax credits, for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased by $42 thousand to $1,033 thousand, compared with $1,075 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in R&#38;D expenditure is explained in the section of this report entitled &#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#148;. 

Environmental Regulatory Compliance 

We believe that we are in compliance with environmental regulations applicable to our research and development facility located in Ville Saint Laurent, Quebec. 

Employees 

As of the date of this filing, we have 21 full-time and no part-time employees. None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. We believe that our relations with our employees are good.
