BUSINESS AND PROPERTIES 

General 

We are a publicly traded Delaware limited partnership formed by Cheniere in 2006. Through our wholly owned subsidiary, SPLNG , we own and operate the regasification facilities at the Sabine Pass LNG terminal located on the Sabine-Neches Waterway &#32;less than four miles from the Gulf Coast. The Sabine Pass LNG terminal includes existing infrastructure of five LNG &#32;storage tanks with capacity of approximately 16.9 Bcfe , two docks that can accommodate vessels with nominal capacity of up to 266,000 cubic meters and vaporizers with regasification capacity of approximately 4.0 Bcf/d . We are developing and constructing natural gas liquefaction facilities (the &#8220;Liquefaction Project&#8221;) &#32;at the Sabine Pass LNG terminal adjacent to the existing regasification facilities through our wholly owned subsidiary, SPL. We are constructing five Trains and developing a sixth Train, each of which is expected to have a nominal production capacity of approximately 4.5 mtpa &#32;of LNG . We also own a 94-mile pipeline that interconnects the Sabine Pass LNG terminal with a number of large interstate pipelines (the &#8220;Creole Trail Pipeline&#8221;) &#32;through our wholly owned subsidiary, CTPL. 

LNG &#32;is natural gas that, through a refrigeration process, has been cooled to a liquid state, which occupies a volume that is approximately 1/600th of its gaseous state. The liquefaction of natural gas into LNG allows it to be shipped economically from areas of the world where natural gas is abundant and inexpensive to produce to other areas where natural gas demand and infrastructure exist to justify economically the use of LNG . LNG &#32;is transported using large oceangoing LNG &#32;tankers specifically constructed for this purpose. LNG &#32;regasification facilities offload LNG &#32;from LNG &#32;tankers, store the LNG &#32;prior to processing, heat the LNG &#32;to return it to a gaseous state and deliver the resulting natural gas into pipelines for transportation to market. Although results are consolidated for financial reporting, Cheniere Partners, SPL, SPLNG and CTPL operate with independent capital structures. 

The following diagram depicts our abbreviated capital structure as of December 31, 2015 :

&#8226; 

safely maintaining and operating the Sabine Pass LNG terminal and the Creole Trail Pipeline ; 

&#8226; 

developing business relationships for the marketing of additional long-term and short-term agreements for additional LNG &#32;volumes at the Sabine Pass LNG terminal; and 

&#8226; 

expanding our existing asset base through acquisitions from Cheniere or third parties or our own development of the Liquefaction Project &#32;or complementary businesses or assets such as other LNG facilities, midstream assets, natural gas storage assets and natural gas pipelines. 

Our Business 

&#160; 

We have constructed and are operating regasification facilities at the Sabine Pass LNG terminal and are developing and constructing the Liquefaction Project. 

&#160; 

Regasification Facilities 

The Sabine Pass LNG terminal has operational regasification capacity of approximately 4.0 Bcf/d &#32;and aggregate LNG storage capacity of approximately 16.9 Bcfe . Approximately 2.0 Bcf/d &#32;of the regasification capacity at the Sabine Pass LNG terminal has been reserved under two long-term third-party TUA s, under which SPLNG&#8217;s customers are required to pay fixed monthly fees, whether or not they use the LNG terminal. Each of Total Gas &#38; Power North America, Inc. (&#8220;Total&#8221;) &#32;and Chevron U.S.A. Inc. (&#8220;Chevron&#8221;) &#32;has reserved approximately 1.0 Bcf/d &#32;of regasification capacity and is obligated to make monthly capacity payments to SPLNG aggregating approximately $125 million annually for 20 years that commenced in 2009. Total S.A. has guaranteed Total &#8217;s obligations under its TUA &#32;up to $2.5 billion, subject to certain exceptions, and Chevron Corporation has guaranteed Chevron &#8217;s obligations under its TUA &#32;up to 80% of the fees payable by Chevron . 

The remaining approximately 2.0 Bcf/d &#32;of capacity has been reserved under a TUA &#32;by SPL. SPL is obligated to make monthly capacity payments to SPLNG aggregating approximately $250 million annually, continuing until at least 20 years after SPL delivers its first commercial cargo at the Liquefaction Project . SPL entered into a partial TUA assignment agreement with Total , whereby SPL will progressively gain access to Total &#8217;s capacity and other services provided under Total &#8217;s TUA with SPLNG. This agreement will provide SPL with additional berthing and storage capacity at the Sabine Pass LNG terminal that may be used to accommodate the development of Trains 5 and 6, provide increased flexibility in managing LNG cargo loading and unloading activity starting with the commencement of commercial operations of Train 3 and permit SPL to more flexibly manage its LNG storage capacity with the commencement of Train 1. Notwithstanding any arrangements between Total &#32;and SPL, payments required to be made by Total &#32;to SPLNG will continue to be made by Total &#32;to SPLNG in accordance with its TUA. 

Under each of these TUA s, SPLNG is entitled to retain 2% of the LNG delivered to the Sabine Pass LNG terminal. 

Liquefaction Facilities 

The Liquefaction Project &#32;is being developed and constructed at the Sabine Pass LNG terminal adjacent to the existing regasification facilities. We have received authorization from the FERC to site, construct and operate Trains 1 through 6. We commenced construction of Trains 1 and 2 and the related new facilities needed to treat, liquefy, store and export natural gas in August 2012. Construction of Trains 3 and 4 and the related facilities commenced in May 2013. In June 2015, we commenced construction of Train 5 and the related facilities. 

&#160; 

The DOE &#32;has authorized the export of up to a combined total of the equivalent of 16 mtpa &#32;(approximately 803 Bcf/yr ) of domestically produced LNG by vessel from the Sabine Pass LNG terminal to FTA countries &#32;for a 30-year term and to non-FTA countries &#32;for a 20-year term. The DOE &#32;further issued an order authorizing SPL to export up to the equivalent of approximately 203 Bcf/yr &#32;of domestically produced LNG from the Sabine Pass LNG terminal to FTA countries &#32;for a 25-year period. SPL&#8217;s application for authorization to export that same 203 Bcf/yr &#32;of domestically produced LNG from the Sabine Pass LNG terminal to non-FTA countries &#32;is currently pending at the DOE . Additionally, the DOE &#32;issued orders authorizing SPL to export up to a combined total of 503.3 Bcf/yr &#32;of domestically produced LNG from the Sabine Pass LNG terminal to FTA countries &#32;and non-FTA countries &#32;for a 20-year term. A party to the proceeding requested a rehearing of the non-FTA order pertaining to the 503.3 Bcf/yr , and the DOE &#32;has not yet issued a final ruling on the rehearing request. In each case, the terms of these authorizations begin on the earlier of the date of first export thereunder or the date specified in the particular order, which ranges from 5 to 10 years from the date the order was issued. Furthermore, the DOE issued an order authorizing SPL to export up to 600 Bcf in total of domestically produced LNG by vessel from the Sabine Pass LNG terminal to FTA countries and non-FTA countries over a two-year period commencing on January 15, 2016. 

As of December 31, 2015 , the overall project completion percentages for Trains 1 and 2 and Trains 3 and 4 of the Liquefaction Project &#32;were approximately 97.4% &#32;and 79.5% , respectively. As of December 31, 2015 , the overall project completion percentage for Train 5 of the Liquefaction Project &#32;was approximately 14.9% &#32;with engineering, procurement and construction approximately 41.9% , 20.5% &#32;and 0.1% &#32;complete, respectively. As of December 31, 2015 , the overall project completion of each of our Trains was ahead of the contractual schedule. We produced our first LNG from Train 1 of the Liquefaction Project &#32;in February 2016. Based on our current construction schedule, we anticipate that Train 2 will produce LNG as early as mid-2016 and Trains 3 through 5 are expected to commence operations on a staggered basis thereafter.

Customers 

SPL &#32;has entered into six fixed price, 20-year SPA s with third parties that in the aggregate equate to approximately 19.75 mtpa &#32;of LNG, which is approximately 88% of the expected aggregate nominal production capacity of Trains 1 through 5, that commence with the date of first commercial delivery for Trains 1 through 5. Under these SPA s, the customers will purchase LNG from SPL for a price consisting of a fixed fee plus 115% of Henry Hub &#32;per MMBtu &#32;of LNG. In certain circumstances, the customers may elect to cancel or suspend deliveries of LNG cargoes, in which case the customers would still be required to pay the fixed fee with respect to the contracted volumes that are not delivered. A portion of the fixed fee will be subject to annual adjustment for inflation. The SPA s and contracted volumes to be made available under the SPA s are not tied to a specific Train; however, the term of each SPA &#32;commences upon the start of operations of a specified Train. As of December 31, 2015 , SPL &#32;had the following third-party SPA s: 

&#160;

In aggregate, the fixed fee portion to be paid by the third-party SPA customers is approximately $2.9 billion annually for Trains 1 through 5, with the applicable fixed fees starting from the commencement of commercial operations of the applicable Train. These fixed fees equal approximately $411 million, $564 million, $650 million, $648 million and $588 million for each of Trains 1 through 5, respectively. 

In addition, Cheniere Marketing has entered into an SPA &#32;with SPL to purchase, at Cheniere Marketing&#8217;s option, any LNG produced by SPL in excess of that required for other customers. 

Natural Gas Transportation and Supply 

To ensure SPL is able to transport adequate natural gas feedstock to the Sabine Pass LNG terminal, it has entered into transportation precedent agreements to secure firm pipeline transportation capacity with CTPL and third-party pipeline companies. SPL has also entered into enabling agreements and natural gas purchase agreements with third parties in order to secure natural gas feedstock for the Liquefaction Project. As of December 31, 2015 , SPL has secured up to approximately 2,154.2 million &#32;MMBtu of natural gas feedstock through natural gas purchase agreements. 

Natural Gas Storage Services 

For SPL&#8217;s natural gas storage requirements, SPL has entered into firm storage services agreements with third parties. The storage services agreements will assist SPL in managing volatility in natural gas needs for the Liquefaction Project . 

Construction 

SPL entered into lump sum turnkey contracts with Bechtel Oil, Gas and Chemicals, Inc. (&#8220;Bechtel&#8221;) &#32;for the engineering, procurement and construction of Trains 1 through 5, under which Bechtel &#32;charges a lump sum for all work performed and generally bears project cost risk unless certain specified events occur, in which case Bechtel &#32;may cause SPL to enter into a change order, or SPL agrees with Bechtel &#32;to a change order. 

The total contract prices of the EPC &#32;contract for Trains 1 and 2, the EPC &#32;contract for Trains 3 and 4 and the EPC &#32;contract for Train 5 of the Liquefaction Project &#32;are approximately $4.1 billion , $3.8 billion &#32;and $3.0 billion , respectively, reflecting amounts incurred under change orders through December 31, 2015 . Total expected capital costs for Trains 1 through 5 are estimated to be between $12.5 billion &#32;and $13.5 billion &#32;before financing costs and between $17.0 billion &#32;and $18.0 billion &#32;after financing costs, including, in each case, estimated owner&#8217;s costs and contingencies. 

Pipeline Facilities 

During the third quarter of 2015, CTPL completed construction of certain modifications to allow the Creole Trail Pipeline &#32;to be able to transport natural gas to the Sabine Pass LNG terminal. 

Final Investment Decision on Train 6 

We will contemplate making an FID &#32;to commence construction of Train 6 of the Liquefaction Project &#32;based upon, among other things, entering into an EPC &#32;contract, entering into acceptable commercial arrangements and obtaining adequate financing to construct the Train. 

Governmental Regulation 

&#160; 

The Sabine Pass LNG terminal is subject to extensive regulation under federal, state and local statutes, rules, regulations and laws. These laws require that we engage in consultations with appropriate federal and state agencies and that we obtain and maintain applicable permits and other authorizations. This regulatory requirement increases our cost of operations and construction, and failure to comply with such laws could result in substantial penalties. 

Federal Energy Regulatory Commission 

&#160; 

T he design, construction and operation of our liquefaction facilities and the export of LNG and the transportation of natural gas through the Creole Trail Pipeline &#32;are highly regulated activities. In order to site and construct the Sabine Pass LNG terminal, we received and are required to maintain authorization from the FERC &#32;under Section 3 of the Natural Gas Act of 1938 (&#8220;NGA&#8221;). The FERC &#8217;s approval under Section 3 of the NGA, as well as several other material governmental and regulatory approvals and permits, are required in order to site, construct and operate our liquefaction facilities. 

The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (the &#8220;EPAct&#8221;) &#32;amended Section 3 of the NGA to establish or clarify the FERC &#8217;s exclusive authority to approve or deny an application for the siting, construction, expansion or operation of LNG terminals, although except as specifically provided in the EPAct , nothing in the EPAct &#32;is intended to affect otherwise applicable law related to any other federal agency&#8217;s authorities or responsibilities related to LNG terminals. The FERC &#32;issued final orders in April and July 2012 approving our application for an order under Section 3 of the NGA authorizing the siting, construction and operation of Trains 1 through 4 of the Liquefaction Project. Subsequently, the FERC &#32;issued written approval to commence site preparation work for Trains 1 through 4. In October 2012, we applied to amend the FERC &#32;approval to reflect certain modifications to the Liquefaction Project , and in August 2013, the FERC &#32;issued an order approving the modifications. In October 2013, we applied to further amend the FERC &#32;approval, requesting authorization to increase the total LNG production capacity of Trains 1 through 4 from the currently authorized 803 Bcf/yr to 1,006 Bcf/yr so as to more accurately reflect the estimated maximum LNG production capacity. In February 2014, the FERC &#32;issued an order approving the October 2013 application (the &#8220;February 2014 Order&#8221;) . A party to the proceeding requested a rehearing of the February 2014 Order , and in September 2014, the FERC denied rehearing. The party petitioned the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to review the February 2014 Order &#32;and the FERC Order Denying Rehearing, and that appeal is still pending. In September 2013, we filed an application with the FERC for authorization to add Trains 5 and 6 to the Liquefaction Project, which was granted by the FERC in April 2015. 

In order to construct, own, operate and maintain the Creole Trail Pipeline , CTPL received a certificate of public convenience and necessity from the FERC &#32;under Section 7 of the NGA. The FERC &#8217;s approval under Section 7 of the NGA, as well as several other material governmental and regulatory approvals and permits, may be required prior to making any modifications to the Creole Trail Pipeline &#32;as it is a regulated, interstate natural gas pipeline. The FERC &#32;also approved CTPL&#8217;s application for authorization to construct, own, operate and maintain certain new facilities in order to enable bi-directional natural gas flow on the Creole Trail Pipeline &#32;system to allow for the delivery of up to 1,530,000 Dthd of feed gas to the Liquefaction Project. In November 2013, CTPL received approval from the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (&#8220;LDEQ&#8221;) &#32;for the proposed modifications and, with subsequent final FERC &#32;clearance, construction was completed in 2015. 

Several other material governmental and regulatory approvals and permits will be required prior to construction and operation of our liquefaction projects. In addition, the FERC authorization requires us to obtain certain additional FERC approvals as construction progresses. To date, we have been able to obtain these approvals as needed and the need for these approvals has not materially affected our construction progress. Throughout the life of our LNG terminals, we will be subject to regular reporting requirements to the FERC, the U.S. Department of Transportation and applicable state regulatory agencies regarding the operation and maintenance of our facilities. 

In addition to the siting and construction authority with respect to the LNG terminals under the NGA, the FERC has authority to approve, and if necessary, set &#8220;just and reasonable rates&#8221; for the transportation or sale of natural gas in interstate commerce. In addition, under the NGA, our pipelines are not permitted to unduly discriminate or grant undue preference as to rates or the terms and conditions of service. The FERC has the authority to grant certificates allowing construction and operation of facilities used in interstate gas transportation and authorizing the provision of services. Under the NGA, the FERC&#8217;s jurisdiction generally extends to the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce, to the sale in interstate commerce of natural gas for resale for ultimate consumption for domestic, commercial, industrial or any other use and to natural gas companies engaged in such transportation or sale. However, the FERC&#8217;s jurisdiction does not extend to the production, gathering or local distribution of natural gas. 

In general, the FERC&#8217;s authority to regulate interstate natural gas pipelines and the services that they provide includes: 

&#8226; rates and charges for natural gas transportation and related services; 

&#8226; the certification and construction of new facilities; 

&#8226; the extension and abandonment of services and facilities; 

&#8226; the maintenance of accounts and records; 

&#8226; the acquisition and disposition of facilities; 

&#8226; the initiation and discontinuation of services; and 

&#8226; various other matters. 

The FERC&#8217;s Standards of Conduct apply to interstate pipelines that conduct transmission transactions with an affiliate that engages in marketing functions. Interstate pipelines must treat all transmission customers on a not unduly discriminatory basis. The general principles of the Standards of Conduct are: (1) independent functioning, which requires transmission function employees to function independently of marketing function employees; (2) no-conduit rule, which prohibits passing transmission function information to marketing function employees; and (3) transparency, which imposes posting requirements to detect undue preference. CTPL has established the required policies and procedures to comply with the FERC&#8217;s Standards of Conduct and is subject to audit by the FERC to review compliance, policies and its training programs. 

In 2002, the FERC concluded that it would apply light-handed regulation over the rates, terms and conditions agreed to by parties for LNG terminalling services, such that LNG terminal owners would not be required to provide open-access service at non-discriminatory rates or maintain a tariff or rate schedule on file with the FERC, as distinguished from the requirements applied to our FERC-regulated natural gas pipelines. The EPAct &#32;codified the FERC&#8217;s policy, but those provisions expired on January 1, 2015. Nonetheless, we see no indication that the FERC intends to modify its longstanding policy of light-handed regulation of LNG terminals. 

DOE Export License 

The DOE has authorized the export of up to a combined total of the equivalent of 16 mtpa (approximately 803 Bcf/yr) of domestically produced LNG by vessel from the Sabine Pass LNG terminal to FTA countries for a 30-year term and to non-FTA 

countries for a 20-year term. The DOE further issued an order authorizing SPL to export up to the equivalent of approximately 203 Bcf/yr of domestically produced LNG from the Sabine Pass LNG terminal to FTA countries for a 25-year period. SPL&#8217;s application for authorization to export that same 203 Bcf/yr of domestically produced LNG from the Sabine Pass LNG terminal to non-FTA countries is currently pending at the DOE. Additionally, the DOE issued orders authorizing SPL to export up to a combined total of 503.3 Bcf/yr of domestically produced LNG from the Sabine Pass LNG terminal to FTA countries and non-FTA countries for a 20-year term. A party to the proceeding requested a rehearing of the non-FTA order pertaining to the 503.3 Bcf/yr, and the DOE has not yet issued a final ruling on the rehearing request. In each case, the terms of these authorizations begin on the earlier of the date of first export thereunder or the date specified in the particular order, which ranges from 5 to 10 years from the date the order was issued. Furthermore, the DOE issued an order authorizing SPL to export up to 600 Bcf in total of domestically produced LNG by vessel from the Sabine Pass LNG terminal to FTA countries and non-FTA countries over a two-year period commencing on January 15, 2016. 

Exports of natural gas to FTA countries are &#8220;deemed to be consistent with the public interest&#8221; and authorization to export LNG to FTA countries shall be granted by the DOE without &#8220;modification or delay.&#8221; FTA countries which import LNG now or will do so by 2016 include Chile, Mexico, Singapore, South Korea and the Dominican Republic. Exports of natural gas to non-FTA countries are considered by the DOE in the context of a comment period whereby interveners are provided the opportunity to assert that such authorization would not be consistent with the public interest. 

&#160; 

Pipelines 

The Creole Trail Pipeline &#32;is also subject to regulation by the U.S. Department of Transportation (&#8220;DOT&#8221;), under the Pipeline and Hazardous Material Safety Administration (&#8220;PHMSA&#8221;), pursuant to which the PHMSA has established requirements relating to the design, installation, testing, construction, operation, replacement and management of pipeline facilities. 

The Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002, as amended (&#8220;PSIA&#8221;), which is administered by the PHMSA Office of Pipeline Safety, governs the areas of testing, education, training and communication. The PSIA requires pipeline companies to perform extensive integrity tests on natural gas transportation pipelines that exist in high population density areas designated as &#8220;high consequence areas.&#8221; Pipeline companies are required to perform the integrity tests on a seven-year cycle. The risk ratings are based on numerous factors, including the population density in the geographic regions served by a particular pipeline, as well as the age and condition of the pipeline and its protective coating. Testing consists of hydrostatic testing, internal electronic testing, or direct assessment of the piping. In addition to the pipeline integrity tests, pipeline companies must implement a qualification program to make certain that employees are properly trained. Pipeline operators also must develop integrity management programs for gas transportation pipelines, which requires pipeline operators to perform ongoing assessments of pipeline integrity; identify and characterize applicable threats to pipeline segments that could impact a high consequence area; improve data collection, integration and analysis; repair and remediate the pipeline, as necessary; and implement preventive and mitigation actions. 

In 2010, the PHMSA issued a final rule (known as &#8220;Control Room Management/Human Factors Rule&#8221;) requiring pipeline operators to write and institute certain control room procedures that address human factors and fatigue management. In August 2011, the PHMSA issued an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking addressing whether changes are needed to the regulations governing the safety of gas transmission pipelines. Specifically, PHMSA is considering whether integrity management requirements should be changed, including whether the definition of &#8220;high consequence area&#8221; should be revised and whether additional restrictions should be placed on the use of specific pipeline assessment methods. The PHMSA is also considering whether to revise requirements for non-integrity management issues, such as mainline valves, corrosion control issues and the safety of gathering lines. This advanced notice of proposed rulemaking is still pending at the PHMSA. 

In March 2015, the PHMSA issued a final rule amending the pipeline safety regulations to update and clarify certain regulatory requirements, including who can perform post-construction inspections on transmission pipelines. In May 2015, the PHMSA issued a notice of proposed rulemaking proposing to amend gas pipeline safety regulations regarding plastic piping systems used in gas services, including the installation of plastic pipe used for gas transmission lines. In July 2015, the PHMSA issued a notice of proposed rulemaking proposing to add a specific timeframe for operators&#8217; notification of accidents or incidents, as well as amending the safety regulations regarding operator qualification requirements by expanding the requirements to include new construction and certain previously excluded operation and maintenance tasks, requiring a program effectiveness review and adding new recordkeeping requirements. These notices of proposed rulemaking are still pending at the PHMSA. 

Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968 (&#8220;NGPSA&#8221;) 

Louisiana and Texas administer federal pipeline safety standards under the NGPSA, which requires certain pipelines to comply with safety standards in constructing and operating the pipelines and subjects the pipelines to regular inspections. Failure to comply with the NGPSA may result in the imposition of administrative, civil and criminal remedies. 

Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty and Jobs Creation Act of 2011 

The Creole Trail Pipeline &#32;is also subject to the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty and Jobs Creation Act of 2011, which regulates safety requirements in the design, construction, operation and maintenance of interstate natural gas transmission facilities. Under the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty and Job Creation Act of 2011, PHMSA has civil penalty authority up to $200,000 per day (increased from the prior $100,000), with a maximum of $2 million for any related series of violations (increased from the prior $1 million). 

Other Governmental Permits, Approvals and Authorizations 

The construction and operation of the Sabine Pass LNG terminal are subject to additional federal permits, orders, approvals and consultations required by other federal agencies, including the DOE, Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (&#8220;USACE&#8221;), U.S. Department of Commerce, National Marine Fisheries Services, U.S. Department of the Interior, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Environmental Protection Agency (the &#8220;EPA&#8221;) and U.S. Department of Homeland Security. 

Three significant permits are the USACE Section 404 of the Clean Water Act/Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act Permit (the &#8220;Section 10/404 Permit&#8221;), the Clean Air Act Title V (&#8220;Title V&#8221;) Operating Permit and the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (&#8220;PSD&#8221;) Permit, the latter two permits being issued by the LDEQ . 

The application for revision of the Sabine Pass LNG terminal&#8217;s Section 10/404 Permit to authorize construction of Train 1 through Train 4 was submitted in January 2011. The process included a public comment period which commenced in March 2011 and closed in April 2011. The revised Section 10/404 Permit was received from the USACE in March 2012. An application for a further revision to the Section 10/404 Permit, to address wetlands impacted by the construction of Trains 5 and 6, was received from the USACE in June 2015. The USACE acted in the capacity as a cooperating agency in the FERC&#8217;s NEPA review process. In addition, a Section 10/404 permit application is pending with respect to the expansion of the Creole Trail Pipeline . These permits will require us to provide mitigation to compensate for the wetlands impacted by the respective projects. The application to amend the Sabine Pass LNG terminal&#8217;s existing Title V and PSD permits to authorize construction of Train 1 through Train 4 was initially submitted in December 2010 and revised in March 2011. The process included a public comment period from June 2011 to August 2011 and a public hearing in August 2011. The final revised Title V and PSD permits were issued by the LDEQ &#32;in December 2011. Although these permits are final, a petition with the EPA has been filed pursuant to the Clean Air Act requesting that the EPA object to the Title V permit. The EPA has not ruled on this petition. In June 2012, we applied to the LDEQ &#32;for a further amendment to the Title V and PSD permits to reflect proposed modifications to the Liquefaction Project &#32;that were filed with the FERC in October 2012. The LDEQ &#32;issued the amended PSD and Title V permits in March 2013. These permits are final. In September 2013, Cheniere Partners applied to the LDEQ &#32;for another amendment to its PSD and Title V permits seeking approval to, among other things, construct and operate Trains 5 and 6. The LDEQ issued the amended PSD and Title V permits in June 2015. These permits are final. 

CTPL was issued new Title V and PSD permits for the proposed modifications to the Creole Trail Pipeline &#32;system by the LDEQ &#32;in November 2013. 

In August 2014, the Sabine Pass LNG terminal&#8217;s existing wastewater discharge permit was modified by LDEQ &#32;to authorize the discharge of wastewaters from the liquefaction facilities, including wastewaters generated with respect to the anticipated operations of Trains 5 and 6. 

The Sabine Pass LNG terminal is subject to DOT safety regulations and standards for the transportation and storage of LNG and regulations of the U.S. Coast Guard relating to maritime safety and facility security. 

Commodity Futures Trading Commission (&#8220;CFTC&#8221;) 

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the &#8220;Dodd-Frank Act&#8221;) provides for federal regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market and entities, such as us, that participate in that market. The regulatory regime created by the Dodd-Frank Act is designed primarily to (1) regulate certain participants in the swaps markets, including entities falling within the categories of &#8220;Swap Dealer&#8221; and &#8220;Major Swap Participant,&#8221; (2) require clearing and exchange trading of certain classes of swaps as designated by the CFTC, (3) increase swap market transparency through robust reporting and recordkeeping requirements, (4) reduce financial risks in the derivatives market by imposing margin or collateral requirements on both cleared and, in certain cases, uncleared swaps, (5) establish position limits on certain swaps and futures products, and (6) otherwise enhance the rulemaking and enforcement authority of the CFTC and the SEC regarding the derivatives markets. As required by the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFTC, the SEC and other regulators have been promulgating rules and regulations implementing the regulatory provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, although neither the CFTC nor the SEC has yet adopted or implemented all of the rules required by the Dodd-Frank Act. In addition, the CFTC and its staff regularly issue rule amendments and guidance, policy statements and letters interpreting or taking no-action positions, including time-limited no action positions, regarding the derivatives provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and the rules of the CFTC under these provisions. 

A provision of the Dodd-Frank Act requires the CFTC, in order to diminish or prevent excessive speculation in commodity markets, to adopt rules imposing new position limits on futures contracts, options contracts and economically equivalent physical commodity swaps traded on registered swap trading platforms and on over-the-counter swaps that perform a significant price discovery function with respect to certain markets. In that regard, the CFTC has proposed position limits rules that would modify and expand the applicability of position limits on the amounts of certain core futures contracts and economically equivalent futures contracts, options contracts and swaps for or linked to certain physical commodities, including Henry Hub natural gas, that market participants may hold, subject to limited exemptions for certain bona fide hedging and other types of transactions. It is uncertain at this time when and in what form the CFTC&#8217;s proposed new position limits rules may become final and effective. 

Pursuant to rules adopted by the CFTC, six classes of over-the-counter (&#8220;OTC&#8221;) interest rate and credit default swaps must be cleared through a derivatives clearing organization and executed on an exchange or swap execution facility. The CFTC has not yet proposed to designate any other classes of swaps, including swaps relating to physical commodities, for mandatory clearing, but could do so in the future. Although we expect to qualify for the &#8220;end-user exception&#8221; from the mandatory clearing and exchange-trading requirements applicable to any swaps that we enter into to hedge our commercial risks, the mandatory clearing and exchange-trading requirements may apply to other market participants, including our counterparties (who may be registered as Swap Dealers), with respect to other swaps, and the application of such rules may change the cost and availability of the swaps that we use for hedging. 

As required by provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFTC and federal banking regulators have adopted rules to require Swap Dealers and Major Swap Participants, including those that are regulated financial institutions, to collect initial and variation margin with respect to uncleared swaps from their counterparties that are financial end users, registered swap dealers or major swap participants. These rules do not require collection of margin from commercial end users who qualify for the end user exception from the mandatory clearing requirement or certain other counterparties. We expect to qualify as such a commercial end user with respect to the swaps that we enter into to hedge our commercial risks. The Dodd-Frank Act&#8217;s swaps regulatory provisions and the related rules may also adversely affect our existing derivative contracts and restrict our ability to monetize such contracts, cause us to restructure certain contracts, reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against risks or to optimize assets, adversely affect our ability to execute our hedging strategies and impact the liquidity of certain swaps products, all of which could increase our business costs. 

Under the Commodity Exchange Act as amended by the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFTC is directed generally to prevent manipulation, including by fraudulent or deceptive practices, in two markets: (1) physical commodities traded in interstate commerce, including physical energy and other commodities, as well as (2) financial instruments, such as futures, options and swaps. Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFTC has adopted additional anti-manipulation and anti-disruptive trading practices regulations that prohibit, among other things, manipulative or deceptive schemes in the physical commodities, futures, options and swaps markets. Should we violate these laws and regulations, we could be subject to a CFTC enforcement action and material penalties, possibly resulting in changes in the rates we can charge. 

Environmental Regulation 

&#160; 

The Sabine Pass LNG terminal is subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and natural resources. These environmental laws and regulations may impose substantial penalties for noncompliance and substantial liabilities for pollution. Many of these laws and regulations restrict or prohibit the types, quantities and concentration of substances that can be released into the environment and can lead to substantial civil and criminal fines and penalties for non-compliance. 

&#160; 

Clean Air Act (&#8220;CAA&#8221;) 

&#160; 

The Sabine Pass LNG terminal is subject to the federal CAA and comparable state and local laws. We may be required to incur certain capital expenditures over the next several years for air pollution control equipment in connection with maintaining or obtaining permits and approvals addressing air emission-related issues. We do not believe, however, that our operations, or the construction and operation of our liquefaction facilities, will be materially and adversely affected by any such requirements. 

&#160; 

In &#32;2009, the EPA promulgated and finalized the Mandatory Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule for multiple sections of the economy. This rule requires mandatory reporting of greenhouse gas (&#8220;GHG&#8221;) emissions from stationary fuel combustion sources as well as all fugitive emissions throughout LNG terminals. From time to time, Congress has considered proposed legislation directed at reducing GHG emissions, and the EPA has defined GHG emissions thresholds for requiring certain permits for new and existing industrial sources. In addition, many states have already taken regulatory action to monitor and/or reduce emissions of GHGs, primarily through the development of GHG emission inventories or regional GHG cap and trade programs. It is not possible at this time to predict how future regulations or legislation may address GHG emissions and impact our business. However, future regulations and laws could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, operating results &#32;and cash flows. 

Coastal Zone Management Act (&#8220;CZMA&#8221;) 

&#160; 

The Sabine Pass LNG terminal is subject to the review and possible requirements of the CZMA throughout the construction of facilities located within the coastal zone. The CZMA is administered by the states (in Louisiana, by the Department of Natural Resources, and in Texas, by the General Land Office). This program is implemented to ensure that impacts to coastal areas are consistent with the intent of the CZMA to manage the coastal areas. 

Clean Water Act (&#8220;CWA&#8221;) 

&#160; 

The Sabine Pass LNG terminal is subject to the federal CWA and analogous state and local laws. The CWA imposes strict controls on the discharge of pollutants into the navigable waters of the United States, including discharges of wastewater and storm water runoff and fill/discharges into waters of the United States. Permits must be obtained prior to discharging pollutants into state and federal waters. The CWA is administered by the EPA, the USACE and by the states (in Louisiana, by the LDEQ ). 

&#160; 

Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (&#8220;RCRA&#8221;) 

&#160; 

The federal RCRA and comparable state statutes govern the disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. In the event such wastes are generated in connection with our facilities, we will be subject to regulatory requirements affecting the handling, transportation, treatment, storage and disposal of such wastes 

&#160; 

Endangered Species Act 

&#160; 

The Sabine Pass LNG terminal may &#32;be restricted by requirements under the Endangered Species Act, which seeks to protect endangered or threatened animal, fish and plant species and designated habitats. 

Market Factors and Competition 

SPLNG &#32;currently does not experience competition for its terminal capacity because the entire approximately 4.0 Bcf/d of regasification capacity that is available at the Sabine Pass LNG terminal has been fully contracted. If and when SPLNG &#32;has to replace any TUAs, it will compete with other then-existing LNG terminals for customers. 

The Liquefaction Project &#32;currently does not experience competition with respect to Trains 1 through 5. SPL &#32;has entered into six fixed price, 20-year SPA s with third parties that will utilize substantially all of the liquefaction capacity available from these Trains. Each customer will be required to pay an escalating fixed fee for its annual contract quantity even if it elects not to purchase any LNG from us. 

If and when SPL &#32;needs to replace any existing SPA &#32;or enter into new SPA s, SPL &#32;will compete on the basis of price per contracted volume of LNG with other natural gas liquefaction projects throughout the world. Cheniere is currently developing a natural gas liquefaction facility near Corpus Christi, Texas and has entered into eight fixed price, 20-year third-party SPA s for the sale of LNG from this natural gas liquefaction facility, and may continue to enter into commercial agreements with respect to this natural gas liquefaction facility that might otherwise have been entered into with respect to Train 6. Revenues associated with any incremental volumes of the Liquefaction Project, including those under the Cheniere Marketing SPA &#32;discussed above, will also be subject to market-based price competition. 

Our ability to enter into additional long-term SPAs to underpin the development of additional Trains, sell any quantities of LNG available under the SPA s with Cheniere Marketing, or develop new projects is subject to market factors, including changes in worldwide supply and demand for natural gas, LNG and substitute products, the relative prices for natural gas, crude oil and substitute products in North America and international markets, economic growth in developing countries, investment in energy infrastructure, the rate of fuel switching for power generation from coal, nuclear or oil to natural gas and access to capital markets. 

We expect that global demand for natural gas and LNG will continue to increase as nations seek more abundant, reliable and environmentally cleaner fuel alternatives to oil and coal. Global demand for natural gas is projected by the International Energy Agency to grow by approximately 23 Tcf between 2013 and 2025, with LNG increasing its current share of approximately ten percent of the global market. Wood Mackenzie forecasts that global demand for LNG will increase by 72%, from approximately 245 mtpa, or 11.9 Tcf, in 2015, to 421 mtpa, or 20.5 Tcf, in 2025 and that LNG production from existing facilities and new facilities already under construction will be able to supply the market with 365 mtpa in 2025, resulting in a market need for construction of additional facilities capable of producing an incremental 56 mtpa of LNG. We believe our new project that does not already have capacity sold under long-term contracts is competitive and well-positioned to capture a portion of this incremental market need. 

We have limited exposure, particularly in the LNG terminal business for our five Trains under construction, to the decline in oil prices, even if it persists for more than 12 months, as we have contracted a significant portion of our LNG production capacity under long-term sale and purchase agreements. These agreements contain fixed fees that are required to be paid even if the customers elect to cancel or suspend delivery of LNG cargoes. To date, we have contracted approximately 19.75 mtpa of aggregate production capacity for Trains 1 through 5 of the Liquefaction Project with third-party customers. Train 6 has not been contracted to date. As of January 31, 2016 , oil and gas futures prices indicate that LNG exported from the U.S. continues to be competitively priced, supporting the opportunity for U.S. LNG to fill uncontracted future demand through the execution of long-term, medium-term and short-term contracting of LNG from our terminal. 

Subsidiaries 

&#160; 

Our assets are generally held by or under our subsidiaries. We conduct most of our business through these subsidiaries, including the development, construction and operation of our LNG terminal business. 

Employees 

&#160; 

We have no employees. We rely on our general partner to manage all aspects of the development, construction, operation and maintenance of the Sabine Pass LNG terminal and the Liquefaction Project and to conduct our business. Because our general partner has no employees, it relies on subsidiaries of Cheniere to provide the personnel necessary to allow it to meet its management obligations to us, SPLNG, SPL and CTPL. As of January 31, 2016 , Cheniere and its subsidiaries had 888 &#32;full-time employees, including 488 &#32;employees who directly supported the Sabine Pass LNG terminal operations. See Note 11&#8212;Related Party Transactions &#32;of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the services agreements pursuant to which general and administrative services are provided to Cheniere Partners, SPLNG, SPL and CTPL.
