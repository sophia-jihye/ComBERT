&#160; 

General 

&#160; 

The Company is a leading provider of analytics and insights that facilitate measurement and improvement of the patient and employee experience while also increasing patient engagement and loyalty for healthcare providers, payers and other healthcare organizations. The Company&#8217;s solutions enable its clients to provide customer-centric healthcare through understanding the voice of the customer to improve patient experience, engagement and loyalty, while also facilitating regulatory compliance and the shift to population-based health management for its clients. The Company&#8217;s ability to measure what matters most and systematically capture, analyze and deliver to its clients self-reported information from patients, families and consumers is critical in today&#8217;s healthcare market. NRC believes that access to and analysis of its extensive consumer-driven information is becoming more valuable as healthcare providers increasingly need to more deeply understand and engage patients and consumers in an effort towards effective population-based health management. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s portfolio of subscription-based solutions provide actionable information and analysis to healthcare organizations and payers across a range of mission-critical, constituent-related elements, including patient experience and satisfaction, community population health risks, workforce engagement, community perceptions, and physician engagement. NRC partners with clients across the continuum of healthcare services. The Company&#8217;s clients range from acute care hospitals and post-acute providers, such as home health, long term care and hospice, to numerous payer organizations. The Company believes this cross-continuum positioning is a unique and an increasingly important capability as evolving payment models drive healthcare providers and payers towards a more collaborative and interactive healthcare system. 

&#160; 

NRC&#8217;s expertise includes the efficient capture, interpretation, transmittal and benchmarking of critical data elements from millions of healthcare consumers. Using its portfolio of solutions through internet-based business intelligence tools, the Company&#8217;s clients gain insights into best practices to drive improvements across key performance metrics. The Company&#8217;s clients are also able to access networking groups, on-line education and an extensive library of performance improvement material that can be tailored to each of their unique needs. 

&#160; 

NRC has achieved a market leadership position through its more than 34 years of industry innovation and experience, as well as its long-term, recurring revenue relationships (solutions that are used or required by a client each year) with many of the healthcare industry&#8217;s largest organizations. Since its founding in 1981, the Company has focused on meeting the evolving information needs of the healthcare industry through internal product development, as well as select acquisitions. The Company is a Wisconsin corporation headquartered in Lincoln, Nebraska. 

&#160; 

Industry and Market Opportunity 

&#160; 

According to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (&#8220;CMS&#8221;), health expenditures in the United States were approximately $3.0 trillion in 2014, or $9,523 per person. In total, health spending accounted for 17.5% of the nation&#8217;s Gross Domestic Product in 2014. Addressing this growing expenditure burden continues to be a major policy priority at both federal and state levels. In addition, continued unemployed and underemployed rates and lower incomes for many Americans coupled with increased co-pays and deductibles in healthcare plans have focused even more consumer attention on health spending and affordability. In the public sector, Medicare provides health coverage for individuals aged 65 and older, while Medicaid provides coverage for low income families and other individuals in need. Both programs are administered by the CMS. With the aging of the U.S. population, Medicare enrollment has increased significantly. In addition, longer life spans and greater prevalence of chronic illnesses among both the Medicare and Medicaid populations have placed tremendous demands on the health care system. 

&#160; 

Driven by escalating costs and a growing recognition of the challenges of chronic care and unnecessary hospitalizations, Medicare reimbursement for healthcare providers is shifting from a volume-based approach (fees paid for each element of service rendered, independent of outcome) to a more value-based model, where reimbursement is based on the value (or quality) of the healthcare service delivered. The establishment of standardized quality-focused datasets and the requirement that providers capture and transmit this data to CMS has enabled this shift. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

An increasing percentage of Medicare reimbursement and, in all likelihood, reimbursement from commercial payers as well will be at risk for hospitals, based on factors such as patient readmission rates and provider adherence to certain quality-related protocols. At the same time, many hospitals and other providers are creating new models of care delivery and reimbursement to reduce cost and enable more effective delivery of care. These new models are based on sharing financial risk and managing the health and behaviors of large populations of patients and consumers. Certain of these new models are known as accountable care organizations, or ACOs, and medical homes, in which multiple provider organizations are coordinated in providing care and bearing shared financial risk in serving a defined patient population. This transformation towards population-based health management, value-based purchasing, and an increased engagement of healthcare consumers is resulting in a greater need for providers to deliver more customer-centric healthcare. 

&#160; 

NRC believes that its current portfolio of solutions is aligned to address this evolving market opportunity. The Company provides tools and solutions to capture, interpret and improve the data required by CMS as well as enhanced capabilities that capture insights about patient health risks, behaviors and perspectives. The information and analytics provided through these solutions enable payers and providers to better tailor offerings to the populations they serve. Meanwhile, the Company&#8217;s portfolio of engagement solutions helps providers address and impact the types of behaviors that could result in reduced hospital re-admission rates, resulting in a direct and measurable impact on providers&#8217; revenue. 

&#160; 

Finally, the Company believes that its ability to offer these insights across the entire care continuum is particularly relevant as new reimbursement models force collaboration amongst different types of providers. Bundled payments, medical home, ACOs and other models of reimbursement for population-based health management all require an understanding of healthcare both within and outside of the traditional acute care setting. 

&#160; 

NRC&#8217;s Solutions 

&#160; 

NRC&#8217;s portfolio of solutions address specific market needs around growth, engagement, informing and thought leadership for healthcare providers, payers and other healthcare organizations. While each distinct solution provides discernible value on a stand-alone basis, the Company believes that in combination, its solutions provide a comprehensive view of healthcare consumers both within healthcare settings and outside of those settings&#8212;creating a differentiated solution set to address the emerging needs for population-based health management. 

&#160; 

Growth Solutions - NRC&#8217;s growth solutions are subscription-based services that include measurement of community perception (Market Insights), brand tracking (BrandArc), advertising testing (AdVoice) and custom consumer research (Research Bureau). Market Insights is the largest online U.S. healthcare survey, measuring the opinions and behaviors of 270,000 healthcare consumers in the top 250 markets across the country annually. Market Insights is a syndicated survey that provides clients with an independent third-party source of information that is used to understand consumer preferences and optimize marketing strategies. BrandArc is a solution that enables clients to measure brand value and build brand equity in their markets. AdVoice is a solution that helps NRC&#8217;s clients evaluate and optimize advertising efficiency and consumer recall. The Research Bureau solution enables clients to conduct custom research to obtain real time voice of the customer feedback to support branding and loyalty initiatives. The Company&#8217;s growth solutions were historically marketed under the Healthcare Market Guide and Ticker brands. 

&#160; 

Engagement Solutions - NRC&#8217;s engagement solutions include patient and resident experience, physician engagement and employee experience measurement and improvement tools. These solutions enable clients to comply with regulatory requirements and to improve their reimbursement under value-based purchasing models. Additionally, clients use these applications to positively impact patient experience through utilization of the Company&#8217;s prescriptive analytics to enable improvement planning and implementation of best practices. Finally, with a growing body of research linking employee and physician satisfaction levels to provide quality and patient experience, NRC&#8217;s engagement solutions also measure satisfaction from those constituents and integrate that data into prescriptive analytics for improvement. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s engagement solutions are marketed under the NRC Picker, My InnerView (&#8220;MIV&#8221;), Connect Transitions and NRC Canada brands and are provided on a subscription basis via a cross-continuum platform that collects and measures data and then delivers business intelligence that the Company&#8217;s clients utilize to improve experience, engagement and loyalty. Patient data can be collected on a longitudinal basis for improvement and regulatory compliance purposes as well as on a real time basis to support rapid cycle improvement and engagement activities. NRC provides these performance results and prescriptive analytics to its clients via web-based improvement planning and business intelligence portals. 

&#160; 

NRC&#8217;s patient outreach and discharge call solutions are provided to healthcare organizations on a subscription basis under the Connect Transitions brand. Through preference-based communications and real-time alerts, these solutions enable organizations to identify and manage high risk patients to reduce readmissions, increase patient satisfaction and support safe care transitions. 

&#160; 

The Connect Transitions solution is provided by Customer-Connect LLC (doing business as Connect). Connect was formed in June 2013 to develop and provide patient outreach and discharge call solutions. NRC originally had a 49% ownership interest in Connect but increased that ownership interest to 89% in July 2015. The remaining 11% of Connect is held by Illuminate Health, LLC. 

&#160; 

Informing Solutions - NRC&#8217;s informing solutions include its health risk assessments (Payer Solutions) and reputation management and monitoring (Reputation) solution. Payer Solutions enable the Company&#8217;s clients to understand the health risks associated with populations of patients, analyze and address readmission risks and efficiently reach out to patients to impact their behaviors outside of the healthcare provider settings. These health risk assessment solutions enable its clients to effectively stratify and manage care for those who are most at-risk, engage individuals, increase preventative care and manage wellness programs to improve patient experience and outcomes. The Reputation offering provides a five star rating metric and patient comments derived from actual patient survey data to complement online physician information and, in turn, drive new patient acquisition and grow online physician reputation. This offering also includes a reputation monitoring capability that clients utilize to scan social media content for positive and negative comments that impact physician reputation. 

&#160; 

Thought Leadership Solutions &#8211; NRC&#8217;s thought leadership solutions include national conferences, publications and an on-line portal, and are integrated at various levels into NRC&#8217;s growth, engagement and informing solutions. NRC also offers a specific thought leadership service branded as The Governance Institute (&#8220;TGI&#8221;). TGI is a membership organization that offers subscription-based governance information solutions and educational conferences designed to improve the effectiveness of hospital and healthcare systems by continually strengthening their boards, medical leadership, management performance and transparency positioning. TGI conducts conferences, produces publications, videos, white papers and research studies, and tracks industry trends showcasing emerging healthcare trends and best practice solutions of healthcare boards across the country.

&#160; 

NRC&#8217;s Competitive Strengths 

&#160; 

The Company believes that its competitive strengths include the following: 

&#160; 

A leading provider of patient experience solutions for healthcare providers, payers and other healthcare organizations . The Company&#8217;s history is based on capturing the voice of the consumer in healthcare markets. With survey solutions that span the healthcare continuum, in 2015, 2014 and 2013 the Company was recognized by Modern Healthcare as one of the nation&#8217;s largest patient experience survey providers . Its solutions build on the &#8220;Eight Dimensions of Patient-Centered Care,&#8221; a philosophy developed by noted patient advocate Harvey Picker, who believed patients&#8217; experiences are integral to quality healthcare. NRC has extended this philosophy to include families, caregivers, employees and other stakeholders. 

&#160; 

Premier client portfolio across the care continuum. NRC&#8217;s client portfolio encompasses leading healthcare organizations across the healthcare continuum, from acute care hospitals and post-acute providers to healthcare payers. The Company&#8217;s client base is diverse, with its top ten clients representing approximately 15% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 and no single client representing more than 5% of the Company&#8217;s revenue. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Highly scalable and visible revenue model . The Company&#8217;s solutions are offered to healthcare providers, payers and other healthcare organizations primarily through subscription-based service agreements. The solutions NRC provides are also recurring in nature, which enables an ongoing relationship with its clients. This combination of subscription-based revenue, a base of ongoing client renewals and automated platforms creates a highly visible and scalable revenue model for the Company. 

&#160; 

Comprehensive portfolio of solutions . Since NRC offers solutions encompassing growth, engagement, informing and thought leadership, its clients can engage with the Company at multiple levels and, over time, increase their commitment and spend. 

&#160; 

Exclusive focus on healthcare. The Company focuses exclusively on healthcare and serving the unique needs of healthcare organizations across the continuum, which NRC believes gives it a distinct competitive advantage compared to other survey and analytics software providers. The Company&#8217;s platform includes features and capabilities built specifically for healthcare providers, including a library of performance improvement content which can be tailored to the provider based on their specific customer feedback profile. 

&#160; 

Experienced senior management team led by NRC&#8217;s founder. NRC&#8217;s senior management team has extensive industry and leadership experience. Michael D. Hays, the Company&#8217;s Chief Executive Officer, founded NRC in 1981 . Prior to launching the Company, Mr. Hays served as Vice President and as a Director of SRI Research Center, Inc. (now known as the Gallup Organization). The Chief Financial Officer, Kevin Karas, CPA, has extensive financial experience having served as CFO at two previous companies, along with healthcare experience at Rehab Designs of America, Inc. and NovaCare, Inc. Steven D. Jackson, the Company&#8217;s President, served as Chief Strategy Officer for Vocera Communications, and he also served as Chief Operating Officer for ExperiaHealth. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

The healthcare information and market research services industry is highly competitive. The Company has traditionally competed with healthcare organizations&#8217; internal marketing, market research and/or quality improvement departments which create their own performance measurement tools, and with relatively small specialty research firms which provide survey-based healthcare market research and/or performance assessment. The Company&#8217;s primary competitors among such specialty firms include Press Ganey, which has significantly higher annual revenue than the Company, and three or four other firms that NRC believes have less annual revenue than the Company. The Company, to a certain degree, currently competes with, and anticipates that in the future it may increasingly compete with, (1) traditional market research firms which are significant providers of survey-based, general market research and (2) firms which provide services or products that complement healthcare performance assessments such as healthcare software or information systems. Although only a few of these competitors have offered specific services that compete directly with the Company&#8217;s solutions, many of these competitors have substantially greater financial, information gathering, and marketing resources than the Company and could decide to increase their resource commitments to the Company&#8217;s market. There are relatively few barriers to entry into the Company&#8217;s market, and the Company expects increased competition in its market which could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s operating results through pricing pressure, increased marketing expenditures, and market share losses, among other factors. There can be no assurance that the Company will continue to compete successfully against existing or new competitors. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

The Company believes the primary competitive factors within its market include quality of service, timeliness of delivery, unique service capabilities, credibility of provider, industry experience, and price. NRC believes that its industry leadership position, exclusive focus on the healthcare industry, cross-continuum presence, comprehensive portfolio of solutions and relationships with leading healthcare payers and providers position the Company to compete in this market. 

&#160; 

Growth Strategy 

&#160; 

NRC believes that the value proposition of its current solutions, combined with the favorable alignment of its solutions with emerging market demand, positions the Company to benefit from multiple growth opportunities. The Company believes that it can accelerate its growth through (1) increasing sales of its existing solutions to its existing clients (or cross-selling), (2) winning additional new clients through market share growth in existing market segments, (3) developing and introducing new solutions to new and existing clients, and (4) pursuing acquisitions of, or investments in, firms providing products, solutions or technologies which complement those of the Company. 

&#160; 

Selling additional solutions to existing clients . Less than 15% of the Company&#8217;s existing clients purchase more than one of its solutions. NRC&#8217;s sales organization actively identifies and pursues these cross-sell opportunities in order to accelerate the growth of the Company. 

&#160; 

Adding new clients. NRC believes that there is an opportunity to add new clients in each of the acute care, post-acute care and health plan market segments. The Company&#8217;s sales organization is actively identifying and engaging new client prospects in each of the segments noted above, with a focus on featuring its comprehensive cross continuum portfolio of solutions. 

&#160; 

Adding new solutions. The need for growth, engagement and informing solutions in the market segments that NRC serves is evolving to align with emerging healthcare regulatory and reimbursement trends. The evolving market creates an opportunity for the Company to introduce new solutions that leverage its existing core competencies. The Company believes that there is an opportunity to drive sales growth with both existing and new clients, across all of the market segments that it serves, through the introduction of new solutions. 

&#160; 

Pursue Strategic Acquisitions. The Company has historically complemented its organic growth with strategic acquisitions, having completed seven such transactions over the past fifteen years. These transactions have added new capabilities and access to market segments that are adjacent and complementary to the Company&#8217;s existing solutions and market segments. NRC believes that additional strategic acquisition opportunities exist for the Company to complement its organic growth by further expanding its service capabilities, technology offerings and end markets. 

&#160; 

Sales and Marketing 

&#160; 

The Company generates the majority of its revenue from the renewal of subscription-based client service agreements, supplemented by sales of other solutions to existing clients and the addition of new clients. NRC sales activities are carried out by a direct sales organization staffed with professional, trained sales associates. As compared to the typical industry practice of compensating sales associates with relatively high base pay and a relatively small sales commission, NRC compensates its sales staff with relatively low base pay and a relatively high commission component. The Company believes this compensation structure provides incentives to its sales associates to surpass sales goals and increases the Company&#8217;s ability to attract top-quality sales associates. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

In addition to prospect leads generated by direct sales associates, the Company&#8217;s integrated marketing activities facilitate its ongoing receipt of prospect request-for-proposals. NRC uses lead generation mechanisms to add generated leads to its database of current and potential client contacts. The Company also maintains an active public relations program which includes (1) an ongoing presence in leading industry trade press and in the mainstream press, (2) public speaking at strategic industry conferences, (3) fostering relationships with key industry constituencies, and (4) the annual Consumer Choice Award program recognizing top-ranking healthcare organizations. 

&#160; 

Clients 

&#160; 

NRC&#8217;s clients include many of the nation&#8217;s largest healthcare systems. The Company provides solutions to over 57 payer health plans and over 7,200 acute and post-acute facilities. 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s ten largest clients accounted for 15%, 16%, and 19% of the Company&#8217;s total revenue in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Approximately 5% of the Company&#8217;s revenue was derived from foreign customers in 2015 and 7% in 2014 and 2013. 

&#160; 

For financial information by geographic area, see Note 14 to the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements. 

&#160; 

Intellectual Property and Other Proprietary Rights 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s success depends in part upon its data collection processes, research methods, data analysis techniques and internal systems, and procedures that it has developed specifically to serve clients in the healthcare industry. The Company has no patents. Consequently, it relies on a combination of copyright and trade secret laws and associate nondisclosure agreements to protect its systems, survey instruments and procedures. There can be no assurance that the steps taken by the Company to protect its rights will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of such rights or that third parties will not independently develop functionally equivalent or superior systems or procedures. The Company believes that its systems and procedures and other proprietary rights do not infringe upon the proprietary rights of third parties. There can be no assurance, however, that third parties will not assert infringement claims against the Company in the future or that any such claims will not result in protracted and costly litigation, regardless of the merits of such claims or whether the Company is ultimately successful in defending against such claims. 

&#160; 

Associates 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, the Company employed a total of 347 persons on a full-time basis. In addition, as of such date, the Company had 28 part-time associates primarily in its survey operations, representing approximately 14 full-time equivalent associates. None of the Company&#8217;s associates are represented by a collective bargaining unit. The Company considers its relationship with its associates to be good. 

&#160;
