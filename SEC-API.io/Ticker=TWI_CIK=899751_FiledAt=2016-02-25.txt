History 

The Company traces its roots to the Electric Wheel Company in Quincy, Illinois, which was founded in 1890. Titan was incorporated in 1983. The Company has grown through six major acquisitions in recent years. In 2005, Titan Tire Corporation, a subsidiary of the Company, acquired The Goodyear Tire &#38; Rubber Company&#8217;s North American farm tire assets. In 2006, Titan Tire Corporation of Bryan, a subsidiary of the Company, acquired the off-the-road (OTR) tire assets of Continental Tire North America, Inc. In 2011, the Company acquired The Goodyear Tire &#38; Rubber Company's Latin American farm tire business. In August 2012, the Company purchased a 56% controlling interest in Planet Corporation Group, now known as Titan National (Australia) Holdings PTY LTD (TNAH). In October 2012, the Company completed its acquisition of Titan Europe. In October 2013, the Company in partnership with One Equity Partners (OEP) and the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) closed the acquisition of an 85% interest in Voltyre-Prom, a leading producer of agricultural and industrial tires in Volgograd, Russia. In the first half of 2014, the partnership of Titan, OEP, and RDIF purchased an additional 15% to bring the total Voltyre-Prom ownership to 100% for the partnership. These acquisitions have allowed Titan to expand its global footprint and enhance product offering in the Company&#8217;s target markets. 

&#8226; 

Market Segments 

In 2015, Titan&#8217;s agricultural segment sales represented 52% &#32;of net sales, the earthmoving/construction segment represented 36% &#32;and the consumer segment represented 12% &#32;of net sales. 

&#160; 

COMPETITIVE STRENGTHS 

Titan&#8217;s strong market position in the off-highway wheel, tire and undercarriage market, and its long-term core customer relationships contribute to the Company&#8217;s competitive strengths. Titan produces both wheels and tires which uniquely allows the Company to provide a one-stop solution for its customers' wheel and tire assembly needs. These strengths, along with Titan&#8217;s dedication to the off-highway equipment market, continue to drive the Company forward. 

&#8226; 

Strong Market Position 

Titan&#8217;s ability to offer a broad range of specialized wheels, tires, assemblies and undercarriage systems and components has resulted in the Company&#8217;s strong position in the global off-highway market. Through a diverse dealer network, the Company is able to reach an increasing number of customers in the aftermarket and build Titan&#8217;s image and brand recognition. The Company&#8217;s acquisition of the Goodyear Farm Tire brand in North America and Latin America contributes to overall visibility and customer confidence. Titan gained a strong presence in Europe and other parts of the world through the 2012 acquisition of Titan Europe. The 2013 acquisition of Voltyre-Prom expanded Titan's footprint into the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) region. Years of product design and engineering experience have enabled Titan to improve existing products and develop new ones that have been well received in the marketplace. In addition, Titan believes it has benefited from significant barriers to entry, such as the substantial investment necessary to replicate the Company&#8217;s manufacturing equipment and numerous tools, dies and molds, many of which are used in custom processes.

&#8226; 

Wheel and Tire Manufacturing Capabilities 

The Company&#8217;s unique position as a manufacturer of both wheels and tires allows Titan to mount and deliver one of the largest selections of off-highway assemblies in North America. Titan offers this value-added service of one-stop shopping for wheel and tire assemblies for the agricultural, earthmoving/construction and consumer segments. Both standard and Low Sidewall (LSW) assemblies are delivered as a single, complete unit based on each customer&#8217;s unique requirements. 

&#8226; 

Long-Term Core Customer Relationships 

The Company&#8217;s top customers, including global leaders in agricultural and construction equipment manufacturing, have been purchasing products from Titan or its predecessors for numerous years. Customers including AGCO Corporation, Caterpillar Inc., CNH Global N.V., Deere &#38; Company and Kubota Corporation have helped sustain Titan&#8217;s leadership in wheel, tire and assembly innovation. 

BUSINESS STRATEGY 

Titan&#8217;s business strategy is to increase its presence in the segments it serves through its one-stop assembly solutions, including LSW technology. The Company continues to seek global expansion of this complete wheel and tire assembly product offering within the geographies it competes. This may be through strategic worldwide acquisitions or through expanded manufacturing capabilities in regions where the Company lacks either the wheel or the tire production. In addition, Titan continually seeks to improve operating efficiencies and gain additional synergies from more recent acquisitions. 

&#8226; 

Low Sidewall (LSW) Technology 

The Company has developed a LSW tire technology, featuring a larger rim diameter and a smaller sidewall than standard tires. As a cornerstone of the Company's strategy, Titan continues to expand the LSW product offering in both the agricultural and construction segments. Titan&#8217;s unique capabilities as both a wheel and tire manufacturer allow the Company to drive further adoption within these markets. Titan seeks to be at the forefront of off-road equipment advancement through the innovation of its LSW solution with the belief that it will become the industry standard. 

The Company follows an adoption strategy whereby LSW assemblies are placed with certain end users in order to demonstrate the superior performance of this innovative solution. With LSW, these end users experience reduced power hop, road lope, soil compaction, and fuel consumption as well as improved safety and performance. Both power hop and road lope can disturb ride and impede equipment performance. Low sidewall technology has been widely adopted within the automotive industry for many years. The benefits translate to Titan's markets through superior comfort, ride and fuel economy. 

&#8226; 

OTR and Earthmoving Product 

The Company&#8217;s 2006 acquisition of the OTR tire assets of Continental Tire North America, Inc. in Bryan, Ohio, expanded Titan&#8217;s product offering into larger earthmoving, construction and mining tires. In 2008, the Company expanded the Bryan facility production capacity to include giant mining tires. The mining tire market is expected to offer long-term opportunities. 

&#8226; 

Increase Aftermarket Tire Business 

The Company has concentrated on increasing its presence in the tire aftermarket, which historically has tended to be somewhat less cyclical than the OEM market. The aftermarket also offers the potential for higher profit margins and is a larger market in most cases. 

&#8226; 

Improve Operating Efficiencies 

The Company constantly works to improve the operating efficiency of its assets and manufacturing facilities. Titan integrates each facility&#8217;s strengths, which may include transferring equipment and business to the facilities that are best equipped to handle the work. This provides capability to increase utilization and spread operating costs over a greater volume of products. Titan is also continuing a comprehensive program to refurbish, modernize and enhance the technology of its equipment. 

&#32;4 

&#8226; 

Enhance Design Capacity and New Product Development 

Equipment manufacturers constantly face changing industry dynamics. Titan directs its business and marketing strategy to understand and address the needs of its customers and demonstrate the advantages of its products. In particular, the Company often collaborates with customers in the design of new and enhanced products. Titan recommends modified products to its customers based on its own market information. These value-added services enhance Titan&#8217;s relationships with its customers. The Company tests new designs and technologies and develops methods of manufacturing to improve product quality and performance. Titan&#8217;s engineers have introduced designs for giant mining wheels and tires, which employ an innovative steel radial construction technology. Titan has also developed a Low Sidewall (LSW) tire technology, featuring a larger rim diameter and smaller sidewall than standard tires, which helps reduce power hop, road lope, soil compaction, and provides improved safety and performance. 

&#8226; 

Explore Additional Strategic Acquisitions 

The Company&#8217;s expertise in the manufacture of off-highway wheels, tires and undercarriage systems and components has permitted it to take advantage of opportunities to acquire businesses that complement this product line. In the future, Titan may make additional strategic acquisitions of businesses that have an off-highway focus. The Company continually explores worldwide opportunities to expand manufacturing and distribution in order to serve new and existing geographies.

OPERATIONS 

Titan&#8217;s operations include manufacturing wheels, manufacturing tires, combining these wheels and tires into assemblies, and manufacturing undercarriage systems and components for use in the agricultural, earthmoving/construction and consumer markets. These operations entail many manufacturing processes in order to complete the finished products. 

&#8226; 

Wheel Manufacturing Process 

Most agricultural wheels are produced using a rim and a center disc. A rim is produced by first cutting large steel sheets to required width and length specifications. These steel sections are rolled and welded to form a circular rim, which is flared and formed in the rollform operation. The majority of discs are manufactured using presses that both blank and form the center to specifications in multiple stage operations. The Company e-coats wheels using a multi-step process prior to the final paint top coating. 

&#160; 

Large earthmoving/construction steel wheels are manufactured from hot and cold-rolled steel sections. Hot-rolled sections are generally used to increase cross section thickness in high stress areas of large diameter wheels. A special cold forming process for certain wheels is used to increase cross section thickness while reducing the number of wheel components. Rims are built from a series of hoops that are welded together to form a rim base. The complete rim base is made from either three or five separate parts that lock together after the rubber tire has been fitted to the wheel and inflated. 

&#160; 

For most wheels in our consumer segment, the Company manufactures rims and center discs from steel sheets. Rims are rolled and welded, and discs are stamped and formed from the sheets. The manufacturing process then entails welding the rims to the centers and painting the assembled product. 

&#8226; 

Tire Manufacturing Process 

The first stage in tire production is the mixing of rubber, carbon black and chemicals to form various rubber compounds. These rubber compounds are then extruded and processed with textile or steel materials to make specific components. These components &#8211; beads (wire bundles that anchor the tire with the wheel), plies (layers of fabric that give the tire strength), belts (fabric or steel fabric wrapped under the tread in some tires), tread and sidewall &#8211; are then assembled into an uncured tire carcass. The uncured carcass is placed into a press that molds and vulcanizes the carcass under set time, temperature and pressure into a finished tire. 

&#8226; 

Wheel and Tire Assemblies 

The Company&#8217;s position as a manufacturer of both wheels and tires allows Titan to mount and deliver one of the largest selections of off-highway assemblies in North America. Titan offers this value-added service of one-stop shopping for wheel and tire assemblies for the agricultural, earthmoving/construction and consumer segments. Both standard and LSW assemblies are delivered as a single, complete unit based on each customer&#8217;s unique requirements. 

&#8226; 

Undercarriage Manufacturing Process 

The undercarriage components (track groups, track and carrier rollers, idler assemblies and sprockets) are all manufactured from steel and produced according to specifications. 

All of the track groups produced by the Company are built from four major parts: shoes, right and left hand links, pins and bushings. Shoes are manufactured from steel cast in the Company foundry or obtained from different shapes of hot rolled profiles (depending on application), sheared to length, and then heat treated for high wear bending and breaking resistance. Right and left hand links are hot forged, trimmed, mass heat treated, machined and finally induction hardened on rail surface for optimal wear and fatigue resistance. Pins are made from round bars that are cut, machined, heat treated and surface finished. Bushings are generally cold extruded, machined, mass heat treated, and finally carburized or induction hardened for wear resistance and optimal toughness. 

&#32;6 

The lifetime lubricated and maintenance free track and carrier rollers are assembled with two major components: single or double flange roller shells (typically hot forged in halves, deep hardened, friction or arc welded and finish machined with metallurgical characteristics depending upon size and application) and shafts (generally cut from bars or forged, mass heat treated, rough machined, induction hardened and ground). 

The idler assemblies are also lifetime lubricated, for virtually no maintenance. They are offered with cast (single web or hollow design) or fabricated shells, depending on size and application, and feature induction hardened tread surfaces for optimal wear resistance. 

The sprockets, designed to transfer the machine driving loads from the final drive to the track, are produced cast or forged in several geometric options, depending upon size and application. They are also heat treated for wear resistance and cracking resistance. 

The undercarriage systems, custom designed and produced by the Company, consist of a structured steel fabricated frame, all the undercarriage components mentioned above (track groups, track and carrier rollers, idler assemblies and sprockets) and a final drive. They are completely assembled in house, for consistent quality. 

&#8226; 

Quality Control 

The Company is ISO certified at all five main domestic manufacturing facilities located in Bryan, Ohio; Des Moines, Iowa; Freeport, Illinois; Quincy, Illinois; and Saltville, Virginia, as well as the majority of the foreign manufacturing facilities. The ISO series is a set of related and internationally recognized standards of management and quality assurance. The standards specify guidelines for establishing, documenting and maintaining a system to ensure quality. The ISO certifications are a testament to Titan&#8217;s dedication to providing quality products for its customers. 

RAW MATERIALS 

Steel and rubber are the primary raw materials used by the Company in all segments. To ensure a consistent steel supply, Titan purchases raw steel from key steel mills and maintains relationships with steel processors for steel preparation. The Company is not dependent on any single producer for its steel supply; however, some components do have limited suppliers. Rubber and other raw materials for tire manufacture represent some of the Company&#8217;s largest commodity expenses. Titan buys rubber in markets where there are usually several sources of supply. In addition to the development of key domestic suppliers, the Company&#8217;s strategic procurement plan includes international steel and rubber suppliers to assure competitive price and quality in the global marketplace. As is customary in the industry, the Company does not have long-term contracts for the purchase of steel or rubber and, therefore, purchases are subject to price fluctuations. Titan has developed a procurement strategy and practice that will mitigate price risk and lower cost. 

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES 

Capital expenditures for 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 &#32;were $48.4 million , $58.4 million &#32;and $80.1 million , respectively. The capital expenditures in each year were used primarily for expanding capabilities, updating manufacturing equipment, and for further automation at the Company&#8217;s facilities. These capital expenditures are anticipated to be used to primarily enhance the Company&#8217;s existing facilities and manufacturing capabilities, and drive productivity gains. 

PATENTS, TRADEMARKS AND ROYALTIES 

The Company owns various patents and trademarks and continues to apply for patent protection for new products. Due to the difficult nature of predicting the interpretation of patent laws, the Company cannot anticipate or predict any material adverse effect on its operations, cash flows or financial condition as a result of associated liabilities created under such patent interpretations should the Company be unable to protect its patents or found to be infringing others' patents. 

The Company has trademark license agreements with The Goodyear Tire &#38; Rubber Company to manufacture and sell certain farm tires under the Goodyear name. These agreements cover sales in North America, Latin America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Russia and other Commonwealth of Independent States countries. The North American and Latin American farm tire royalties were prepaid through March 2018 as a part of the 2011 Goodyear Latin American farm tire acquisition. The Company also has a trademark license agreement with Goodyear to manufacture and sell certain non-farm tire products in Latin America. 

MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION 

The Company employs an internal sales force and utilizes several manufacturing representative firms for sales in North America, Europe, Latin America, the CIS region, and other worldwide locations. Sales representatives are primarily organized within geographic regions. 

&#32;7 

Titan distributes wheels, tires, assemblies, and undercarriage systems directly to OEMs. The distribution of aftermarket tires occurs primarily through a network of independent and OEM-affiliated dealers. The Company distributes wheels, tires, wheel and tire assemblies, and undercarriage systems directly to OEMs and aftermarket customers through its distribution network consisting of facilities worldwide. 

SEASONALITY 

Agricultural equipment sales are seasonal by nature. Farmers generally order equipment to be delivered before the growing season. Shipments to OEMs in the U.S. and Europe usually peak during the Company&#8217;s first and second quarters for the spring planting period, while shipments in Latin America usually peak during the Company's second and third quarter for the fall planting period. Earthmoving/construction and consumer segments also historically tend to experience higher demand in the first and second quarters. These segments are affected by mining, building and economic conditions. 

RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND ENGINEERING 

The Company&#8217;s research, development and engineering staff tests original designs and technologies and develops new manufacturing methods to improve product performance. These services enhance the Company&#8217;s relationships with its customers. Titan's unique advantage as both a wheel and tire manufacturer allow the Company to design, test, and bring to market innovative solutions to meet the specific needs of its customers. Titan has also developed a Low Sidewall (LSW) tire technology, featuring a larger rim diameter and a smaller sidewall than standard tires, which helps reduce power hop, road lope, soil compaction, and provides improved safety and performance. Research and development (R&#38;D) expenses are expensed as incurred. R&#38;D costs were $11.2 million , $14.0 million &#32;and $11.2 million &#32;for the years ending December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively. 

CUSTOMERS 

Titan&#8217;s 10 largest customers accounted for 31% &#32;of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2015 , and 41% &#32;for the year ended December 31, 2014 . Net sales to Deere &#38; Company in Titan&#8217;s agricultural, earthmoving/construction and consumer segments combined represented 10% &#32;and 12% &#32;of the Company&#8217;s consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company&#8217;s net sales in 2015 &#32;or 2014 . Management believes the Company is not totally dependent on any single customer; however, certain products are dependent on a few customers. While the loss of any substantial customer could impact Titan&#8217;s business, the Company believes that its diverse product mix and customer base may minimize a longer-term impact caused by any such loss. 

ORDER BACKLOG 

As of January 31, 2016 , Titan estimates $284 million &#32;in open orders compared to $371 million &#32;at January 31, 2015 , for the Company&#8217;s operations. The January 31, 2016 &#32;open order amount included $126 million &#32;in the agricultural segment, $147 million &#32;in the earthmoving/construction segment, and $11 million &#32;in the consumer segment. The January 31, 2015 &#32;open order amount included $160 million &#32;in the agricultural segment, $189 million &#32;in the earthmoving/construction segment, and $22 million &#32;in the consumer segment. The Company believes that current open orders will be filled during the current year. The Company's backlog of open orders is not considered material to, or a significant factor in, evaluating and understanding any of its business segments or its businesses considered as a whole. 

INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS 

In April of 2011, the Company closed on the acquisition of The Goodyear Tire &#38; Rubber Company's Latin American farm tire business. As a result of this transaction, the Company operates a manufacturing facility in Sao Paulo, Brazil. The Latin American operations recorded 12% &#32;and 16% &#32;of the Company's sales for the years ended December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively. 

In October of 2012, the Company closed on the acquisition of Titan Europe and, as a result, expanded its global footprint. The Titan Europe operations accounted for 31% &#32;and 27% &#32;of the Company's sales for the years ended December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively. 

In October 2013, the Company closed on the acquisition of Voltyre-Prom. As a result of this transaction, the Company operates a manufacturing facility in Volgograd, Russia, expanding its presence to the CIS region. The Voltyre-Prom operations accounted for 5% &#32;of the Company's sales for both of the years ended December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 . 

&#32;8 

EMPLOYEES 

At December 31, 2015 , the Company employed approximately 6,000 people worldwide, including approximately 4,000 located outside the United States. 

The collective bargaining agreements at the Company's Bryan, Ohio; Freeport, Illinois; and Des Moines, Iowa facilities, which account for approximately 43% &#32;of the Company&#8217;s U.S. employees, expire in March 2017. 

Outside the United States, the Company enters into employment contracts and agreements in those countries in which such relationships are mandatory or customary. The provisions of these agreements correspond in each case with the required or customary terms in the subject jurisdiction. 

ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS 

In the ordinary course of business, like other industrial companies, Titan is subject to extensive and evolving federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, and has made provisions for the estimated financial impact of environmental cleanup. The Company&#8217;s policy is to accrue environmental cleanup-related costs of a non-capital nature when those costs are believed to be probable and can be reasonably estimated. Expenditures that extend the life of the related property, or mitigate or prevent future environmental contamination, are capitalized. The Company does not currently anticipate any material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities. The quantification of environmental exposures requires an assessment of many factors, including changing laws and regulations, advances in environmental technologies, the quality of information available related to specific sites, the assessment stage of the site investigation, preliminary findings and the length of time involved in remediation or settlement. Due to the difficult nature of predicting future environmental costs, the Company cannot anticipate or predict the material adverse effect on its operations, cash flows or financial condition as a result of efforts to comply with, or its liabilities under, environmental laws. 

Presently, two of Titan&#8217;s subsidiaries are currently involved in litigation concerning environmental laws and regulations; 

&#160; 

On October 26, 2010, the United States of America, on behalf of the Environmental Protection Agency (&#8220;EPA&#8221;), filed a complaint against Dico, Inc. (&#8220;Dico&#8221;) and Titan Tire Corporation (&#8220;Titan Tire&#8221;) in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa, wherein the EPA sought civil penalties, punitive damages and response costs against Dico and Titan Tire pursuant to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (&#8220;CERCLA&#8221;). 

&#160; 

On June 11, 2015, Titan Tire and Dico, Inc. appealed the U.S. District Court&#8217;s order granting the EPA&#8217;s motion for summary judgment that found Dico and Titan Tire liable for civil penalties and response costs for violating CERCLA and Dico liable for civil penalties and punitive damages for violating an EPA Administrative Order. 

&#160; 

On December 10, 2015, the United States Court of Appeals reversed the District Court&#8217;s summary judgment order with respect to &#8220;arranger&#8221; liability for Titan Tire and Dico under CERCLA and the imposition of punitive damages against Dico for violating the EPA Administrative Order, but affirmed the summary judgment order imposing civil penalties in the amount of $1.62 million against Dico for violating the EPA Administrative Order violation. 

&#160; 

The case has been remanded to the District Court for trial on the issues of &#8220;arranger&#8221; liability under CERCLA as to Titan Tire and Dico and whether punitive damages should be imposed upon Dico for alleged violations of the EPA Administrative Order. 

COMPETITION 

The Company competes with several domestic and international companies, some of which are larger and have greater financial and marketing resources than Titan. The Company believes it is a primary source of steel wheels and rims to the majority of its North American customers. Major competitors in the off-highway wheel market include GKN Wheels, Ltd., Trelleborg Group, and Topy Industries, Ltd. Significant competitors in the off-highway tire market include Alliance Tire Company Ltd., Balkrishna Industries Limited (BKT), Bridgestone/Firestone, Michelin, Mitas a.s., and Pirelli. Significant competitors in the undercarriage market include Berco and Caterpillar. 

&#160; 

The Company competes primarily on the basis of price, quality, customer service, design capability and delivery time. The Company&#8217;s ability to compete with international competitors may be adversely affected by currency fluctuations. Titan owns the molds and dies used to produce its wheels and tires. However, certain of the Company&#8217;s OEM customers could elect to manufacture the Company&#8217;s products to meet their requirements or to otherwise compete with the Company. There can be no assurance that the Company will not be adversely affected by increased competition in the markets in which it operates, or that competitors will not develop products that are more effective, less expensive or otherwise render certain of Titan&#8217;s products less competitive. From time to time, certain of the Company&#8217;s competitors have reduced their prices in particular product categories, which has prompted Titan to reduce prices as well. There can be no assurance that competitors of the Company will not further reduce prices in the future or that any such reductions would not have a material adverse effect on the Company.

&#32;ITEM 1A &#8211; RISK FACTORS 

The Company is subject to various risks and uncertainties relating to or arising out of the nature of its business and general business, economic, financing, legal and other factors or conditions that may affect the Company. Realization of any of the following risks could have a material adverse effect on Titan&#8217;s business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. 

&#8226; 

The Company is exposed to price fluctuations of key commodities. 

The Company does not generally enter into long-term commodity contracts and does not use derivative commodity instruments to hedge exposures to commodity market price fluctuations. Therefore, the Company is exposed to price fluctuations of key commodities, which consist primarily of steel and rubber. Although the Company attempts to pass on certain material price increases to its customers, there is no assurance that the Company will be able to do so in the future. Any increase in the price of steel and rubber that is not passed on to customers could have a material adverse effect on Titan&#8217;s results of operations. 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

The Company relies on a limited number of suppliers. 

The Company currently relies on a limited number of suppliers for certain key commodities, which consist primarily of steel and rubber, in the manufacturing of Titan products. The loss of key suppliers or their inability to meet price, quality, quantity and delivery requirements could have a significant adverse impact on the Company&#8217;s results of operations. 

&#8226; 

The Company&#8217;s revolving credit facility and other debt obligations contain covenants. 

The Company&#8217;s revolving credit facility and other debt obligations contain covenants and restrictions. These covenants and restrictions could limit Titan&#8217;s ability to respond to market conditions, to provide for unanticipated capital investments, to raise additional debt or equity capital, to pay dividends or to take advantage of business opportunities, including future acquisitions. Titan&#8217;s ability to comply with the covenants may be affected by events beyond its control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. 

&#160; &#32; 

&#8226; 

The Company operates in cyclical industries and is subject to numerous changes in the economy. 

The Company's sales are substantially dependent on three major industries: agricultural equipment, earthmoving/construction equipment and consumer products. The business activity levels in these industries are subject to specific industry and general economic cycles. Any downturn in these industries or the general economy could have a material adverse effect on Titan&#8217;s business. 

&#160; 

The agricultural equipment industry is affected by crop prices, farm income and farmland values, weather, export markets and government policies. The earthmoving/construction industry is affected by the levels of government and private construction spending and replacement demand. The mining industry, which is within the earthmoving/construction industry, is affected by raw material commodity prices. The consumer products industry is affected by consumer disposable income, weather, competitive pricing, energy prices and consumer attitudes. In addition, the performance of these industries is sensitive to interest rate and foreign exchange rate changes and varies with the overall level of economic activity. 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

The Company&#8217;s customer base is relatively concentrated. 

The Company&#8217;s ten largest customers, which are primarily original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), accounted for 31% &#32;of Titan&#8217;s net sales for 2015. Net sales to Deere &#38; Company represented 10% &#32;of total 2015 net sales. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of net sales in 2015. As a result, Titan&#8217;s business could be adversely affected if one of its larger customers reduces its purchases from Titan due to work stoppages or slow-downs, financial difficulties, as a result of termination provisions, competitive pricing or other reasons. There is also continuing pressure from the OEMs to reduce costs, including the cost of products and services purchased from outside suppliers such as Titan. The Company has had long-term relationships with major customers and expects to continue these relationships. There can be no assurance that Titan will be able to maintain such ongoing relationships. Any failure to maintain the Company&#8217;s relationship with a leading customer could have an adverse effect on results of operations. 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

The Company&#8217;s revenues are seasonal in nature due to Titan&#8217;s dependence on seasonal industries. 

The agricultural, earthmoving/construction and recreational industries are seasonal, with typically lower sales during the second half of the year. This seasonality in demand has resulted in fluctuations in the Company&#8217;s revenues and operating results. Because much of Titan&#8217;s overhead expenses are fixed, seasonal trends can cause reductions in quarterly profit margins and financial condition, especially during slower periods. 

&#32;11 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

The Company may be adversely affected by changes in government regulations and policies. 

Domestic and foreign political developments and government regulations and policies directly affect the agricultural, earthmoving/construction and consumer products industries in the United States and abroad. Regulations and policies in the agricultural industry include those encouraging farm acreage reduction in the United States and granting ethanol subsidies. Regulations and policies relating to the earthmoving/construction industry include the construction of roads, bridges and other items of infrastructure. The modification of existing laws, regulations or policies or the adoption of new laws, regulations or policies could have an adverse effect on any one or more of these industries and, therefore, on Titan&#8217;s business. 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

The Company is subject to corporate governance requirements, and costs related to compliance with, or failure to comply with, existing and future requirements could adversely affect Titan&#8217;s business. 

The Company is subject to corporate governance requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as well as new rules and regulations subsequently adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). These laws, rules and regulations continue to evolve and may become increasingly restrictive in the future. Failure to comply with these laws, rules and regulations may have an adverse material effect on Titan&#8217;s reputation, financial condition and the value of the Company&#8217;s securities. 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

The Company faces substantial competition from domestic and international companies. 

The Company competes with several domestic and international competitors, some of which are larger and have greater financial and marketing resources than Titan. Titan competes primarily on the basis of price, quality, customer service, design capability and delivery time. The Company&#8217;s ability to compete with international competitors may be adversely affected by currency fluctuations. In addition, certain OEM customers could elect to manufacture certain products to meet their own requirements or to otherwise compete with Titan. 

There can be no assurance that Titan&#8217;s businesses will not be adversely affected by increased competition in the Company&#8217;s markets or that competitors will not develop products that are more effective or less expensive than Titan products or which could render certain products less competitive. From time to time certain competitors have reduced prices in particular product categories, which has caused Titan to reduce prices. There can be no assurance that in the future Titan&#8217;s competitors will not further reduce prices or that any such reductions would not have a material adverse effect on Titan&#8217;s business. 

&#8226; 

The Company may be affected by unfair trade. 

Titan faces intense competition from producers both in the United States and around the world. In early January 2016, Titan, along with the United Steel Workers, filed petitions with the U.S. Department of Commerce (&#8220;Dept. of Commerce&#8221;) and the U.S. International Trade Commission (&#8220;ITC&#8221;) alleging that imported off-the-road tires from India and Sri Lanka and wheel and tire assemblies from China were being dumped and/or subsidized and were a cause of material injury to the domestic industry. Both the Dept. of Commerce and the ITC have initiated investigations against India and Sri Lanka; but, the ITC did not recommend pursuing the investigation into wheel and tire assemblies from China. If the Dept. of Commerce determines that imports are a cause of material injury (or threat of material injury) to the domestic industry and the Dept. of Commerce finds that imported goods are dumped and/or subsidized, imports will be subject to offsetting duties to neutralize such internationally recognized unfair trade practices. The investigations will likely run through early 2017, although preliminary relief could be provided during the summer of 2016. 

Unfair trade from other countries may have a material adverse effect on Titan's business. 

&#8226; 

The Company could be negatively impacted if Titan fails to maintain satisfactory labor relations. 

The Company is party to collective bargaining agreements. Upon the expiration of any of the collective bargaining agreements, however, Titan may be unable to negotiate new collective bargaining agreements on terms that are cost effective to the Company. The business operations may be affected as a result of labor disputes or difficulties and delays in the process of renegotiating collective bargaining agreements. 

&#32;12 

&#8226; 

Unfavorable outcomes of legal proceedings could adversely affect results of operations. 

The Company is a party to routine legal proceedings arising out of the normal course of business. Although it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of these unresolved legal actions or the range of possible loss, the Company believes at this time that none of these actions, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows of the Company. However, due to the difficult nature of predicting unresolved and future legal claims, the Company cannot anticipate or predict any material adverse effect on its consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows as a result of efforts to comply with, or its liabilities pertaining to, legal judgments. 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

Acquisitions may require significant resources and/or result in significant losses, costs or liabilities. 

Any future acquisitions will depend on the ability to identify suitable acquisition candidates, to negotiate acceptable terms for their acquisition and to finance those acquisitions. Titan will also face competition for suitable acquisition candidates that may increase costs. In addition, acquisitions require significant managerial attention, which may be diverted from current operations. Furthermore, acquisitions of businesses or facilities entail a number of additional risks, including: 

&#160; 

- problems with effective integration of operations; 

&#160; 

- the inability to maintain key pre-acquisition customer, supplier and employee relationships; 

&#160; 

- the potential that expected benefits or synergies are not realized and operating costs increase; and 

&#160; 

- exposure to unanticipated liabilities. 

International acquisitions may be more complex and time consuming. Also, international acquisitions may include a number of additional risks including the integration of acquisitions operating under differing laws and regulations. 

&#160; 

Subject to the terms of indebtedness, the Company may finance future acquisitions with cash from operations, additional indebtedness and/or by issuing additional equity securities. These commitments may impair the operation of Titan&#8217;s businesses. In addition, the Company could face financial risks associated with incurring additional indebtedness such as reducing liquidity and access to financing markets and increasing the amount of cash flow required to service such indebtedness. 

&#8226; 

The Company &#32; has international operations and purchases raw material from foreign suppliers. 

The Company had total aggregate sales outside the United States of approximately $750.2 million , $1,028.0 million &#32;and $1,089.9 million , for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively. Sales outside the United States have become a significant proportion of total sales, accounting for 54%, 54% and 50% for the years ending December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Sales from these international operations are expected to continue to represent a similar portion of total sales. 

International Operations and Sales &#32;&#8211; International operations and sales are subject to a number of special risks, including, but not limited to, risks with respect to currency exchange rates, economic and political destabilization, other disruption of markets and restrictive actions by foreign governments (such as restrictions on transfer of funds, export duties and quotas and foreign customs). Other risks include changes in foreign laws regarding trade and investment; difficulties in obtaining distribution and support; nationalization; reforms of United States laws and policies affecting trade, foreign investment and loans; and foreign tax laws. There may also be restrictions on the Company's ability to repatriate earnings and investments from international operations. There can be no assurance that one or a combination of these factors will not have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s ability to increase or maintain its foreign sales. 

&#160; 

Foreign Suppliers &#32;&#8211; The Company purchases raw materials from foreign suppliers. The production costs, profit margins and competitive position of the Company are affected by the strength of the currencies in countries where Titan purchases goods, relative to the strength of the currencies in countries where the products are sold. The Company&#8217;s results of operations, cash flows and financial position may be affected by fluctuations in foreign currencies. 

&#32;13 

&#8226; 

The Company is subject to anti-corruption laws and regulations. 

The Company has international operations and must comply with anti-corruption laws and regulations including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). These anti-bribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA prohibits these payments regardless of local customs and practices. Although Titan has a compliance program in place to reduce the potential violations of corruption laws, violations of these laws could adversely affect the Company's business. 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

The Company may be subject to product liability and warranty claims. 

The Company warrants its products to be free of certain defects and, accordingly, may be subject to product liability or product warranty claims in the ordinary course of business. Losses may result or be alleged to result from defects in Titan products, which could subject the Company to claims for damages, including consequential damages. There can be no assurance that Company insurance will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred or that adequate insurance will be available on terms acceptable to the Company. Any claims relating to defective products that result in liability exceeding Titan&#8217;s insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on financial condition and results of operations. Further, claims of defects could result in negative publicity against Titan, which could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business. 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

The Company has incurred, and may incur in the future, net losses. 

The Company reported loss before income taxes of $52.0 million &#32;and $152.2 million &#32;for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and may incur losses in the future. Although the Company reported net income for the year ended December 31, 2013, and the Company expects to generate future profitability, there is no guarantee the Company will be profitable in the future. 

&#8226; 

The Company may be adversely affected by a disruption in, or failure of, information technology systems. 

The Company relies upon information technology systems, some of which are managed by third parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information. Technology systems are used in a variety of business processes and activities, including purchasing, manufacturing, distribution, invoicing and financial reporting. The Company utilizes security measures and business continuity plans to prevent, detect and remediate damage from computer viruses, natural disasters, unauthorized access, utility failures and other similar disruptions. Despite these measures, a security breach or information technology system failure may disrupt and adversely affect the Company's operations. 

&#8226; 

The Company is subject to risks associated with climate change and climate change regulations. 

Governmental regulatory bodies in the United States and other countries have, or are, contemplating introducing regulatory changes in response to the potential impacts of climate change. Laws and regulations regarding climate change and energy usage may impact the Company directly through higher costs for energy and raw materials. The Company&#8217;s customers may also be affected by climate change regulations that may impact future purchases. Physical climate change may potentially have a large impact on the Company&#8217;s two largest industry segments, agriculture and earthmoving/construction. The potential impacts of climate change and climate change regulations are highly uncertain at this time, and the Company cannot anticipate or predict the material adverse effect on its consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows as a result of climate change and climate change regulations. 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

The Company is subject to risks associated with environmental laws and regulations. 

The Company&#8217;s operations are subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations governing, among other things, emissions to air, discharge to waters and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of waste and other materials. The Company&#8217;s operations entail risks in these areas, and there can be no assurance that Titan will not incur material costs or liabilities. In addition, potentially significant expenditures could be required in order to comply with evolving environmental and health and safety laws, regulations or requirements that may be adopted or imposed in the future. 

&#8226; 

The Company may incur additional tax expense or tax exposure. 

The Company is subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions, and has domestic and international tax liabilities which are dependent upon the distribution of income among these different jurisdictions. Titan's income tax provision and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors, including income before taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in tax laws and regulations. 

&#32;14 

&#8226; 

The Company is subject to foreign currency translation risk. 

The Company continues to expand globally and now operates in many worldwide locations and transacts business in many foreign currencies. Titan's financial statements are reported in U.S. dollars with financial statements of international subsidiaries being initially recorded in foreign currencies and translated into U.S. dollars. Large fluctuations in currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other world currencies may materially adversely affect the Company's financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. &#32; &#160; 

&#8226; 

The Company is subject to risks associated with uncertainties related to social, political and economic conditions in Russia and Brazil. 

Geopolitical and economic uncertainties relating to Russia and Brazil have and could continue to have a negative impact on the Company's sales and results of operations at the Company's Russian and Brazilian operations. 

&#8226; 

The Company has identified a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting which resulted in a restatement of its financial statements which, if not remediated, could result in additional material mistatements in the Company's financial statements. 

Titan&#8217;s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. As disclosed in Item 9A, management identified a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting related to entity level controls. A material weakness is defined as a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. As a result of this material weakness, management concluded that Titan's internal control over financial reporting was not effective based on criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organization of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control - An Integrated Framework. Management is actively engaged in developing a remediation plan designed to address this material weakness. If the remediation measures are insufficient to address the material weakness or if additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in Titan's internal control over financial reporting are discovered or occur in the future, the Company's consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements and Titan could be required to restate financial results.
