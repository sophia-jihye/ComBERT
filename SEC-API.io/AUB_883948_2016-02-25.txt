 ITEM 1. - BUSINESS. 

&#160; 

GENERAL 

&#160;

The Company is a financial holding company and a bank holding company organized under Virginia law and registered under the BHCA. The Company, headquartered in Richmond, Virginia is committed to the delivery of financial services through its community bank subsidiary Union Bank &#38; Trust and three non-bank financial services affiliates. As of December 31, 2015, the Company&#8217;s bank subsidiary and non-bank financial services affiliates are:

&#160;

Community Bank Union Bank &#38; Trust Richmond, Virginia &#160; &#160; Financial Services Affiliates Union Mortgage Group, Inc. Glen Allen, Virginia Union Investment Services, Inc. Richmond, Virginia Union Insurance Group, LLC Richmond, Virginia &#160;

Effective February 16, 2015, the Company changed its subsidiary bank&#8217;s name from &#8220;Union First Market Bank&#8221; to &#8220;Union Bank &#38; Trust.&#8221; Effective January 1, 2016, UISI was dissolved as a separate corporate entity and the securities, brokerage, and investment advisory businesses of UISI were integrated into Union Bank &#38; Trust.

&#160; 

History 

&#160;

The Company was formed in connection with the July 1993 merger of Northern Neck Bankshares Corporation and Union Bancorp, Inc. Although the Company was formed in 1993, certain of the community banks that were acquired and ultimately merged to form what is now Union Bank &#38; Trust were among the oldest in Virginia at the time they were acquired.

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015, UISI had 16 offices within the Bank&#8217;s market area providing securities, brokerage, and investment advisory services. UISI is a full service investment company handling all aspects of wealth management including stocks, bonds, annuities, mutual funds, and financial planning. Securities are offered through a third party contractual arrangement with Raymond James Financial Services, Inc., an independent broker dealer. Effective January 1, 2016, UISI was dissolved as a separate corporate entity and the securities, brokerage, and investment advisory businesses of UISI were integrated into Union Bank &#38; Trust.

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015, UMG had offices in Virginia (18), Maryland (1), and North Carolina (1). UMG does business in selected states throughout the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast, as well as Washington, D.C., providing a variety of mortgage products to customers in those areas. The mortgage loans originated by UMG generally are sold in the secondary market through purchase agreements with institutional investors with servicing released. During 2015, the mortgage segment also began originating loans with the intent that the loans be held for investment purposes.

&#160;

UIG, an insurance agency, is owned by the Bank and UMG. This agency operates in a joint venture with Bankers Insurance, LLC, a large insurance agency owned by community banks across Virginia and managed by the Virginia Bankers Association. UIG generates revenue through sales of various insurance products through Bankers Insurance LLC, including long-term care insurance and business owner policies.

SEGMENTS 

&#160;

The Company has two reportable segments: its traditional full service community banking business and its mortgage banking business. For more financial data and other information about each of the Company&#8217;s operating segments, refer to Item 7. -&#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; sections, &#8220;Segment Information &#8211; Community Bank Segment&#8221; and &#8220;Segment Information &#8211; Mortgage Segment,&#8221; and to Note 17 &#8220;Segment Reporting Disclosures&#8221; in the &#8220;Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements&#8221; contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.

&#160; 

EXPANSION AND STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS 

&#160;

The Company expands its market area and increases its market share through organic growth (internal growth and de novo expansion) and strategic acquisitions. Strategic acquisitions by the Company to date have included whole bank acquisitions, branch and deposit acquisitions, and purchases of existing branches from other banks. The Company generally considers acquisitions of companies in strong growth markets or with unique products or services that will benefit the entire organization. Targeted acquisitions are priced to be economically feasible with expected minimal short-term drag to achieve positive long-term benefits. These acquisitions may be paid for in the form of cash, stock, debt, or a combination thereof. The amount and type of consideration and deal charges paid could have a short-term dilutive effect on the Company&#8217;s earnings per share or book value. However, cost savings and revenue enhancements in such transactions are anticipated to provide long-term economic benefit to the Company.

&#160;

On January 1, 2014, the Company acquired StellarOne by merger in an all-stock transaction. Pursuant to the StellarOne merger agreement, StellarOne&#8217;s common shareholders received 0.9739 shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock in exchange for each share of StellarOne&#8217;s common stock, resulting in the Company issuing 22,147,874 shares of common stock. The Company operated StellarOne Bank as a separate wholly-owned bank subsidiary until May 2014, at which time StellarOne Bank was merged with and into the Bank. As part of the acquisition plan and cost control efforts, the Company consolidated 13 overlapping bank branches into nearby locations during 2014.

&#160;

The Bank currently operates in-store bank branches in 21 MARTIN&#8217;S Food Markets, one Fas Mart location, and one Walmart location. A significant majority of branches in the MARTIN&#8217;s Food Markets stores were acquired in connection with the Company&#8217;s acquisition of FMB in 2010.

&#160;

Excluding the StellarOne acquisition, the Company&#8217;s new construction expansion during the last five years consisted of opening two new bank branches in Virginia:

&#160;

&#8226; Three James Center , Union Bank &#38; Trust branch located in the city of Richmond, Virginia (November 2011) &#160;

&#8226; Berea Marketplace , Union Bank &#38; Trust branch located in Stafford County, Virginia (March 2011) &#160; 

EMPLOYEES 

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015, the Company had 1,422 full-time equivalent employees, including executive officers, loan and other banking officers, branch personnel, and operations and other support personnel. Of this total, 109 were mortgage segment personnel. None of the Company&#8217;s employees are represented by a union or covered under a collective bargaining agreement. The Company provides employees with a comprehensive employee benefit program which includes the following: group life, health and dental insurance, paid time off, educational opportunities, a cash incentive plan, a stock purchase plan, stock incentive plans, deferred compensation plans for officers and key employees, an ESOP, and a 401(k) plan with employer match.

&#160; 

COMPETITION 

&#160;

The financial services industry remains highly competitive and is constantly evolving. The Company experiences strong competition in all aspects of its business. In its market areas, the Company competes with large national and regional financial institutions, credit unions, other independent community banks, as well as consumer finance companies, mortgage companies, loan production offices, mutual funds, and life insurance companies. Competition for deposits and loans is affected by various factors including interest rates offered, the number and location of branches and types of products offered, and the reputation of the institution. Credit unions increasingly have been allowed to expand their membership definitions, and because they enjoy a favorable tax status, they have been able to offer more attractive loan and deposit pricing. The Company&#8217;s non-bank affiliates also operate in highly competitive environments. The Company believes its community bank framework and philosophy provide a competitive advantage, particularly with regard to larger national and regional institutions, allowing the Company to compete effectively. The Company&#8217;s community bank segment generally has strong market shares within the markets it serves. The Company&#8217;s deposit market share in Virginia was 3.16% of total bank deposits as of June 30, 2015, making it the largest community bank headquartered in Virginia.

&#160;

ECONOMY 

&#160;

The economies in the Company&#8217;s market areas are widely diverse and include local and federal government, military, agriculture, and manufacturing. The Company believes Virginia has weathered the recent economic challenges better than most other states over the last several years but is still faced with a protracted low interest rate environment and the burden of regulatory requirements enacted in response to the most recent financial crisis. Virginia&#8217;s employment growth continues to lag slightly behind the national rate, but 2015 has seen the highest growth in nonfarm employment since 2011. Based on the most recent reported rate from the Virginia Employment Commission, the state&#8217;s unemployment rate is 4.2% as of December 2015 compared to 4.8% at year-end 2014, and continues to be below the national rate of 5.0% at year-end 2015. Virginia&#8217;s housing market ended 2015 with a continued rebound in nearly all regions within the state, outperforming every year since 2007. The Company&#8217;s management continues to consider future economic events and their impact on the Company&#8217;s performance while focusing attention on managing nonperforming assets, controlling costs, and working with borrowers to mitigate and protect against risk of loss.

&#160; 

SUPERVISION AND REGULATION 

&#160;

The Company and the Bank are extensively regulated under both federal and state laws. The following description briefly addresses certain historic and current provisions of federal and state laws and certain regulations, proposed regulations, and the potential impacts on the Company and the Bank. To the extent statutory or regulatory provisions or proposals are described in this report, the description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the particular statutory or regulatory provisions or proposals.

&#160;

The Company 

&#160;

General . As a financial holding company and a bank holding company registered under the BHCA, the Company is subject to supervision, regulation, and examination by the Federal Reserve. The Company elected to be treated as financial holding company by the Federal Reserve in September 2013. The Company is also registered under the bank holding company laws of Virginia and is subject to supervision, regulation, and examination by the SCC.

&#160; 

Permitted Activities . The permitted activities of a bank holding company are limited to managing or controlling banks, furnishing services to or performing services for its subsidiaries, and engaging in other activities that the Federal Reserve determines by regulation or order to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. In addition, bank holding companies that qualify and elect to be financial holding companies, such as the Company, may engage in any activity, or acquire and retain the shares of a company engaged in any activity, that is either (i) financial in nature or incidental to such financial activity (as determined by the Federal Reserve in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury) or (ii) complementary to a financial activity and does not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally (as solely determined by the Federal Reserve), without prior approval of the Federal Reserve. Activities that are financial in nature include securities underwriting and dealing, insurance underwriting, and making merchant banking investments.

&#160;

To maintain financial holding company status, a financial holding company and all of its depository institution subsidiaries must be &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; and &#8220;well managed.&#8221; A depository institution subsidiary is considered to be &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; if it satisfies the requirements for this status under applicable Federal Reserve capital requirements. A depository institution subsidiary is considered &#8220;well managed&#8221; if it received a composite rating and management rating of at least &#8220;satisfactory&#8221; in its most recent examination. A financial holding company&#8217;s status will also depend upon it maintaining its status as &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; and &#8220;well managed&#8221; under applicable Federal Reserve regulations. If a financial holding company ceases to meet these capital and management requirements, the Federal Reserve&#8217;s regulations provide that the financial holding company must enter into an agreement with the Federal Reserve to comply with all applicable capital and management requirements. Until the financial holding company returns to compliance, the Federal Reserve may impose limitations or conditions on the conduct of its activities, and the company may not commence any of the broader financial activities permissible for financial holding companies or acquire a company engaged in such financial activities without prior approval of the Federal Reserve. If the company does not return to compliance within 180 days, the Federal Reserve may require divestiture of the financial holding company&#8217;s depository institutions.

&#160;

- 5 - 

&#160;

&#160;

In order for a financial holding company to commence any new activity permitted by the BHCA or to acquire a company engaged in any new activity permitted by the BHCA, each insured depository institution subsidiary of the financial holding company must have received a rating of at least &#8220;satisfactory&#8221; in its most recent examination under the CRA. See below under &#8220;The Bank &#8211; Community Reinvestment Act.&#8221;

&#160;

Despite prior approval, the Federal Reserve may order a bank holding company or its subsidiaries to terminate any activity or to terminate ownership or control of any subsidiary when the Federal Reserve has reasonable cause to believe that a serious risk to the financial safety, soundness or stability of any bank subsidiary of that bank holding company may result from such an activity.

&#160;

Banking Acquisitions; Changes in Control . The BHCA requires, among other things, the prior approval of the Federal Reserve in any case where a bank holding company proposes to (i) acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the outstanding voting stock of any bank or bank holding company (unless it already owns a majority of such voting shares), (ii) acquire all or substantially all of the assets of another bank or bank holding company, or (iii) merge or consolidate with any other bank holding company. In determining whether to approve a proposed bank acquisition, the Federal Reserve will consider, among other factors, the effect of the acquisition on competition, the public benefits expected to be received from the acquisition, the projected capital ratios and levels on a post-acquisition basis, and the acquiring institution&#8217;s performance under the CRA and its compliance with fair housing and other consumer protection laws.

&#160;

Subject to certain exceptions, the BHCA and the Change in Bank Control Act, together with the applicable regulations, require Federal Reserve approval (or, depending on the circumstances, no notice of disapproval) prior to any person or company&#8217;s acquiring &#8220;control&#8221; of a bank or bank holding company. A conclusive presumption of control exists if an individual or company acquires the power, directly or indirectly, to direct the management or policies of an insured depository institution or to vote 25% or more of any class of voting securities of any insured depository institution. A rebuttable presumption of control exists if a person or company acquires 10% or more but less than 25% of any class of voting securities of an insured depository institution and either the institution has registered its securities with the SEC under Section 12 of the Exchange Act or no other person will own a greater percentage of that class of voting securities immediately after the acquisition. The Company&#8217;s common stock is registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act.

&#160;

In addition, Virginia law requires the prior approval of the SCC for (i) the acquisition of more than 5% of the voting shares of a Virginia bank or any holding company that controls a Virginia bank, or (ii) the acquisition by a Virginia bank holding company of a bank or its holding company domiciled outside Virginia.

&#160;

Source of Strength . Federal Reserve policy has historically required bank holding companies to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to their subsidiary banks. The Dodd-Frank Act codified this policy as a statutory requirement. Under this requirement, the Company is expected to commit resources to support the Bank, including times when the Company may not be in a financial position to provide such resources. Any capital loans by a bank holding company to any of its subsidiary banks are subordinate in right of payment to depositors and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary banks. In the event of a bank holding company&#8217;s bankruptcy, any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to priority of payment.

&#160;

Safety and Soundness . There are a number of obligations and restrictions imposed on bank holding companies and their subsidiary banks by law and regulatory policy that are designed to minimize potential loss to the depositors of such depository institutions and the FDIC insurance fund in the event of a depository institution default. For example, under the FDICIA, to avoid receivership of an insured depository institution subsidiary, a bank holding company is required to guarantee the compliance of any subsidiary bank that may become &#8220;undercapitalized&#8221; with the terms of any capital restoration plan filed by such subsidiary with its appropriate federal bank regulatory agency up to the lesser of (i) an amount equal to 5% of the institution&#8217;s total assets at the time the institution became undercapitalized, or (ii) the amount that is necessary (or would have been necessary) to bring the institution into compliance with all applicable capital standards as of the time the institution fails to comply with such capital restoration plan.

&#160;

Under the FDIA, the federal bank regulatory agencies have adopted guidelines prescribing safety and soundness standards. These guidelines establish general standards relating to internal controls and information systems, internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth and compensation, fees, and benefits. In general, the guidelines require, among other things, appropriate systems and practices to identify and manage the risk and exposures specified in the guidelines.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Capital Requirements. The Federal Reserve imposes certain capital requirements on bank holding companies under the BHCA, including a minimum leverage ratio and a minimum ratio of &#8220;qualifying&#8221; capital to risk-weighted assets. These requirements are described below under &#8220;The Bank &#8211; Capital Requirements&#8221;. Subject to its capital requirements and certain other restrictions, the Company is able to borrow money to make a capital contribution to the Bank, and such loans may be repaid from dividends paid by the Bank to the Company.

&#160;

Limits on Dividends and Other Payments . The Company is a legal entity, separate and distinct from its subsidiaries. A significant portion of the revenues of the Company result from dividends paid to it by the Bank. There are various legal limitations applicable to the payment of dividends by the Bank to the Company and to the payment of dividends by the Company to its shareholders. The Bank is subject to various statutory restrictions on its ability to pay dividends to the Company. Under current regulations, prior approval from the Federal Reserve is required if cash dividends declared in any given year exceed net income for that year, plus retained net profits of the two preceding years. The payment of dividends by the Bank or the Company may be limited by other factors, such as requirements to maintain capital above regulatory guidelines. Bank regulatory agencies have the authority to prohibit the Bank or the Company from engaging in an unsafe or unsound practice in conducting its respective business. The payment of dividends, depending on the financial condition of the Bank, or the Company, could be deemed to constitute such an unsafe or unsound practice.

&#160;

Under the FDIA, insured depository institutions such as the Bank, are prohibited from making capital distributions, including the payment of dividends, if, after making such distributions, the institution would become &#8220;undercapitalized&#8221; (as such term is used in the statute). Based on the Bank&#8217;s current financial condition, the Company does not expect that this provision will have any impact on its ability to receive dividends from the Bank. The Company&#8217;s non-bank subsidiaries pay dividends to the Company periodically on a non-regulated basis.

&#160;

In addition to dividends it receives from the Bank, the Company receives management fees from its affiliated companies for expenses incurred related to external financial reporting and audit fees, investor relations expenses, Board of Directors fees, and legal fees related to corporate actions. These fees are charged to each subsidiary based upon various specific allocation methods measuring the estimated usage of such services by that subsidiary. The fees are eliminated from the financial statements in the consolidation process.

&#160;

The Bank 

&#160;

General . The Bank is supervised and regularly examined by the Federal Reserve and the SCC. The various laws and regulations administered by the bank regulatory agencies affect corporate practices, such as the payment of dividends, incurrence of debt, and acquisition of financial institutions and other companies; they also affect business practices, such as the payment of interest on deposits, the charging of interest on loans, types of business conducted, and location of offices. Certain of these law and regulations are referenced above under &#8220;The Company.&#8221;

&#160;

Capital Requirements. The Federal Reserve and the other federal banking agencies have issued risk-based and leverage capital guidelines applicable to U.S. banking organizations. Those regulatory agencies may from time to time require that a banking organization maintain capital above the minimum levels because of its financial condition or actual or anticipated growth.

&#160;

On June 7, 2012, the Federal Reserve issued a series of proposed rules intended to revise and strengthen its risk-based and leverage capital requirements and its method for calculating risk-weighted assets. The rules were proposed to implement the Basel III regulatory capital reforms from the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. On July 2, 2013, the Federal Reserve approved certain revisions to the proposals and finalized new capital requirements for banking organizations.

&#160;

Under the risk-based capital requirements of the Federal Reserve that became effective January 1, 2015, the Company and the Bank are required to maintain a minimum ratio to total capital (which is defined as core capital and supplementary capital less certain specified deductions from total capital such as reciprocal holdings of depository institution capital instruments and equity investments) to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.0% (unchanged from the prior requirement). At least 6% of the total capital is required to be &#8220;Tier 1 capital,&#8221; which consists principally of common and certain qualifying preferred shareholders&#8217; equity (including grandfathered trust preferred securities) as well as retained earnings, less certain intangibles and other adjustments (increased from the prior requirement of 4.0%). The &#8220;Tier 2 capital&#8221; consists of cumulative preferred stock, long-term perpetual preferred stock, a limited amount of subordinated and other qualifying debt (including certain hybrid capital instruments), and a limited amount of the general loan loss allowance. A common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5% of risk-weighted assets was added with the new rules effective January 1, 2015. The Tier 1, common equity Tier 1, and total capital to risk-weighted asset ratios of the Company were 11.93%, 10.55% and 12.46%, respectively, as of December 31, 2015, thus exceeding the minimum requirements. The Tier 1, common equity Tier 1, and total capital to risk-weighted asset ratios of the Bank were 11.52%, 11.52% and 12.05%, respectively, as of December 31, 2015, also exceeding the minimum requirements.

&#160;

- 7 - 

&#160;

&#160;

Each of the federal bank regulatory agencies also has established a minimum leverage capital ratio of Tier 1 capital to average adjusted assets (&#8220;Tier 1 leverage ratio&#8221;). The guidelines require a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of 3.0% for financial holding companies and banking organizations with the highest supervisory rating. All other banking organizations were required to maintain a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4.0% unless a different minimum was specified by an appropriate regulatory authority (unchanged from the prior requirement). In addition, for a depository institution to be considered &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, its Tier 1 leverage ratio must be at least 5.0%. Banking organizations that have experienced internal growth or made acquisitions are expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels without significant reliance on intangible assets. The Federal Reserve has not advised the Company or the Bank of any specific minimum leverage ratio applicable to either entity. As of December 31, 2015, the Tier 1 leverage ratios of the Company and the Bank were 10.68% and 10.31%, respectively, well above the minimum requirements.

&#160;

The capital requirements that became effective January 1, 2015 are the initial capital obligations, which will be phased in over a four-year period. When fully phased in on January 1, 2019, the rules will require the Company and the Bank to maintain (i) a minimum ratio of common equity Tier 1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5%, plus a 2.5% &#8220;capital conservation buffer&#8221; (which is added to the 4.5% common equity Tier 1 ratio as that buffer is phased in, effectively resulting in a minimum ratio of common equity Tier 1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 7.0% upon full implementation); (ii) a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 6.0%, plus the 2.5% capital conservation buffer (which is added to the 6.0% Tier 1 capital ratio as that buffer is phased in, effectively resulting in a minimum Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5% upon full implementation); (iii) a minimum ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.0%, plus the 2.5% capital conservation buffer (which is added to the 8.0% total capital ratio as that buffer is phased in, effectively resulting in a minimum total capital ratio of 10.5% upon full implementation); and (iv) a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0%, calculated as the ratio of Tier 1 capital to average assets.

&#160;

The capital conservation buffer requirement is being phased in beginning January 1, 2016, at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets, increasing by the same amount each year until fully implemented at 2.5% on January 1, 2019. The capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Banking institutions with a ratio of common equity Tier 1 to risk-weighted assets above the minimum but below the conservation buffer will face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases, and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall.

&#160;

With respect to the Bank, the Federal Reserve&#8217;s final rules also revised the &#8220;prompt corrective action&#8221; regulations pursuant to Section 38 of the FDIA by (i) introducing a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio requirement at each level (other than critically undercapitalized), with the required ratio being 6.5% for well-capitalized status; (ii) increasing the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio requirement for each category, with the minimum ratio for well-capitalized status being 8.0% (as compared to the prior ratio of 6.0%); and (iii) eliminating the provision that provided that a bank with a composite supervisory rating of 1 may have a 3.0% Tier 1 leverage ratio and still be well-capitalized. These new thresholds were effective for the Bank as of January 1, 2015. The minimum total capital to risk-weighted assets ratio (10.0%) and minimum leverage ratio (5.0%) for well-capitalized status were unchanged by the final rules.

&#160;

The new capital requirements also include changes in the risk weights of assets to better reflect credit risk and other risk exposures. These include a 150% risk weight (up from 100%) for certain high volatility commercial real estate acquisition, development, and construction loans and nonresidential mortgage loans that are 90 days past due or otherwise on nonaccrual status, a 20% (up from 0%) credit conversion factor for the unused portion of a commitment with an original maturity of one year or less that is not unconditionally cancellable, a 250% risk weight (up from 100%) for mortgage servicing rights and deferred tax assets that are not deducted from capital, and increased risk-weights (from 0% to up to 600%) for equity exposures.

&#160;

Deposit Insurance. The deposits of the Bank are insured up to applicable limits by the DIF of the FDIC and are subject to deposit insurance assessments to maintain the DIF. On April 1, 2011, the deposit insurance assessment base changed from total deposits to average total assets minus average tangible equity, pursuant to a rule issued by the FDIC as required by the Dodd-Frank Act.

&#160;

- 8 - 

&#160;

&#160;

The FDIA, as amended by the Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Act and the Dodd-Frank Act, requires the FDIC to set a ratio of deposit insurance reserves to estimated insured deposits of at least 1.35%. The FDIC utilizes a risk-based assessment system that imposes insurance premiums based upon a risk matrix that takes into account a bank&#8217;s capital level and supervisory rating. On February 27, 2009, the FDIC introduced three possible adjustments to an institution&#8217;s initial base assessment rate: (i) a decrease of up to five basis points for long-term unsecured debt, including senior unsecured debt (other than debt guaranteed under the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program) and subordinated debt and, for small institutions, a portion of Tier 1 capital; (ii) an increase not to exceed 50% of an institution&#8217;s assessment rate before the increase for secured liabilities in excess of 25% of domestic deposits; and (iii) for non-Risk Category I institutions, an increase not to exceed 10 basis points for brokered deposits in excess of 10% of domestic deposits. In 2015 and 2014, the Company paid only the base assessment rate for &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; institutions, which totaled $4.5 million and $5.1 million, respectively, in regular deposit insurance assessments.

&#160;

In addition, all FDIC insured institutions are required to pay assessments to the FDIC at an annual rate of approximately one basis point of insured deposits to fund interest payments on bonds issued by the Financing Corporation, an agency of the federal government established to recapitalize the predecessor to the Savings Association Insurance Fund. These assessments will continue until the FICO bonds mature in 2017 through 2019.

&#160;

Transactions with Affiliates . Pursuant to Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation W, the authority of the Bank to engage in transactions with related parties or &#8220;affiliates&#8221; or to make loans to insiders is limited. Loan transactions with an affiliate generally must be collateralized and certain transactions between the Bank and its affiliates, including the sale of assets, the payment of money or the provision of services, must be on terms and conditions that are substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the Bank, as those prevailing for comparable nonaffiliated transactions. In addition, the Bank generally may not purchase securities issued or underwritten by affiliates.

&#160;

Loans to executive officers, directors, or to any person who directly or indirectly, or acting through or in concert with one or more persons, owns, controls, or has the power to vote more than 10% of any class of voting securities of a bank (&#8220;10% Shareholders&#8221;), are subject to Sections 22(g) and 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act and their corresponding regulations (Regulation O) and Section 13(k) of the Exchange Act relating to the prohibition on personal loans to executives (which exempts financial institutions in compliance with the insider lending restrictions of Section 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act). Among other things, these loans must be made on terms substantially the same as those prevailing on transactions made to unaffiliated individuals and certain extensions of credit to those persons must first be approved in advance by a disinterested majority of the entire Board of Directors. Section 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act prohibits loans to any of those individuals where the aggregate amount exceeds an amount equal to 15% of an institution&#8217;s unimpaired capital and surplus plus an additional 10% of unimpaired capital and surplus in the case of loans that are fully secured by readily marketable collateral, or when the aggregate amount on all of the extensions of credit outstanding to all of these persons would exceed the Bank&#8217;s unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus. Section 22(g) of the Federal Reserve Act identifies limited circumstances in which the Bank is permitted to extend credit to executive officers.

&#160;

Prompt Corrective Action . Federal banking regulators are authorized and, under certain circumstances, required to take certain actions against banks that fail to meet their capital requirements. The federal bank regulatory agencies have additional enforcement authority with respect to undercapitalized depository institutions. &#8220;Well capitalized&#8221; institutions may generally operate without supervisory restriction. With respect to &#8220;adequately capitalized&#8221; institutions, such banks cannot normally pay dividends or make any capital contributions that would leave it undercapitalized, they cannot pay a management fee to a controlling person if, after paying the fee, it would be undercapitalized, and they cannot accept, renew, or roll over any brokered deposit unless the bank has applied for and been granted a waiver by the FDIC.

&#160;

Immediately upon becoming &#8220;undercapitalized,&#8221; a depository institution becomes subject to the provisions of Section 38 of the FDIA, which: (i) restrict payment of capital distributions and management fees; (ii) require that the appropriate federal banking agency monitor the condition of the institution and its efforts to restore its capital; (iii) require submission of a capital restoration plan; (iv) restrict the growth of the institution&#8217;s assets; and (v) require prior approval of certain expansion proposals. The appropriate federal banking agency for an undercapitalized institution also may take any number of discretionary supervisory actions if the agency determines that any of these actions is necessary to resolve the problems of the institution at the least possible long-term cost to the DIF, subject in certain cases to specified procedures. These discretionary supervisory actions include: (i) requiring the institution to raise additional capital; (ii) restricting transactions with affiliates; (iii) requiring divestiture of the institution or the sale of the institution to a willing purchaser; and (iv) any other supervisory action that the agency deems appropriate. These and additional mandatory and permissive supervisory actions may be taken with respect to significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized institutions. The Bank met the definition of being &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; as of December 31, 2015.

&#160;

As described above in &#8220;The Bank &#8211; Capital Requirements,&#8221; the new capital requirement rules issued by the Federal Reserve incorporate new requirements into the prompt corrective action framework.

Community Reinvestment Act . The Bank is subject to the requirements of the CRA. The CRA imposes on financial institutions an affirmative and ongoing obligation to meet the credit needs of the local communities, including low and moderate income neighborhoods. If the Bank receives a rating from the Federal Reserve of less than &#8220;satisfactory&#8221; under the CRA, restrictions on operating activities would be imposed. In addition, in order for a financial holding company, like the Company, to commence any new activity permitted by the BHCA, or to acquire any company engaged in any new activity permitted by the BHCA, each insured depository institution subsidiary of the financial holding company must have received a rating of at least &#8220;satisfactory&#8221; in its most recent examination under the CRA. The Bank received a &#8220;satisfactory&#8221; CRA rating in its most recent examination.

&#160;

Privacy Legislation . Several recent laws, including the Right to Privacy Act, and related regulations issued by the federal bank regulatory agencies, provide new protections against the transfer and use of customer information by financial institutions. A financial institution must provide to its customers information regarding its policies and procedures with respect to the handling of customers&#8217; personal information. Each institution must conduct an internal risk assessment of its ability to protect customer information. These privacy provisions generally prohibit a financial institution from providing a customer&#8217;s personal financial information to unaffiliated parties without prior notice and approval from the customer.

&#160;

USA Patriot Act of 2001 . In October 2001, the USA Patriot Act of 2001 (&#8220;Patriot Act&#8221;) was enacted in response to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks in New York, Pennsylvania, and Northern Virginia. The Patriot Act is intended to strengthen U.S. law enforcement and the intelligence communities&#8217; abilities to work cohesively to combat terrorism. The continuing impact on financial institutions of the Patriot Act and related regulations and policies is significant and wide ranging. The Patriot Act contains sweeping anti-money laundering and financial transparency laws, and imposes various regulations, including standards for verifying customer identification at account opening, and rules to promote cooperation among financial institutions, regulators, and law enforcement entities to identify persons who may be involved in terrorism or money laundering.

&#160;

Volcker Rule. The Dodd-Frank Act prohibits insured depository institutions and their holding companies from engaging in proprietary trading except in limited circumstances and prohibits them from owning equity interests in excess of 3% of Tier 1 capital in private equity and hedge funds (known as the &#8220;Volcker Rule&#8221;). On December 10, 2013, the federal bank regulatory agencies adopted final rules implementing the Volcker Rule. These final rules prohibit banking entities from (i) engaging in short-term proprietary trading for their own accounts, and (ii) having certain ownership interests in and relationships with hedge funds or private equity funds. The final rules are intended to provide greater clarity with respect to both the extent of those primary prohibitions and of the related exemptions and exclusions. The final rules also require each regulated entity to establish an internal compliance program that is consistent with the extent to which it engages in activities covered by the Volcker Rule, which must include (for the largest entities) making regular reports about those activities to regulators. Although the final rules provide some tiering of compliance and reporting obligations based on size, the fundamental prohibitions of the Volcker Rule apply to banking entities of any size, including the Company and the Bank. The final rules were effective April 1, 2014, with full compliance being phased in over a period which will end on July 21, 2016. The Company has evaluated the implications of the final rules on its investments and does not expect any material financial implications at this time.

&#160;

Under rules implementing the Volcker Rule, banking entities would have been prohibited from owning certain collateralized debt obligations (&#8220;CDOs&#8221;) backed by trust preferred securities (&#8220;TruPS&#8221;) as of July 21, 2015, which could have forced banking entities to recognize unrealized market losses based on the inability to hold any such investments to maturity. However, on January 14, 2014, the federal bank regulatory agencies issued an interim final rule, effective April 1, 2014, exempting TruPS CDOs from the Volcker Rule if (i) the CDO was established prior to May 19, 2010, (ii) the banking entity reasonably believes that the offering proceeds of the CDO were used to invest primarily in TruPS issued by banks with less than $15 billion in assets, and (iii) the banking entity acquired the CDO on or before December 10, 2013. The Company currently does not have any impermissible holdings of TruPS CDOs under the interim final rule and, therefore, will not be required to divest any of such investments or change their accounting treatment. The Company is continuously reviewing its investments to ensure compliance as the various provisions of the Volcker Rule regulations become effective.

&#160;

Consumer Financial Protection . The Bank is subject to a number of federal and state consumer protection laws that extensively govern its relationship with its customers. These laws include the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, the Expedited Funds Availability Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Service Members Civil Relief Act, laws governing flood insurance, federal and state laws prohibiting unfair and deceptive business practices, foreclosure laws, and various regulations that implement some or all of the foregoing. These laws and regulations mandate certain disclosure requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must deal with customers when taking deposits, making loans, collecting loans, and providing other services. If the Bank fails to comply with these laws and regulations, it may be subject to various penalties. Failure to comply with consumer protection requirements may also result in failure to obtain any required bank regulatory approval for merger or acquisition transactions the Bank may wish to pursue or being prohibited from engaging in such transactions even if approval is not required.

&#160;

The Dodd-Frank Act centralized responsibility for consumer financial protection by creating a new agency, the CFPB, and giving it responsibility for implementing, examining, and enforcing compliance with federal consumer protection laws. The CFPB focuses on (i) risks to consumers and compliance with the federal consumer financial laws, (ii) the markets in which firms operate and risks to consumers posed by activities in those markets., (iii) depository institutions that offer a wide variety of consumer financial products and services, and (iv) non-depository companies that offer one or more consumer financial products or services.

&#160;

The CFPB has broad rulemaking authority for a wide range of consumer financial laws that apply to all banks, including, among other things, the authority to prohibit &#8220;unfair, deceptive, or abusive&#8221; acts and practices. Abusive acts or practices are defined as those that materially interfere with a consumer&#8217;s ability to understand a term or condition of a consumer financial product or service or take unreasonable advantage of a consumer&#8217;s (i) lack of financial savvy, (ii) inability to protect himself in the selection or use of consumer financial products or services, or (iii) reasonable reliance on a covered entity to act in the consumer&#8217;s interests. The CFPB can issue cease-and-desist orders against banks and other entities that violate consumer financial laws. The CFPB may also institute a civil action against an entity in violation of federal consumer financial law in order to impose a civil penalty or injunction.

&#160;

Ability-to-Repay and Qualified Mortgage Rule. Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFPB issued a final rule on January 10, 2013 (effective on January 10, 2014), amending Regulation Z as implemented by the Truth in Lending Act, requiring creditors to make a reasonable and good faith determination based on verified and documented information that a consumer applying for a mortgage loan has a reasonable ability to repay the loan according to its terms. Creditors are required to determine consumers&#8217; ability to repay in one of two ways. The first alternative requires the creditor to consider the following eight underwriting factors when making the credit decision: (i) current or reasonably expected income or assets; (ii) current employment status; (iii) the monthly payment on the covered transaction; (iv) the monthly payment on any simultaneous loan; (v) the monthly payment for mortgage-related obligations; (vi) current debt obligations, alimony, and child support; (vii) the monthly debt-to-income ratio or residual income; and (viii) credit history. Alternatively, the creditor can originate &#8220;qualified mortgages,&#8221; which are entitled to a presumption that the creditor making the loan satisfied the ability-to-repay requirements. In general, a &#8220;qualified mortgage&#8221; is a mortgage loan without negative amortization, interest-only payments, balloon payments, or terms exceeding 30 years. In addition, to be a qualified mortgage the points and fees paid by a consumer cannot exceed 3% of the total loan amount. Qualified mortgages that are &#8220;higher-priced&#8221; (e.g. subprime loans) garner a rebuttable presumption of compliance with the ability-to-repay rules, while qualified mortgages that are not &#8220;higher-priced&#8221; (e.g. prime loans) are given a safe harbor of compliance. To meet the mortgage credit needs of a broader customer base, the Company is predominantly an originator of mortgages that are intended to be in compliance with the ability-to-pay requirements.

&#160; 

Incentive Compensation . In June 2010, the federal bank regulatory agencies issued comprehensive final guidance on incentive compensation policies intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of financial institutions do not undermine the safety and soundness of such institutions by encouraging excessive risk-taking. The Interagency Guidance on Sound Incentive Compensation Policies , which covers all employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of financial institutions, either individually or as part of a group, is based upon the key principles that a financial institution&#8217;s incentive compensation arrangements should (i) provide incentives that do not encourage risk-taking beyond the institution&#8217;s ability to effectively identify and manage risks; (ii) be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management; and (iii) be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the financial institution&#8217;s Board of Directors.

&#160;

The Federal Reserve will review, as part of the regular, risk-focused examination process, the incentive compensation arrangements of financial institutions, such as the Company and the Bank, that are not &#8220;large, complex banking organizations.&#8221; These reviews will be tailored to each financial institution based on the scope and complexity of the institution&#8217;s activities and the prevalence of incentive compensation arrangements. The findings of the supervisory initiatives will be included in reports of examination. Deficiencies will be incorporated into the institution&#8217;s supervisory ratings, which can affect the institution&#8217;s ability to make acquisitions and take other actions. Enforcement actions may be taken against a financial institution if its incentive compensation arrangements, or related risk-management control or governance processes, pose a risk to the institution&#8217;s safety and soundness and the financial institution is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies. At December 31, 2015, the Company and the Bank have not been made aware of any instances of non-compliance with the final guidance.

Effect of Governmental Monetary Policies 

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s operations are affected not only by general economic conditions but also by the policies of various regulatory authorities. In particular, the Federal Reserve regulates money and credit conditions and interest rates to influence general economic conditions. These policies have a significant impact on overall growth and distribution of loans, investments, and deposits; they affect interest rates charged on loans or paid for time and savings deposits. Federal Reserve monetary policies have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks, including the Company, in the past and are expected to do so in the future.

&#160;

Filings with the SEC 

&#160;

The Company files annual, quarterly, and other reports under the Exchange Act with the SEC. These reports and this Form 10-K are posted and available at no cost on the Company&#8217;s investor relations website, http://investors.bankatunion.com , as soon as reasonably practicable after the Company files such documents with the SEC. The information contained on the Company&#8217;s website is not a part of this Form 10-K. The Company&#8217;s filings are also available through the SEC&#8217;s website at http://www.sec.gov .
