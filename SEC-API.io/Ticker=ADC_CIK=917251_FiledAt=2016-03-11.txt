 Item 1: Business &#160;

General

Agree Realty Corporation, a Maryland corporation, is a fully integrated real estate investment trust (&#8220;REIT&#8221;) primarily focused on the ownership, acquisition, development and management of retail properties net leased to industry leading tenants. We were founded in 1971 by our current Executive Chairman, Richard Agree, and our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange (&#8220;NYSE&#8221;) in 1994.

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015, our portfolio consisted of 278 properties located in 41 states and totaling approximately 5.2 million square feet of gross leasable area. See &#8220;Item 2 &#8211; Properties &#8211; Geographic Diversification&#8221; for more information on our market. Our portfolio included 275 net lease properties, which contributed approximately 97.6% of annualized base rent, and three community shopping centers, which generated the remaining 2.4% of annualized base rent.

&#160;

&#160; 1 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015, our portfolio was approximately 99.5% leased and had a weighted average remaining lease term of approximately 11.4 years. A significant majority of our properties are leased to national tenants and approximately 51.9% of our annualized base rent was derived from tenants, or parents thereof, with an investment grade credit rating. Substantially all of our tenants are subject to net lease agreements. A net lease typically requires the tenant to be responsible for minimum monthly rent and property operating expenses including property taxes, insurance and maintenance.

&#160;

Our assets are held by, and all of our operations are conducted through, directly or indirectly, the Operating Partnership, of which we are the sole general partner and in which we held a 98.3% interest as of December 31, 2015. Under the partnership agreement of the Operating Partnership, we, as the sole general partner, have exclusive responsibility and discretion in the management and control of the Operating Partnership.

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015, we had 20 full-time employees, including executive, investment, due diligence, construction, accounting, asset management and administrative personnel.

&#160;

Our principal executive offices are located at 70 E. Long Lake Road, Bloomfield Hills, MI 48304 and our telephone number is (248) 737-4190. We maintain a website at www.agreerealty.com. Our reports electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) the Exchange Act can be accessed through this site, free of charge, as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file or furnish such reports. These filings are also available on the SEC&#8217;s website at www.sec.gov.

Recent Developments

&#160; 

Investments 

During 2015, we completed approximately $226.4 million of investments in net leased retail real estate, including the acquisition of 73 properties for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $220.6 million and the completed development of one property for an aggregate cost of approximately $5.8 million. These 74 properties are leased to 41 different tenants operating in 19 sectors and are located in 25 states. These assets are 100% leased for a weighted average lease term of approximately 12.2 years and the weighted average capitalization rate on our investments was approximately 8.0%. 

&#160; 

We calculate the weighted average capitalization rate on our investments by dividing annual expected net operating income derived from the properties by the total investment in the properties. Annual expected net operating income is defined as the straight-line rent for the base term of the lease, less property level expenses (if any) that are not recoverable from the tenant. 

&#160; 

Dividends 

We increased our quarterly dividend per share from $0.45 per share in March 2015 to $0.465 per share in June 2016. 

&#160; 

The quarterly dividend per share of $0.465 per share represents an annualized dividend of $1.86 per share and an annualized dividend yield of approximately 5.5% based on the last reported sales price of our common stock on the NYSE of $33.99 on December 31, 2015. We have paid a quarterly cash dividend for 87 consecutive quarters and, although we expect to continue our policy of paying quarterly dividends, we cannot guarantee that we will maintain our current level of dividends, that we will continue our recent pattern of increasing dividends per share, or what our actual dividend yield will be in any future period. 

&#160; 

Financing 

In December 2015, we issued 1,725,000 shares of common stock at a price of $32.10 per share, including 225,000 shares purchased by the underwriters upon the exercise of their option to purchase additional shares. After underwriting discounts and other offering costs of $2.4 million, net proceeds of approximately $53.0 million were used to repay borrowings under our $150 million revolving credit facility (the &#8220;Credit Facility&#8221;), which were used primarily to fund property acquisitions. 

&#160; 

In May 2015, we completed a private placement of $100.0 million principal amount of senior unsecured notes (the &#8220;Senior Unsecured Notes&#8221;). The Senior Unsecured Notes were sold in two series, including $50.0 million of 4.16% notes due May 30, 2025 and $50.0 million of 4.26% notes due May 30, 2027. The weighted average term of the Senior Unsecured Notes is 11 years and the weighted average interest rate is 4.21%. Proceeds from the issuance were used to repay borrowings under our Credit Facility and for general corporate purposes. 

&#160; 

&#160; 2 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

In May 2015, we implemented a $100.0 million at-the-market equity program (the &#8220;ATM program&#8221;) by entering into multiple equity distribution agreements through which we may, from time to time, sell newly issued shares of our common stock. We use the proceeds generated from our ATM program for general corporate purposes including funding our investment activity, the repayment or refinancing of outstanding indebtedness, working capital and other general purposes.

&#160;

During the year ended December 31, 2015, we issued 1,318,812 shares of common stock under our ATM program at an average price of $30.31, realizing gross proceeds of $40.0 million. We had approximately $60.0 million remaining under the ATM program as of December 31, 2015.

&#160;

In March 2015, the SEC declared effective a shelf registration statement previously filed by the Company. The securities covered by this registration statement, which expires March 27, 2018, cannot exceed $500.0 million in the aggregate and include common stock, preferred stock, depositary shares and warrants. We may periodically offer one or more of these securities in amounts, prices and on terms to be announced when and if these securities are offered. The specifics of any future offerings, along with the use of proceeds of any securities offered, will be described in detail in a prospectus supplement, or other offering materials, at the time of any offering.

&#160; 

Dispositions 

During 2015, we sold eight properties for aggregate gross proceeds of $29.0 million, which resulted in a gain of $12.1 million. Dispositions included three land parcels, two single tenant net leased properties and three community shopping centers (Marshall Plaza in Marshall, Michigan; Ferris Commons in Big Rapids, Michigan; and Lakeland Plaza in Lakeland, Florida). 

&#160; 

Leasing 

During 2015, excluding properties that were sold, we executed new leases, extensions or options on nearly 125,000 square feet of gross leasable area throughout our portfolio. The annual rent associated with these new leases, extensions or options is approximately $1.2 million. Material new leases, extensions or options included a 51,513 square foot JC Penny and a 15,400 square foot Planet Fitness, both at Central Michigan Commons in Mt. Pleasant, Michigan. 

&#160; 

Business Strategies

Our primary business objective is to generate consistent shareholder returns by investing in and actively managing a diversified portfolio of retail properties net leased to industry leading tenants. The following is a discussion of our investment, financing and asset management strategies: 

&#160;

Investment Strategy 

We are focused primarily on the fee simple ownership of properties net leased to national or large, regional retailers operating in sectors we believe to be more e-commerce and recession resistant. Our leases are typically long term, net leases that require the tenant to pay all property operating expenses, including real estate taxes, insurance and maintenance. We believe that a diversified portfolio of such properties provides for stable and predictable cash flow.

&#160;

We seek to expand and enhance our portfolio by identifying the best risk-adjusted investment opportunities across our Acquisitions, Development and Partner Capital Solutions platforms. Each platform leverages the Company&#8217;s collective real estate acumen to pursue investments in net lease retail real estate.

&#160;

Acquisitions : We launched our acquisitions platform in April 2010. Since its inception, we have acquired 212 properties for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $598.2 million. These properties are net leased to over 75 different tenants representing more than 25 retail sectors and are located in 41 states. We pursue acquisition opportunities that meet both our real estate and return on investment criteria and that will further diversify our existing portfolio.

&#160;

Development : We have been developing retail properties since the formation of our predecessor in 1971 and have developed 59 of the 278 properties in our portfolio as of December 31, 2015, including 56 of our net lease properties and all three community shopping centers. We have the capability to direct all aspects of the development process, including site selection, land acquisition, lease negotiation, due diligence, design and construction.

&#160;

&#160; 3 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Partner Capital Solutions 

We launched our Partner Capital Solutions (&#8220;PCS&#8221;) platform, formerly known as Joint Venture Capital Solutions, in April 2012. Our PCS program allows us to acquire properties by partnering with private developers on their in-process developments. We offer development and construction expertise, tenant relationships, access to capital and forward commitments to purchase that facilitate the successful completion of their projects. We typically own a 100% fee simple interest in PCS projects upon completion.

&#160;

We believe that development and PCS projects have the potential to generate superior risk-adjusted returns on investment in properties that are substantially similar to those which we acquire.

&#160; 

Financing Strategy 

We seek to maintain a capital structure that provides us with the flexibility to manage our business and pursue our growth strategies, while allowing us to service our debt requirements and generate appropriate risk adjusted returns for our shareholders. We believe these objectives are best achieved by a capital structure that consists primarily of common equity and prudent amounts of debt financing. However, we may raise capital in any form and under terms that we deem acceptable and in the best interest of our shareholders.

&#160;

We have previously utilized common equity offerings, secured mortgage borrowings, unsecured bank borrowings, the private placement of senior unsecured notes and the sale of properties to meet our capital requirements. We evaluate our financing policies on an on-going basis in light of current economic conditions, access to various capital markets, relative costs of equity and debt securities, market value of our properties and other factors.

&#160;

At December 31, 2015, our ratio of total debt to total market capitalization, assuming the conversion of limited partnership interests in the Operating Partnership (&#8220;OP Units&#8221;) into shares of common stock, was approximately 30.9%, and our ratio of total debt to total gross assets (before accumulated depreciation) was approximately 37.6%.

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015, our total debt outstanding was $319.6 million, including $101.6 million of secured mortgage debt that had a weighted average fixed interest rate of 4.2% (including the effects of interest rate swap agreements) and a weighted average maturity of 4.2 years, $200 million of unsecured borrowings that had a weighted average fixed interest rate of 4.0% (including the effects of interest rate swap agreements) and a weighted average maturity of 7.8 years, and $18.0 million of floating rate borrowings under our Credit Facility at a weighted average interest rate of approximately 1.7%.

&#160;

Certain financial agreements to which we are a party contain covenants that limit our ability to incur debt under certain circumstances; however, our organizational documents do not limit the absolute amount or percentage of indebtedness that we may incur. As such, we may modify our borrowing policies at any time without shareholder approval.

&#160;

Asset Management 

We maintain a proactive leasing and capital improvement program that, combined with the quality and locations of our properties, has made our properties attractive to tenants. We intend to continue to hold our properties for long-term investment and, accordingly, place a strong emphasis on the quality of construction and an on-going program of regular and preventative maintenance. Our properties are designed and built to require minimal capital improvements other than renovations or alterations paid for by tenants. At our three community shopping center properties, we sub contract on-site functions such as maintenance, landscaping, snow removal and sweeping. The cost of these functions is generally reimbursed by our tenants. Personnel from our corporate headquarters conduct regular inspections of each property and maintain regular contact with major tenants.

&#160;

We have a management information system designed to provide our management with the operating data necessary to make informed business decisions on a timely basis. This system provides us rapid access to lease data, tenants&#8217; sales history, cash flow budgets and forecasts. Such a system helps us to maximize cash flow from operations and closely monitor corporate expenses.

Financial and Asset Information about Industry Segments

We are in the business of acquiring, developing and managing retail real estate which we consider one reporting segment. See &#8220;Item 2 &#8211; Properties&#8221;, &#8220;Item 6 &#8211; Selected Financial Data&#8221; and &#8220;Note 2 &#8211; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#8221;: to our consolidated financial statements for additional financial and asset information. 

&#160;

Competition

The U.S. commercial real estate investment market is a highly competitive industry. We actively compete with many entities engaged in the acquisition, development and operation of commercial properties. As such, we compete with other investors for a limited supply of properties and financing for these properties. Investors include traded and non-traded public REITs, private equity firms, institutional investment funds, insurance companies and private individuals, many of which have greater financial resources than we do and the ability to accept more risk than we believe we can prudently manage. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully with such entities in our acquisition, development and leasing activities in the future.

&#160;

Significant Tenants

As of December 31, 2015, we leased 32 properties to Walgreens. Total annualized base rents were approximately 17.2%, 21.9% and 26.8% for the years ended 2015, 2014 and 2013 respectively. As of December 31, 2015, the weighted average remaining lease term of our Walgreens leases was 13.4 years.

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015, we leased 3 properties to Walmart or Walmart affiliates, which represented approximately 5.5% of our total annualized base rent. The weighted average remaining lease term of our Walmart leases was 6.0 years.

&#160;

No other tenant accounted for more than 5.0% of our annualized base rent as of December 31, 2015. See &#8220;Item 2 &#8211; Properties&#8221; for additional information on our top tenants and the composition of our tenant base.

&#160;

Regulation

&#160;

Environmental 

Investments in real property create the potential for environmental liability on the part of the owner or operator of such real property. If hazardous substances are discovered on or emanating from a property, the owner or operator of the property may be held strictly liable for all costs and liabilities relating to such hazardous substances. We have obtained a Phase I environmental study (which involves inspection without soil sampling or ground water analysis) conducted by independent environmental consultants on each of our properties and, in certain instances, have conducted additional investigation, including a Phase II environmental assessment. Furthermore, we have adopted a policy of conducting a Phase I environmental study on each property we acquire and conducting additional investigation as warranted.

&#160;

We have no knowledge of any hazardous substances existing on our properties in violation of any applicable laws; however, no assurance can be given that such substances are not located on any of our properties. We carry no insurance coverage for the types of environmental risks described above.

&#160;

We believe that we are in compliance, in all material respects, with all federal, state and local ordinances and regulations regarding hazardous or toxic substances. Furthermore, we have not been notified by any governmental authority of any noncompliance, liability or other claim in connection with any of our properties.

&#160;

Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 

Our properties, as commercial facilities, are required to comply with Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and similar state and local laws and regulations (collectively, the &#8220;ADA&#8221;). Investigation of a property may reveal non-compliance with the ADA. Our tenants will typically have primary responsibility for complying with the ADA, but we may incur costs if the tenant does not comply. As of December 31, 2015, we have not been notified by any governmental authority, nor are we otherwise aware, of any non-compliance with the ADA that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or results of operations.

&#160;
