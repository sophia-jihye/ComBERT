Formation and Initial Public Offering 

&#160; 

We are a master limited partnership formed by our parent on March 2, 2015. On July 1, 2015, we completed our IPO of 11 ,500,000 common units representing limited partner interests. Our common units are traded under the symbol &#8220;GPP&#8221; on Nasdaq . After completing the IPO, in addition to the interests of BlendStar, we received the assets and liabilities of the ethanol storage and leased railcar assets, previously owned and operated by our parent, in a transfer between entities under common control. 

&#160; 

Overview 

&#160; 

Green Plains Partners is a Delaware limited partnership that provide s &#160; fee-based fuel storage and transportation services by owning, operating, developing and acquiring ethanol and fuel storage tanks, terminals, transportation assets and other related assets and businesses. We were formed by Green Plains, a vertically integrated ethanol producer, to support its marketing and distribution activities as its primary downstream logistics provider. 

&#160; 

We generate a substantial portion of our revenues under fee-based commercial agreements with Green Plains Trade for receiving, storing, transferring and transporting ethanol and other fuels, which are supported by minimum volume or take-or-pay capacity commitments. We do not take ownership or receive any payments based on the value of the e thanol or other fuels we handle. A s a result, we do not have any direct exposure to fluctuating commodity prices. 

&#160; 

O ur parent own s a 62.5% limite d partner interest in us , consisting of 4,389,642 common units and 15,889,642 subordinated units, all of our incentive distribution rights and a 2.0% general partner interest . The public owns the remaining 35.5% limited partner interest. Th e following diagram depict s our simplified organizational structure at December 31, 2015: 

&#160; 

Our Assets and Operations 

&#160; 

Ethanol Storage . &#160; Our ethanol storage assets are the principal method of storing the ethanol produced at our parent&#8217;s ethanol production plants. &#160; Each of our parent&#8217;s ethanol production plants are located near major rail lines. Ethanol is 

&#160;

distributed from our storage facilities to bulk terminals via truck or railcar. 

&#160; 

We own 30 ethanol storage facilities and approxi mately 47 acres of land . O ur storage tanks are located at our parent&#8217;s 14 ethanol production plants in Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Min nesota, Nebraska, Tennessee , Texas and Virginia. &#160; 

&#160; 

Our ethanol storage tanks have combined storage capacity of approximately 31. 8 mmg and aggregate throughput capacity of approxi mately 1,6 7 7 m mgy. For the year ended December 31, 2015, the ethanol storage assets had throughput of approximately 948 mmg, representing 91.1% of our parent&#8217;s daily average production capacity.

(2) The Hopewell &#160; plant resumed operations on February 8, 2016. &#160; 

&#160; 

Terminal and Distribution Services . We own and operate eight fuel terminals with access to major rail lines that have combined total storage capacity of approximately 7.4 mmg in Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, Kentucky, Tennessee and Oklahoma. &#160; We also &#160; own approximately five acres of land and lease approximately 19 acres of land wher e our fuel terminals are located. F or the year ended December 31, 201 5, the aggregate throughput at these facilities was approximately 3 21.5 mmg . &#160; 

&#160; 

Ethanol is transported from our terminals to third-parties for blending with gasoline and transferred to a loading rack for delivery by truck to retail gas stations. &#160; Our Birmingham facility is one of 20 facilities in the United States capable of efficiently receiving and offloading ethanol and other fuels from unit trains.

&#160; 

Transportation and Delivery . Ethanol d eliveries to distant markets are shipped using major U.S. rail carriers that can switc h cars to other major railroads . O ur leased railcar fleet consists of approximately 2, 500 railcars with an aggregate capacity of approxima te ly 76.3 mmg. We expect our railcar volumetric capacity will fluctuate over the normal course of business as our existing railcar leases expire and we enter into or acquire new railcar leases. Our volumetric capacity is used to transport produ ct primarily from our fuel terminals or third-party production facilities to international export terminals and 

&#160;

refineries located throughout the United States . 

&#160; 

We also own and operate a fleet of seven trucks to transport ethanol and other biofuels. 

&#160; 

Segments 

&#160; 

Our operations consist of one reportable segment with all business activities conducted in the United States. 

&#160; 

Our Relationship with Green Plains 

&#160; 

Our parent is a vertically integrated producer, marketer and distributor of ethanol and the fourth largest producer in North America. O ur parent mitigates commodity price volatility by having operations throughout the ethanol value chain, which differentiates it from other companies focused only on ethanol production. 

&#160; 

We benefit significantly from our relationship with our parent. Our assets are the principal method of storing and delivering the ethanol our parent produces for its customers and the commercial agreements with Green Plains Trade account for a substantial portion of our revenues. 

&#160; 

Our parent has a majority interest in us through ownership of our general partner, a 62.5% limited partner interest and all of our incentive distribution rights. We believe our parent will continue to support the successful execution of our business strategies given its significant ownership in us and the importance of our assets to Green Plains&#8217; operations. 

&#160; 

We entered into several agreements with our parent , which were established in conjunction with the IPO, including: an omnibus agreement; a contribution, conveyance and assumption agreement; an operational services and secondment agreement; and various commercial agreements described below. For additional information related to these agreements, please refer to Note 3 &#8211; Initial Public Offering to the consolidated financial statements in this report . 

&#160; 

Commercial Agreements with Affiliate 

&#160; 

A substantial portion of our revenues and cash flows are derived from our commercial agreements with Green Plains Trade, our primary customer, including a (1) ten-year fee-based storage and throughput agreement, (2) &#160; Birmingham terminal services agreement, (3) &#160; six-year fee-based rail transportation services agreement and (4) various other transportation and terminal services agreements. For &#160; th e agreements in their entirety, please refer to the current report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on July 6, 2015 , and the amendments filed with this report. 

&#160; 

Minimum Volume Commitments. Our storage and throughput agreement and certa in terminal services agreements with Green Plains Trade are supported by minimum volume commitments. Our rail transportation services agreement is supported by minimum take-or-pay capacity commitments. Green Plains Trade is required to pay us fees for these minimum commitments regardless of the actual throughput or volume, capacity used or amount of product tendered for transport, assuring us that we will receive a certain amount of revenue during the terms of these agreements . T he nature of these arrangements will provide stable and predictable cash flows over time. 

&#160; 

Storage and Throughput Agreement. U nder our storage and throughput agreement, Green Plains Trade i s obligated to throughput a minimum of 2 46 .5 mmg of product p er calendar quarter at our storage facilities. Green Plains Trade is obligated to pay $0.05 per gallon on all throughput volumes , subject to an inflation escalator based on the producer price index following the last day of the primary term&#8217;s fifth year . If Green Plains Trade fails to meet its minimum volume commitment during any quarter, Green Plains Trade will pay us a deficiency payment equal to the deficient volume multiplied by the applicable fee. The deficiency p ayment may be applied as a credit toward volumes throughput by Green Plains Trade in excess of the minimum volume commitment during the next four quarters, after which time any unused credits will expire. For each of the quarters ended September 30, 2015, and December 31, 2015, Green Plains Trade met its minimum volume commitment, with throughput of 215.6 mmg and 248.8 mmg, respectively. &#160; At December 31, 2015 , the remaining primary term of our storage and throughput agreement was 9.5 years . The storage and throughput agreement will automatically renew for successive one-year terms unless either party provides written notice of its intent to terminate at least 360 days prior to the end of the remaining primary or renewal term . 

&#160; 

The current minimum volume commitment was increased from 212.5 mmg of product per calendar quarter in connection with &#160; the acquisition of the Hereford, Texas and Hopewell, Virginia ethanol storage and leased railcar assets, effective January 1, 2016 . All other terms and conditions are substantially the same as the initial agreement . 

&#160; 

&#160;

Terminal Services Agreement. Under our terminal services agreement for the Birmingham facility , Green Plains Trade is obligated to pay $0.0355 per gallon on all throughput volume s, subject to a minimum volume commitment of approximately 2.8 mmg per month of ethanol and other fuels , equivalent to 33.2 mmgy, as well as fees for ancillary services. At December 31, 2015, the remaining primary term of the &#160; terminal services agreement was approximately two years . The terminal services agreement will automatically renew for successive one-year renewal terms unless either party provides written notice of its intent to terminate at least 90 days prior to the end of the remaining primary or renewal term . &#160; O ther terminal services agreements with Green Plains Trade and third parties also contain minimum volume commitments with various remaining terms. 

&#160; 

Rail Transportation Service Agreement. U nder our rail transportation services agreement, Green Plains Trade is obligated to transport ethanol and other fuels by rail from identified receipt and delivery points and pay a n average monthly f ee of approxima t ely $0.03 58 per gallon for all railcar volumetric capacity provided. Currently, our minimum railcar volumetric capacity commitment is 76.3 mm g and t he weighted average remaining term of all railcar lease agreements &#160; is 2. 9 years. &#160; At December 31, 2015, the remaining primary term of our rail transportation services agreement was 5.5 years. The rail transportation services agreement will automatically renew for successive one-year renewal terms unless either party provides written notice of its intent to terminate at least 360 days prior to the end of the remaining primary or renewal term . 

&#160; 

We lease o ur railcars from third parties under lease agreements with various terms. T he minimum take-or-pay capacity commitment is reduced by the capacity of the railcars subject to expiration under our lease agreements . 

&#160; 

Effective January 1, 2016, the rail transportation services agreement was amended in connection with the acquisition of the Hereford, Texas and Hopewell, Virginia ethanol storage and leased railcar assets . The amended agreement increase d the minimum railcar volumetric capacity commitment by 6.7 mmg , &#160; to &#160; its current level . All other terms and conditions are substantially the same as the initial agreement . &#160; 

&#160; 

Green Plains Trade is also obligated to &#160; pay a monthly fee of approximately $0.0013 per gallon for logistical operations management and other services based &#160; on railcar volumetric capacity obtained by Green Plains Trade from third parties. &#160; 

Trucking Transportation Agreement. Under our trucking transportation agreement, Green Plains Trade pays us to transport ethanol and other fuels from identified receipt and delivery points by truck . At December 31, 2015 , the remaining term of our trucking transportation agreement was six months . The trucking transportation agreement will automatically renew for successive one-year renewal terms unless either party provides written notice of its intent to terminate at least 30 days prior to the end of the remaining primary or renewal term . Green Plains Trade is obligated to pay a monthly trucking transportation services fee equal to the aggregate amount of product volume transported in a calendar month multiplied by the applicable rate for ea ch truck lane. 

&#160; 

We also entered into an omnibus agreement and an operational services and secondment agreement with our parent. For more information, see Note 3 &#8211; Initial Public Offering &#160; to the consolidated financial statements in this report . 

&#160; 

Competitive Streng ths 

&#160; 

We believe that the following competitive strengths position us to successfully execute our business strategies: 

&#160; 

Stable and Predictable Cash Flows. A substantial portion of our revenues and cash flows are derived from long-term, fee-based commercial agreements with Green Plains Trade, including a storage and throughput agreement, rail transportation services agreement, terminal services agreement and other transportation agreements. Our s torage and throughput agreement and certain terminal services ag reements are supported by minimum volume commitments, and o ur rail transportation services agreement is supported by minimum take-or-pay capacity commitments. Green Plains Trade is obligated to pay us fees for these minimum commitments regardless of actual throughput or volume, capacity used or amount of product tendered for transport, assuring us that we will receive a certain amount of revenue &#160; durin g the terms of these agreements . 

&#160; 

Advantageous Relationship with Our Parent . Our assets are the principal method of storing and delivering the ethanol our parent produces , and the related agreements with Green Plains Trade include minimum volume or take-or-pay capacity commitments. Furthermore, as general partner and owner of a 62.5% limited partner interest in us and all of our incentive distribution rights, our parent directly benefits from our growth, which provides incentive to pursue projects that directly or indirectly enhance the value of our business and assets. This can be accomplished though organic expansion, accretive acquisitions or the development of downstream distribution services. Under an omnibus agreement, we are granted the right of first offer, for a period of five yea rs, on any ethanol storage asset , fuel terminal facility or transportation asset our parent owns , constructs or acquire s &#160; and decide s to sell. 

&#160;

&#160; 

Quality Assets. Our &#160; portfolio of assets have an expected remaining weighted average useful life of over 20 years . Our assets are strategically located in eight states near major rail lines, which minimizes our exposure to weather-related downtime and transportation congestion , while enabling access to markets across the United States. Given the nature of our asset s , we expect to incur only modest maintenance-related expenses and capital expenditures in the near future. 

&#160; 

Financial Strength and Flexibility. Our borrowing capacity and ability to access debt and equity capital markets provide financial flexibility necessary to achieve our organic and acquisition growth strategies. 

&#160; 

Proven Management Team. &#160; Each member of our senior management team is an employee of our parent who also devotes time to manage our business affairs. We believe the level of commercial, operational and financial expertise of our senior management team, which averages approximat ely 25 years of industry experience, will allow us to successfully execute our business strategies. 

&#160; 

Business Strategy 

&#160; 

We believe ethanol could become an increasingly larger portion of the global fuel supply driven by volatile oil prices, heightened environmental concerns, energy independence and national security concerns. We intend to further develop and strengthen our business by pursuing the following growth strategies: &#160; 

&#160; 

Generate Stable, Fee-Based Cash Flows . &#160; &#160; A substantial portion of our revenues and cash flows are derived from our commercial agreements with Green Plains Trade. Under these agreements, we do not have direct exposure to fluctuating commodity prices. We will continue to establish fee-based contracts with our parent and third parties that generate stable and predictable cash flows as we grow. 

&#160; 

Grow Organically . We will collaborate with our parent and other potential third-party customers to identify opportunities to construct assets that provide us with stable cash flows through fee-based service agreements. Plant expansion by our parent that increases its production capacity also increases annual throughput at our facilities. Our capital expenditures associated with expansion would be minimal since our ethanol storage facilities have available capacity to accommodate growth. 

&#160; 

Acquire Strategic Assets . &#160; &#160; We intend to pursue strategic acquisitions independently and jointly with our parent to grow our business. The U.S. ethanol production industry is poised for consolidation. Our parent has a proven history of identifying, acquiring and integrating assets that are accretive to its business. Under the omnibus agreement, we have a five-year, right of first offer on any fuel storage, terminal or transportation asset our parent owns, constructs or acquires and decides to sell. In addition, we intend to continually monitor the marketplace to identify and pursue assets that complement or diversify our existing operations, including fuel storage and terminal assets in close proximity to our existing asset base. 

&#160; 

Development of Downstream Distribution Services. &#160; Our parent will continue to use its logistical capabilities and expertise to further develop downstream ethanol distribution services. We will benefit from our parent&#8217;s marketing and distribution strategy due to the strategic location s of our ethanol storage facilities and fuel terminal facilities. 

&#160; 

Conduct Safe, Reliable and Efficient Operations. We conduct routine inspections of our assets in accordance with applicable laws and regulations and are committed to maintaining safe, reliable and environmentally compliant operations. We seek to improve our operating performance through preventive maintenance, employee training, and safety and development programs. 

&#160; 

Recent Developments 

&#160; 

On November 4, 2015, we announced plans to form a joint venture, as a 50% partner, to build an ethanol unit train terminal in Maumelle, Arkansas. The terminal will be capable of unloading 110-car unit trains in less than 24 hours and initially include storage for approximately 4.2 mmg of ethanol. The project is expected to cost approximately $12 million and be completed during the fourth quarter of 2016. 

&#160; 

Effective January 1, 2016, we acquired the ethanol storage and leased railcar assets of the Hereford, Texas and Hopewell, Virginia ethanol production facilities from our parent for initial consideration of $62.5 million. We used our revolving credit fac ility and cash on hand to fund the purchase . T he acquired assets include three ethanol storage tanks that support the plants&#8217; combined production capacity of approximately 160 mmgy and 224 leased railcars with volumetric capacity of approximately 6.7 mmg. We amended the storage and throughput agreement with Green Plains Trade, increasing 

&#160;

the minimum volume commitment from 212.5 mmg to 246.5 mmg per calendar quarter. We also amended the rail transportation services agreement, increasing the minimum railcar volumetric capacity commitment 6.7 mmg t o 76.3 mm g. 

&#160; 

Our Competition 

&#160; 

Our contractual relationship with Green Plains Trade and the integrated nature of our storage tanks with our parent&#8217;s production facilities minimizes potential competition for storage and distribution services provided under our commercial agreements from other third-party operators. 

&#160; 

We compete with independent fuel terminal operators and major fuel producers for terminal services based on terminal location, services provided, safety and cost. While there are numerous fuel producers and distributors that own terminal operations similar to ours, they are not typically focused on providing services to third parties. Independent operators are often located near key distribution points with cost advantages and provide more efficient services and distribution capabilities into strategic markets with a variety of transportation options. Companies often rely on independent providers when their own storage facilities cannot handle their volumes or they cannot manage their throughput adequately due to lack of expertise, market congestion, size constraints, optionality or the nature of the material s being stored. 

&#160; 

We believe we are well-positioned to compete effectively in a growing market due to our expertise managing third-party terminal services and logistics. We are a low-cost operator, focused on safety and efficiency, capable of managing the needs of multiple constituencies across geographical markets. While the competitiveness of our services can be impacted by competition from new entrants, transportation constraints, industry production levels and related storage needs, we believe there are significant barriers to entry that partially mitigate these risks, including significant capital costs, execution risk, complex permitting requirements, development cycle, financial and working capital constraints, expertise and experience , and ability to effectively capture strategic assets or locations. 

&#160; 

Seasonality 

&#160; 

Our business is directly affected by the supply and demand for ethanol and other fuels in the markets served by our assets. However, the effects of seasonality on our revenues are substantially mitigated through our fee-based commercial agreements with Green Plains Trade , which include minimum volume or take-or-pay capacity commitments. 

&#160; 

Major Customer 

&#160; 

Revenues fro m Green Plains Trade , controlled by our parent , totaled approxim ately $42.5 million, or 83.5%, of ou r consolidated revenues fo r 2015. We are highly dependent on Green Plains Trade and expect to derive most of our revenues from them &#160; in the foreseeable future. Accordingly, we are indirectly subject to the business risks of Green Plains Trade. For additional information, please read Risk Factors&#8212;Risks Related to Our Business . Since a substantial majority of our revenue s &#160; are, and in the foreseeable future &#160; are expected to be , derived from Green Plains Trade, any development that materially and adversely affects Green Plain Trade&#8217;s operations, financial condition or market reputation could have a material adverse impact on us. 

&#160; 

Regulatory Matters 

&#160; 

Government Ethanol Programs and Policies 

&#160; 

The domestic ethanol market is impacted by federal mandates under the RFS II, which sets the required volume of renewable fuel to be blended with transportation fuel in the United States . On June 10 , 2015, the EPA proposed volume targets for conventional ethanol of 13.25 billion gallons, 13.4 0 billion gallons and 14.0 0 billion gallons for 2014 , 2015 and 2016, respectively. On November 30, 2015, the EPA announced final volume requirements for conventional ethanol that were higher than the levels proposed in June of 13.6 1 billion gallons, 14. 05 billion gallons and 14.5 0 billion gallons for 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively. &#160; 

&#160; 

In April 2013, the Master Limited Partnership Parity Act was introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives as H.R. 1696 to extend the publicly traded partnership ownership structure to renewable energy projects, including ethanol production. The legislation was proposed to provide a more level financing system and tax burden for renewable energy equal to fossil energy projects. H.R. 1696 did not advance out of committee during the 113th Congress and its co-sponsors have not re-introduced the bill. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Environmental Regulation 

&#160; 

Our operations are subject to environmental regulations, including those that govern the handling and release of ethanol, crude oil and other liquid hydrocarbon materials. Compliance with existing and anticipated environmental laws and regulations will increase our overall cost of business, including capital costs to construct, maintain, operate, and upgrade equipment and facilities. However, we do not believe that this will have a material impact on our operations or financial position. 

&#160; 

There are also risks of accidental releases into the environment associated with our operations, such as releases of ethanol from our storage facilities. Should an event , such as an accidental release, not be covered by our insurance, we could be subject to substantial liabilities arising from environmental cleanup and restoration costs, claims made by neighboring landowners and other third parties for personal injury and property damage, and fines or penalties for any related violations of environmental laws or regulations. 

&#160; 

Under the omnibus agreement, our parent indemnified us from all known and certain unknown environmental liabilities associated with owning and operating our assets that occurred on or before the closing of the IPO. In turn, we have agreed to indemnify our parent from future environmental liabilities associated with the activities of the partnership. 

&#160; 

Construction or maintenance of our terminal and storage facilities may impact wetlands, which are regulated by the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers under the Clean Water Act. 

&#160; 

Other Regulations 

&#160; 

In July 2014, the DOT proposed new regulations to improve the transportation of flammable materials by rail, which it finalized on May 1, 2015. The Enhanced Tank Car Standards and Operational Controls for High-Hazard Flammable Trains calls for an enhanced tank car standard known as the DOT specification 117 and establishes a schedule to retrofit or replace older tank cars that carry crude oil and ethanol. The rule also establishes braking standards intended to reduce the severity of accidents and new operational protocols. Companies that transport hazardous materials must develop more accurate classification protocols. &#160; As a result of t he final rule , lease costs for railcars may increase over the long term . Additionally, existing railcars could be out of service for a period of time while such upgrades are made, tightening supply in an industry that is highly dependent on railcars to transport product. We intend to retrofit or replace our leased railcars to comply with the new regulations. R etrofitting costs will be reimbursed by Green Plains Trade under our rail transportation services agreement. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

We do not have any employees. We are managed and operated by the executive officers of our general partner, who are also officers of our parent, and our &#160; general partner&#8217;s board of directors. O ur general partner and its affiliates have approximately 15 full-time equivalent employees under the direct management and supervision of our general partne r for our operations.
