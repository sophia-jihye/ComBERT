Overview 

&#160; 

We are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of novel targeted therapeutics for cancer, wet age-related macular degeneration, or wet AMD, and fibrotic diseases. We are a leader in the field of endoglin biology and are using our expertise to develop antibodies that bind to the endoglin receptor. Endoglin is essential to angiogenesis, the process of new blood vessel formation, and a key contributor to the development of fibrosis, or tissue scarring. Our lead product candidate, TRC105, is an endoglin antibody that is being developed for the treatment of multiple solid tumor types in combination with inhibitors of the vascular endothelial growth factor, or VEGF, pathway. The VEGF pathway regulates vascular development in the embryo, or vasculogenesis, and angiogenesis. TRC105 has been studied in six completed Phase 2 clinical trials and three completed Phase 1 clinical trials, and is currently being dosed in five Phase 2 clinical trials (hereafter referred to as ongoing clinical trials). Interim data from these trials have shown encouraging rates of durable complete responses in angiosarcoma and choriocarcinoma, cancers types that qualify for orphan drug designation and also highly express endoglin. We expect to initiate a Phase 3 trial in angiosarcoma and a multicenter Phase 2 trial in gestational trophoblastic neoplasia, or GTN, that includes choriocarcinoma and could be registration enabling, in 2016. Furthermore, we expect topline data in all of the ongoing TRC105 clinical trials by the end of 2016 and, if results are positive, we expect to initiate additional Phase 3 clinical trials for one or more indications of soft tissue sarcoma, renal cell carcinoma, glioblastoma, and hepatocellular carcinoma. 

&#160; 

We believe treatment with TRC105 in combination with VEGF inhibitors may improve survival in cancer patients when compared to treatment with a VEGF inhibitor alone. In initial clinical trials of more than 400 patients, TRC105 has shown good tolerability and promising anti-tumor activity, particularly in combination with VEGF inhibitors. Clinical trial results of TRC105 in combination with VEGF inhibitors include the following: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Data were published in Clinical Cancer Research in 2014 from a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of TRC105 with Avastin (bevacizumab), a VEGF antibody, that primarily enrolled patients with colorectal and ovarian cancer whose cancer had progressed on prior Avastin treatment. The combination demonstrated anti-tumor activity in the trial. Specifically, of 25 evaluable patients treated previously with VEGF inhibitors, 16 patients (64%) had stable disease, and ten patients (40%) had partial responses as measured by Choi criteria. Six responding patients who had been treated with prior VEGF inhibitors (24%) remained without cancer progression longer than during their prior VEGF inhibitor therapy, and were therefore considered to have durable responses. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Data were presented from the ascending dose portion of a Phase 2 clinical trial of TRC105 with Inlyta (axitinib) in patients with renal cell carcinoma at the Genitourinary Cancers Symposium of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) conference in February 2015 and at the Kidney Cancer Association annual meeting in November 2015. The &#160; combination &#160; was &#160; well &#8208; tolerated &#160; and &#160; dose &#160; limiting &#160; toxicity was not observed. Five of 17 patients (29%) demonstrated partial responses by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1, or RECIST 1.1. Final median progression free survival, or PFS, was 8.4 months in all patients and 9.6 months in patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma. Based on a Phase 3 trial of Inlyta, the expected median progression-free survival of patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma treated with Inlyta who progressed following treatment with only one prior inhibitor of the VEGF pathway is 4.8 months. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Data were presented from the ascending dose portion of a Phase 2 clinical trial of TRC105 with Nexavar (sorafenib) being conducted at the National Cancer Institute (NCI) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma at the ASCO annual meeting in June 2015. Four of the ten patients (40%) with measurable disease treated at recommended Phase 2 doses of TRC105 (10 mg/kg or 15 mg/kg dosed once every two weeks) demonstrated partial responses by RECIST 1.1, in a setting where the expected partial response rate of Nexavar alone is 2%. We plan to initiate dosing in a multicenter Phase 1/2 study of TRC105 in hepatocellular carcinoma in the first half of 2016. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Data were presented from the ascending dose portion of a Phase &#160; 2 &#160; clinical trial of TRC105 with Votrient (pazopanib) in patients with advanced &#160; soft &#160; tissue &#160; sarcoma at the ASCO annual meeting in June 2015 and 

&#160;

updated in an oral presentation at the Connective Tissue Oncology Society annual meeting in November 2015. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

18 &#160; patients &#160; were &#160; treated &#160; with &#160; the &#160; combination &#160; of &#160; TRC105 &#160; given &#160; once &#160; weekly &#160; (8 &#160; mg/kg &#160; or &#160; 10 &#160; mg/kg) &#160; and &#160; Votrient &#160; at &#160; its &#160; approved &#160; dose &#160; of &#160; 800 &#160; mg &#160; per &#160; day. &#160; The &#160; combination &#160; was &#160; well &#8208; tolerated &#160; and &#160; dose &#160; limiting &#160; toxicity was not observed. The &#160; Phase &#160; 2 &#160; portion &#160; of &#160; the &#160; study completed enrollment of 63 additional patients and top-line data indicate that the unstratified median PFS (3.9 months) is similar to the PFS expected for Votrient alone, based on data from the Votrient PALETTE Phase 3 trial in soft tissue sarcoma. We expect to report data on the prospectively defined secondary endpoint of PFS stratified by sarcoma histology, including in patients with angiosarcoma, and stratified by tumor endo glin expression in mid-2016. All five patients with angiosarcoma, a sarcoma subtype that highly expresses endoglin, enrolled in the trial had reductions in tumor burden, median PFS to date is at least 9.3 months, and two of these five patients have durable complete responses to treatment that are ongoing at 45 and 75 weeks of treatment. We have amended the study to enroll an additional cohort of 13 patients with angiosarcoma. In addition, a patient with undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma has an ongoing durable complete response at 51 weeks of treatment. For comparison, there were no complete responses in sarcoma patients treated with Votrient (n=246 ) in the Votrient PALETTE Phase 3 trial. A Phase 3 study in angiosarcoma is planned, and stratification of PFS in the Phase 2 trial by tumor endoglin expression may identify other sarcoma histologies that are more likely to respond to treatment with TRC105. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Data were presented from a single &#160; patient &#160; Phase &#160; 2 &#160; clinical &#160; trial &#160; of TRC105 with Avastin in a patient with &#160; refractory &#160; and &#160; unresectable &#160; metastatic &#160; choriocarcinoma, a form of GTN, that had recurred despite five prior chemotherapy regimens and autologous stem cell transplant, at the 18th World Congress on Gestational Trophoblastic Diseases in September 2015. The &#160; patient &#160; was &#160; treated &#160; with &#160; TRC105 &#160; dosed &#160; 10 &#160; mg/kg &#160; weekly &#160; in &#160; combination &#160; with &#160; Avastin dosed &#160; 10 &#160; mg/kg &#160; every &#160; other &#160; week. &#160; At the &#160; time &#160; of &#160; the &#160; presentation, &#160; the &#160; patient &#160; had &#160; completed &#160; 7 &#160; cycles &#160; (28 &#160; weeks) &#160; of &#160; treatment. &#160; Beta &#160; human &#160; chorionic &#160; gonadotropin &#160; ( &#946; &#8208; hCG), &#160; a &#160; known and &#160; reliable &#160; marker &#160; of &#160; disease &#160; burden &#160; in &#160; choriocarcinoma, &#160; normalized &#160; during &#160; the &#160; fourth &#160; cycle &#160; of &#160; treatment, &#160; indicating &#160; a complete &#160; response, which is ongoing at 12 months after enrollment. A second patient, also with refractory &#160; and &#160; unresectable &#160; metastatic &#160; choriocarcinoma, was treated with TRC105 and Avastin and did not respond to treatment. We plan to initiate an international multicenter Phase 2 clinical trial of TRC105 in GTN, including choriocarcinoma, in the first half of 2016, with the primary endpoint expected to be overall response rate in patients with refractory GTN. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

The following chart summarizes key information regarding ongoing and planned development of our TRC10 5 product candidate: 

&#160; 

&#160; 

We are developing TRC105 for use in combination with agents that inhibit angiogenesis by targeting the VEGF pathway. VEGF, like endoglin, is required for angiogenesis. While multiple VEGF inhibitors have been approved and have achieved commercial success, nearly all cancer patients develop resistance to this class of treatment and many do not respond at the onset. Targeting endoglin concurrently with the VEGF pathway has been shown to improve angiogenesis inhibition and the treatment of cancer in preclinical models. TRC105 binds to the endoglin receptor at a precise location to inhibit endothelial cell activation and angiogenesis. Certain manufacturers of approved VEGF inhibitors that we are studying in combination with TRC105 have agreed to supply their drug at no cost for use in the applicable clinical trials. 

&#160; 

Our TRC105 oncology clinical development plan is broad and involves a tiered approach. We are initially focused on two orphan indications, GTN and angiosarcoma, that highly express endoglin, and therefore may be more responsive to treatment with TRC105. The next tier of development includes ongoing Phase 2 trials in renal cell carcinoma, glioblastoma, and hepatocellular carcinoma that are expected to produce top-line data in 2016, and that, if positive, may enable Phase 3 development. We consider these indications attractive because the endpoints for regulatory approval may be attained more quickly than the endpoints for other indications. We also expect that these initial indications would be for the same lines of treatment for which the companion VEGF inhibitor is approved. Finally, the third tier of development includes large indications. We plan to initiate dosing in a Phase 1b trial in lung cancer and a Phase 1b/2a trial in breast cancer, in 2016 that, if positive, would enable further development . 

&#160; 

We have also collaborated with the NCI, which has selected TRC105 for federal funding of clinical development. Under these collaborations, NCI has sponsored or is sponsoring six compl eted or ongoing clinical trials of TRC105. If merited by Phase 2 data, we expect to fund initial Phase 3 clinical trials of TRC105, and, based on NCI&#8217;s past course of conduct with similarly situated pharmaceutical companies in which it has sponsored pivotal clinical trials following receipt of positive Phase 2 data, we expect that Phase 3 clinical trials of TRC105 in additional indications 

&#160;

could be sponsored by NCI. 

&#160; 

We have produced formulations of TRC105 for development in ophthalmology, which are initially being developed for the treatment of wet AMD, the leading cause of blindness in the Western world. In March 2014, Santen licensed from us exclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize our endoglin antibodies, including TRC105, for ophthalmology indications. We retain global rights to develop our endoglin antibodies outside of the field of ophthalmology. In &#160; June &#160; 2015, Santen filed &#160; an &#160; Investigational &#160; New &#160; Drug, or IND, A pplication &#160; with &#160; the &#160; U.S. &#160; Food &#160; and &#160; Drug &#160; Administration, or FDA, &#160; for &#160; the &#160; initiation &#160; of &#160; clinical &#160; studies &#160; for &#160; DE &#8208; 122 &#160; in &#160; patients &#160; with &#160; wet &#160; AMD. &#160; DE &#8208; 122 &#160; is &#160; the &#160; ophthalmic &#160; formulation &#160; of &#160; TRC105. A Phase 1 trial is recruiting patients with wet AMD, including patients receiving a VEGF inhibitor. The IND filing for DE &#8208; 122 triggered a $3.0 million milestone payment which we received in July, 2015. 

&#160; 

TRC205, a humanized, deimmunized endoglin antibody, is being developed for the treatment of fibrotic diseases. Diseases characterized by fibrosis, the harmful buildup of excessive fibrous tissue from cells, including the fibroblast, that leads to scarring and ultimately organ failure, include nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, or IPF, renal fibrosis, cardiac fibrosis and scleroderma. Clinical data demonstrated increased endoglin expression on fibroblasts in patients with heart failure and inhibiting endoglin reduced cardiac fibrosis, preserved heart function and improved survival in mouse models of heart failure. Subsequent preclinical research in mouse models indicated that antibodies to endoglin inhibit cardiac, liver, and pulmonary fibrosis. These findings indicate endoglin&#8217;s importance in cardiac, lung and liver fibrosis, and we believe these findings may be applicable to multiple fibrotic diseases, including NASH, &#160; IPF, myelofibrosis and other indications. 

&#160; 

We are also developing TRC102, a small molecule that is in clinical development for the treatment of lung cancer and glioblastoma. TRC102 is an inhibitor of DNA repair intended to reverse resistance to chemotherapy, including approved drugs used in the treatment of lung cancer and glioblastoma. In initial clinical trials of more than 100 patients, TRC102 has shown good tolerability and promising anti-tumor activity, in combination with alkylating and antimetabolite chemotherapy. Clinical trial results of TRC102 in combination with chemotherapy include the following: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Data from a Phase 1 clinical trial of TRC102 in combination with Alimta (pemetrexed), a chemotherapy drug approved for the treatment of lung cancer and mesothelioma, was published in Investigational New Drugs in 2012. The dose limiting toxicity of TRC102 was anemia, as predicted by preclinical models, and TRC102 did not appear to increase toxicities associated with Alimta. There &#160; were &#160; no &#160; pharmacokinetic &#160; interactions &#160; between &#160; the &#160; two &#160; drugs , TRC102 &#160; target &#160; concentrations &#160; were &#160; achieved, and DNA repair was inhibited. Patients who received TRC102 at its maximum tolerated dose with Alimta demonstrated reduction in tumor masses, including partial response, and lung cancer patients with squamous histology, a tumor type resistant to Alimta treatment, demonstrated stable disease. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Data from a trial of intravenous TRC102 given in combination with the approved chemotherapy drug Fludara (fludarabine) in a Phase 1 clinical trial sponsored by Case Western Reserve University, or Case Western, were presented at the &#160; American Society for Hematology, or ASH, annual &#160; meeting in December 2014. &#160; The &#160; combination &#160; of &#160; TRC102 &#160; and Fludara was &#160; well &#160; tolerated, &#160; there &#160; were &#160; no &#160; pharmacokinetic &#160; interactions &#160; between &#160; the &#160; two &#160; drugs, &#160; and &#160; TRC102 &#160; target &#160; concentrations &#160; were &#160; achieved. &#160; Antitumor &#160; activity, including partial response, was noted &#160; in &#160; patients &#160; with lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, including in patients treated previously with Fludara. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Data from a trial of TRC102 given orally in combination with the approved chemotherapy drug Temodar (temozolomide) in a Phase 1 clinical trial sponsored by NCI were presented at the &#160; American Association for Cancer Research, or AACR, annual &#160; meeting in April 2015. &#160; The &#160; combination &#160; of &#160; TRC102 &#160; and &#160; Temodar &#160; was &#160; well &#160; tolerated, &#160; there &#160; were &#160; no &#160; pharmacokinetic &#160; interactions &#160; between &#160; the &#160; two &#160; drugs , and TRC102 &#160; target &#160; concentrations &#160; were &#160; achieved. &#160; Partial response &#160; was &#160; noted &#160; in &#160; patients &#160; with &#160; ovarian &#160; cancer &#160; and &#160; squamous cell lung cancer. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Data from a trial of TRC102 given intravenously in combination with Temodar in a Phase &#160; 1 clinical trial sponsored by Case Western were presented at the &#160; ASCO &#160; annual &#160; meeting in June &#160; 2015. &#160; &#160; The &#160; combination &#160; 

&#160;

of &#160; TRC102 &#160; and &#160; Temodar &#160; was &#160; well &#160; tolerated, &#160; there &#160; were &#160; no &#160; pharmacokinetic &#160; interactions &#160; between &#160; the &#160; two &#160; drugs &#160; and &#160; TRC102 &#160; target &#160; concentrations &#160; were &#160; achieved. &#160; Anti-tumor &#160; activity &#160; was &#160; noted &#160; in &#160; patients &#160; with &#160; ovarian &#160; cancer &#160; and &#160; neuroendocrine &#160; tumors. 

&#160; 

The following chart summarizes key information regarding ongoing and planned development of our TRC102 product candidate: 

&#160; 

&#160; 

TRC102 has begun Phase 2 development through two Phase 2 trials sponsored by the NCI; one that combines TRC102 with Alimta in patients with mesothelioma and one that combines TRC102 with Temodar in patients with glioblastoma. A Phase 1b trial sponsored by the NCI that combines TRC102 with Alimta and cisplatin in patients with solid tumors has also been initiated, and we expect NCI to sponsor an additional Phase 1 clinical trial of TRC102 with chemotherapy and radiation therapy in lung cancer. We retain global rights to develop TRC102. If merited by Phase 2 data, we expect to fund initial Phase 3 clinical trials and, based on NCI&#8217;s past course of conduct with similarly situated pharmaceutical companies in which it has sponsored pivotal clinical trials following receipt of positive Phase 2 data, we expect that Phase 3 clinical trials in additional indications could be sponsored by NCI. 

&#160; 

We operate a clinical development model that emphasizes capital efficiency. Our experienced clinical operations and regulatory affairs groups are responsible for significant aspects of our clinical trials, including site monitoring, regulatory compliance, database management and clinical study report preparation. We use this internal resource to eliminate the cost associated with hiring contract research organizations, or CROs, to manage clinical, regulatory and database aspects of the Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials that we sponsor in the United States. In our experience, this model has resulted in capital efficiencies and improved communication with clinical trial sites, which expedites patient enrollment and access to patient data as compared to a CRO-managed model, and we plan to leverage this capital efficient model for future product development. 

&#160; 

We received orphan drug designation from the FDA for TRC105 for the treatment of soft tissue sarcoma in January 2016 and have applied for orphan drug designation for TRC105 for the treatment of GTN. We also expect to apply for orphan drug designation for TRC102 for the treatment of glioblastoma and mesothelioma. If granted, orphan drug designation may provide financial incentives, such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages and FDA user-fee waivers, as well as the potential for a period of market exclusivity. In addition, we were granted FDA Fast Track designation for TRC105 for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma and intend to seek appropriate expedited development program designation for all of our eligible product candidates. Fast Track and other expedited programs for serious conditions are procedures designed to facilitate the development and expedite the FDA&#8217;s review of drugs to treat serious conditions and fill unmet medical needs. However, there is no guarantee that we will receive or be able to maintain these designations or realize the related potential benefits. For example, even if we do receive Fast Track designation, we may not experience a faster development process, review or approval compared to conventional FDA procedures. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Our Strategy 

&#160; 

Our goal is to be a leader in the development of targeted therapies for patients with cancer and other diseases of high unmet medical need. As key components of our strategy, we intend to: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Focus the initial tier of clinical development of TRC105 on orphan oncology indications that highly express endoglin and have demonstrated durable complete responses to treatment, and have potential reduced time to regulatory approval. We plan to initiate Phase 3 development of TRC105 in angiosarcoma, a type of soft tissue sarcoma that highly expresses endoglin, in combination with the approved VEGF inhibitor Votrient, and to initiate an international multicenter Phase 2 clinical trial of TRC105 as a single agent and in combination with Avastin in GTN, that could be registration enabling, in 2016 . The FDA has granted approval for drugs in soft tissue sarcoma based on progression-free survival, or the time a patient lived without the cancer progressing, rather than overall survival. A progression-free survival primary endpoint can be achieved sooner than an overall survival endpoint, thereby reducing the time to complete clinical trials and submit applications for regulatory approval. In the case of GTN, response can be reliably assessed by serum &#946; &#8208; hCG, a known and reliable marker of disease burden, and we expect that regulatory approval would be based on overall response rate in a single arm trial. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Focus the second tier of clinical development of TRC105 on oncology indications that have potential reduced time to regulatory approval. We plan to continue ongoing Phase 2 development of TRC105 in combination with approved VEGF inhibitors in the oncology indications of soft tissue sarcoma, renal cell carcinoma, glioblastoma, and hepatocellular carcinoma, each of which is associated with reduced time to achieve the endpoints necessary for regulatory approval, with the goal of enabling one or more Phase 3 clinical trials in these indications. The FDA has granted approval for drugs in soft tissue sarcoma and renal cell carcinoma based on a primary endpoint of progression-free survival, rather than overall survival. Although the endpoint for approval for glioblastoma and hepatocellular carcinoma is overall survival, this endpoint is typically reached sooner for glioblastoma and hepatocellular carcinoma than for many other solid tumors. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Focus the third tier of clinical development of TRC105 on large market oncology indications. To maximize the commercial opportunity of TRC105, we intend to continue developing TRC105 in additional oncology indications with large patient populations. We plan to initiate dosing in a Phase 1 trial of TRC105 in combination with chemotherapy and Avastin in lung cancer, and in a Phase 1/2 trial of TRC105 with Afinitor (everolimus) and Femara (letrozole) in breast cancer in the first half of 2016. We expect top-line data in these large indications in 2017 that, if positive, would enable further development. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Continue to leverage our collaborative relationship with NCI to accelerate and broaden development of TRC105 and TRC102. Our collaboration with NCI allows us to pursue more indications with our assets than we would otherwise be able to pursue on our own. We anticipate that NCI will complete ongoing Phase 2 clinical trials of TRC105 and TRC102 and may initiate other Phase 2 clinical trials in addition to the Phase 2 clinical trials of TRC105 that we are sponsoring. If merited by Phase 2 data, we expect to fund initial Phase 3 clinical trials of TRC105 and TRC102 and, based on NCI&#8217;s past course of conduct with similarly situated pharmaceutical companies in which it has sponsored pivotal clinical trials following receipt of positive Phase 2 data, we anticipate that NCI will sponsor Phase 3 clinical trials in additional indications. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Support Santen during preclinical and clinical development to advance DE-122 in wet AMD. We are using our expertise in the development of endoglin antibodies to assist Santen in the development of DE-122. Santen filed an IND in June 2015 for the development of DE-122 and began recruiting wet AMD patients into a Phase 1 trial of DE-122 in 2015. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Continue preclinical studies of TRC205 in fibrotic diseases. TRC205, a humanized and deimmunized endoglin antibody, is our lead product candidate for the treatment of fibrotic diseases, including NASH and IPF, each of which presents a large commercial opportunity. We expect to complete testing of TRC205 in 

&#160;

preclinical fibrosis models, including a preclinical model of NASH, in 2016. Positive preclinical data may allow for IND enabling manufacturing activities and additional preclinical studies to begin in 2016 either alone or through a corporate partnership. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Leverage internal capabilities to advance other programs efficiently and cost effectively through clinical development. We have assembled a management team that has contributed to the approval of seven therapeutics, including VEGF inhibitors in cancer and in wet AMD, and that has core competencies relating to clinical operations and regulatory affairs. We expect to continue to benefit from these capabilities through the development of additional early and mid-stage product candidates, both from internal programs and potential in-licensed programs. 

&#160; 

Rationale for Developing Endoglin Antibodies to Treat Cancer, Wet AMD and Fibrotic Diseases 

&#160; 

We focus on developing antibodies that target the endoglin receptor. Endoglin is a protein that is overexpressed on endothelial cells, the cells that line the interior surface of blood vessels, when they experience hypoxia, which is a condition characterized by inadequate oxygen supply. Endoglin allows endothelial cells to proliferate in a hypoxic environment and is required for angiogenesis. These properties render endoglin an attractive target for the treatment of diseases that require angiogenesis, including solid cancers and wet AMD, especially in combination with VEGF inhibitors. Endoglin is also expressed on fibroblasts, the cells that mediate fibrosis, and is a key contributor to the development of fibrosis. Inhibiting endoglin limits transforming growth factor beta, or TGF-&#946;, signaling and production of fibrotic proteins by human cardiac fibroblasts. Endoglin antibodies have inhibited fibrosis in mouse models of cardiac and liver fibrosis. 

&#160; 

Inhibiting Angiogenesis to Limit Tumor Growth and Treat Wet AMD 

&#160; 

The progressive growth of solid cancers to clinically recognized sizes requires angiogenesis. Similarly, abnormal angiogenesis causes wet AMD. Thus, inhibition of angiogenesis is an effective strategy for the treatment of solid cancer and wet AMD. 

&#160; 

Therapies that inhibit angiogenesis are attractive for multiple reasons: 

&#160; 

&#61623; Except for ovulation and wound healing, angiogenesis in adults is generally not necessary or desirable and otherwise only occurs in connection with an abnormal process such as tumor growth or choroidal neovascularization, the process of angiogenesis that causes wet AMD. 

&#160; 

&#61623; Treatments that interrupt tumor angiogenesis may inhibit the growth of many solid cancers. 

&#160; 

&#61623; Angiogenic targets are present either in the plasma or on the surface of endothelial cells, and therefore are readily accessible to antibody treatments, in contrast to targets expressed within tumors that are more difficult for antibodies to access. 

&#160; 

&#61623; Angiogenic targets on endothelial cells are less prone to genetic mutation than targets expressed by genetically unstable cancer cells. As a result, development of resistance may be lower for agents that target endothelial cell functions than for those targeting cancer cells. 

&#160; 

Success and Limitations of VEGF Inhibitors 

&#160; 

Several anti-angiogenesis therapies that inhibit the VEGF pathway are currently marketed for the treatment of cancer. The VEGF inhibitor Avastin significantly prolongs overall survival for patients with advanced colorectal cancer and lung cancer when added to chemotherapy regimens. Avastin is also an approved therapy for glioblastoma, renal cell carcinoma, and ovarian cancer. Zaltrap (ziv-aflibercept) and Cyramza (ramucirumab), other large molecule VEGF inhibitors, are approved for the treatment of colorectal cancer and gastric cancer, colorectal cancer and lung cancer, respectively, and orally available small molecule VEGF inhibitors, including Sutent (sunitinib malate), Nexavar, Votrient, Stivarga, Cometriq (cabozantinib), Lenvima (lenvatinib) and Inlyta, have been shown to prolong survival in 

&#160;

patients with metastatic soft tissue sarcoma, renal cell carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, neuroendocrine cancer, thyroid cancer, and colorectal cancer. Despite the clinical and commercial success of anti-angiogenesis agents that primarily target the VEGF pathway, nearly all cancer patients develop resistance to this class of treatment and many do not respond at the onset. According to current research, resistance to anti-angiogenic agents occurs through the emergence of escape pathways rather than by acquired mutations to the VEGF receptor or its ligand. We believe that the endoglin pathway serves as the dominant escape pathway that allows continued angiogenesis despite inhibition of the VEGF pathway. Specifically, inhibition of the VEGF pathway causes hypoxia, which in turn increases endoglin expression, allowing continued angiogenesis through the endoglin pathway despite inhibition of the VEGF pathway. 

&#160; 

The Endoglin Pathway 

&#160; 

Endoglin modulates signaling of receptor complexes of the TGF-&#946; protein family. Endoglin participates in signal transduction mediated by TGF-&#946; and bone morphogenic proteins, or BMP. Endoglin serves two functions through its expression on endothelial cells: binding of TGF-&#946; to endoglin reinforces a static state in the endothelium, while binding of BMP to endoglin activates the endothelial cells and promotes angiogenesis. 

&#160; 

As illustrated in the figure below, the binding of TGF-&#946; to endoglin, as part of a receptor complex that includes activin receptor-like kinase 5, or ALK5, and TGF-&#946;R2, a member of the TGF-&#946; receptor family, causes activation of intracellular proteins that reinforce a static state in the endothelium, as shown on the left. Binding of BMP to endoglin, as part of a receptor complex that includes ALK1 and BMPR2, a member of the BMP receptor family, on proliferating endothelium activates proteins that override growth inhibition stimulated by TGF-&#946; binding to endothelium, and allows organized endothelial proliferation, as shown on the right.

Inhibition and proliferation of endothelial cells through the endoglin pathway 

&#160; 

&#160;

Targeted inactivation of endoglin results in defective vascular development. In a preclinical study, mice embryos lacking endoglin died from the absence of angiogenesis by day 11.5. The figure below depicts endoglin immunostains of mice embryos at day 8.5. The mouse embryo on the upper left is a normal mouse embryo, with endoglin expression indicated by black staining. The mouse embryo on the upper right had both copies of the endoglin gene inactivated, and a lack of endoglin expression is indicated by the absence of black staining. Photomicrographs of the mice embryos at day 10.5 show developed vasculature in normal mice (bottom left) and pockets of red blood cells without discernible vessels in endoglin-deficient mice (bottom right).

&#160; 

Endoglin has also been shown to be critical for normal blood vessel development in humans. For example, the inheritance of one normal copy and one abnormal copy of the endoglin gene results in diminished endoglin function and causes Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome, a rare disease characterized by dilated small blood vessels of the skin and mucosal surfaces that cause nosebleeds, typically beginning in the second decade of life. Compared to patients with a normal complement of endoglin genes, patients with Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome have improved overall cancer survival, with a reported 31% reduced risk of death following cancer diagnosis, after controlling for known prognostic factors. 

&#160; 

Endoglin is highly overexpressed on the membrane of proliferating endothelial cells in tumor vessels. A high level of endoglin expression has been associated with poor prognosis in patients with substantially all solid tumor types, including the following:

Targeting the Endoglin Pathway to Address Limitations of VEGF Inhibitors 

&#160; 

Preclinical studies indicate that endoglin expression promotes resistance to inhibition of the VEGF pathway, suggesting that targeting the endoglin pathway in addition to the VEGF pathway may be a more effective means to inhibit angiogenesis in tumors than targeting the VEGF pathway alone, particularly given the frequent development of resistance to VEGF inhibitors. For example, in a preclinical model of human pancreatic cancer, endoglin expression within tumors increased following treatment with a VEGF inhibitor. Further studies indicated that the endoglin ligand TGF-&#946;, which inhibits angiogenesis, was the most highly overexpressed protein (over 16-fold increased expression, whereas no other protein was more than four-fold elevated) in pancreatic cancers from mice treated with a VEGF inhibitor. Unlike the endoglin pathway, many angiogenic pathways were not affected by VEGF inhibition, indicating that these pathways are unlikely to mediate escape from VEGF inhibition. Proteins that were not elevated included the angiopoietins, a family of angiogenic factors that are distinct from endoglin and VEGF. Consistent with this observation, therapies targeting the angiopoietins have not demonstrated anti-tumor activity when combined with VEGF inhibitors in clinical trials. 

&#160; 

We believe the endoglin pathway serves as the dominant escape pathway that allows continued angiogenesis despite inhibition of the VEGF pathway. In support of this hypothesis, researchers analyzed blood vessels from human bladder cancers implanted in mice following VEGF inhibitor treatment. Data indicated that endoglin-expressing vessels persisted at the tumor periphery and increased within the core of the tumor, allowing continued tumor growth despite treatment with a large molecule VEGF inhibitor. In another preclinical study, mice with a predisposition to develop tumors were bred to have only one normal copy, rather than two normal copies, of the endoglin gene. Tumors in mice with two normal copies of the endoglin gene exhibited resistance to large and small molecule VEGF inhibitors. This resistance was not observed in the mice where endoglin function was inhibited by deleting one copy of the endoglin gene. Likewise, mice in which both copies of the endoglin gene were deleted in endothelial cells developed smaller lung tumors following treatment with a small molecule VEGF inhibitor, as compared to mice with normal levels of endoglin. In these models, VEGF inhibitors demonstrated anti-tumor activity only following inhibition of the endoglin pathway. These results illustrate the therapeutic utility of targeting both angiogenic pathways concurrently for the treatment of cancer. 

&#160; 

BMP has been identified as a key endoglin ligand that binds to the endoglin receptor to promote angiogenesis. Therefore, it is a rational drug development strategy to target the receptor with an antibody that binds more tightly to endoglin at the BMP binding site than BMP itself, thereby preventing BMP from activating endothelial cells. TRC105 is a novel human chimeric immunoglobulin G subclass 1 antibody, or IgG1, that binds to endoglin with high affinity and inhibits BMP binding to endoglin, thereby inhibiting endothelial cell activation. As expected, studies have shown that endoglin antibodies that do not bind at the BMP binding site do not inhibit angiogenesis in preclinical models. 

&#160; 

We believe that a combination of VEGF and endoglin inhibitors may have application in wet AMD as well as a number of oncology indications where VEGF inhibitors are currently approved by regulatory authorities. Tumor types for which VEGF inhibitors have been approved include colorectal cancer, gastrointestinal stromal tumor, glioblastoma, 

&#160;

hepatocellular carcinoma, lung cancer, neuroendocrine tumors, renal cell carcinoma, soft tissue sarcoma, ovarian cancer and thyroid cancer.

Anti-Angiogenesis VEGF Inhibitors in Oncology Indications 

&#160; 

Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the Western world and may affect any organ in the human body. Localized cancer is generally treated and cured with surgery. However, metastatic cancer that has spread beyond the location where it started is generally incurable. Metastatic cancer is treated with chemotherapeutics or targeted agents that specifically inhibit pathways implicated in tumor growth or angiogenesis. 

&#160; 

There are several FDA-approved anti-angiogenesis drugs that inhibit the VEGF pathway, with over $10.0 billion in reported aggregate worldwide sales in oncology in 2015. VEGF inhibitors are approved in the following oncology indications, among others: 

&#160; 

&#61623; Soft Tissue Sarcoma, including angiosarcoma. The American Cancer Society, or the ACS, estimates there were approximately 12,000 new cases of soft tissue sarcoma in the United States in 2015 with more than 4,800 deaths. Localized tumors are curable, but patients with metastatic disease have a median survival of approximately 12 months following diagnosis. Standard systemic chemotherapy regimens are poorly tolerated and of limited usefulness with response rates of approximately 20% to 30%. Votrient, a small molecule VEGF inhibitor, was approved in the United States for the second line treatment of soft tissue sarcoma in 2013. Votrient is also approved for angiosarcoma where there are an estimated 400 cases annually in the United States. 

&#160; 

&#61623; Renal Cell Carcinoma. The ACS estimates there were 61,560 new cases of renal cell carcinoma in the United States in 2015 with 14,080 deaths. Sutent, Nexavar and Votrient are small molecule VEGF inhibitors approved as single agents for the first line treatment of advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma, Inlyta is a small molecule VEGF inhibitor approved for second line treatment, and Avastin is approved with interferon. Inlyta was approved in 2012 for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma, with reported global sales of $430 million in 2015, compared to $410 million in 2014. 

&#160; 

&#61623; Glioblastoma. Glioblastoma represents one of the highest unmet needs in oncology. Glioblastoma is the most common and most lethal malignant brain cancer in adults. The Central Brain Tumor Registry of the United States estimates that there are about 12,000 new cases diagnosed each year in the United States. The median survival following diagnosis is reported to be approximately 14 months. Avastin has been approved in the United States for the second line treatment of glioblastoma following cancer progression on prior therapy. 

&#160; 

&#61623; Hepatocellular Carcinoma. The ACS estimates there were 35,660 new cases of hepatocellular carcinoma in the United States in 2015 with 24,550 deaths. The only drug approved in the United States for the first line treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma is the VEGF inhibitor Nexavar. In 2014, reported global sales of Nexavar were $1.0 billion worldwide. 

&#160; 

&#61623; Colorectal Cancer. The ACS estimates there were 132,700 new cases of colon cancer or rectal cancer in the United States in 2015 with 49,700 deaths. Avastin is approved with chemotherapy for the first and second line treatment of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer, Cyramza is approved with chemotherapy for second line treatment of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer, and Zaltrap is approved with chemotherapy for the second line treatment of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. Stivarga is approved following prior treatment with chemotherapy and VEGF inhibitors. 

&#160; 

&#61623; Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer. The ACS estimates there were 221,200 new cases of lung cancer in the United States in 2015 with 158,040 deaths. Avastin is approved for the first line treatment of patients with locally advanced, recurrent, or metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer, in combination with chemotherapy and Cyramza is approved for the first line treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. 

&#160;

&#160; 

VEGF inhibitors are also used off-label in other indications, including GTN. GTN is a form of GTD, a group of rare diseases that originate in the placenta and have the potential to locally invade the uterus and metastasize. The pathogenesis of GTD is unique because the maternal tumor arises from gestational rather than maternal tissue. The major histologic entities for this disease include complete molar pregnancy, partial molar pregnancy, invasive mole, and choriocarcinoma. The term gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN) is used when molar and non-molar pregnancies become malignant, and comprise the morphologic entities of invasive mole and choriocarcinoma. Choriocarcinoma metastasizes hematogenously and can follow any type of pregnancy, but most commonly develops after complete hydatidiform mole. The reported incidence of GTD in the United States is about 110 to 120 per 100,000 pregnancies. The reported incidence of choriocarcinoma, the most aggressive form of GTD, in the United States is about 2 to 7 per 100,000 pregnancies.

TRC105 Development in Oncology 

&#160; 

Clinical Development Overview 

&#160; 

TRC105 is our investigational novel human chimeric IgG1 monoclonal antibody that is currently being dosed weekly or every two weeks by intravenous, or IV, infusion. Commercialized chimeric antibodies include Rituxan (rituximab), Erbitux (cetuximab) and Adcetris (brentuximab vedotin), which collectively had reported global sales of over $8.0 billion in 2015. TRC105 is in five ongoing clinical trials in combination with VEGF inhibitors and has been studied in nine completed clinical trials as a single agent or with VEGF inhibitors.

Each of these trials was designed with a Phase 1 open-label portion, which demonstrated that the recommended single agent dose of TRC105 can be administered in combination with the approved dose of the companion VEGF inhibitor. 

&#160; 

** 

This trial was designed to randomize 88 patients, but enrollment was closed following the accrual of 62 patients after an interim analysis concluded that the trial was unlikely to achieve the primary endpoint. Patients who were already enrolled are continuing treatment. 

&#160; 

The collective clinical data support the development of TRC105 in combination with VEGF inhibitors rather than development as a single agent. Initially, TRC105 was studied in the last line treatment setting, where patients tend to be resistant to additional treatments, but ongoing development focuses on the treatment of cancer patients with TRC105 and VEGF inhibitors in the first and second line treatment settings, where increased susceptibility to anti-angiogenic treatment is expected. 

&#160; 

Clinical trials of TRC105 as a single agent in patients whose cancer had progressed on multiple prior therapies indicated limited single agent activity in treatment-resistant patients with prostate cancer, metastatic bladder cancer, advanced or metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma, glioblastoma and ovarian cancer. However, single agent activity, as evidenced by progression-free survival greater than 18 months or partial response, was achieved in individual treatment-resistant patients with soft tissue sarcoma, hepatocellular carcinoma and prostate cancer. Additionally, TRC105 may be more effective as a single agent in tumor types known to overexpress endoglin. 

&#160; 

Ongoing Phase 2 clinical trials are assessing the activity of TRC105 with a particular VEGF inhibitor in patients who have not previously been treated with that particular VEGF inhibitor. In general, it is expected to be more difficult to resensitize a patient whose cancer has already progressed on a prior VEGF inhibitor than it is to prevent resistance in a patient who has not previously been treated with that VEGF inhibitor. In addition, cancer progresses rapidly in some patients following treatment with a VEGF inhibitor, to the point that these patients are unavailable for subsequent therapy. Thus, we believe the greatest potential for TRC105 will be in combination with VEGF inhibitors prior to the development of resistance to the companion VEGF inhibitor. 

&#160; 

Ongoing Clinical Trials of TRC105 

&#160; 

Phase 2 Clinical Trial of TRC105 with Inlyta in Patients with Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma 

&#160; 

We are conducting a two-part Phase 2 clinical trial of TRC105 in combination with Inlyta, an approved VEGF inhibitor, in patients with advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma. We have completed enrollment of Part 1 of the trial, which is being conducted at five sites in the United States and enrolled 18 patients. Three patients were initially enrolled at an 8 mg/kg TRC105 dose level and three patients were initially enrolled at a 10 mg/kg TRC105 dose level to demonstrate that the recommended single agent dose of TRC105 of 10 mg/kg given weekly was well tolerated when administered with the approved single agent dose of Inlyta. Twelve additional patients were then enrolled at the 

&#160;

10 mg/kg TRC105 dose level with the approved single agent dose of Inlyta. Part 1 of the trial has also been amended to enroll additional patients who will be dosed with TRC105 every two weeks. 

&#160; 

We believe that data from Part 1 that were presented at the Kidney Cancer Association annual meeting in November 2015 are encouraging. Based on a Phase 3 trial of Inlyta, the expected median progression-free survival of patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma treated with Inlyta who have progressed following treatment with only one prior inhibitor of the VEGF pathway is 4.8 months. The overall final progression-free survival of patients enrolled in Part 1 of our trial of TRC105 with Inlyta, all of whom failed at least one prior inhibitor of the VEGF pathway, was 8.4 months, and in patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma, was 9.6 months by Kaplan Meier lifetable analysis. The best overall response among the 17 patients who were followed for at least two months in Part 1 of the trial is described below. Percentage decreases in tumor size are reported relative to the baseline measurement at the beginning of the study. 

&#160; 

&#61623; Five patients had tumor reductions that qualified as partial responses according to RECIST 1.1. All patients had cancer progression following previous treatment with at least one small molecule VEGF inhibitor and four patients were treated in the fourth line setting. Two patients also progressed following treatment with Opdivo (nivolumab), an antibody directed at the programmed cell death 1 receptor (PD-1). One of these patients, whose previous best response was stable disease with the VEGF inhibitor Votrient, following which cancer progression was documented, and also had cancer progression on interleukin-2 and Opdivo, remained on trial for 14 months with a partial response as assessed by RECIST 1.1. The second patient, whose previous best response was stable disease with the VEGF inhibitor Sutent, then demonstrated cancer progression after three months of treatment with Votrient as well as cancer progression on Opdivo, remained on trial for 11 months with a partial response as assessed by RECIST 1.1. The third patient, whose previous best response was stable disease with the VEGF inhibitor Sutent, following which cancer progression was documented, and who also progressed following treatment with Afinitor, a drug approved for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma that inhibits a metabolic pathway, remained on trial for 17 months with a partial response as assessed by RECIST 1.1. The fourth patient, whose previous best response was stable disease with the VEGF inhibitor Sutent, following which cancer progression was documented, remained on trial for 11 months with a partial response as assessed by RECIST 1.1. The fifth patient, whose previous best response was stable disease with the VEGF inhibitor Sutent, who also was treated with the VEGF inhibitor Votrient, following which cancer progression was documented, remained on trial for ten months with a partial response as assessed by RECIST 1.1. 

&#160; 

&#61623; Ten patients had tumor reductions that qualified as partial responses as assessed by the Choi criteria including the five patients with partial responses as assessed by RECIST 1.1. Choi criteria are response criteria developed at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center to evaluate the activity of angiogenesis inhibitors. Choi criteria have been shown to correlate more strongly with progression-free survival and overall survival than RECIST 1.1 in several clinical trials of angiogenesis inhibitors. Progression-free survival is the anticipated endpoint for Phase 3 clinical trials in patients with soft tissue sarcoma and renal cell carcinoma. All patients enrolled in the trial had cancer progression following prior treatment with at least one small molecule VEGF inhibitor. 

&#160; 

&#61623; Three patients had stable disease. 

&#160; 

&#61623; Four patients had radiographic or clinical cancer progression within two months following initiation of treatment. 

&#160; 

&#61623; Improved anti-tumor activity was noted in patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma, the most common type of renal cell carcinoma, which is noted to be more responsive to treatment with angiogenesis inhibitors. Eight of 12 patients (67%) with clear cell histology demonstrated partial responses as assessed by Choi criteria, including four partial responses (33%) as assessed by RECIST 1.1. Progression-free survival was also longer in patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma (9.6 months). 

&#160; 

&#160;

The best response by maximum percent change decrease in tumor lesion size of each of 17 patients enrolled in the trial with measureable disease who underwent efficacy assessment is noted in the figure below. 

&#160;

treated with TRC105 and Inlyta 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Based on the tolerability and anti-tumor activity observed in Part 1 of the trial , Part 2 of the trial began enrollment in November 2014 and is expected to enroll 150 advanced clear cell renal cell carcinoma patients at approximately 30 sites in the United States and Europe to compare TRC105 in combination with Inlyta to Inlyta alone. Enrollment is expected to be completed in 2016. The patients are randomly allocated in equal numbers to the two treatment arms, and the primary endpoint of Part 2 of the trial is progression-free survival as assessed by RECIST 1.1. If successful, Part 2 of the trial may support initiation of a Phase 3 clinical trial. 

&#160; 

Phase 2 Clinical Trial of TRC105 with Votrient in Patients with Soft Tissue Sarcoma 

&#160; 

We are conducting a two-part Phase 2 clinical trial of TRC105 in combination with Votrient, an approved VEGF inhibitor, in patients with soft tissue sarcoma. Part 1 of the trial completed enrollment of 18 evaluable patients. Three patients were initially enrolled at an 8 mg/kg TRC105 dose level and three patients were initially enrolled at a 10 mg/kg TRC105 dose level to demonstrate that the recommended single agent dose of TRC105 of 10 mg/kg was well tolerated with the approved single agent dose of Votrient. Dose limiting toxicity was not observed and a total of 15 patients were enrolled at the 10 mg/kg dose level. The most common adverse events were generally low grade and included epistaxis, gingival bleeding, headache, anemia and fatigue. Adverse events characteristic of each individual drug were not increased in frequency or severity when the two drugs were administrated concurrently. TRC105 and Votrient demonstrated encouraging preliminary signs of activity in a highly pretreated population, including partial responses by Choi criteria in six of 18 (33%) patients, including a complete response by RECIST 1.1 that was ongoing at 75 weeks of treatment in a patient with cutaneous angiosarcoma. 

&#160; 

&#160;

The best response by maximum percent change decrease in tumor lesion size of each of 18 patients enrolled in Part 1 of the trial with measureable disease who underwent efficacy assessment is noted in the figure below. 

&#160; 

Maximum percentage change in target lesion size in soft tissue sarcoma patients 

treated with TRC105 and Votrient 

&#160; 

Based on the tolerability and anti-tumor activity observed to date, Part 2 of the trial began enrollment in September 2014. Part 2 of the trial completed accrual of the planned 63 patients at eight sites in the United States in November 2015 , and top-line data indicate that median PFS unstratified by histology or tumor endoglin expression (3.9 months) is similar to the PFS expected for Votrient alone, based on data from the Votrient PALETTE Phase 3 trial in soft tissue sarcoma. We expect to report data on the primary endpoint of median PFS stratified by sarcoma histology, including in patients with angiosarcoma, and stratified by tumor endoglin expression, at a major cancer conference in the first half of 2016. All five patients with angiosarcoma, a sarcoma subtype that highly expresses endoglin, enrolled in the trial had reductions in tumor burden, the median PFS to date for these five patients is at least 9.3 months, and two of these five patients have durable complete responses to treatment by RECIST 1.1 that are ongoing at 45 and 75 weeks of treatment. An additional ongoing complete response at 51 weeks of treatment was seen in a patient with undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma, a sarcoma subtype known to highly express endoglin in certain cases. For comparison, there were no complete responses in sarcoma patients treated with Votrient (n=246) in the Votrient PALETTE Phase 3 trial. The Phase 2 study of TRC105 and Votrient was amended to enroll an additional cohort of 13 patients with angiosarcoma, as well as additional patients who will be dosed with TRC105 every two weeks, both of which are enrolling at this time. 

&#160; 

Phase 2 Randomized Clinical Trial of TRC105 with Avastin in Patients with Glioblastoma 

&#160; 

NCI is sponsoring a two-part Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with glioblastoma that includes more than 50 sites in the United States. Part 1 of the trial was a dose escalation study of TRC105 in combination with Avastin in 12 patients and completed enrollment in January 2014. In Part 2 of the trial, approximately 86 glioblastoma patients who have received chemotherapy or radiation therapy and have not been treated previously with Avastin or another VEGF inhibitor have been randomized in equal proportions to receive TRC105 and Avastin or Avastin alone. Enrollment into Part 2 of the trial began in the third quarter of 2014. The primary endpoint is progression-free survival, and we expect that NCI will have topline data by late 2016.

Phase 2 Clinical Trial of TRC105 with Nexavar in Patients with Hepatocellular Carcinoma 

&#160; 

NCI is conducting a two-part Phase 2 clinical trial of TRC105 in combination with Nexavar, an approved VEGF inhibitor, in up to 42 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Part 1 of the trial was completed following the 

&#160;

enrollment of 20 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, 15 of which were evaluable by RECIST 1.1, and Part 2 of the trial was initiated in the third quarter of 2014 and is expected to enroll up to 23 patients. Part 1 of the trial was designed as an ascending dose trial with an expansion stage with the primary endpoint of evaluating the safety and tolerability of 3, 6, 10 and 15 mg/kg TRC105 every two weeks in combination with the approved dose of Nexavar to select a dose level of TRC105 (in combination with Nexavar) for further study if merited. Data reported at the ASCO annual meeting in June 2015 indicated that TRC105 was well tolerated at all doses tested (3, 6, 10 and 15 mg/kg) in combination with approved doses of Nexavar. As shown in the figure below, anti-tumor activity was noted, including reductions in tumor burden in the majority of treated patients, and partial response by RECIST 1.1 in four of the ten patients (40%) with measurable disease treated at recommended Phase 2 doses of TRC105 (10 mg/kg or 15 mg/kg dosed once every two weeks). This response rate exceeded the response rate reported for Nexavar in its pivotal Phase 3 trial of 2%, as assessed by RECIST 1.1. The primary endpoint of Part 2 of the trial is overall response rate as assessed by RECIST 1.1.

Phase 2 Clinical Trials of TRC105 with Avastin in Single Patients with Metastatic Choriocarcinoma 

&#160; 

We are conducting a single patient Phase 2 clinical trial of TRC105 in combination with Avastin in a woman with choriocarcinoma, a form of GTN. Choriocarcinoma is a rare tumor of reproductive tissue that is typically vascular and may highly express endoglin on the tumor tissue. Data was reported at the 18th World Congress on Gestational Trophoblastic Diseases in September 2015 in the patient who had persistent and unresectable metastatic choriocarcinoma that had recurred despite five prior chemotherapy regimens and autologous stem cell transplant. The &#160; patient &#160; was &#160; treated &#160; with &#160; TRC105 &#160; dosed &#160; 10 &#160; mg/kg &#160; weekly &#160; in &#160; combination &#160; with &#160; Avastin dosed &#160; 10 &#160; mg/kg &#160; every &#160; other &#160; week. &#160; At &#160; the &#160; time &#160; of &#160; the &#160; presentation, &#160; the &#160; patient &#160; had &#160; completed &#160; 7 &#160; cycles &#160; (28 &#160; weeks) &#160; of &#160; treatment. &#160; Beta &#160; human &#160; chorionic &#160; gonadotropin &#160; ( &#946;&#8208; hCG), &#160; a &#160; known and reliable &#160; marker &#160; of &#160; disease &#160; burden &#160; in &#160; choriocarcinoma, &#160; normalized &#160; during &#160; the &#160; fourth &#160; cycle &#160; of &#160; treatment , indicating &#160; a &#160; durable &#160; complete &#160; response that is ongoing at month 12 of treatment. A second patient also with refractory &#160; and &#160; unresectable &#160; metastatic &#160; choriocarcinoma was treated with TRC105 and Avastin and did not respond to treatment.

Open Clinical Trials of TRC105 That Have Not Yet Dosed 

&#160; 

Phase 2 Clinical Trial of TRC105 with Afinitor and Femara in Postmenopausal Women with Newly Diagnosed Local or Locally Advanced Potentially Resectable Hormone-Receptor Positive and Her-2 Negative Breast Cancer 

&#160; 

We plan to initiate dosing in a two -part Phase 2 clinical trial of TRC105 as a neoadjuvant in combination with Afinitor and Femara, each of which is approved for the treatment of breast cancer in a study sponsored by the University of Alabama, Birmingham Cancer Center, or UAB. The trial is expected to enroll patients with locally advanced breast cancer who will receive TRC105 in combination with Afinitor and Femara prior to surgical removal of the tumor. Part 1 of the trial is expected to enroll up to 18 patients to determine whether the recommended Phase 2 dose of TRC105 of 10 mg/kg given weekly can be administered safely concurrently with Afinitor and Femara and assess pharmacokinetic parameters. Part 2 of the trial is expected to enroll up to 20 patients with locally advanced potentially resectable hormone-receptor positive and Her-2 negative breast cancer to determine the pathologic complete response rate and downstaging rate, or rate of tumor size reduction, at the time of surgery. 

&#160; 

Phase 2 Clinical Trial of TRC105 with Nexavar in Patients with Hepatocellular Carcinoma 

&#160; 

We plan to initiate dosing in a two-part Phase 2 clinical trial of TRC105 in combination with Nexavar, which is approved for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma, in patients with advanced or metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma. Prior completed clinical trials indicated that 20 mg/kg of TRC105 given every two weeks is well tolerated when given as a single agent and 15 mg/kg of TRC105 given every two weeks was well tolerated in combination with approved doses of Nexavar. Part 1 of the trial will determine whether the recommended Phase 2 dose of TRC105 of 15 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg given every two weeks can be administered safely concurrently with Nexavar. Part 2 of the trial is expected to enroll up to 21 patients with advanced or metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma to determine the overall response rate, progression-free survival and overall survival following treatment with the recommended Phase 2 dose of TRC105 determined from Part 1 of the trial given concurrently with Nexavar. 

&#160; 

Phase 1 Clinical Trial of TRC105 with Taxol, carboplatin and Avastin in Patients with Lung Cancer 

&#160; 

We plan to initiate d osing in a Phase 1 clinical trial of TRC105 in combination with Taxol, carboplatin and Avastin for the initial treatment of advanced or metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer. The combination of Taxol, carboplatin and Avastin is approved for the initial treatment of advanced or metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer, and the combination of Taxol and Avastin is approved for the treatment of ovarian cancer. Prior completed trials indicated the recommended Phase 2 dose of 10 mg/kg of TRC105 was well tolerated with Avastin. The primary endpoint of the trial is to determine whether the recommended Phase 2 dose of TRC105 of 10 mg/kg can be administered safely concurrently with Taxol, carboplatin and Avastin. Up to 18 patients are expected to be treated with the recommended Phase 2 dose of TRC105 of 10 mg/kg given concurrently with Taxol, carboplatin and Avastin. Secondary endpoints include pharmacokinetics, overall response rate by RECIST 1.1, progression-free survival and overall survival. 

&#160; 

Planned Clinical Trials of TRC105 

&#160; 

Phase 2 Clinical Trial of TRC105 with or without Avastin in Patients with GTN, including choricarcinoma 

&#160; 

We plan to initiate a Phase 2 multicenter international clinical trial that employs a sequential treatment design in the first half of 2016, whereby patients will receive initially TRC105 as a single agent, and will also have the opportunity to receive TRC105 in combination with Avastin after demonstrating lack of response to single agent Avastin. The trial is expected to enroll up to 30 patients with GTN, including choriocarcinoma, placental site trophoblastic tumor (PSTT) and epithelioid trophoblastic tumor (ETT). Patients will be enrolled who are refractory to at least one prior multiagent chemotherapeutic regimen and the primary endpoint will be overall response rate as assessed by &#946;-hCG for choriocarcinoma and by a combination of &#946;-hCG and RECIST 1.1 for PSTT and ETT. The primary endpoint is expected to be an overall response rate. We expect that positive data from this trial could be registration enabling. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Phase 3 Clinical Trial of TRC105 with Votreint in Patients with Angiosarcoma 

&#160; 

Based on the activity seen in patients with angiosarcoma and data indicating high tumor endoglin expression in the majority of cases of angiosarcoma, we expect to initiate a Phase 3 trial in the second half of 2016 of approximately 140 angiosarcoma patients at approximately 30 sites in the United States and Europe to compare TRC105 in combination with Votrient to Votrient alone. The patients are expected to be randomly allocated in equal numbers to the two treatment arms, and the primary endpoint of the trial is expected to be progression-free survival as assessed by RECIST 1.1. We expect that positive data from this trial could be registration enabling. If data from the current ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial in soft tissue sarcoma indicate tumor endoglin expression is predictive of TRC105 activity, a separate Phase 3 clinical trial in soft tissue sarcoma, other than angiosarcoma, may incorporate a biomarker strategy to use tumor endoglin expression as a basis for enrollment of more responsive patients into the trial. 

&#160; 

Completed Clinical Trials of TRC105 

&#160; 

Phase 1 First-in-Human Clinical Trial of TRC105 in Patients with Advanced and Treatment-Resistant Cancer 

&#160; 

We conducted a Phase 1, single agent, first-in-human ascending dose clinical trial evaluating the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and anti-tumor activity of TRC105 in patients with advanced solid tumors. The primary endpoint of the trial was to determine the recommended dose of TRC105 for Phase 2 clinical trials and assess overall safety and tolerability. Secondary endpoints included analysis of TRC105 distribution in the blood, assessment of whether antibodies were made in response to treatment with TRC105 and assessment of preliminary signs of antitumor activity. Given the limited number of patients in this clinical trial, no statistical analyses were performed. Fifty patients were treated with escalating doses of TRC105 until cancer progression or unacceptable toxicity was reached using a standard dose escalation design at dose levels of 0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, 10 and 15 mg/kg given weekly or every two weeks. The maximum tolerated dose was exceeded at 15 mg/kg given weekly due to anemia, an expected adverse event of TRC105 treatment. TRC105 exposure increased with increasing dose, and continuous serum concentrations that saturate endoglin receptors were maintained at 10 mg/kg given weekly and 15 mg/kg given every two weeks. The safety profile was distinct from that of VEGF inhibitors, and the adverse effects of hypertension and proteinuria seen commonly with VEGF inhibitors were rarely observed with TRC105. Pulmonary edema and low platelet counts, which are side effects of other inhibitors of the endoglin pathway, were not observed. Antibodies to TRC105 were not detected in patients treated with the formulation of TRC105 that is being used in our Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials, indicating that TRC105 is not highly immunogenic. Stable disease or better was achieved in 21 of 45 evaluable patients (47%), including two patients with durable reductions in tumor burden lasting longer than 48 and 18 months, respectively. One of three patients had soft tissue sarcoma and remained on TRC105 for 18 months with a reduction in tumor burden of each of five pulmonary metastases, which was first detected two months after initiation of treatment. An overall reduction in the sum of tumor diameters of 13% was noted during treatment. The duration of TRC105 treatment exceeded the duration of three prior treatments: carboplatin and paclitaxel (four months), Arimidex (anastrozole) (eight months) and ifosfamide (two months), each of which had been previously discontinued because the cancer progressed. The anti-tumor data compared favorably with the first-in-human anti-tumor data reported with Avastin in a less treatment-resistant population. The majority of patients demonstrated an increase in plasma levels of VEGF at the time of cancer progression, providing a rationale for inhibiting the VEGF pathway in patients treated with TRC105. Lastly, patients at the 10 mg/kg and 15 mg/kg dose levels were observed to have dilated blood vessels in the skin or mucosal membranes, similar to those in patients with Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome, indicating inhibition of the endoglin pathway. Results of this clinical trial were published in Clinical Cancer Research in 2012. 

&#160; 

Phase 1/2 Clinical Trial of TRC105 with Avastin in Patients with Advanced and Treatment-Resistant Cancer 

&#160; 

We completed a Phase 1/2 ascending dose trial evaluating the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and anti-tumor activity of TRC105 in combination with an approved dose of Avastin in patients with advanced and treatment-resistant solid tumors. The primary endpoint of the trial was to determine the recommended dose of TRC105 to be used in combination with Avastin for Phase 2 clinical trials and assess overall safety and tolerability of the combination. Secondary endpoints included analysis of TRC105 distribution in the blood, assessment of whether antibodies were made in response to treatment with TRC105 and assessment of preliminary evidence of improved anti-tumor activity when TRC105 was combined with Avastin. Given the limited number of patients in this clinical trial, no 

&#160;

statistical analyses were performed. Thirty-eight patients primarily with colorectal and ovarian cancer were treated with escalating doses of TRC105 until cancer progression or unacceptable toxicity was reached using a standard dose escalation design at dose levels of 3, 6, 8 and 10 mg/kg given weekly, in combination with an approved dose of Avastin. TRC105 and Avastin were generally well tolerated when dosed together at their recommended single agent doses (10 mg/kg each) when the initial dose of TRC105 was delayed by one week and divided over two days to reduce the frequency and severity of headache. The concurrent administration of Avastin and TRC105 did not otherwise appear to increase the frequency or severity of known toxicities of TRC105 or Avastin. Pharmacokinetic studies indicated that treatment with Avastin increased endoglin expression on endothelium, a finding that was consistent with preclinical studies indicating endoglin may allow continued angiogenesis despite inhibition of the VEGF pathway. This finding provides support for targeting angiogenesis with endoglin antibodies in combination with VEGF inhibitors. Pharmacokinetic studies also indicated that serum levels of TRC105 were continuously present at concentrations above levels needed to inhibit endoglin function. Antibodies to TRC105 were detected in two patients and were not associated with clinical effects. Biomarker studies indicated increased blood levels of platelet-derived growth factor, or PDGF, a soluble protein that plays a significant role in angiogenesis, in patients treated with TRC105 in combination with Avastin. Several patients, including patients with colorectal cancer and ovarian cancer whose cancer had previously progressed on Avastin or small molecule VEGF inhibitors, experienced responses, including ten partial responses as assessed by Choi criteria, two of which were also partial responses as assessed by RECIST 1.1. 

&#160; 

The best response by maximum percent change decrease in target lesion size of each of 30 patients enrolled in the trial with measurable disease who underwent efficacy assessment is noted in the figure below, and patients who received prior treatment with at least one VEGF inhibitor are indicated by a star. Of 25 evaluable patients treated previously with VEGF inhibitors, 16 patients (64%) had stable disease, of whom two patients (8%) had partial responses as assessed by RECIST 1.1. Ten patients who received prior VEGF treatment (40%) had a partial response by Choi criteria and are denoted with a solid triangle and a star in the figure below. Six patients (24%) with responses by Choi criteria or RECIST 1.1 remained without cancer progression for longer than during their prior VEGF inhibitor therapy, and are therefore considered to have durable responses.

These collective data demonstrate that TRC105 is active with Avastin based on decreases of tumor size and durability of treatment in patients whose cancer progressed on prior treatment with Avastin or other VEGF inhibitors. 

&#160; 

Phase 2 Clinical Trial of TRC105 as a Single Agent or Combined with Avastin in Patients with Glioblastoma that Progressed on Prior Avastin Treatment 

&#160; 

We completed a Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating the safety, tolerability, and anti-tumor activity of TRC105 in combination with Avastin in patients with glioblastoma that progressed on prior initial treatment with combined chemotherapy and radiation therapy and subsequent treatment with Avastin. The primary endpoint of the trial was to determine median overall survival, and secondary endpoints included assessment of tolerability and determination of response rate and time to tumor progression. After an initial portion of the trial assessing the safety of TRC105 as a single agent, 16 patients were treated with TRC105 at 10 mg/kg given weekly with Avastin at 10 mg/kg given every two weeks until cancer progression or unacceptable toxicity was reached. The concurrent administration of TRC105 and Avastin did not appear to increase the frequency or severity of known toxicities of TRC105 or Avastin. Overall survival in the 16 patients treated with TRC105 and Avastin was 5.7 months, which was statistically longer than the overall survival of 4 month expected in this population specified in the protocol based on historical data. The majority of patients with Avastin-resistant glioblastoma who enrolled in the trial had cancer progression in fewer than four months on prior Avastin treatment, and median progression-free survival was two months following treatment with TRC105 and Avastin. No patient demonstrated an objective response. Future clinical trials will focus on enrolling patients with glioblastoma prior to Avastin treatment, when they may be more likely to be responsive to angiogenesis inhibition. 

&#160; 

Phase 1 Clinical Trial of TRC105 with Xeloda in Patients with Metastatic Breast Cancer 

&#160; 

We completed a Phase 1 ascending dose clinical trial evaluating the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and anti-tumor activity of TRC105 in combination with Xeloda. The primary endpoint of the trial was to determine the recommended dose of TRC105 to be used in combination with Xeloda for Phase 2 clinical trials and to assess overall safety and tolerability of the combination. Secondary endpoints included analysis of TRC105 distribution in the blood, assessment of whether antibodies were made in response to treatment with TRC105 and assessment of preliminary evidence of improved anti-tumor activity when TRC105 was combined with Xeloda. Given the limited number of patients in this clinical trial, no statistical analyses were performed. Nineteen patients, primarily with metastatic breast cancer, were treated with escalating doses of TRC105 until cancer progression or unacceptable toxicity was reached using a standard dose escalation design at dose levels of 7.5 and 10 mg/kg given weekly, in combination with the recommended single agent dose of Xeloda of 1,000 mg/m 2 given twice daily for two weeks followed by a one week rest 

&#160;

period. TRC105 and Xeloda were generally well tolerated when dosed together at their recommended single agent doses. The concurrent administration of TRC105 with Xeloda did not otherwise appear to increase the frequency or severity of expected toxicities of TRC105 or Xeloda. Pharmacokinetic studies indicated continuous serum levels of TRC105 at doses above target concentrations at both TRC105 dose level. Antibodies to TRC105 were detected in one patient. Several patients demonstrated evidence of clinical benefit, including one patient with metastatic breast cancer who achieved a partial response as assessed by RECIST 1.1. 

&#160; 

Phase 2 Randomized Clinical Trial of TRC105 with Avastin in Patients with Renal Cell Carcinoma 

&#160; 

NCI completed enrollment of a Phase 2 clinical trial to study the activity of TRC105 in combination with Avastin, compared to treatment with Avastin alone, in patients with renal cell carcinoma that included non-clear histology. The NCI-sponsored trial in renal cell carcinoma included approximately 20 centers in the United States and enrolled patients with all histologic types of renal cell carcinoma who had received as many as four prior systemic therapies, including as many as four prior VEGF inhibitors, and had not been treated with Avastin previously. The trial was designed to randomize 88 total patients in equal proportions to receive TRC105 and Avastin or Avastin alone with the goal of demonstrating a 100% increase in progression-free survival. However, an interim analysis performed in September 2014 concluded that the trial was unlikely to achieve the primary endpoint, and enrollment was closed following the accrual of 62 patients. Data reported at the ASCO annual meeting in June 2015 by the NCI indicated no statistical difference in progression free survival between patients treated with TRC105 and Avastin compared to patients treated with single agent Avastin. 

&#160; 

Other Phase 1 and Phase 2 Clinical Trials of TRC105 in Cancer Patients 

&#160; 

A Phase 1, single agent, ascending dose clinical trial sponsored by NCI enrolled 21 patients with metastatic and treatment-resistant prostate cancer and results were published in the British Journal of Urology in 2014. The primary endpoint of the trial was to determine the recommended dose of TRC105 to be used in Phase 2 clinical trials and to assess overall safety and tolerability. Secondary endpoints included analysis of TRC105 distribution in the blood, assessment of whether antibodies were made in response to treatment with TRC105 and assessment of preliminary evidence of improved anti-tumor activity. Given the limited number of patients in this clinical trial, no statistical analyses were performed. TRC105 was tolerated at 20&#8201;mg/kg every other week with a safety profile distinct from that of VEGF inhibitors. A significant induction of plasma VEGF was associated with CD105 reduction, suggesting anti-angiogenic activity of TRC105. An exploratory analysis showed a tentative correlation between the reduction of CD105 and a decrease in PSA velocity, suggestive of potential activity of TRC105 in the patients with metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer. The data from this exploratory analysis suggested that rising VEGF level was a possible compensatory mechanism for TRC105-induced anti-angiogenic activity. A Phase 2 clinical trial of TRC105 sponsored by NCI enrolled 13 patients with advanced or metastatic bladder cancer that had progressed on prior treatment with chemotherapy. NCI has not yet reported clinical data for this trial. 

&#160; 

A Phase 2 clinical trial sponsored by NCI enrolled 11 patients with advanced or metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma that had progressed on prior treatment with Nexavar. The primary endpoint of the trial was to determine the time to tumor progression. Data reported at the Gastrointestinal Cancer Symposium of the American Society of Clinical Oncology in January 2014 indicated TRC105 at 15 mg/kg every two weeks demonstrated anti-tumor activity in three of seven evaluable by RECIST 1.1 patients presented, including in one patient who achieved a partial response as assessed by RECIST 1.1. However, at least three of the first ten patients needed to be free of tumor progression to enroll further patients in the trial, and only two of ten patients were free of tumor progression after four months of treatment. 

&#160; 

Our Phase 2 clinical trial in 23 patients with advanced or metastatic ovarian cancer that had progressed on prior treatment with platinum chemotherapy treated with TRC105 at 10 mg/kg every week indicated limited anti-tumor activity, as evidenced by a minor tumor reduction in one patient and tumor marker reductions in several other patients. However, no patients achieved either of the dual primary endpoints of being free of tumor progression for at least six months or achieving a partial response as assessed by RECIST 1.1. Subsequent data from a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of TRC105 in combination with Avastin suggested advanced ovarian cancer patients were more likely to benefit from the combination treatment. These data are consistent with preclinical findings indicating that inhibition of the VEGF or endoglin pathway individually is less effective than inhibition of the VEGF and endoglin pathways simultaneously. Avastin was recently approved in the United States with chemotherapy for the treatment of ovarian cancer, and we expect to develop TRC105 in combination with Avastin and chemotherapy in this indication. 

&#160;

Safety of TRC105 as a Single Agent and in Combination with Approved VEGF Inhibitors 

&#160; 

In clinical trials as of December 31, 2015, TRC105 has been administered to more than 400 patients and was generally well tolerated as a single agent and in combination with VEGF inhibitors. The most commonly reported adverse events related to TRC105 therapy, either alone or in combination, include anemia, dilated small vessels in the skin and mucosal membranes (which may result in nosebleeds and bleeding of the gums), headache, fatigue and gastrointestinal and other symptoms during the initial infusion of TRC105, or infusion reaction. Infusion reactions were reduced in frequency and severity through the use of premedication. The majority of treatment-related adverse events have been mild. Serious adverse events considered related to TRC105 have largely been isolated events. 

&#160; 

Antibodies to TRC105 were detected in fewer than 5% of treated patients with the current anti-drug-antibody method and were not associated with specific clinical effects. 

&#160; 

TRC105 Investigational New Drug Applications 

&#160; 

We are evaluating TRC105 in the United States in clinical trials under two INDs, the first of which we filed with the FDA in November 2007 for the treatment of patients with advanced solid tumors, and the second of which we filed with the FDA in September 2014 for the treatment of patients with renal cell carcinoma. Subsequent amendments to the first IND have included clinical protocols to study TRC105 alone, or in combination with VEGF inhibitors, in patients with multiple tumor types. TRC105 is also being studied in the United States under three INDs sponsored by NCI to evaluate TRC105 in patients with prostate cancer, liver cancer and bladder cancer, which NCI filed in December 2009, December 2010 and August 2010, respectively, and one IND sponsored by NCI to evaluate TRC105 in patients with renal cell carcinoma and glioblastoma, which NCI filed in April 2012. The INDs filed by NCI cross reference our initial solid tumor IND. 

&#160; 

Preclinical Studies 

&#160; 

Endoglin Antibodies 

&#160; 

A number of preclinical studies have demonstrated the feasibility of using endoglin antibodies, both alone and in combination with VEGF inhibitors, to inhibit angiogenesis and treat tumors. These studies have also indicated that endoglin antibodies and VEGF inhibitors may be more effective when used in combination than when used as single agents. 

&#160; 

Endoglin antibodies that bind to mouse endoglin have been shown to be effective anti-tumor agents in mice implanted with mouse tumor cells. An endoglin antibody inhibited tumor growth of mouse liver cancer cells implanted subcutaneously and inhibited angiogenesis, as demonstrated by marked reduction in vascular density of the tumors treated with the endoglin antibody. The figure on the left below shows the tumor progression in three groups of mice implanted with mouse liver cancer cells and then treated with one of endoglin antibody (&#8220;Anti-mAb&#8221; in the figures below) antibody that did not bind endoglin (&#8220;Cont-Ab&#8221; in the figures below) or saline vehicle (&#8220;Cont-NS&#8221; in the figures below). Tumor growth was inhibited following treatment with the endoglin antibody, and the degree of inhibition was statistically significant with a p-value of less than 0.05 at the time points indicated by &#8220;a&#8221; and with a p-value of less than 0.01 at the time points indicated by &#8220;b.&#8221; A p-value is the probability that the reported result was achieved purely by chance, such that a p-value of less than or equal to 0.05 or 0.01 means that there is a 5.0% or 1.0% or less probability, respectively, that the difference between the control group and the treatment group is purely due to chance. A p-value of 0.05 or less typically represents a statistically significant result. Furthermore, tumors treated with endoglin antibody contained fewer blood vessels compared with mice treated with antibody that did not bind endoglin or with saline vehicle. As illustrated on the figure on the right below, mice treated with the endoglin antibody also survived significantly longer than animals treated with antibody that did not bind endoglin or saline vehicle.

Anti-tumor activity of endoglin antibody in a mouse model of liver cancer 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Our collaborator at the Roswell Park Cancer Institute showed that TRC105 is a potent inhibitor of angiogenesis mediated by human endothelial cells. A mouse engrafted with human skin was employed to compensate for the fact that the mouse antibody from which TRC105 was derived, SN6j, binds human endoglin to interrupt BMP binding, but does not interrupt BMP binding to mouse endoglin. Human breast cancer cells implanted into these mice grew based on the recruitment of blood vessels of mouse and human origin. SN6j was shown to suppress the growth of human breast cancer cells established in mice at a dose of 10 mg/kg when compared to saline vehicle and was able to increase the effects of cyclophosphamide chemotherapy. SN6j completely inhibited the growth of human blood vessels when given as a single agent or when combined with chemotherapy, as shown in the figure below, which depicts the number of blood vessels per high-power field in mice treated with saline vehicle and active treatments.

Our collaborator at Duke University has conducted preclinical studies on the effect of TRC105 in combination with Avastin on angiogenesis mediated by human endothelial cells. Angiogenesis was modeled using human endothelial cells, which formed visible polygons, a measure of vascular networks, in culture, as demonstrated in the figure below. TRC105 and Avastin each inhibited human endothelial cell organization into vascular networks, compared to untreated 

&#160;

cells. However, the combination of the two agents more effectively inhibited the organization of human endothelial cells into vascular networks than either agent alone.

Quantification of the number of visible polygons, as illustrated in the table below, indicated statistically significant inhibition with a p-value of less than 0.05 using the combination of the two drugs compared to each individual drug.

Endoglin Antibody Drug Conjugates 

&#160; 

Many antibodies are more potent when linked to either drugs or toxins than as unconjugated antibodies. For example, Kadcyla (trastuzumab emtansine) is an approved antibody drug conjugate of the approved unconjugated antibody Herceptin (trastuzumab) and is active in patients whose cancer progressed on prior Herceptin treatment. In addition to its potential as an unconjugated antibody, TRC105 could also be developed as an antibody drug conjugate. 

&#160; 

Endoglin antibody drug conjugates have been effective anti-tumor agents in preclinical models of human cancer in mice. MJ7/18, an antibody that binds to mouse endoglin, was conjugated to the Nigrin B toxin and dosed to mice bearing genetically identical melanoma tumors. Treatment of tumor-bearing mice with MJ7/18 or Nigrin B alone did not inhibit tumor growth compared to control animals. However, the endoglin antibody drug conjugate, MJ7-Ngb immunotoxin, inhibited tumor growth and caused complete regressions of palpable tumors in several animals. Antibody drug conjugates constructed using our proprietary endoglin antibodies have demonstrated antitumor activity. In the future, we may pursue development of TRC105 as an antibody drug conjugate, which would complement its use as an unconjugated antibody.

&#160; 

Translational Preclinical Research 

&#160; 

Studies of endoglin biology using choriocarcinoma cell lines indicate that higher levels of endoglin expression are associated with greater degrees of resistance to chemotherapy. Chemotherapy treatment also led to an increase in endoglin expression on choriocarcinoma cell lines. Serum endoglin and BMP levels were higher in pretreatment samples of women who developed GTN that was resistant to chemotherapy, with BMP levels showing a greater ability to predict resistance than the traditional scoring system that is routinely used to assess prognosis in GTN. We plan to assess BMP levels are assessed in patients with GTN and other tumor types as part of ongoing Phase 2 studies to determine if serum levels of this activating endoglin ligand will predict which patients are most responsive to TRC105 treatment. 

&#160; 

Role of Endoglin Antibodies in AMD Treatment 

&#160; 

Overview of AMD 

&#160; 

AMD is a major public health problem that has a devastating effect on patients. AMD distorts central vision, which is necessary for daily activities such as reading, face recognition, watching television and driving and can lead to loss of central vision and blindness. According to a 2010 study sponsored by AMD Alliance International, the annual direct healthcare system cost of visual impairment worldwide due to AMD was estimated at approximately $255 billion. 

&#160;

According to the Macular Degeneration Partnership, approximately 15 million people in the United States and 30 million people worldwide suffer from some form of AMD. There are two forms of AMD: dry AMD and wet AMD. It is reported that wet AMD represents approximately 10% of all cases of AMD, but is responsible for 90% of the severe vision loss associated with the disease. Wet AMD is the leading cause of blindness in the Western world. 

&#160; 

In a subset of AMD patients, dry AMD progresses to wet AMD as a result of abnormal angiogenesis in the choroid layer beneath the retina, which is referred to as choroidal neovascularization, or CNV. In the context of wet AMD, CNV is associated with the accumulation of other cell types and altered tissue. The new blood vessels associated with this abnormal angiogenesis tend to be fragile and often bleed and leak fluid into the macula, the central-most portion of the retina responsible for central vision and color perception. If left untreated, the blood vessel growth and associated leakage typically lead to retinal distortion and eventual retinal scarring, with irreversible destruction of the macula and loss of vision. This visual loss occurs rapidly with a progressive course. 

&#160; 

Currently Available Therapies for Wet AMD 

&#160; 

The current standard of care for wet AMD is administration by intraocular injection of VEGF inhibitors as single agents. VEGF inhibitors have been reported to be effective in treating wet AMD because of their ability to inhibit the effects of abnormal angiogenesis that defines CNV. The FDA has approved the VEGF inhibitors Lucentis (ranibizumab), Eylea and Macugen (pegaptanib sodium) for the treatment of wet AMD. Lucentis is an antibody fragment derived from the same full length antibody from which Avastin was derived. In 2015, annual worldwide sales of Lucentis and Eylea for all indications totaled more than $7.0 billion. This sales number does not include Avastin, which is commonly used off-label to treat wet AMD in the United States and, to a lesser extent, in the European Union. 

&#160; 

The availability of VEGF inhibitors has significantly improved visual outcomes for many patients with wet AMD. A retrospective study published in 2012 confirmed that the prevalence of both legal blindness and moderate visual impairment in patients two years after being diagnosed with wet AMD has decreased substantially following the introduction of VEGF inhibitor therapy. Nonetheless, the condition of many patients with wet AMD treated with VEGF inhibitors does not improve significantly and in many cases deteriorates. 

&#160; 

VEGF inhibitors prevent VEGF from binding to its natural receptor on endothelial cells in the abnormal new blood vessels, thereby inhibiting further CNV and leakage associated with wet AMD. However, VEGF inhibitor therapy may be limited in its ability to improve CNV. Results of third-party clinical trials suggest that visual outcomes for wet AMD patients receiving treatment with a VEGF inhibitor worsen over time and are often associated with the development of subretinal fibrosis and the growth of CNV over time. Furthermore, data from clinical trials conducted by Ophthotech Corporation indicate that vision in patients with AMD can be improved by targeting complementary pathways in combination with VEGF inhibitors. 

&#160; 

As is the case with angiogenesis that drives tumor growth, we believe that the endoglin pathway serves as an escape pathway that allows continued CNV despite inhibition of the VEGF pathway. In addition, the impact of VEGF inhibitors may be limited by the activity of pericytes, which are the cells that cover the outside of blood vessels and support and stabilize newly formed vessels. Pericytes are not targeted by VEGF inhibitor therapies, but because they express endoglin, they are an additional target for endoglin antibodies such as TRC105. These facts provide the rationale for treating wet AMD with a combination of endoglin antibodies and VEGF inhibitors. 

&#160; 

TRC105 Development in Wet AMD 

&#160; 

Preclinical Studies of TRC105 in Wet AMD 

&#160; 

TRC105 was studied in vivo for its ability to inhibit angiogenesis through our collaborator at Johns Hopkins University, using a mouse model of CNV. Mice were divided into three groups that each received treatment with a different dose of TRC105, and each mouse received an intraocular injection of TRC105 in one eye and saline vehicle (&#8220;PBS Control IV&#8221; in the figures below) in the other eye. After 14 days, the area of CNV was measured by image analysis and the mean area and standard deviation were calculated. Treatment with TRC105 decreased the area of CNV as measured in square millimeters (&#8220;Area of Choroidal NV (mm 2 )&#8221; in the figures below) in mice as illustrated in the 

&#160;

figure below. The inhibitory effect of TRC105 on CNV was dose dependent, and statistically significant at each TRC105 dose level as evidenced by a p-value of less than 0.05, and the highest dose administered (5 mg/mL) inhibited CNV by over 50% versus saline vehicle. 

&#160; 

Dose dependent inhibition of CNV with TRC105 in a mouse model of wet AMD 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

Notably, the highest concentration of TRC105 used in this experiment was 5% of the concentration that we have developed for clinical trials of TRC105 in wet AMD patients. 

&#160; 

DE-122 for Wet AMD 

&#160; 

Our endoglin antibodies for ophthalmology indications are being developed in collaboration with Santen. We have produced formulations of TRC105 for development in ophthalmology, and Santen is developing TRC105 under the name DE-122. In June 2015, Santen filed an IND with the FDA for the &#160; initiation &#160; of &#160; clinical &#160; studies &#160; for &#160; DE &#8208; 122 &#160; in &#160; patients &#160; with &#160; wet &#160; AMD and we expect Santen to complete a Phase 1 clinical trial of DE-122 in wet AMD patients in 2016, and that these early clinical trials will include testing of TRC105 in patients receiving treatment with a VEGF inhibitor. 

&#160; 

Role of Endoglin Antibodies in Fibrotic Disease Treatment 

&#160; 

Overview of Fibrosis 

&#160; 

Fibrosis is a condition characterized by the harmful buildup of excessive fibrous tissue leading to scarring and ultimately organ failure. It is caused by the abnormal secretion of fibrous proteins, including collagen, by fibroblasts, which are cells that are present in all skin and connective tissue. As a result, fibrosis can affect almost any organ. Endoglin is expressed on fibroblasts, and its expression may be important to cell function. Increased endoglin expression has been demonstrated on fibroblasts from patients with heart failure and may play a role in the development of cardiac fibrosis as well as fibrotic diseases involving other organs. Examples of fibrotic diseases that may be initial target indications for TRC205 include NASH and IPF. 

&#160; 

NASH is a common and serious chronic liver disease caused by excessive fat accumulation in the liver, or steatosis, which induces inflammation and may lead to progressive fibrosis and cirrhosis, followed by eventual liver failure and death. NASH is considered to be the second leading cause of hepatocellular carcinoma, and its prevalence is increasing. NASH is believed to be one of the most common chronic liver diseases worldwide, with an estimated prevalence of 2% to 5% of the general adult population in the United States, and an estimated prevalence of 2% to 3% in Europe and other developed countries. There are currently no therapeutic products approved for the treatment of NASH. Current treatment options are limited to off-label therapies. Given the lack of available treatment options, we believe that there is a significant unmet need for a novel therapy for NASH, particularly in those patients with advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis. 

&#160; 

IPF is a disease characterized by progressive fibrosis of the lungs, which leads to their deterioration and destruction. The cause of IPF is unknown. Research suggests that there are between 40,000 and 80,000 diagnosed cases of IPF in the United States, with similar prevalence in the European Union. Esbriet (pirfenidone) is approved for the treatment of mild to moderate IPF in the United States, the European Union and other countries. OFEV (nintedanib) has been approved for the treatment of IPF in the United States and has been submitted for regulatory approval in the European Union 

&#160; 

The Role of Endoglin in Fibrosis 

&#160; 

Preclinical and clinical data from Tufts Medical Center identified increased endoglin expression on fibroblasts in the left ventricle of patients with heart failure and demonstrated that inhibiting endoglin limits TGF-&#946; signaling and production of fibrotic proteins by human cardiac fibroblasts. Inhibiting endoglin function decreased cardiac fibrosis, preserved left ventricular function, and improved survival in mouse models of heart failure. In the figure below, wild-type mice (&#8220;WT&#8221; in the figure below) that contain both copies of the endoglin gene develop fibrosis, as evidenced by collagen deposition darkly stained in the figure below, at four and ten weeks following the induction of heart failure. However, in endoglin deficient mice fibrosis is decreased at four and ten weeks, as evidenced by the lack of dark stain (&#8220;Eng +/-&#8221; in the figure below). Survival also improved in endoglin-deficient mice. Studies using TRC105 demonstrated that TRC105 reversed cardiac fibrosis in mouse models. These data were published in Circulation and the Journal of the American Heart Association . Subsequent preclinical research in mouse models indicated that antibodies to endoglin inhibit cardiac and liver fibrosis. Although initial findings indicate endoglin&#8217;s importance in cardiac and liver fibrosis, we believe these findings may be applicable to multiple fibrotic diseases, including NASH, IPF and myelofibrosis, given 

&#160;

that endoglin is expressed on fibroblasts, a cell that is critical to the process of fibrosis in the heart, lung, liver and other organs. 

&#160; 

Cardiac Fibrosis in Wild-Type Mice and Endoglin-Deficient Mice 

&#160; 

&#160; 

TRC205 and TRC105 Development in Fibrotic Diseases 

&#160; 

We may develop TRC105 in a fibrotic disease. We also are using our knowledge of the endoglin pathway to design and evaluate a fully humanized and deimmunized endoglin antibody called TRC205. We have cloned this antibody and demonstrated high affinity binding to human endoglin. We expect to complete additional preclinical studies of TRC205 in fibrosis, including in models of NASH, in 2016. Positive preclinical data may allow for IND enabling manufacturing activities and preclinical studies to begin in 2016 by TRACON or through a corporate partnership. 

&#160; 

Overview of Base Excision Repair and the Mechanism of Action of TRC102 

&#160; 

Base-excision repair, or BER, is a complex and fundamental cellular process used by cancer cells to repair the DNA damage caused by chemotherapeutics, especially the classes of chemotherapeutics known as alkylating agents, including Temodar, dacarbazine and bis-dichloroethyl-nitrosourea, or BCNU, and anti-metabolite agents, including Fludara and Alimta. The process of BER removes DNA bases damaged by chemotherapy, resulting in the formation of gaps in the DNA strand called apurinic and apyrimidinic, or AP, sites. The appropriate base is then inserted in this gap to restore the proper tumor DNA sequence. By this process, cancer cells can circumvent the anti-tumor effects of chemotherapy. 

&#160; 

Inhibition of BER has been proposed as a way to improve the efficacy of chemotherapeutics; however, to our knowledge, no inhibitors of BER have yet been tested in clinical trials. We are developing TRC102 (methoxyamine hydrochloride) to reverse resistance to specific chemotherapeutics by inhibiting BER. TRC102 interrupts BER by rapidly and covalently binding within AP sites, converting the AP site to a substrate for the enzyme topoisomerase II, which cleaves TRC102-bound DNA, resulting in an accumulation of DNA strand breaks that trigger cellular apoptosis, or programmed cell death, as illustrated in the figure below: 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

TRC102 binding results in apoptosis 

&#160; 

&#160; 

The induction of apoptosis by TRC102 is relatively selective for cancer cells, which typically overexpress topoisomerase II. In nonmalignant cells with low topoisomerase II expression, TRC102-bound DNA is excised and replaced by a separate DNA repair system. 

&#160; 

TRC102 Development in Oncology 

&#160; 

TRC102 is being developed to reverse resistance to Temodar, an alkylating chemotherapeutic, as well as to Alimta and Fludara, two antimetabolite chemotherapeutics. We consider it advantageous to combine TRC102 with Alimta because Alimta is already approved in one large market indication (lung cancer) and one orphan drug indication (mesothelioma). Temodar is an approved chemotherapeutic used as a standard of care agent to treat glioblastoma, and Fludara is an approved chemotherapeutic used as a standard of care agent to treat lymphoma and leukemia. In initial clinical trials of more than 100 patients, TRC102 has shown good tolerability and promising anti-tumor activity, in combination with alkylating and antimetabolite chemotherapy. 

&#160; 

TRC102 recently began Phase 2 development through a Phase 2 clinical trial sponsored by the NCI that combines TRC102 with Alimta in patients with mesothelioma, as well as a Phase 2 clinical trial of TRC102 with Temodar in patients with glioblastoma. A Phase 1b trial sponsored by the NCI that combines TRC102 with Alimta and cisplatin in patients with solid tumors has also been initiated, and we expect NCI to initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial of TRC102 with chemotherapy and radiation therapy in lung cancer. If Phase 2 data indicate activity of TRC102 with Temodar, we believe these data would support the initiation of a Phase 3 clinical trial with the goal of approving TRC102 with Temodar for treatment of glioblastoma. If Phase 2 data indicate activity of TRC102 with Alimta or other antimetabolite chemotherapeutics, we believe these data would support the initiation of Phase 3 clinical trials with the goal of approving TRC102 for treatment with Alimta or other approved antimetabolite chemotherapeutics. We expect to fund Phase 3 clinical trials, if merited by Phase 2 data. 

&#160; 

We filed an IND for TRC102 in March 2008, Case Western filed an IND for TRC102 in March 2006, and NCI filed an IND for TRC102 in March 2013, all for the treatment of patients with advanced solid tumors. The IND filed by NCI cross references our IND. 

&#160;

Completed Phase 1 Clinical Trials 

&#160; 

We completed a Phase 1 ascending dose clinical trial evaluating the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and anti-tumor activity of TRC102 given with Alimta in patients with advanced solid tumors. The primary endpoint of the trial was to determine the recommended dose of TRC102 to be used in combination with Alimta for Phase 2 clinical trials and to assess overall safety and tolerability of the combination. Secondary endpoints included analysis of TRC102 distribution in the blood, assessment of whether TRC102 inhibited BER and assessment of preliminary evidence of improved anti-tumor activity when TRC102 was combined with Alimta. 

&#160; 

Given the limited number of patients in this clinical trial, no statistical analyses were performed. Twenty-eight patients were treated with escalating doses of TRC102 until cancer progression or unacceptable toxicity using a standard dose escalation design at dose levels of 15, 30, 60 and 100 mg/m 2 given once daily for four days of recurring three-week cycles with the approved dose of Alimta given every three weeks. The maximum tolerated dose was exceeded at the top dose of 100 mg/m 2 given once daily due to anemia, as predicted by preclinical studies. Anemia was the only dose limiting toxicity reported and was not accompanied by significant low platelet count or low white blood cell count, and was reversible and manageable with standard supportive measures. The 30 mg/m 2 daily TRC102 dose level was generally well tolerated and achieved target TRC102 levels in the blood and inhibited BER as expected in the peripheral blood cells of cancer patients. In addition, Alimta exposure analyzed following dosing with the co-administration of TRC102 was similar to published Alimta exposures, indicating that TRC102 did not affect the clearance of Alimta. 

&#160; 

All 28 patients had RECIST 1.1-defined measurable disease, and 25 underwent at least one response assessment. Fifteen patients had a best response of stable disease or better lasting for three or more cycles, including a 61-year-old woman with metastatic salivary gland cancer treated previously with Erbitux, Taxotere (docetaxel) and carboplatin, whose tumor expressed high levels of a marker associated with resistance to Alimta. This patient had a partial response as assessed by RECIST 1.1 and remained in our clinical trial without cancer progression for 14 months. In addition, 14 patients had stable disease for three or more cycles including patients with squamous cell lung cancer (three patients), epithelial ovarian cancer (three patients), colorectal cancer (two patients), non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (one patient), pancreatic cancer (one patient), prostate cancer (one patient), endometrial cancer (one patient), head and neck cancer (one patient) and breast cancer (one patient). These data were published in Investigational New Drugs in 2012. 

&#160; 

Case Western reported data from a trial of intravenous TRC102 given in combination with Fludara in a Phase 1 clinical trial at the ASH annual meeting in December 2014. Five dose levels of TRC102 were studied in 20 patients. The combination of TRC102 at the highest dose level of 120 mg/m 2 /day was well tolerated with Fludara given at 25 mg/m 2 /day for five days in recurring 28 day cycles. There were no pharmacologic interactions between the two drugs and TRC102 target concentrations were achieved. Anti-tumor activity, including partial response, was noted in patients with lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, including patients treated previously with Fludara. 

&#160; 

Case Western reported data from a trial of TRC102 given intravenously in combination with Temodar in a Phase 1 clinical trial at the ASCO annual meeting in June 2015. Seven dose levels were studied in 38 patients. The combination of TRC102 at the highest dose level of 150 mg/m 2 /day and Temodar at 200 mg/ &#160; m 2 /day for five days was well tolerated. There were no pharmacologic interactions between the two drugs and TRC102 target concentrations were achieved. Anti-tumor activity was noted in patients with ovarian cancer and neuroendocrine tumors. 

&#160; 

Ongoing Phase 1 Clinical Trial of TRC102 and Temodar 

&#160; 

The NCI reported data from a trial of TRC102 given orally in combination with Temodar in a Phase 1 clinical trial at the &#160; AACR annual &#160; meeting in April 2015. Dosing of five of eight planned dose levels had been studied in 27 patients, and t he &#160; combination &#160; of &#160; TRC102 at 100 mg/day for five days with Temodar at 150 mg/m 2 /day for five days of recurring 28 day cycles was &#160; well &#160; tolerated. There &#160; were &#160; no &#160; pharmacologic &#160; interactions &#160; between &#160; the &#160; two &#160; drugs and TRC102 &#160; target &#160; concentrations &#160; were &#160; achieved. &#160; Partial response &#160; was &#160; noted &#160; in &#160; patients &#160; with &#160; ovarian &#160; cancer &#160; and &#160; squamous cell lung cancer. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Preclinical Studies 

&#160; 

Preclinical studies conducted by Case Western demonstrated that increased DNA strand breaks occurred in cells exposed to BCNU in combination with TRC102 versus cells exposed to BCNU alone. These results suggest that a significant increase in DNA damage occurs when an alkylating agent is combined with TRC102. TRC102 also reversed resistance of colorectal cancer cells to BCNU in vivo . Four human colorectal cancer cell lines were grown as tumors in mice and then exposed to TRC102 and BCNU. While all cell lines were insensitive to BCNU alone, the combined administration of TRC102 and BCNU resulted in significant growth inhibition in all tested human tumors grown in mice. 

&#160; 

TRC102 also increased the anti-tumor effect of another alkylating chemotherapeutic, Temodar. Tumor regression was noted when mice were treated with a combination of Temodar and TRC102. In comparison, each agent alone either had no effect or delayed tumor growth but did not produce regression. Moreover, although TRC102 was able to improve the efficacy of Temodar, there was no additional toxicity compared to animals treated with Temodar alone as assessed by body weight and complete blood counts. Tumor apoptosis in this mouse experiment occurred in a dose- and time-dependent manner after treatment with TRC102 and Temodar. Additional preclinical studies indicate that TRC102 increased the efficacy of the combination of Temodar and a poly ADP-ribose polymerase, or PARP, inhibitor. These data suggest that the inhibition of BER by TRC102 increases the sensitivity of tumor cells to the effects of alkylating agents such as Temodar and BCNU. TRC102&#8217;s lack of toxicity provides an excellent opportunity to increase the therapeutic effects of alkylating agents while avoiding the toxicities of combination therapies with cytotoxic agents. We believe this approach may benefit patients whose therapy requires the use of alkylating agents for treatment, including patients with breast, brain and urinary tract cancers, as well as hematologic cancers such as myeloma and lymphoma. 

&#160; 

Further data from preclinical studies combining TRC102 with Fludara and Alimta indicated that TRC102 similarly increased the efficacy of a second class of chemotherapeutics known as anti-metabolites. DNA damage caused by the anti-metabolite Fludara is repaired by BER. As with alkylating chemotherapeutics, TRC102 increased the number of DNA strand breaks caused by Fludara, leading to increased apoptosis. The addition of TRC102 also increased the anti-tumor activity of Fludara in a study using human colon cancer cells grown in mice. Similar studies were conducted with Alimta, another anti-metabolite agent. Alimta treatment induced BER in cancer cells, as evidenced by the generation of large numbers of AP sites. Treatment with Alimta in combination with TRC102 increased the number of DNA strand breaks relative to treatment with Alimta alone. TRC102 also reversed resistance to Alimta in human lung cancer cells grown in mice. 

&#160; 

Clinical and Regulatory Efficiencies 

&#160; 

Our clinical operations and regulatory affairs groups are responsible for significant aspects of our clinical trials, including site selection, site qualification, site initiation, site monitoring, maintenance of the trial master file, regulatory compliance, drug distribution management, contracting and budgeting, database management, edit checks, query resolution, and clinical study report preparation. The use of this internal resource eliminates the cost associated with hiring CROs to manage clinical, regulatory and database aspects of the Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials that we sponsor in the United States. In our experience, this model has resulted in capital efficiencies and improved communication with clinical trial sites, which expedites patient enrollment and access to patient data compared to a CRO-managed model, and we plan to leverage this capital efficient model for future product development. 

&#160; 

We have also been able to advance clinical development of TRC105 and TRC102 in a capital-efficient manner through our collaboration with NCI. Both of our clinical stage assets, TRC105 and TRC102, have been selected by NCI for funding of Phase 1 and Phase 2 development. This highly competitive program is designed to accelerate the development of promising oncology drugs that target novel anti-cancer pathways. Genentech Inc. collaborated with NCI to accelerate the development of Avastin. Notably, Phase 3 clinical trials of Avastin (in lung cancer, breast cancer, and renal cell carcinoma) were conducted through NCI, and data from these Phase 3 clinical trials were important elements of the supplemental Biologics License Applications, or BLAs, submitted by Genentech that resulted in the approval of Avastin in these indications. Phase 2 clinical trials of both TRC102 and TRC105 are being performed in collaboration with NCI. If merited by Phase 2 data, we expect to fund initial Phase 3 clinical trials of TRC105 and TRC102, and, based on NCI&#8217;s past course of conduct with similarly situated pharmaceutical companies in which it has sponsored pivotal clinical trials following receipt of positive Phase 2 data, we anticipate that NCI will sponsor Phase 3 clinical trials 

&#160;

in additional indications. 

&#160; 

Collaboration and License Agreements 

&#160; 

License Agreement with Santen 

&#160; 

In March 2014, we entered into a license agreement with Santen, under which we granted Santen an exclusive, worldwide license to certain patents, information and know-how related to TRC105, or the TRC105 Technology. Under the agreement, as amended, Santen is permitted to use, develop, manufacture and commercialize TRC105 products for ophthalmology indications, excluding systemic treatment of ocular tumors. Santen also has the right to grant sublicenses to affiliates and third party collaborators, provided such sublicenses are consistent with the terms of our agreement. In the event Santen sublicenses any of its rights under the agreement relating to the TRC105 Technology, Santen will be obligated to pay us a portion of any upfront and certain milestone payments received under such sublicense. 

&#160; 

Santen has sole responsibility for funding, developing, seeking regulatory approval for and commercializing TRC105 products in the field of ophthalmology. In the event that Santen fails to meet certain commercial diligence obligations, we will have the option to co-promote TRC105 products in the field of ophthalmology in the United States with Santen. If we exercise this option, we will pay Santen a percentage of certain development expenses, and we will receive a percentage of profits from sales of the licensed products in the ophthalmology field in the United States, but will not also receive royalties on such sales. 

&#160; 

We will own any and all discoveries and inventions made solely by us under the agreement, and Santen will own any and all discoveries and inventions made solely by Santen under the agreement. We will jointly own discoveries and inventions made jointly by us and Santen. We have the first right, but not the obligation, to enforce the patents licensed to Santen under the agreement, and Santen has the first right, but not the obligation, to enforce the patents it controls that are related to TRC105 and the patents owned jointly by us and Santen. Subject to certain limitations, if the party with the first right to enforce a patent fails to timely do so, the other party will have the right to enforce such patent. 

&#160; 

In consideration of the rights granted to Santen under the agreement, we received a one-time upfront fee of $10.0 million. In addition, we are eligible to receive up to a total of $155.0 million in milestone payments upon the achievement of certain milestones, of which $20.0 million relates to the initiation of certain development activities, $52.5 million relates to the submission of certain regulatory filings and receipt of certain regulatory approvals and $82.5 million relates to commercialization activities and the achievement of specified levels of product sales. If TRC105 products are successfully commercialized in the field of ophthalmology, Santen will be required to pay us tiered royalties on net sales ranging from high single digits to low teens, depending on the volume of sales, subject to adjustments in certain circumstances. In addition, Santen will reimburse us for all royalties due by us under certain third party agreements with respect to the use, manufacture or commercialization of TRC105 products in the field of ophthalmology by Santen and its affiliates and sublicensees. Royalties will continue on a country-by-country basis through the later of the expiration of our patent rights applicable to the TRC105 products in a given country or 12 years after the first commercial sale of the first TRC105 product commercially launched in such country. As of December 31, 2015, $3.0 million of the development milestones have been achieved and received in accordance with the agreement. 

&#160; 

Santen may unilaterally terminate this agreement in its entirety, or on a country-by-country basis, for any reason or for no reason upon at least 90 days&#8217; notice to us (or 30 days&#8217; notice if after a change in control). Either party may terminate the agreement in the event of the other party&#8217;s bankruptcy or dissolution or for the other party&#8217;s material breach of the agreement that remains uncured 90 days (or 30 days with respect to a payment breach) after receiving notice from the non-breaching party. Unless earlier terminated, the agreement continues in effect until the termination of Santen&#8217;s payment obligations. 

&#160; 

License Agreement with Roswell Park Cancer Institute and Health Research Inc. 

&#160; 

In November 2005, we entered into a license agreement with Health Research Inc. and Roswell Park Cancer Institute, referred to collectively as RPCI. Under the agreement, as amended, we obtained an exclusive, worldwide license to certain patents and other intellectual property rights controlled by RPCI related to endoglin antibodies, 

&#160;

including TRC105, and their therapeutic uses, which we refer to as the RPCI Technology, and a non-exclusive, worldwide license to certain know-how controlled by RPCI related to the RPCI Technology. Under the agreement, we are permitted to use, manufacture, develop and commercialize products utilizing the RPCI Technology in all fields of use. In addition, we are permitted to sublicense our rights under the agreement to third parties. 

&#160; 

Under the agreement, we are responsible for development and commercialization activities for products utilizing the RPCI Technology, and we are obligated to use all commercially reasonable efforts to bring a product utilizing the RPCI Technology to market timely and efficiently. 

&#160; 

In consideration of the rights granted to us under the agreement, we paid a one-time upfront fee to RPCI. In addition, we may be required to pay up to an aggregate of approximately $6.4 million upon the achievement of certain milestones for products utilizing the RPCI Technology, including TRC105, of which approximately $1.4 million relates to the initiation of certain development activities and $5.0 million relates to certain regulatory filings and approvals. Pursuant to the amendment entered into in November 2009, we may also be required to pay up to an aggregate of approximately $6.4 million upon the achievement of certain milestones for products utilizing a patent owned by us covering humanized endoglin antibodies, including TRC205, of which approximately $1.4 million relates to the initiation of certain development activities and $5.0 million relates to certain regulatory filings and approvals. Upon commercialization, we will be required to pay RPCI mid single-digit royalties based on net sales of products utilizing the RPCI Technology in each calendar quarter, subject to adjustments in certain circumstances. In addition, pursuant to the amendment entered into in November 2009, we will be required to pay RPCI low single-digit royalties based on net sales in each calendar quarter of products utilizing our patent covering humanized endoglin antibodies. Our royalty obligations continue until the expiration of the last valid claim in a patent subject to the agreement, which we expect to occur in 2029, based on the patents currently subject to the agreement. 

&#160; 

We may unilaterally terminate this agreement in whole or in part, for any reason or no reason, upon at least 60 days&#8217; notice to RPCI. RPCI may terminate the agreement if we fail to pay any amount due under the agreement or materially breach the agreement and the breach remains uncured 90 days after receiving notice. In the event of our bankruptcy, the agreement will automatically terminate. Unless otherwise terminated, the agreement will remain in effect on a country-by-country basis until the expiration of the last valid claim under the patents subject to the agreement. 

&#160; 

License Agreement with Case Western 

&#160; 

In August 2006, we entered into a license agreement with Case Western, under which we obtained an exclusive, worldwide license to certain patents, know-how and other intellectual property controlled by Case Western related to methoxyamine, which we refer to as the TRC102 Technology. Under the agreement, as amended, we have the right to use, manufacture and commercialize products utilizing the TRC102 Technology for all mammalian therapeutic uses, and to sublicense these rights. 

&#160; 

Under the agreement, we are generally obligated to use our best efforts to commercialize the TRC102 Technology as soon as possible. We are also required to meet specified diligence milestones, and if we fail to do so and do not cure such failure, Case Western may convert our license into a non-exclusive license or terminate the agreement. 

&#160; 

In consideration of the rights granted to us under the agreement, we paid a one-time upfront fee to Case Western. In addition, we may be required to pay up to an aggregate of approximately $9.8 million in milestone payments, of which $650,000 relates to the initiation of certain development activities and approximately $9.1 million relates to the submission of certain regulatory filings and receipt of certain regulatory approvals. If products utilizing the TRC102 Technology are successfully commercialized, we will be required to pay Case Western a single-digit royalty on net sales, subject to adjustments in certain circumstances. Beginning on the earlier of a specified number of years from the effective date of the agreement and the anniversary of the effective date following the occurrence of a specified event, we will be required to make a minimum annual royalty payment of $75,000, which will be credited against our royalty obligations. In the event we sublicense any of our rights under the agreement relating to the TRC102 Technology, we will be obligated to pay Case Western a portion of certain fees we may receive under the sublicense. Our royalty obligations will continue through the later of (i) the expiration of any orphan drug marketing exclusivity for a product utilizing the TRC102 Technology, (ii) August 2026, or (iii) on a country-by-country basis upon the expiration 

&#160;

of the last valid claim under the TRC102 Technology or any patent we receive that is a derivative of the TRC102 Technology. 

&#160; 

We may unilaterally terminate this agreement in its entirety, for any reason or for no reason, upon at least 30 days&#8217; notice to Case Western. If we do so, we will be required to pay Case Western a termination fee. If we fail to pay any amount required under the agreement and do not cure the default within 90 days of receiving notice, Case Western will have to right to convert our exclusive license to a non-exclusive license or to terminate the agreement entirely. Either party may terminate the agreement in the event of the other party&#8217;s material breach of the agreement that remains uncured 60 days after receiving notice of the breach. 

&#160; 

License Agreement with Lonza Sales AG 

&#160; 

In June 2009, we entered into a license agreement with Lonza Sales AG, or Lonza, under which we obtained a world-wide non-exclusive license to Lonza&#8217;s glutamine synthetase gene expression system consisting of cell lines into which TRC105 may be transfected and corresponding patents and applications, which we refer to as the Lonza Technology. Under the agreement, we are permitted to use, develop, manufacture and commercialize TRC105 obtained through use of the Lonza Technology. 

&#160; 

In consideration for the rights granted to us under the agreement, we are required to pay Lonza a low single-digit percentage royalty on the net selling price of TRC105 product manufactured by Lonza. In the event that we or a strategic partner or collaborator manufactures the product, we will be required to pay Lonza an annual lump sum payment of &#163;75,000, along with a low single-digit percentage royalty on the net selling price of the manufactured TRC105 product. In the event that we sublicense our manufacturing rights under the agreement (other than to a strategic partner or collaborator), we will be obligated to pay Lonza an annual lump sum payment of &#163;300,000 per sublicense, along with a low single-digit percentage royalty on the net selling price of the manufactured TRC105 product. If, on a country-by-country basis, the manufacture or sale of the TRC105 product is not protected by a valid claim in a licensed patent, our royalty obligations in such country will decrease and will expire 12 years after the first commercial sale of the product. 

&#160; 

We may unilaterally terminate this agreement for any reason upon at least 60 days&#8217; written notice to Lonza. Either party may terminate the agreement by written notice if the other party commits a breach and, if the breach is curable, does not cure the breach within 30 days of receiving notice from the non-breaching party. In addition, either party may terminate the agreement with written notice in the event of the other party&#8217;s liquidation or appointment of a receiver. Unless earlier terminated, the agreement continues in effect until the later of the expiration of the last valid claim in a licensed patent or for so long as the know-how subject to the agreement is identified and remains secret and substantial. 

&#160; 

Cooperative Research and Development Agreements with NCI 

&#160; 

We are a party to three Cooperative Research and Development Agreements, or CRADAs, with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, as represented by NCI, for the development of TRC105 and TRC102 for the treatment of cancer. We entered into the two CRADAs governing the development of TRC105 in December 2010, or the 2010 CRADA, and January 2011, or the 2011 CRADA, respectively. The 2010 CRADA is with the Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis of NCI, and the 2011 CRADA is with NCI&#8217;s Center for Cancer Research. We entered into the CRADA governing the development of TRC102 in August 2012. 

&#160; 

Under the CRADAs, as amended, NCI conducts clinical trials and non-clinical studies of either TRC105 or TRC102. We are responsible for supplying TRC105 for NCI&#8217;s activities under the TRC105 CRADAs. 

&#160; 

Pursuant to the terms of the 2010 CRADA, we are required to pay NCI $20,000 per clinical trial per year as well as expenses incurred by NCI in connection with carrying out its responsibilities under the 2010 CRADA, up to an aggregate maximum of $500,000 per year, as well as up to $5,000 per year for personnel-related expenses. At our discretion, we may also provide additional funding to support assays and other studies. In addition, we made a one-time payment of $20,000 to support regulatory filings. Under the 2011 CRADA, we are required to pay NCI $5,000 per year 

&#160;

for support for its research activities, as well as up to $5,000 per year for personnel-related expenses. We may also provide funding for mutually agreed upon animal studies. Under the TRC102 CRADA, we are required to pay NCI $20,000 per year per Phase 1 clinical trial and $25,000 per year per Phase 2 clinical trial, as well as expenses incurred by NCI in connection with carrying out its responsibilities under the TRC102 CRADA, up to an aggregate maximum per year of $200,000. We may also provide funding to support assays and other studies, and if NCI supplies TRC102 for additional mutually approved clinical trials beyond the planned trials, we will reimburse NCI for costs associated with manufacturing TRC102. In addition, we made a one-time payment of $20,000 for the initial IND filing and may be required to make additional one-time payments of $10,000 each for additional IND filings. Funding for clinical trials beyond those contemplated by the 2010 CRADA or the TRC102 CRADA will be determined in an amendment to the applicable CRADA. 

&#160; 

Under each CRADA, each party individually owns all inventions, data and materials produced solely by its employees in the course of performing research activities pursuant to the CRADA. The parties jointly own any inventions and materials that are jointly produced by employees of both parties. Subject to certain conditions, we have the option under each CRADA to negotiate commercialization licenses from the government to intellectual property conceived or first reduced to practice in performance of the CRADA research plan that was developed solely by NCI employees or jointly by us and NCI employees. 

&#160; 

Each CRADA had an original five-year term, with the 2010 CRADA and the 2011 CRADA expiring on December 22, 2015 and January 28, 2016, respectively, and the TRC102 CRADA expiring on August 7, 2017. The 2010 and 2011 CRADA have been extended through December 22, 2018 and January 28, 2021, respectively. Each CRADA may be terminated at any time by mutual written consent, and we or NCI may unilaterally terminate any of the CRADAs for any reason or no reason by providing written notice at least 60 days before the desired termination date. 

&#160; 

Manufacturing 

&#160; 

We do not own or operate, nor do we expect to own or operate, facilities for product manufacturing, storage, distribution or testing. We therefore rely on various third-party manufacturers for the production of our product candidates. TRC105 drug substance for our preclinical studies, Phase 1 clinical trials and Phase 2 clinical trials is manufactured by Lonza, a contract manufacturer that also manufactures approved biologic cancer treatments marketed by other companies and is compliant to U.S. and European regulatory standards. 

&#160; 

TRC105 drug substance is produced by Chinese hamster ovary, or CHO, cells developed at Lonza and manufactured using Lonza&#8217;s proprietary manufacturing and purification processes. Lonza has capabilities to manufacture monoclonal antibodies and other protein therapeutics at the large scale needed for commercialization. We are currently working with Lonza to scale the process to a level that will support commercializatio n. 

&#160; 

TRC105 drug product is produced by an FDA-registered contract manufacturer. Drug product is filter-sterilized and aseptically filled into single-use pharmaceutical grade vials and stoppered using an automated filling machine. The final drug product is stored refrigerated until used. 

&#160; 

TRC102 drug substance is manufactured through a standard chemical synthesis and may be obtained from multiple manufacturers. 

&#160; 

TRC205 is currently produced at research scale using standard antibody production methods. We expect to contract with a third-party manufacturer to prepare production-grade cell lines for the cGMP manufacture of TRC205 prior to initiating clinical trials. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

The development and commercialization of new drugs is highly competitive, and we and our collaborators face competition with respect to each of our product candidates in their target indications. Many of the entities developing and marketing potentially competing products have significantly greater financial, technical and human resources and expertise than we do in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing. Mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may 

&#160;

result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. Our commercial opportunity will be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are more effective, have fewer side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. 

&#160; 

If our product candidates are approved, they will compete with currently marketed drugs and therapies used for treatment of the following indications, and potentially with drug candidates currently in development for the same indications. 

&#160; 

The key competitive factors affecting the success of any approved product will include its efficacy, safety profile, price, method of administration and level of promotional activity. 

&#160; 

Oncology Therapies 

&#160; 

We are developing TRC105 to be used in combination with VEGF inhibitors for the treatment of cancer. If TRC105 is approved, it could compete with other non-VEGF angiogenesis inhibitors in development, including some that also target the endoglin pathway and have the potential to be combined with VEGF inhibitors or used independently of VEGF inhibitors to inhibit angiogenesis. Acceleron Pharma Inc., Amgen, Inc., MedImmune LLC, OncoMed Pharmaceuticals Inc., Pfizer Inc., Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Roche AG are each developing non-VEGF angiogenesis inhibitors, which are in various phases of clinical development. Pfizer&#8217;s product candidate targets the endoglin co-receptor ALK1 and is in a Phase 1b clinical trial in combination with Stivarga in patients with colorectal carcinoma. Acceleron&#8217;s product candidate targets the endoglin ligand BMP and is in a Phase 2b clinical trial in combination with Inlyta in patients with renal cell carcinoma and a Phase 1b clinical trial in combination with Nexavar in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. 

&#160; 

We are developing TRC102 to be used in combination with alkylating chemotherapeutics (including Temodar) and antimetabolite chemotherapeutics (including Alimta and Fludara) for the treatment of cancer. If TRC102 is approved, it could compete with other inhibitors of DNA repair. Tesaro, Inc. and AbbVie Inc. are each developing inhibitors of DNA repair that work by a mechanism of action that is distinct from that of TRC102. In addition to the therapies mentioned above, there are many generic chemotherapeutics and other regimens commonly used to treat various types of cancer, including soft tissue sarcoma and glioblastoma. 

&#160; 

Wet AMD Therapies 

&#160; 

Our partner, Santen, is developing DE-122 for the treatment of wet AMD and other eye diseases. If DE-122 is approved in combination with a VEGF inhibitor it could compete with product candidates currently in clinical development that inhibit the function of PDGF or inhibit the function of both VEGF and PDGF, of which Ophthotech Corporation&#8217;s anti-PDGF agent, Fovista, currently in Phase 3 clinical development in combination with Lucentis, is the most advanced. If DE-122 is approved as a single agent, it would compete with currently marketed VEGF inhibitors, including Avastin and Lucentis (marketed by Genentech in the United States), and Eylea (marketed by Regeneron in the United States), which are well established therapies and are widely accepted by physicians, patients and third-party payors as the standard of care for the treatment of wet AMD. In addition, DE-122 could face competition from other VEGF inhibitors in development, such as Allergan&#8217;s VEGF inhibitor, DARPin, which is in Phase 2 clinical development for administration in a single intraocular injection. Other aniogenesis inhibitors in development include Regeneron&#8217;s antibody to PDGFR-beta, in Phase 2 development in combination with Eylea and Regeneron&#8217;s antibody to Ang2, which is planned to enter Phase 2 development in 2016 in combination with Eylea. 

&#160; 

Fibrotic Disease Therapies 

&#160; 

If TRC205 is approved for the treatment of diseases characterized by fibrosis, including NASH and IPF, we anticipate that TRC205 could compete with other therapies being developed for the same or similar indications. In addition, TRC205 would compete with therapies currently used off-label to treat fibrotic diseases. 

&#160; 

&#160;

NASH 

&#160; 

There are currently no therapeutic products approved by the FDA for the treatment of NASH. Several marketed therapeutics are currently used off- label for this indication, such as insulin sensitizers (including metformin), antihyperlipidemic agents (including gemfibrozil), pentoxifylline and Ursodeoxycholic acid (ursodiol), but they have not been proven effective in the treatment of NASH. We are aware of several companies that have product candidates in Phase 3 clinical development for the treatment of NASH, including Genfit Corp. and Intercept Pharmaceuticals, Inc. In addition, we are aware of companies in Phase 2 clinical development for the treatment of NASH, including Conatus Pharmaceuticals Inc., Galmed Medical Research Ltd., Gilead Sciences, Inc., Immuron Ltd., Shire plc, Mochida Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., NasVax Ltd., Raptor Pharmaceutical Corp. and Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, and there are other companies with candidates in earlier stage programs. 

&#160; 

IPF 

&#160; 

Esbriet, which is marketed by InterMune, Inc., is approved for the treatment of mild to moderate IPF in the United States, the European Union and other countries. OFEV, which is marketed by Boehringer Ingelheim, a VEGF inhibitor that is approved for the treatment of IPF in the United States and the European Union. There are at least eight product candidates in various stages of Phase 2 development being pursued by Biogen Idec., Bristol-Myers Squibb, Celgene Corporation, Fibrogen, Inc., Gilead, Janssen Pharmaceuticals Inc., Novartis AG and Sanofi S.A. 

&#160; 

Commercialization 

&#160; 

We hold worldwide commercialization rights for our oncology product candidates, TRC105 and TRC102, as well as for our fibrotic disease product candidate TRC205, while Santen holds worldwide commercialization rights for our endoglin antibodies, including TRC105, in the field of ophthalmology. If TRC105 or TRC102 is approved in oncology indications, our plan is to build an oncology-focused specialty sales force in North America to support their commercialization and seek a partner to support commercialization outside of North America. We believe that a specialty sales force will be sufficient to target key prescribing physicians in oncology. We currently do not have any sales or marketing capabilities or experience. We plan to establish the required capabilities within an appropriate time frame ahead of any product approval and commercialization to support a product launch. 

&#160; 

Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our protein therapeutics, novel biological discoveries, to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing U.S. and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and potential in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position. Additionally, we expect to benefit from a variety of statutory frameworks in the United States, Europe, Japan and other countries that relate to the regulation of biosimilar molecules and orphan drug status. These statutory frameworks provide periods of non-patent-based exclusivity for qualifying molecules. See &#8220;&#8212;Government Regulation.&#8221; 

&#160; 

Our patenting strategy is focused on our protein therapeutics. We seek composition-of-matter and method-of-treatment patents for each such protein in key therapeutic areas. We also seek patent protection with respect to companion diagnostic methods and compositions and treatments for targeted patient populations. We have sought patent protection alone or jointly with our collaborators, as dictated by our collaboration agreements. 

&#160; 

Our patent estate as of December 31, 2015, on a worldwide basis, includes 14 issued patents and allowed applications and eight pending patent applications in the United States and 25 issued patents and allowed applications and 40 pending patent applications outside the United States with pending and issued claims relating to our product candidates. 22 of our issued US and foreign patents cover antibodies to endoglin that we have selected as the core focus of our development approach. These figures include in-licensed patents and patent applications to which we hold 

&#160;

exclusive commercial rights in non-ophthalmologic fields of use. 

&#160; 

Individual patents extend for varying periods of time depending on the date of filing of the patent application or the date of patent issuance and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. Generally, patents issued from applications filed in the United States are effective for twenty years from the earliest non-provisional filing date. In addition, in certain instances, a patent term can be extended to recapture a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period, however, the restoration period cannot be longer than five years and the total patent term including the restoration period must not exceed 14 years following FDA approval. The duration of foreign patents varies in accordance with provisions of applicable local law, but typically is also twenty years from the earliest international filing date. Our issued patents and pending applications with respect to our protein therapeutic candidates will expire on dates ranging from 2016 to 2035, exclusive of possible patent term extensions. However, the actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product by product basis, from country to country and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of extensions of patent term, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent. 

&#160; 

National and international patent laws concerning protein therapeutics remain highly unsettled. No consistent policy regarding the patent-eligibility or the breadth of claims allowed in such patents has emerged to date in the United States, Europe or other countries. Changes in either the patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the United States and other countries can diminish our ability to protect our inventions and enforce our intellectual property rights. Accordingly, we cannot predict the breadth or enforceability of claims that may be granted in our patents or in third-party patents. The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights. Our ability to maintain and solidify our proprietary position for our drugs and technology will depend on our success in obtaining effective claims and enforcing those claims once granted. We do not know whether any of the patent applications that we may file or license from third parties will result in the issuance of any patents. The issued patents that we own or may receive in the future, may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, and the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with sufficient protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technology. Furthermore, our competitors may be able to independently develop and commercialize similar drugs or duplicate our technology, business model or strategy without infringing our patents. Because of the extensive time required for clinical development and regulatory review of a drug we may develop, it is possible that, before any of our drugs can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing any advantage of any such patent. The patent positions for our most advanced programs are summarized below: 

&#160; 

TRC105/TRC205 Patent Coverage 

&#160; 

We hold issued patents covering the TRC105 composition of matter in the United States, Japan, and Canada. The expected expiration date for these composition-of-matter patents is 2016, plus any extensions of term available under the applicable national law.

&#160; 

We have filed a patent application on further combinations of TRC102 that is pending the United States and Europe. The expected expiration date for these patents is 2031, exclusive of possible patent term extensions. 

&#160; 

Trade Secrets 

&#160; 

In addition to patents, we rely upon unpatented trade secrets and know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, using confidentiality agreements with our commercial partners, collaborators, employees and consultants and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of the invention assignment agreements, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with a third party. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our commercial partners, collaborators, employees and consultants use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. 

&#160; 

Government Regulation 

&#160; 

The preclinical studies and clinical testing, manufacture, labeling, storage, record keeping, advertising, promotion, export, marketing and sales, among other things, of our product candidates and future products, are subject to extensive regulation by governmental authorities in the United States and other countries. In the United States, pharmaceutical products are regulated by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, of FFDCA, and other laws, including, in the case of biologics, the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, in addition to the FDA&#8217;s implementing regulations. We expect TRC105 to be regulated by the FDA as a biologic, which requires the submission of a BLA and approval by the FDA prior to being marketed in the United States. We expect our small molecule product candidate TRC102 to be regulated as a drug and subject to New Drug Application, or NDA, requirements, which are substantially similar to the BLA requirements discussed below. Manufacturers of our product candidates may also be subject to state regulation. Failure to comply with FDA requirements, both before and after product approval, may subject us or our partners, contract manufacturers and suppliers to administrative or judicial sanctions, including FDA refusal to approve applications, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, fines and/or criminal prosecution. 

&#160; 

The steps required before a biologic may be approved for marketing of an indication in the United States generally include: 

&#160; 

&#61623; completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies conducted according to Good Laboratory Practices, or GLPs, and other applicable regulations; 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#61623; submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may commence; 

&#160; 

&#61623; completion of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with Good Clinical Practices, or GCPs, to establish that the biological product is &#8220;safe, pure and potent,&#8221; which is analogous to the safety and efficacy approval standard for a chemical drug product for its intended use; 

&#160; 

&#61623; submission to the FDA of a BLA; 

&#160; 

&#61623; satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with applicable current Good Manufacturing Practice requirements, or cGMPs; and 

&#160; 

&#61623; FDA review of the BLA and issuance of a biologics license which is the approval necessary to market a biologic therapeutic product. 

&#160; 

Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and efficacy of the biologic candidate. Preclinical studies must be conducted in compliance with FDA regulations regarding GLPs. The results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. Nonclinical testing may continue after the IND is submitted. In addition to including the results of the preclinical testing, the IND will also include a protocol detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated if the first phase or phases of the clinical trial lends themselves to an efficacy determination. The IND will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA within the 30-day time period places the IND on clinical hold because of its concerns about the drug candidate or the conduct of the trial described in the clinical protocol included in the IND. The FDA can also place the IND on clinical hold at any time during drug development for safety concerns related to the investigational drug or to the class of products to which it belongs. The IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can proceed. 

&#160; 

All clinical trials must be conducted under the supervision of one or more qualified principal investigators in accordance with GCPs. They must be conducted under protocols detailing the objectives of the applicable phase of the trial, dosing procedures, research subject selection and exclusion criteria and the safety and effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND, and progress reports detailing the status of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA annually. Sponsors also must timely report to the FDA serious and unexpected adverse reactions, any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator&#8217;s brochure, or any findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the drug. An institutional review board, or IRB, at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the protocol before a clinical trial commences at that institution, approve the information regarding the trial and the consent form that must be provided to each research subject or the subject&#8217;s legal representative, and monitor the study until completed. 

&#160; 

Clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap and different trials may be initiated with the same drug candidate within the same phase of development in similar or differing patient populations. Phase 1 clinical trials may be conducted in a limited number of patients, but are usually conducted in healthy volunteer subjects for indications other than oncology. The drug candidate is initially tested for safety and, as appropriate, for absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion, pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics. 

&#160; 

Phase 2 usually involves trials in a larger, but still limited, patient population to evaluate preliminarily the efficacy of the drug candidate for specific, targeted indications to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage and to identify possible short-term adverse effects and safety risks. 

&#160; 

Phase 3 trials are undertaken to further evaluate clinical efficacy of a specific endpoint and to test further for safety within an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. Phase 1, Phase 2, or Phase 3 testing might not be completed successfully within any specific time period, if at all, with respect to any of our product 

&#160;

candidates. Results from one trial are not necessarily predictive of results from later trials. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend clinical trials at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB&#8217;s requirements or if the drug candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. 

&#160; 

The FFDCA permits the FDA and an IND sponsor to agree in writing on the design and size of clinical studies intended to form the primary basis of a claim of effectiveness in a BLA or NDA. This process is known as a Special Protocol Assessment, or SPA. An SPA agreement may not be changed by the sponsor or the FDA after the trial begins except with the written agreement of the sponsor and the FDA, or if the FDA determines that a substantial scientific issue essential to determining the safety or effectiveness of the drug was identified after the testing began. For certain types of protocols, including carcinogenicity protocols, stability protocols, and Phase 3 protocols for clinical trials that will form the primary basis of an efficacy claim, the FDA has agreed under its performance goals associated with the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, to provide a written response on most protocols within 45 days of receipt. However, the FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goals, and additional FDA questions and resolution of issues leading up to an SPA agreement may result in the overall SPA process being much longer, if an agreement is reached at all. 

&#160; 

The results of the preclinical studies and clinical trials, together with other detailed information, including information on the manufacture and composition of the product, are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA requesting approval to market the drug candidate for a proposed indication. Under the PDUFA, as re-authorized most recently in July 2012, the fees payable to the FDA for reviewing a BLA, as well as annual fees for commercial manufacturing establishments and for approved products, can be substantial. The fees typically increase each year. Each BLA submitted to the FDA for approval is reviewed for administrative completeness and reviewability within 60 days following receipt by the FDA of the application. If the BLA is found complete, the FDA will file the BLA, triggering a full review of the application. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission. The FDA&#8217;s established goal is to review 90% of priority BLA applications within six months after the application is accepted for filing and 90% of standard BLA applications within 10 months of the acceptance date, whereupon a review decision is to be made. The FDA, however, may not approve a drug candidate within these established goals and its review goals are subject to change from time to time. Further, the outcome of the review, even if generally favorable, may not be an actual approval but a &#8220;complete response letter&#8221; that describes additional work that must be done before the application can be approved. Before approving a BLA, the FDA may inspect the facility or facilities at which the product is manufactured and will not approve the product unless the facility complies with cGMPs. The FDA may deny approval of a BLA if applicable statutory or regulatory criteria are not satisfied, or may require additional testing or information, which can extend the review process. FDA approval of any application may include many delays or never be granted. If a product is approved, the approval may impose limitations on the uses for which the product may be marketed, may require that warning statements be included in the product labeling, may require that additional studies be conducted following approval as a condition of the approval, and may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing, or dispensing in the form of a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. The FDA must approve a BLA supplement or a new BLA before a product may be marketed for other uses or before certain manufacturing or other changes may be made. Further post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of a product is required. Also, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if safety or manufacturing problems occur following initial marketing. In addition, new government requirements may be established that could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our product candidates under development. 

&#160; 

As part of the recently-enacted Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care Education Reconciliation Act, under the subtitle of Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or the BPCIA, a statutory pathway has been created for licensure, or approval, of biological products that are biosimilar to, and possibly interchangeable with, earlier biological products licensed under the PHSA. Also under the BPCIA, innovator manufacturers of original reference biological products are granted 12 years of exclusivity before biosimilars can be approved for marketing in the United States. The objectives of the BPCIA are conceptually similar to those of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the &#8220;Hatch-Waxman Act,&#8221; which established abbreviated pathways for the approval of drug products. The implementation of an abbreviated approval 

&#160;

pathway for biological products is under the direction of the FDA and is currently being developed. In February 2012 and February 2013, the FDA issued several draft guidances for industry related to the BPCIA, addressing scientific, quality and procedural issues relevant to an abbreviated application for a biosimilar product. In June 2014, the FDA also released a draft guidance document intended to assist sponsors developing biological products and BLA holders in providing information and data to the FDA to determine the date of first licensure for a reference product as contemplated in the BPCIA. The approval of a biologic product biosimilar to one of our products could have a material adverse impact on our business as it may be significantly less costly to bring to market and may be priced significantly lower than our products. 

&#160; 

Both before and after the FDA approves a product, the manufacturer and the holder or holders of the BLA for the product are subject to comprehensive regulatory oversight. For example, quality control and manufacturing procedures must conform, on an ongoing basis, to cGMP requirements, and the FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to spend time, money and effort to maintain cGMP compliance. The first biosimilar to a non-antibody protein was approved in the U.S. in March 2015. 

&#160; 

Other Healthcare Laws 

&#160; 

Although we currently do not have any products on the market, we may be subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. Such laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, privacy and security and physician sunshine laws and regulations, many of which may become more applicable if our product candidates are approved and we begin commercialization. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. 

&#160; 

Orphan Drug Act 

&#160; 

The Orphan Drug Act provides incentives to manufacturers to develop and market drugs for rare diseases and conditions affecting fewer than 200,000 persons in the United States at the time of application for orphan drug designation. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the holder of the approval is entitled to a seven-year exclusive marketing period in the United States for that product except in very limited circumstances. For example, a drug that the FDA considers to be clinically superior to, or different from, another approved orphan drug, even though for the same indication, may also obtain approval in the United States during the seven-year exclusive marketing period. In addition, holders of exclusivity for orphan drugs are expected to assure the availability of sufficient quantities of their orphan drugs to meet the needs of patients. Failure to do so could result in the withdrawal of marketing exclusivity for the drug. 

&#160; 

Legislation similar to the Orphan Drug Act has been enacted outside the United States, including in the European Union and Japan. The orphan legislation in the European Union is available for therapies addressing chronic debilitating or life-threatening conditions that affect five or fewer out of 10,000 persons or are financially not viable to develop. The market exclusivity period is for ten years, although that period can be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, available evidence establishes that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. The market exclusivity may be extended to 12 years if sponsors complete a pediatric investigation plan agreed upon with the relevant committee of the European Medicines Agency. Orphan legislation in Japan similarly provides for ten years of marketing exclusivity for drugs that are approved for the treatment of rare diseases and conditions. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Exclusivity 

&#160; 

TRC105 and TRC205, as new biological products, benefit from the data exclusivity provisions legislated in the United States, the European Union and Japan. All three regions effectively provide a period of data exclusivity to innovator biologic products. U.S. legislation provides a 12-year period of data exclusivity from the date of first licensure of a reference biologic product. EU legislation provides a period of 10 to 11 years and Japan legislation provides a period of 8 years during which companies cannot be granted approval as generic drugs to approved biologic therapies. Protection from generic competition is also available for new chemical entities, including potentially the small molecule TRC102, in the United States for 5 years, in the European Union for 10 to 11 years and in Japan for 8 years. 

&#160; 

Exclusivity in the European Union 

&#160; 

The European Union has led the way among the International Conference on Harmonisation regions in establishing a regulatory framework for biosimilar products. The marketing authorization of generic medicinal products and similar biological medicinal products are governed in the European Union by Article 10(1) of Directive 2001/83/EC (2001). Unlike generic medicinal products, which only need to demonstrate bioequivalence to an authorized reference product, similar biological medicinal products are required to submit preclinical and clinical data, the type and quantity of which is dictated by class and product specific guidelines. In order to submit a marketing authorization for a similar biological medicinal product, the reference product must have been authorized for marketing in the European Union for at least 8 years. Biosimilars can only be authorized for use once the period of data exclusivity on the biological reference medicine has expired. In general, this means that the biological reference medicine must have been authorized for at least 10 years before a similar biological medicine can be made available by another company. The 10-year period can be extended to a maximum of 11 if, during the first 8 years of those 10 years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison to existing therapies. 

&#160; 

Many EU countries have banned interchangeability of biosimilars with their reference products to ensure adequate characterization of the safety profile of the biosimilar and to enable comparison to that of reference product. 

&#160; 

Exclusivity in Japan 

&#160; 

In 2009, Japan&#8217;s Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, or MHLW, and Pharmaceuticals and Medical Device Agency, or PMDA, issued the first Japanese guidance on biosimilars. The guideline (currently available only in Japanese), which shares common key features to EU guidelines, outlines the nonclinical, clinical and CMC requirements for biosimilar applications and describes the review process, naming conventions and application fees. To date, two biosimilar products have been approved in Japan. In June 2009, Novartis&#8217; biosimilar of somatropin became the first biosimilar approved in Japan. In January, 2010, Kissei&#8217;s biosimilar of epoetin alfa was approved. 

&#160; 

Japan does not grant exclusivity to pharmaceutical products; however, the country does have a Post Marketing Surveillance, or PMS, system that affects the timing of generic entry and, in effect, provides a period of market exclusivity to innovator products. This system allows safety data to be acquired for each product. A PMS period is set for most of new drug approvals, and until this period is over, generic companies cannot submit their applications for drug approvals as generic drugs. Recently, this period was extended to 8 years for all new drug approvals. Japan&#8217;s regulations do not allow currently for interchangeability of biosimilars with their reference products. 

&#160; 

Expedited Review and Approval 

&#160; 

The FDA has various programs, including Fast Track, priority review, and accelerated approval, which are intended to expedite or simplify the process for reviewing drugs and biologics, and/or provide for the approval of a drug or biologic on the basis of a surrogate endpoint. Even if a drug qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the drug no longer meets the conditions for qualification or that the time period for FDA review or approval will be shortened. Generally, drugs that are eligible for these programs are those for serious or life-threatening conditions, those with the potential to address unmet medical needs and those that offer meaningful benefits over existing treatments. For example, Fast Track is a process designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs to treat serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions and fill unmet medical needs. Priority review is 

&#160;

designed to give drugs that offer major advances in treatment or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists an initial review within six months as compared to a standard review time of ten months. Although Fast Track and priority review do not affect the standards for approval, the FDA will attempt to facilitate early and frequent meetings with a sponsor of a Fast Track designated drug and expedite review of the application for a drug designated for priority review. Accelerated approval provides for an earlier approval for a new drug that is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and that fills an unmet medical need based on a surrogate endpoint. A surrogate endpoint is a laboratory measurement or physical sign used as an indirect or substitute measurement representing a clinically meaningful outcome. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug candidate receiving accelerated approval perform post-marketing clinical trials to confirm the clinically meaning full outcome as predicted by the surrogate marker trial. 

&#160; 

In June 2013, the FDA published a draft Guidance for Industry entitled, &#8220;Expedited Programs for Serious Conditions&#8212;Drugs and Biologics&#8221; which provides guidance on FDA programs that are intended to facilitate and expedite development and review of new drugs as well as threshold criteria generally applicable to concluding that a drug is a candidate for these expedited development and review programs. In addition to the Fast Track, accelerated approval and priority review programs discussed above, the FDA also provided guidance on a new program for Breakthrough Therapy designation. A request for Breakthrough Therapy designation should be submitted concurrently with, or as an amendment to an IND. The FDA has already granted this designation and approved Breakthrough Therapy designated drugs. 

&#160; 

Pediatric Exclusivity and Pediatric Use 

&#160; 

Under the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, certain drugs may obtain an additional six months of exclusivity, if the sponsor submits information requested in writing by the FDA, or a Written Request, relating to the use of the active moiety of the drug in children. The FDA may decline to issue a Written Request for studies on unapproved or approved indications or where it determines that information relating to the use of a drug in a pediatric population, or part of the pediatric population, may not produce health benefits in that population. 

&#160; 

We have not received a Written Request for such pediatric studies, although we may ask the FDA to issue a Written Request for such studies in the future. To receive the six-month pediatric market exclusivity, we would have to receive a Written Request from the FDA, conduct the requested studies in accordance with a written agreement with the FDA or, if there is no written agreement, in accordance with commonly accepted scientific principles, and submit reports of the studies. A Written Request may include studies for indications that are not currently in the labeling if the FDA determines that such information will benefit the public health. The FDA will accept the reports upon its determination that the studies were conducted in accordance with and are responsive to the original Written Request or commonly accepted scientific principles, as appropriate, and that the reports comply with the FDA&#8217;s filing requirements. 

&#160; 

In addition, the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, requires a sponsor to conduct pediatric studies for most drugs and biologicals, for a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration. Under PREA, original NDAs, BLAs and supplements thereto must contain a pediatric assessment unless the sponsor has received a deferral or waiver. The required assessment must include the evaluation of the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The sponsor or FDA may request a deferral of pediatric studies for some or all of the pediatric subpopulations. A deferral may be granted for several reasons, including a finding that the drug or biologic is ready for approval for use in adults before pediatric studies are complete or that additional safety or effectiveness data needs to be collected before the pediatric studies begin. The FDA must send a non-compliance letter to any sponsor that fails to submit the required assessment, keep a deferral current or fails to submit a request for approval of a pediatric formulation. 

&#160; 

Coverage and Reimbursement 

&#160; 

Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval. In both domestic and foreign markets, sales and reimbursement of any approved products will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations provide coverage, and establish adequate reimbursement levels for, such products. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services and imposing controls to manage costs. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or 

&#160;

also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. Additionally, we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the cost- effectiveness of our products. If third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other therapies, the payors may not cover our products after approved as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of reimbursement may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis. 

&#160; 

The containment of healthcare costs also has become a priority of federal and state governments and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. Governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results. 

&#160; 

Outside the United States, ensuring adequate coverage and payment for our products will face challenges. Pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control in many countries. Pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can extend well beyond the receipt of regulatory marketing approval for a product and may require us to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost effectiveness of our product candidates or products to other available therapies. The conduct of such a clinical trial could be expensive and result in delays in our commercialization efforts. Third-party payors are challenging the prices charged for medical products and services, and many third-party payors limit reimbursement for newly-approved health care products. Recent budgetary pressures in many European Union countries are also causing governments to consider or implement various cost-containment measures, such as price freezes, increased price cuts and rebates. If budget pressures continue, governments may implement additional cost-containment measures. Cost-control initiatives could decrease the price we might establish for products that we may develop or sell, which would result in lower product revenues or royalties payable to us. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. 

&#160; 

Healthcare Reform 

&#160; 

There have been a number of federal and state proposals during the last few years regarding the pricing of pharmaceutical and biological products, government control and other changes to the healthcare system of the United States. It is uncertain what legislative proposals will be adopted or what actions federal, state or private payors for medical goods and services may take in response to any healthcare reform proposals or legislation. We cannot predict the effect medical or healthcare reforms may have on our business, and no assurance can be given that any such reforms will not have a material adverse effect. 

&#160; 

By way of example, the United States and state governments continue to propose and pass legislation designed to reduce the cost of healthcare. In March 2010, the United States Congress enacted the Affordable Care Act, which, among other things, includes changes to the coverage and payment for drug products under government health care programs. The Affordable Care Act: 

&#160; 

&#61623; expanded manufacturers&#8217; rebate liability under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program by increasing the minimum rebate for both branded and generic drugs and revising the definition of &#8220;average manufacturer price,&#8221; or AMP, for calculating and reporting Medicaid drug rebates on outpatient prescription drug prices; 

&#160; 

&#61623; addressed a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected; 

&#160; 

&#61623; extended Medicaid drug rebates, previously due only on fee-for-service utilization, to Medicaid managed care utilization, and created an alternate rebate formula for new formulations of certain existing products that is intended to increase the amount of rebates due on those drugs; 

&#160; 

&#61623; expanded the types of entities eligible for the 340B drug discount program that mandates discounts to certain hospitals, community centers and other qualifying providers. With the exception of children&#8217;s hospitals, these newly eligible entities will not be eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing on orphan drugs. In addition, because 340B pricing is determined based on AMP and Medicaid drug rebate data, the revisions to the Medicaid rebate formula and AMP definition described above could cause the required 

&#160;

340B discounts to increase; and 

&#160; 

&#61623; established the Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program by requiring manufacturers to provide a 50% point-of-sale-discount off the negotiated price of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period as a condition for the manufacturers&#8217; outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D. 

&#160; 

Adoption of other new legislation at the federal or state level could further limit reimbursement for pharmaceuticals, including our product candidates if approved. 

&#160; 

Foreign Regulation 

&#160; 

In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our product candidates. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product candidate, we must obtain approval from the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries or economic areas, such as the European Union, before we may commence clinical trials or market products in those countries or areas. The approval process and requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from place to place, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. 

&#160; 

Certain countries outside of the United States have a process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application much like an IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In Europe, for example, a clinical trial application, or CTA, must be submitted to the competent national health authority and to independent ethics committees in each country in which a company intends to conduct clinical trials. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country&#8217;s requirements, clinical trial development may proceed in that country. In all cases, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with good clinical practices, or GCPs and other applicable regulatory requirements. 

&#160; 

Under European Union regulatory systems, a company may submit marketing authorization applications either under a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure is compulsory for medicinal products produced by biotechnology or those medicinal products containing new active substances for specific indications such as the treatment of AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, viral diseases and designated orphan medicines, and optional for other medicines which are highly innovative. Under the centralized procedure, a marketing application is submitted to the European Medicines Agency where it will be evaluated by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use. A favorable opinion typically results in the grant by the European Commission of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all European Union member states within 67 days of receipt of the opinion. The initial marketing authorization is valid for five years, but once renewed is usually valid for an unlimited period. The decentralized procedure provides for approval by one or more &#8220;concerned&#8221; member states based on an assessment of an application performed by one member state, known as the &#8220;reference&#8221; member state. Under the decentralized approval procedure, an applicant submits an application, or dossier, and related materials to the reference member state and concerned member states. The reference member state prepares a draft assessment and drafts of the related materials within 120 days after receipt of a valid application. Within 90 days of receiving the reference member state&#8217;s assessment report, each concerned member state must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials. If a member state does not recognize the marketing authorization, the disputed points are eventually referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all member states. 

&#160; 

As in the United States, we may apply for designation of a product as an orphan drug for the treatment of a specific indication in the European Union before the application for marketing authorization is made. Orphan drugs in Europe enjoy economic and marketing benefits, including up to 10 years of market exclusivity for the approved indication unless another applicant can show that its product is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the orphan designated product. 

&#160; 

Additional Regulation 

&#160; 

We are also subject to regulation under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Environmental Protection Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and other present and potential 

&#160;

federal, state or local regulations. These and other laws govern our use, handling and disposal of various biological and chemical substances used in, and waste generated by our operations. Our research and development involves the controlled use of hazardous materials, chemicals and viruses. Although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of such materials comply with the standards prescribed by state and federal regulations, the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be completely eliminated. In the event of such an accident, we could be held liable for any damages that result and any such liability could exceed our resources.
