 Item 1. Business.

General

The Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on June 13, 1963 under the name Metro-Tel Corp. and changed its name to DRYCLEAN USA, Inc. on November 7, 1999. On December 1, 2009, the Company changed its name to EnviroStar, Inc.

The Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Steiner-Atlantic Corp. (&#8220;Steiner-Atlantic&#8221;), in the United States, the Caribbean and Latin American:

&#183; distributes commercial and industrial laundry and dry cleaning equipment and steam and hot water boilers manufactured by others; &#183; supplies replacement parts and accessories, and provides maintenance services to its customers; and &#183; designs and plans turn-key laundry, dry cleaning and boiler systems for its customers, which include institutional, retail, industrial and commercial customers. &#160;

2&#160;

&#160;

In addition, the Company, through DRYCLEAN USA License Corp., an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, owns the worldwide rights to the name DRYCLEAN USA&#174; and licenses the right to use such name for a fee to retail dry cleaners in the United States, the Caribbean and Latin America.

Prior to the quarter ended June 30, 2016, the Company reported the results of its operations through two reportable segments - the Company&#8217;s commercial and industrially laundry and dry cleaning equipment and boiler segment, which was comprised of the operations of Steiner-Atlantic, and the Company&#8217;s license and franchise operations segment, which was comprised of the operations of DRYCLEAN USA License Corp. As a result of the significantly reduced activities of DRYCLEAN USA License Corp., effective June 30, 2016, the license and franchise operations segment ceased to be a separate reportable segment and, accordingly, the Company currently reports its results of operations through a single reportable segment.

Products

The Company sells a broad line of commercial and industrial laundry and dry cleaning equipment and steam and hot water boilers manufactured by others, as well as related replacement parts and accessories, and provides maintenance services.

The commercial and industrial laundry equipment distributed by the Company include washroom, finishing, material handling, and mechanical equipment such as washers and dryers, tunnel systems and coin-operated machines, many of which are designed to reduce utility and water consumption. Finishing equipment distributed by the Company includes sheet feeders, flatwork ironers, automatic sheet folders, and stackers. Material handling equipment distributed by the Company includes conveyor and rail systems. Mechanical equipment distributed by the Company includes boilers, hot water/steam systems and air compressors.

The dry cleaning equipment distributed by the Company includes commercial dry cleaning machines, most of which, including the Company&#8217;s proprietary Green Jet&#174; dry-wetcleaning machine, are designed to be environmentally friendly as they do not use perchloroethylene (&#8220;Perc&#8221;) in the dry cleaning process, thereby eliminating the health and environmental concerns that Perc poses to customers and their landlords. This line of products also includes garment presses, finishing equipment, sorting and storage conveyors and accessories. 

Boiler products consist of high efficiency, low emission steam boilers, steam systems and hot water systems that are used in the laundry and dry cleaning industry for temperature control, heating, pressing and de-wrinkling, and in the healthcare industry, food and beverage industry, HVAC industry and in other industrial markets for sterilization, product sealing and other purposes.

3&#160;

&#160;

The Company also sells replacement parts and accessories for the products it sells and provides maintenance services to its customers.

The Company seeks to position and price the products that it sells to appeal to customers in each of the high-end, mid-range and value-priced markets, as the products are generally offered in a wide range of price points to address the needs of a diverse customer base. Suggested prices for most of the Company&#8217;s equipment range from approximately $5,000 to $1,000,000. The Company believes that the portfolio of products that it sells affords the Company&#8217;s customers a &#8220;one-stop shop&#8221; for commercial and industrial laundry and dry cleaning machines, boilers and accessories and that, as a result, the Company is better able to attract and support potential customers who can choose from the Company&#8217;s broad product line. The products and parts sold by the Company and the maintenance services provided by the Company accounted for approximately 99% of the Company&#8217;s revenues for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 (sometimes referred to herein as &#8220;fiscal 2016&#8221;) and approximately 98% of the Company&#8217;s revenues for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 (sometimes referred to herein as &#8220;fiscal 2015&#8221;).

Buy-and-Build Growth Strategy

In addition to organic growth, the Company&#8217;s current business strategy also includes the consideration and pursuit of acquisitions and other strategic transactions that would complement the Company&#8217;s existing business or that might otherwise offer growth opportunities for the Company. In connection therewith, the Company intends to seek to identify and acquire what the Company believes are well-run businesses and help build them through certain initiatives, which may include investments in new locations, additional product lines, expanded service capabilities and advanced technologies. There is no assurance that the Company&#8217;s buy-and-build growth strategy will be successful. 

On September 7, 2016, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Western State Design, LLC, a California limited liability company (&#8220;Western State Design&#8221;), and its members, Dennis Mack and Tom Marks (collectively, the &#8220;Selling Group&#8221;), pursuant to which the Company, indirectly through a newly formed wholly owned subsidiary, has agreed to acquire substantially all of the assets and assume certain liabilities of Western State Design (the &#8220;Western State Design Acquisition&#8221;). The total consideration for the Western State Design Acquisition will be equal to $28,000,000, consisting of (i) cash consideration of $18,000,000 (subject to certain net working capital and other adjustments) and (ii) 2,044,990 shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock, which amount is equal to the quotient of $10,000,000 divided by the average closing price per share of the Company&#8217;s common stock on the NYSE MKT for the 10 trading days immediately prior to the date of the Asset Purchase Agreement (the &#8220;Average Common Stock Price&#8221;). Pursuant to the rules of NYSE MKT, the Company may not issue shares representing more than 19.9% of the total number of shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock outstanding at the time of closing without stockholder approval. Accordingly, at the closing of the Western State Design Acquisition, the Company will issue shares representing 19.9% of the total number of outstanding shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock. The issuance of the balance of the shares issuable in connection with the Western State Design Acquisition will require the approval of the Company&#8217;s stockholders. The Company has agreed to seek stockholder approval of such issuance. If the Company does not obtain stockholder approval of the issuance or otherwise issue the additional shares on or prior to the six-month anniversary after the date of the closing of the Western State Design Acquisition, then the Company will be required to make a cash payment in an amount equal to the number of shares not issued multiplied by the Average Common Stock Price. 

In connection with the financing of the Western State Design Acquisition, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with Symmetric Capital II LLC (&#8220;Symmetric Capital II&#8221;), a company controlled by Henry M. Nahmad, the Manager of Symmetric Capital II and the Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, President and controlling stockholder of the Company. Pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement, the Company agreed to issue and sell to Symmetric Capital II in a private placement transaction (the &#8220;Private Placement&#8221;) an aggregate of 1,290,323 shares (the &#8220;Private Placement Shares&#8221;) of the Company&#8217;s common stock for a total purchase price of approximately $6,000,000. The Company will use the proceeds from the Private Placement to fund a portion of the cash consideration to be paid in 

4&#160;

&#160;

connection with the Western State Design Acquisition. Subject to certain closing conditions, including a financing condition and the approval by the NYSE MKT of the listing of the Private Placement Shares, the closing of the Private Placement is expected to occur immediately prior to the closing of the Western State Design Acquisition. 

In addition, the Company has obtained a debt financing commitment from Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (&#8220;Wells Fargo&#8221;), for senior secured financing facilities in the maximum aggregate amount of up to $20,000,000, approximately $12,000,000 of which the Company intends to use to finance the balance of the cash consideration to be paid in connection with the Western State Design Acquisition not funded by the net proceeds of the Private Placement. The financing facilities are subject to the negotiation of mutually acceptable definitive documentation, which will include customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants, financial covenants, and events of default. Additionally, Wells Fargo&#8217;s obligation to provide the debt financing is subject to a number of customary closing conditions, including consummation of the Western State Design Acquisition in accordance with the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement. 

Closing of the Western State Design Acquisition is subject to certain closing conditions, including, but not limited to, (i) the Company obtaining, on terms and conditions acceptable to the Company, satisfactory debt and equity financing sufficient to fund the cash consideration; (ii) the approval by the NYSE MKT of the listing of the shares to be issued at the closing of the Western State Design Acquisition; (iii) the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the parties; and (iv) the parties&#8217; performance and compliance in all material respects with the agreements and covenants contained in the Asset Purchase Agreement. In addition, closing of the Western State Design Acquisition is conditioned upon the members of the Selling Group entering into a Stockholders Agreement with Symmetric Capital II and certain of its affiliates, including Mr. Nahmad, pursuant to which, among other things, the members of the Selling Group will agree to vote all of the shares of the Company&#8217;s Common Stock owned by them at any time during the term of the Stockholders Agreement as directed by the Manager of Symmetric Capital II and grant to the Manager of Symmetric Capital II an irrevocable proxy and power of attorney in furtherance thereof. As previously described, Mr. Nahmad is the Manager of Symmetric Capital II.

There is no assurance that the Western State Design Acquisition will be completed on the contemplated terms, when anticipated, or at all.

Customers and Markets

The Company&#8217;s customer base consists of approximately 1,600 customers in the United States, the Caribbean and Latin America. The Company&#8217;s commercial and industrial laundry equipment and boilers are sold primarily to laundry plants, hotels, motels, cruise lines, hospitals, hospital combines, nursing homes, government institutions, distributors and specialized users. Dry cleaning equipment is sold primarily to independent and franchise dry cleaning stores, chains and higher-end hotels. Sales to one customer accounted for approximately 12% of the Company&#8217;s revenues for fiscal 2016.

Sales, Marketing and Customer Support

The laundry and dry cleaning equipment products and boilers marketed by the Company are sold to its customers in the United States, the Caribbean and Latin America, as well as customers of its DRYCLEAN USA&#174; licensing subsidiary. The Company employs sales persons to market its proprietary and distributed products in the United States, the Caribbean and Latin America. A substantial portion of sales orders for equipment and replacement parts and accessories are obtained by telephone, e-mail and fax inquiries originated by the customer or by the Company, and significant repeat sales are derived from existing customers. The Company supports product sales through its website and by advertising in trade publications, participating in trade shows and engaging in regional promotions and sales incentive programs.

5&#160;

&#160;

The Company seeks to establish customer satisfaction by offering:

&#183; competitive pricing; &#183; maintenance of a comprehensive replacement parts and accessories inventory, often with same day or overnight availability; &#183; design and layout services; &#183; a toll-free support line and technical website to resolve customer service problems; and &#183; service and on-site training performed by factory trained technicians. The Company trains its employees to provide service and customer support. The Company uses in-person classroom training, instructional videos and vendor sponsored seminars to educate employees about product information. In addition, the Company&#8217;s technical staff has prepared training manuals, written in English and Spanish, relating to specific training procedures. The Company&#8217;s technical personnel are retrained as the Company believes to be necessary as new technology is developed.

Foreign Sales

For fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015, export revenues, principally to the Caribbean and Latin America, totaled approximately $4.6 million and $8.5 million, respectively, substantially all of which related to commercial and industrial laundry and dry cleaning equipment and boilers.

All of the Company&#8217;s export sales require the customer to make payment in United States dollars. Foreign sales may be affected by the strength of the United States dollar relative to the currencies of the countries in which the Company&#8217;s customers are located, as well as the strength of the economies of the countries in which the Company&#8217;s customers are located.

Sources of Supply

The Company purchases laundry, dry cleaning machines, boilers and other products from a number of manufacturers and suppliers. Three of these manufacturers accounted for approximately 34%, 24% and 10%, respectively, of the Company&#8217;s purchases for fiscal 2016, and two manufacturers each accounted for approximately 27% of the Company&#8217;s purchases for fiscal 2015. The major manufacturers of the products sold by the Company are Pellerin Milnor Corporation, Chicago Dryer Company, Alliance Laundry Systems, LLC, Cleaver Brooks Inc., E-Tech Inc., Fulton Thermal Corp., and Unipress Corporation. While the Company has contracts with only a few of the manufacturers and suppliers of the products which the Company sells, the Company has established long-standing relationships with most of its manufacturers and suppliers. The Company has not historically experienced difficulty in purchasing products it distributes and believes that it has good working relationships with its manufacturers and suppliers. The Company further believes that such relationships provide the Company with certain competitive advantages, including exclusivity for certain products in certain areas and, in certain cases, favorable prices and terms. However, there is no assurance that the Company will maintain its relationships with any of its suppliers, and the loss of certain of these relationships, including the loss of a relationship with one of the Company&#8217;s principal suppliers, could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business and results.

Due to special options and features on most of the larger and more expensive equipment ordered by customers, in most instances, the Company purchases the equipment sold by it after its receipt of orders from its customers. However, the Company also maintains an inventory of more standardized and smaller-sized equipment that often requires more rapid delivery to meet customer needs.

Competition

The commercial and industrial laundry, dry cleaning equipment and boiler distribution business is highly competitive and fragmented, with over 100 full-line or partial-line equipment distributors in the United States. The Company&#8217;s management believes that no one distributor has a major share of the 

6&#160;

&#160;

market; substantially all distributors are independently owned; and, with the exception of several regional distributors, distributors operate primarily in local markets. In Florida, the Company&#8217;s principal domestic market, the Company&#8217;s primary competition is from a number of full-line distributors and several manufacturers, which sell direct to the customer. In the export market, the Company competes with distributors and manufacturers as well. Competition is based primarily on price, product quality, and delivery and support services provided to the customer. In all geographic areas, the Company seeks to compete by offering an extensive product selection, value-added services, such as product inspection and quality assurance, a toll-free customer support line and technical website, reliability, warehouse location, price, competitive special features and, with respect to certain products, exclusivity from the manufacturer.

The Company also faces competition from several franchisors and turn-key suppliers of dry cleaning stores, primarily on the basis of trademark recognition and reputation, in connection with its licensing operations and its activities related to the design and planning of turn-key dry cleaning establishments for its customers.

Research and Development

The Company&#8217;s research and development efforts and expenses are generally immaterial as most of the Company&#8217;s products are distributed for manufacturers that perform their own research and development.

Patents and Trademarks

The Company is the owner of United States service mark registrations for the names EnviroStar&#174;, Aero-Tech&#174;, and Green Jet&#174;, which are used in connection with its laundry and dry cleaning equipment, and for the name DRYCLEAN USA&#174;, which is licensed by it to retail dry cleaning establishments. The Company intends to use and protect these or related service marks, as necessary.

Compliance with Environmental and Other Government Laws and Regulations

Over the past several decades, federal, state and local governments in the United States and various other countries have enacted environmental protection laws in response to public concerns about the environment, including with respect to Perc, the primary cleaning agent historically used in the commercial and industrial dry cleaning process. A number of industries, including the commercial and industrial dry cleaning and laundry equipment industries, are subject to these evolving laws and implementing regulations. As a supplier to the industry, the Company serves customers who are primarily responsible for compliance with environmental regulations. Among the United States federal laws that the Company believes are applicable to the industry are the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (&#8220;CERCLA&#8221;), which provides for the investigation and remediation of hazardous waste sites; the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, as amended (&#8220;RCRA&#8221;), which regulates the generation and transportation of hazardous waste as well as its treatment, storage and disposal; and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration Act (&#8220;OSHA&#8221;), which regulates exposure to toxic substances and other health and safety hazards in the workplace. Most states and a number of localities have laws that regulate the environment, which are at least as stringent as the federal laws. In Florida, for example, in which a significant amount of the Company&#8217;s dry cleaning and laundry equipment sales are made, environmental matters are regulated by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, which generally follows the United States government&#8217;s Environmental Protection Agency&#8217;s (&#8220;EPA&#8221;) policy with respect to the implementation of CERCLA and RCRA, and closely adheres to OSHA&#8217;s standards.

The Company does not believe that compliance with federal, state and local environmental and other laws and regulations which have been adopted have had, or will have, a material effect on its capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.

&#160;

Employees

As of September 16, 2016, the Company had 31 employees, including 30 full-time employees. None of the Company&#8217;s employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. The Company believes that its relations with its employees are satisfactory.
