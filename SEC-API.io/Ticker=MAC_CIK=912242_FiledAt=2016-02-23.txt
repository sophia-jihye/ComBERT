Other Transactions and Events: 

On March 9, 2015, the Company received an unsolicited, conditional proposal from Simon Property Group, Inc. (&#8220;Simon&#8221;) to acquire the Company. The Company&#8217;s Board of Directors, after consulting with its financial, real estate and legal advisors, unanimously determined that the Simon proposal substantially undervalued the Company and was not in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. On March 20, 2015, the Company received a revised, unsolicited proposal to acquire the Company from Simon, which Simon described as its best and final proposal. The Company&#8217;s Board of Directors carefully reviewed the revised proposal with the assistance of its financial, real estate and legal advisors, and determined that the revised proposal continued to substantially undervalue the Company and that pursuing the proposed transaction at that time was not in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. 

On June 30, 2015 , the Company conveyed Great Northern Mall , an 895,000 &#32;square foot regional shopping center &#32;in Clay , New York , to the mortgage lender by a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure and was discharged from the mortgage note payable. The mortgage note payable was a non-recourse loan. As a result, the Company recognized a loss of $1.6 million &#32;on the extinguishment of debt. 

On September 30, 2015 , the Company's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1.2 billion &#32;of the Company's outstanding common shares over the period ending September 30, 2017 , as market conditions warrant. On November 12, 2015 , the Company entered into an accelerated share repurchase program ("ASR") to repurchase $400.0 million &#32;of the Company's common stock. In accordance with the ASR, the Company made a prepayment of $400.0 million &#32;and received an initial share delivery of 4,140,788 &#32;shares. On January 20, 2016 , the ASR was completed and the Company received an additional delivery of 970,609 &#32;shares. The average price of the 5,111,397 &#32;shares repurchased under the ASR was $78.26 &#32;per share. The ASR was funded from proceeds in connection with the financing and sale of the ownership interest in the PPR Portfolio &#32;(See "Acquisitions and Dispositions" and "Financing Activity" in Recent Developments). 

On October 30, 2015, the Company declared two &#32;special dividends/distributions ("Special Dividend"), each of $2.00 &#32;per share of common stock and per Operating Partnership Unit ("OP Unit"). The first Special Dividend was paid on December 8, 2015 to stockholders and OP Unit holders of record on November 12, 2015. The second Special Dividend was paid on January 6, 2016 to common stockholders and OP Unit holders of record on November 12, 2015. The Special Dividends were funded from proceeds in connection with the financing and sale of ownership interests in the PPR Portfolio &#32;and Arrowhead Towne Center &#32;(See "Acquisitions and Dispositions" and "Financing Activity" in Recent Developments). 

On November 1, 2015 , the mortgage note payable on Flagstaff Mall , a 347,000 &#32;square foot regional shopping center &#32;in Flagstaff , Arizona , went into maturity default. The mortgage note payable is a non-recourse loan. The Company is negotiating with the loan servicer, which will likely result in a transition of the property to the loan servicer or a receiver. Consequently, Flagstaff Mall &#32;has been excluded from certain 2015 performance metrics and related discussions in this "Item 1. Business", including major tenants, average base rents, cost of occupancy, lease expirations and anchors (See "Major Tenants", "Mall Stores and Freestanding Stores", "Cost of Occupancy", "Lease Expirations", and "Anchors" below). In addition, Flagstaff Mall &#32;has been excluded from the Company's list of properties and related computations of GLA, occupancy and sales per square foot (See "Item 2. Properties"). 

On February 17, 2016 , the Company entered into an ASR to repurchase $400.0 million &#32;of the Company's common stock. In accordance with the ASR, the Company made a prepayment of $400.0 million &#32;and received an initial share delivery of 4,222,193 &#32;shares. The Company expects to complete the ASR on or before April 22, 2016 . The ASR was funded from borrowings under the Company's line of credit, which had been recently paid down from the proceeds from the recently completed financings and sale of ownership interests (See "Acquisitions and Dispositions" and "Financing Activity" in Recent Developments). 

The Shopping Center Industry 

General: 

There are several types of retail shopping centers, which are differentiated primarily based on size and marketing strategy. Regional shopping centers generally contain in excess of 400,000 square feet of GLA and are typically anchored by two or more department or large retail stores ("Anchors") and are referred to as "Regional Shopping Centers" or "Malls." Regional Shopping Centers also typically contain numerous diversified retail stores ("Mall Stores"), most of which are national or regional retailers typically located along corridors connecting the Anchors. "Strip centers", "urban villages" or "specialty centers" ("Community/Power Shopping Centers") are retail shopping centers that are designed to attract local or neighborhood customers and are typically anchored by one or more supermarkets, discount department stores and/or drug stores. Community/Power Shopping Centers typically contain 100,000 to 400,000 square feet of GLA. Outlet Centers generally contain a wide variety of designer and manufacturer stores, often located in an open-air center, and typically range in size from 200,000 to 850,000 square feet of GLA ("Outlet Centers"). In addition, freestanding retail stores are located along the perimeter of the shopping centers ("Freestanding Stores"). Mall Stores and Freestanding Stores over 10,000 square feet of GLA are also referred to as "Big Box." Anchors, Mall Stores, Freestanding Stores and other tenants typically contribute funds for the maintenance of the common areas, property taxes, insurance, advertising and other expenditures related to the operation of the shopping center. 

Regional Shopping Centers: 

A Regional Shopping Center draws from its trade area by offering a variety of fashion merchandise, hard goods and services and entertainment, often in an enclosed, climate controlled environment with convenient parking. Regional Shopping Centers provide an array of retail shops and entertainment facilities and often serve as the town center and a gathering place for community, charity, and promotional events. 

Regional Shopping Centers have generally provided owners with relatively stable income despite the cyclical nature of the retail business. This stability is due both to the diversity of tenants and to the typical dominance of Regional Shopping Centers in their trade areas. 

Regional Shopping Centers have different strategies with regard to price, merchandise offered and tenant mix, and are generally tailored to meet the needs of their trade areas. Anchors are located along common areas in a configuration designed to maximize consumer traffic for the benefit of the Mall Stores. Mall GLA, which generally refers to GLA contiguous to the Anchors for tenants other than Anchors, is leased to a wide variety of smaller retailers. Mall Stores typically account for the majority of the revenues of a Regional Shopping Center. 

Business of the Company 

Strategy: 

The Company has a long-term four-pronged business strategy that focuses on the acquisition, leasing and management, redevelopment and development of Regional Shopping Centers. 

Acquisitions. The Company principally focuses on well-located, quality Regional Shopping Centers that can be dominant in their trade area and have strong revenue enhancement potential. In addition, the Company pursues other opportunistic acquisitions of property that include retail and will complement the Company's portfolio such as Outlet Centers. The Company subsequently seeks to improve operating performance and returns from these properties through leasing, management and redevelopment. Since its initial public offering, the Company has acquired interests in shopping centers nationwide. The Company believes that it is geographically well positioned to cultivate and maintain ongoing relationships with potential sellers and financial institutions and to act quickly when acquisition opportunities arise (See "Acquisitions and Dispositions" in Recent Developments). 

Leasing and Management. The Company believes that the shopping center business requires specialized skills across a broad array of disciplines for effective and profitable operations. For this reason, the Company has developed a fully integrated real estate organization with in-house acquisition, accounting, development, finance, information technology, leasing, legal, marketing, property management and redevelopment expertise. In addition, the Company emphasizes a philosophy of decentralized property management, leasing and marketing performed by on-site professionals. The Company believes that this strategy results in the optimal operation, tenant mix and drawing power of each Center, as well as the ability to quickly respond to changing competitive conditions of the Center's trade area. 

The Company believes that on-site property managers can most effectively operate the Centers. Each Center's property manager is responsible for overseeing the operations, marketing, maintenance and security functions at the Center. Property managers focus special attention on controlling operating costs, a key element in the profitability of the Centers, and seek to develop strong relationships with and be responsive to the needs of retailers. 

The Company generally utilizes regionally located leasing managers to better understand the market and the community in which a Center is located. The Company continually assesses and fine tunes each Center's tenant mix, identifies and replaces underperforming tenants and seeks to optimize existing tenant sizes and configurations. 

On a selective basis, the Company provides property management and leasing services for third parties. The Company currently manages two regional shopping centers and three community centers for third party owners on a fee basis. 

Redevelopment. One of the major components of the Company's growth strategy is its ability to redevelop acquired properties. For this reason, the Company has built a staff of redevelopment professionals who have primary responsibility for identifying redevelopment opportunities that they believe will result in enhanced long-term financial returns and market position for the Centers. The redevelopment professionals oversee the design and construction of the projects in addition to obtaining required governmental approvals (See "Redevelopment and Development Activity" in Recent Developments). 

Development. The Company pursues ground-up development projects on a selective basis. The Company has supplemented its strong acquisition, operations and redevelopment skills with its ground-up development expertise to further increase growth opportunities (See "Redevelopment and Development Activity" in Recent Developments). 

The Centers: 

As of December 31, 2015 , the Centers primarily included 50 &#32;Regional Shopping Centers, excluding Flagstaff Mall , and seven &#32;Community/Power Shopping Centers totaling approximately 55 million &#32;square feet of GLA. These 57 &#32;Centers average approximately 903,000 square feet of GLA and range in size from 3.5 million &#32;square feet of GLA at Tysons Corner Center &#32;to 185,000 &#32;square feet of GLA at Boulevard Shops . As of December 31, 2015 , excluding Flagstaff Mall , the Centers primarily included 204 &#32;Anchors totaling approximately 27.7 million &#32;square feet of GLA and approximately 5,800 Mall Stores and Freestanding Stores totaling approximately 24.3 million square feet of GLA. 

Competition: 

Numerous owners, developers and managers of malls, shopping centers and other retail-oriented real estate compete with the Company for the acquisition of properties and in attracting tenants or Anchors to occupy space. There are eight other publicly traded mall companies, a number of publicly traded shopping center companies and several large private mall companies in the United States, any of which under certain circumstances could compete against the Company for an Anchor or a tenant. In addition, these companies as well as other REITs, private real estate companies or investors compete with the Company in terms of property acquisitions. This results in competition both for the acquisition of properties or centers and for tenants or Anchors to occupy space. Competition for property acquisitions may result in increased purchase prices and may adversely affect the Company's ability to make suitable property acquisitions on favorable terms. The existence of competing shopping centers could have a material adverse impact on the Company's ability to lease space and on the level of rents that can be achieved. There is also increasing competition from other retail formats and technologies, such as lifestyle centers, power centers, outlet centers, Internet shopping, home shopping networks, catalogs, telemarketing and discount shopping clubs that could adversely affect the Company's revenues. 

In making leasing decisions, the Company believes that retailers consider the following material factors relating to a center: quality, design and location, including consumer demographics; rental rates; type and quality of Anchors and retailers at the center; and management and operational experience and strategy of the center. The Company believes it is able to compete effectively for retail tenants in its local markets based on these criteria in light of the overall size, quality and diversity of its Centers. 

Major Tenants: 

The Centers, excluding Flagstaff Mall , derived approximately 75% of their total rents for the year ended December 31, 2015 &#32;from Mall Stores and Freestanding Stores under 10,000 square feet, and Big Box and Anchor tenants accounted for 25% of total rents for the year ended December 31, 2015 . Total rents as set forth in "Item 1. Business" include minimum rents and percentage rents.

Mall Stores and Freestanding Stores: 

Mall Store and Freestanding Store leases generally provide for tenants to pay rent comprised of a base (or "minimum") rent and a percentage rent based on sales. In some cases, tenants pay only minimum rent, and in other cases, tenants pay only percentage rent. The Company generally enters into leases for Mall Stores and Freestanding Stores that also require tenants to pay a stated amount for operating expenses, generally excluding property taxes, regardless of the expenses the Company actually incurs at any Center. However, certain leases for Mall Stores and Freestanding Stores contain provisions that only require tenants to pay their pro rata share of maintenance of the common areas, property taxes, insurance, advertising and other expenditures related to the operations of the Center. 

Tenant space of 10,000 square feet and under in the Company's portfolio at December 31, 2015 , excluding Flagstaff Mall , comprises approximately 76% of all Mall Store and Freestanding Store space. The Company uses tenant spaces of 10,000 square feet and under for comparing rental rate activity because this space is more consistent in terms of shape and configuration and, as such, the Company is able to provide a meaningful comparison of rental rate activity for this space. Mall Store and Freestanding Store space greater than 10,000 square feet is inconsistent in size and configuration throughout the Company's portfolio and as a result does not lend itself to a meaningful comparison of rental rate activity with the Company's other space. Most of the non-Anchor space over 10,000 square feet is not physically connected to the mall, does not share the same common area amenities and does not benefit from the foot traffic in the mall. As a result, space greater than 10,000 square feet has a unique rent structure that is inconsistent with mall space under 10,000 square feet. 

The following tables set forth the average base rent per square foot for the Centers, as of December 31 for each of the past five years:

(1) 

Average base rent per square foot is based on spaces occupied as of December 31 for each of the Centers and gives effect to the terms of each lease in effect, as of such date, including any concessions, abatements and other adjustments or allowances that have been granted to the tenants. 

(2) 

Centers under development and redevelopment are excluded from average base rents. As a result, the leases for Broadway Plaza, Fashion Outlets of Niagara Falls USA, Fashion Outlets of Philadelphia , Paradise Valley Mall, SouthPark Mall &#32;and Westside Pavilion were excluded for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. The leases for Paradise Valley Mall were excluded for the year ended December 31, 2013. The leases for The Shops at Atlas Park and Southridge Center were excluded for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011. 

Flagstaff Mall is excluded for the year ended December 31, 2015 . In addition, the leases for Rotterdam Square, which was sold on January 15, 2014, were excluded for the year ended December 31, 2013. On June 30, 2015, Great Northern Mall &#32;was conveyed to the mortgage lender by a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure. Consequently, Great Northern Mall &#32;is excluded for the year ended December 31, 2014. The leases for Valley View Center, which was sold by a court-appointed receiver in 2012, were excluded for the year ended December 31, 2011. 

(3) 

The average base rent per square foot on leases executed during the year represents the actual rent paid on a per square foot basis during the first twelve months of the lease. 

(4) 

The average base rent per square foot on leases expiring during the year represents the actual rent to be paid on a per square foot basis during the final twelve months of the lease. 

Cost of Occupancy: 

A major factor contributing to tenant profitability is cost of occupancy, which consists of tenant occupancy costs charged by the Company. Tenant expenses included in this calculation are minimum rents, percentage rents and recoverable expenditures, which consist primarily of property operating expenses, real estate taxes and repair and maintenance expenditures. These tenant charges are collectively referred to as tenant occupancy costs. These tenant occupancy costs are compared to tenant sales. A low cost of occupancy percentage shows more potential capacity for the Company to increase rents at the time of lease renewal than a high cost of occupancy percentage. The following table summarizes occupancy costs for Mall Store and Freestanding Store tenants in the Centers as a percentage of total Mall Store sales for the last five years:

The ending base rent per square foot on leases expiring during the period represents the final year minimum rent, on a cash basis, for tenant leases expiring during the year. Currently, 65% &#32;of leases have provisions for future consumer price index increases that are not reflected in ending base rent. The leases for Centers currently under development and redevelopment are excluded from this table. 

Anchors: 

Anchors have traditionally been a major factor in the public's identification with Regional Shopping Centers. Anchors are generally department stores whose merchandise appeals to a broad range of shoppers. Although the Centers receive a smaller percentage of their operating income from Anchors than from Mall Stores and Freestanding Stores, strong Anchors play an important part in maintaining customer traffic and making the Centers desirable locations for Mall Store and Freestanding Store tenants. 

Anchors either own their stores, the land under them and in some cases adjacent parking areas, or enter into long-term leases with an owner at rates that are lower than the rents charged to tenants of Mall Stores and Freestanding Stores. Each Anchor that owns its own store and certain Anchors that lease their stores enter into reciprocal easement agreements with the owner of the Center covering, among other things, operational matters, initial construction and future expansion. 

Anchors accounted for approximately 8.5% of the Company's total rents for the year ended December 31, 2015 , excluding Flagstaff Mall . 

The following table identifies each Anchor, each parent company that owns multiple Anchors and the number of square feet owned or leased by each such Anchor or parent company in the Company's portfolio, excluding Flagstaff Mall , at December 31, 2015 .

(7) 

The Company is seeking replacement tenants and/or contemplating redevelopment opportunities for these vacant sites. The Company continues to collect rent under the terms of an agreement regarding one of these two vacant Anchor locations. 

(8) 

The Company owns a portfolio of eight stores located at shopping centers not owned by the Company. Of these eight stores, two have been leased to Forever 21, one has been leased to Kohl's, one has been leased to Sports Authority and four have been leased for non-Anchor usage. 

Environmental Matters 

Each of the Centers has been subjected to an Environmental Site Assessment&#8212;Phase I (which involves review of publicly available information and general property inspections, but does not involve soil sampling or ground water analysis) completed by an environmental consultant. 

Based on these assessments, and on other information, the Company is aware of the following environmental issues, which may result in potential environmental liability and cause the Company to incur costs in responding to these liabilities or in other costs associated with future investigation or remediation: 

&#8226; 

Asbestos. The Company has conducted asbestos-containing materials ("ACM") surveys at various locations within the Centers. The surveys indicate that ACMs are present or suspected in certain areas, primarily vinyl floor tiles, mastics, roofing materials, drywall tape and joint compounds. The identified ACMs are generally non-friable, in good condition, and possess low probabilities for disturbance. At certain Centers where ACMs are present or suspected, however, some ACMs have been or may be classified as "friable," and ultimately may require removal under certain conditions. The Company has developed and implemented an operations and maintenance ("O&#38;M") plan to manage ACMs in place. 

&#8226; 

Underground Storage Tanks. Underground storage tanks ("USTs") are or were present at certain Centers, often in connection with tenant operations at gasoline stations or automotive tire, battery and accessory service centers located at such Centers. USTs also may be or have been present at properties neighboring certain Centers. Some of these tanks have either leaked or are suspected to have leaked. Where leakage has occurred, investigation, remediation, and monitoring costs may be incurred by the Company if responsible current or former tenants, or other responsible parties, are unavailable to pay such costs. 

&#8226; 

Chlorinated Hydrocarbons. The presence of chlorinated hydrocarbons such as perchloroethylene ("PCE") and its degradation byproducts have been detected at certain Centers, often in connection with tenant dry cleaning operations. Where PCE has been detected, the Company may incur investigation, remediation and monitoring costs if responsible current or former tenants, or other responsible parties, are unavailable to pay such costs. 

See "Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8212;Possible environmental liabilities could adversely affect us." 

Insurance 

Each of the Centers has comprehensive liability, fire, extended coverage and rental loss insurance with insured limits customarily carried for similar properties. The Company does not insure certain types of losses (such as losses from wars), because they are either uninsurable or not economically insurable. In addition, while the Company or the relevant joint venture, as applicable, carry specific earthquake insurance on the Centers located in California, the policies are subject to a deductible equal to 5% of the total insured value of each Center, a $100,000 per occurrence minimum and a combined annual aggregate loss limit of $150 million on these Centers. The Company or the relevant joint venture, as applicable, carry specific earthquake insurance on the Centers located in the Pacific Northwest and in the New Madrid Seismic Zone. However, the policies are subject to a deductible equal to 2% of the total insured value of each Center, a $50,000 per occurrence minimum and a 

combined annual aggregate loss limit of $200 million on these Centers. While the Company or the relevant joint venture also carries standalone terrorism insurance on the Centers, the policies are subject to a $50,000 deductible and a combined annual aggregate loss limit of $1 billion. Each Center has environmental insurance covering eligible third&#8209;party losses, remediation and non-owned disposal sites, subject to a $100,000 deductible and a $50 million three-year aggregate loss limit, with the exception of one Center, which has a $5 million ten-year aggregate loss limit. Some environmental losses are not covered by this insurance because they are uninsurable or not economically insurable. Furthermore, the Company carries title insurance on substantially all of the Centers for generally less than their full value. 

Qualification as a Real Estate Investment Trust 

The Company elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), commencing with its first taxable year ended December 31, 1994, and intends to conduct its operations so as to continue to qualify as a REIT under the Code. As a REIT, the Company generally will not be subject to federal and state income taxes on its net taxable income that it currently distributes to stockholders. Qualification and taxation as a REIT depends on the Company's ability to meet certain dividend distribution tests, share ownership requirements and various qualification tests prescribed in the Code. 

Supplemental Tax Disclosures - Updates to REIT Rules 

The &#8220;Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015&#8221; (the &#8220;PATH Act&#8221;) was enacted on December 18, 2015 and contains several provisions pertaining to REIT qualification and taxation, which are briefly summarized below: 

&#8226; 

For taxable years beginning before January 1, 2018, no more than 25% of the value of the Company's assets may consist of stock or securities of one or more TRSs. For taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, the Act reduces this limit to 20%. 

&#8226; 

For purposes of the REIT asset tests, the PATH Act provides that debt instruments issued by publicly offered REITs will constitute &#8220;real estate assets.&#8221; However, unless such a debt instrument is secured by a mortgage or otherwise would have qualified as a real estate asset under prior law, (i) interest income and gain from such a debt instrument is not qualifying income for purposes of the 75% gross income test and (ii) all such debt instruments may represent no more than 25% of the value of the Company's total assets. 

&#8226; 

For taxable years beginning after December 31, 2015, certain obligations secured by a mortgage on both real property and personal property will be treated as a qualifying real estate asset and give rise to qualifying income for purposes of the 75% gross income test if the fair market value of such personal property does not exceed 15% of the total fair market value of all such property. 

&#8226; 

A 100% excise tax is imposed on &#8220;redetermined TRS service income,&#8221; which is income of a TRS attributable to services provided to, or on behalf of its associated REIT and which would otherwise be increased on distribution, apportionment, or allocation under Section 482 of the Code. 

&#8226; 

For distributions made in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2014, the preferential dividend rules no longer apply to the Company. 

&#8226; 

Additional exceptions to the rules under the Foreign Investment in Real Property Act (&#8220;FIRPTA&#8221;) were introduced for non-U.S. persons that constitute &#8220;qualified shareholders&#8221; (within the meaning of Section 897(k)(3) of the Code) or &#8220;qualified foreign pension funds&#8221; (within the meaning of Section 897(l)(2) of the Code). 

&#8226; 

After February 16, 2016, the FIRPTA withholding rate under Section 1445 of the Code for dispositions of U.S. real property interests is increased from 10% to 15%. 

&#8226; 

The PATH Act increases from 5% to 10% the maximum stock ownership of the REIT that a non-U.S. shareholder may have held to avail itself of the FIRPTA exception for shares regularly traded on an established securities market. 

In addition, the IRS recently issued guidance delaying the imposition of withholding under FATCA to the gross proceeds from a disposition of property that can produce U.S. source interest or dividends. Such withholding will apply only to dispositions occurring after December 31, 2018. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015 , the Company had approximately 997 employees, of which approximately 976 were full-time. The Company believes that relations with its employees are good. 

Seasonality
