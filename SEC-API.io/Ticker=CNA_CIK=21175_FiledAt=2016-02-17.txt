 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

CNA Financial Corporation (CNAF) was incorporated in 1967 and is an insurance holding company. Collectively, CNAF and its subsidiaries are referred to as CNA or the Company. References to &#8220;CNA,&#8221; &#8220;the Company,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;our,&#8221; &#8220;us&#8221; or like terms refer to the business of CNAF and its subsidiaries. CNA's property and casualty and remaining life and group insurance operations are primarily conducted by Continental Casualty Company (CCC), The Continental Insurance Company, Western Surety Company, CNA Insurance Company Limited and Hardy Underwriting Bermuda Limited and its subsidiaries (Hardy). Loews Corporation (Loews) owned approximately 90% of our outstanding common stock as of December 31, 2015 . On August 1, 2014, we completed the sale of the common stock of Continental Assurance Company (CAC). 

Our insurance products primarily include commercial property and casualty coverages, including surety. Our services include risk management, information services, warranty and claims administration. Our products and services are primarily marketed through independent agents, brokers and managing general underwriters to a wide variety of customers, including small, medium and large businesses, insurance companies, associations, professionals and other groups. 

Our core business, commercial property and casualty insurance operations, is reported in three business segments: Specialty, Commercial and International. Our non-core businesses are reported in two business segments: Life &#38; Group Non-Core and Corporate &#38; Other Non-Core. Each segment is managed separately due to differences in their markets and product mix. Discussion of each segment, including the products offered, customers served and distribution channels used, are set forth in the Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&#38;A) included under Item 7 and in Note O &#32;to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8. 

Competition 

The property and casualty insurance industry is highly competitive both as to rate and service. We compete with a large number of stock and mutual insurance companies and other entities for both distributors and customers. Insurers compete on the basis of factors including products, price, services, ratings and financial strength. We must continuously allocate resources to refine and improve our insurance products and services. 

There are approximately 2,700 individual companies that sell property and casualty insurance in the United States. Based on 2014 statutory net written premiums, we are the eighth largest commercial insurance writer and the 14 th &#32;largest property and casualty insurance organization in the United States. 

Regulation 

The insurance industry is subject to comprehensive and detailed regulation and supervision. Regulatory oversight by applicable agencies is exercised through review of submitted filings and information, examinations (both financial and market conduct), direct inquiries and interviews. Each domestic and foreign jurisdiction has established supervisory agencies with broad administrative powers relative to licensing insurers and agents, approving policy forms, establishing reserve requirements, prescribing the form and content of statutory financial reports and regulating capital adequacy and the type, quality and amount of investments permitted. Such regulatory powers also extend to premium rate regulations, which require that rates not be excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory, governance requirements and risk assessment practice and disclosure. In addition to regulation of dividends by insurance subsidiaries, intercompany transfers of assets may be subject to prior notice or approval by insurance regulators, depending on the size of such transfers and payments in relation to the financial position of the insurance subsidiaries making the transfer or payment. 

Domestic insurers are also required by state insurance regulators to provide coverage to insureds who would not otherwise be considered eligible by the insurers. Each state dictates the types of insurance and the level of coverage that must be provided to such involuntary risks. Our share of these involuntary risks is mandatory and generally a function of our respective share of the voluntary market by line of insurance in each state. 

Further, domestic insurance companies are subject to state guaranty fund and other insurance-related assessments. Guaranty funds are governed by state insurance guaranty associations which levy assessments to meet the funding needs of insolvent insurer estates. Other insurance-related assessments are generally levied by state agencies to 

fund various organizations including disaster relief funds, rating bureaus, insurance departments and workers' compensation second injury funds, or by industry organizations that assist in the statistical analysis and ratemaking process and we have the ability to recoup certain of these assessments from policyholders. 

As our insurance operations are conducted in a multitude of both domestic and foreign jurisdictions, we are subject to a number of regulatory agency requirements in respect of a portion, or all, of our operations. These include, but are not limited to, the State of Illinois Department of Insurance (which is our global group-wide supervisor), the U.K. Prudential Regulatory Authority and Financial Conduct Authority, the Bermuda Monetary Authority and the Office of Superintendent of Financial Institutions in Canada. 

Hardy, a specialized Lloyd's of London (Lloyd's) underwriter, is also supervised by the Council of Lloyd's, which is the franchisor for all Lloyd's operations. The Council of Lloyd's has wide discretionary powers to regulate Lloyd's underwriting, such as establishing the capital requirements for syndicate participation. In addition, the annual business plans of each syndicate are subject to the review and approval of the Lloyd's Franchise Board, which is responsible for business planning and monitoring for all syndicates. 

Effective January 1, 2016, the European Union's executive body, the European Commission, implemented new capital adequacy and risk management regulations, Solvency II, that apply to our European operations. Additionally, the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) continues to consider regulatory proposals addressing group supervision, capital requirements and enterprise risk management. The U.S. Federal Reserve, the U.S. Federal Insurance Office and the National Association of Insurance Commissioners are working with other global regulators to define such proposals. It is not currently clear to what extent the IAIS activities will impact the Company as any final proposal would ultimately need to be legislated or regulated by each individual country or state. 

Although the federal government does not currently directly regulate the business of insurance, federal legislative and regulatory initiatives can impact the insurance industry. These initiatives and legislation include proposals relating to potential federal oversight of certain insurers; terrorism and natural catastrophe exposures; cybersecurity risk management; federal financial services reforms; and certain tax reforms. 

The Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2015 was enacted on January 12, 2015. The reauthorization provides for a federal government backstop for insured terrorism risks for another six years with increases to the insurer co-payment and program trigger. The existence of the mitigating effects of such law is part of the analysis of our overall risk posture for terrorism and, accordingly, our risk positioning may change if such law were modified. We also continue to invest in the security network of our systems on an enterprise-wide basis, especially considering the implications of data and privacy breaches. This requires an investment of a significant amount of resources by us on an ongoing basis. Potential implications of possible cybersecurity legislation on such current investment, if any, are uncertain. The foregoing proposals, either separately or in the aggregate, create a regulatory and legal environment that may require changes in our business plan or significant investment of resources in order to operate in an effective and compliant manner. 

Additionally, various legislative and regulatory efforts to reform the tort liability system have, and will continue to, impact our industry. Although there has been some tort reform with positive impact to the insurance industry, new causes of action and theories of damages continue to be proposed in state court actions or by federal or state legislatures that continue to expand liability for insurers and their policyholders. 

Employee Relations 

As of December 31, 2015 , we had approximately 6,900 &#32;employees and have experienced satisfactory labor relations. We have never had work stoppages due to labor disputes. 

We have comprehensive benefit plans for substantially all of our employees, including retirement plans, savings plans, disability programs, group life programs and group health care programs. See Note I &#32;to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 for further discussion of our benefit plans.

Property and Casualty Claim and Claim Adjustment Expenses 

The following loss reserve development table illustrates the change over time of reserves established for property and casualty claim and claim adjustment expenses at the end of the preceding ten calendar years for our property and casualty insurance companies. The first section shows the reserves as originally reported at the end of the stated year. The second section, reading down, shows the cumulative amounts paid as of the end of successive years with respect to the originally reported reserve liability. The third section, reading down, shows re-estimates of the originally recorded reserves as of the end of each successive year, which is the result of our property and casualty insurance subsidiaries' expanded awareness of additional facts and circumstances that pertain to the unsettled claims. The last section compares the latest re-estimated reserves to the reserves originally established, and indicates whether the original reserves were adequate or inadequate to cover the estimated costs of unsettled claims. The loss reserve development table is cumulative and, therefore, ending balances should not be added since the amount at the end of each calendar year includes activity for both the current and prior years.

(a) 

Effective January 1, 2010, we ceded our net asbestos and environmental pollution claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserves under a retroactive reinsurance agreement, as further discussed in Note E &#32;to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8. 

(b) 

On July 2, 2012, we acquired Hardy. As a result of this acquisition, net reserves were increased by $291 million. 

(c) 

In the third quarter of 2014, the Company commuted a workers' compensation reinsurance pool which had the impact of $348 million of favorable gross loss reserve development and $324 million of unfavorable ceded loss reserve development. 

Additional information regarding our property and casualty claim and claim adjustment expense reserves and reserve development is set forth in the MD&#38;A included under Item 7 and in Notes A and E &#32;to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.
