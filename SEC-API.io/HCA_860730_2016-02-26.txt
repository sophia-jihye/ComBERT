Business Strategy 

We are committed to providing the communities we serve with high quality, cost-effective health care while growing our business, increasing our profitability and creating long-term value for our stockholders. To achieve these objectives, we align our efforts around the following growth agenda: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; grow our presence in existing markets; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#149; &#160; achieve industry-leading performance in clinical and satisfaction measures; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; recruit and employ physicians to meet the need for high quality health services; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; continue to leverage our scale and market positions to enhance profitability; and 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; selectively pursue a disciplined development strategy. 

Health Care Facilities 

We currently own, manage or operate hospitals, freestanding surgery centers, freestanding emergency care facilities, urgent care facilities, walk-in clinics, diagnostic and imaging centers, radiation and oncology therapy centers, comprehensive rehabilitation and physical therapy centers, physician practices and various other facilities. 

At December 31, 2015, we owned and operated 164 general, acute care hospitals with 43,275 licensed beds. Most of our general, acute care hospitals provide medical and surgical services, including inpatient care, intensive care, cardiac care, diagnostic services and emergency services. The general, acute care hospitals also provide outpatient services such as outpatient surgery, laboratory, radiology, respiratory therapy, cardiology and physical therapy. Each hospital has an organized medical staff and a local board of trustees or governing board, made up of members of the local community. 

At December 31, 2015, we operated three psychiatric hospitals with 396 licensed beds. Our psychiatric hospitals provide therapeutic programs including child, adolescent and adult psychiatric care, adult and adolescent alcohol and drug abuse treatment and counseling. 

We also operate outpatient health care facilities, which include freestanding ambulatory surgery centers (&#147;ASCs&#148;), freestanding emergency care facilities, urgent care facilities, walk-in clinics, diagnostic and imaging centers, comprehensive rehabilitation and physical therapy centers, radiation and oncology therapy centers, physician practices and various other facilities. These outpatient services are an integral component of our strategy to develop comprehensive health care networks in select communities. Most of our ASCs are operated through partnerships or limited liability companies, with majority ownership of each partnership or limited liability company typically held by a general partner or member that is an affiliate of HCA. 

Certain of our affiliates provide a variety of management services to our health care facilities, including patient safety programs, ethics and compliance programs, national supply contracts, equipment purchasing and leasing contracts, accounting, financial and clinical systems, governmental reimbursement assistance, construction planning and coordination, information technology systems and solutions, legal counsel, human resources services and internal audit services. 

Sources of Revenue 

Hospital revenues depend upon inpatient occupancy levels, the medical and ancillary services ordered by physicians and provided to patients, the volume of outpatient procedures and the charges or payment rates for such services. Charges and reimbursement rates for inpatient services vary significantly depending on the type of payer, the type of service (e.g., medical/surgical, intensive care or psychiatric) and the geographic location of the hospital. Inpatient occupancy levels fluctuate for various reasons, many of which are beyond our control. 

&#160; 

We receive payments for patient services from the federal government under the Medicare program, state governments under their respective Medicaid or similar programs, managed care plans (including plans offered through the American Health Benefit Exchanges (&#147;Exchanges&#148;), beginning in 2014), private insurers and directly from patients. Our revenues from third-party payers and the uninsured for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 are summarized in the following table (dollars in millions):

&#160;

&#160; Medicare is a federal program that provides certain hospital and medical insurance benefits to persons age 65 and over, some disabled persons, persons with end-stage renal disease and persons with Lou Gehrig&#146;s Disease. Medicaid is a federal-state program, administered by the states, which provides hospital and medical benefits to qualifying individuals who are unable to afford health care. All of our general, acute care hospitals located in the United States are eligible to participate in Medicare and Medicaid programs. Amounts received under Medicare and Medicaid programs are generally significantly less than established hospital gross charges for the services provided. 

Our hospitals generally offer discounts from established charges to certain group purchasers of health care services, including private insurance companies, employers, health maintenance organizations (&#147;HMOs&#148;), preferred provider organizations (&#147;PPOs&#148;) and other managed care plans, including plans offered through the Exchanges. These discount programs generally limit our ability to increase revenues in response to increasing costs. See Item 1, &#147;Business &#151; Competition.&#148; Patients are generally not responsible for the total difference between established hospital gross charges and amounts reimbursed for such services under Medicare, Medicaid, HMOs, PPOs and other managed care plans, but are responsible to the extent of any exclusions, deductibles or coinsurance features of their coverage. The amount of such exclusions, deductibles and coinsurance continues to increase. Collection of amounts due from individuals is typically more difficult than from governmental or third-party payers. We provide discounts to uninsured patients who do not qualify for Medicaid or charity care under our charity care policy. In implementing the uninsured discount policy, we may attempt to provide assistance to uninsured patients to help determine whether they may qualify for Medicaid, other federal or state assistance or charity care under our charity care policy. If an uninsured patient does not qualify for these programs, the uninsured discount is applied. 

Medicare 

In addition to the reimbursement reductions and adjustments discussed below, the Budget Control Act of 2011 (the &#147;BCA&#148;) requires automatic spending reductions to reduce the federal deficit, including Medicare spending reductions of up to 2% per fiscal year, with a uniform percentage reduction across all Medicare programs. These automatic spending reductions began on March 1, 2013, with the Centers for Medicare &#38; Medicaid Services (&#147;CMS&#148;) imposing a 2% reduction on Medicare claims beginning on April 1, 2013. These reductions have been extended through 2025. 

&#160; 

Inpatient Acute Care 

Under the Medicare program, we receive reimbursement under a prospective payment system (&#147;PPS&#148;) for general, acute care hospital inpatient services. Under the hospital inpatient PPS, fixed payment amounts per inpatient discharge are established based on the patient&#146;s assigned Medicare severity diagnosis-related group (&#147;MS-DRG&#148;). MS-DRGs classify treatments for illnesses according to the estimated intensity of hospital resources necessary to furnish care for each principal diagnosis. MS-DRG weights represent the average resources for a given MS-DRG relative to the average resources for all MS-DRGs. MS-DRG payments are adjusted for area wage differentials. Hospitals, other than those defined as &#147;new,&#148; receive PPS reimbursement for inpatient capital costs based on MS-DRG weights multiplied by a geographically adjusted federal rate. When the cost to treat certain patients falls well outside the normal distribution, providers typically receive additional &#147;outlier&#148; payments. 

MS-DRG rates are updated, and MS-DRG weights are recalibrated, using cost-relative weights each federal fiscal year (which begins October 1). The index used to update the MS-DRG rates (the &#147;market basket&#148;) gives consideration to the inflation experienced by hospitals and entities outside the health care industry in purchasing goods and services. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the &#147;Health Reform Law&#148;), provides for annual decreases to the market basket, including the following reductions for each of the following federal fiscal years: 0.2% in 2016 and 0.75% in 2017, 2018 and 2019. For each federal fiscal year, the Health Reform Law provides for the annual market basket update to be further reduced by a productivity adjustment based on the Bureau of Labor Statistics (&#147;BLS&#148;) 10-year moving average of changes in specified economy-wide productivity. At the time of enactment, CMS estimated that the combined market basket and productivity adjustments would reduce Medicare payments under the inpatient PPS by $112.6 billion from 2010 to 2019. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 requires a negative documentation and coding adjustment for four years beginning in federal fiscal year 2014. It is estimated that this documentation and coding adjustment will reduce Medicare inpatient PPS payments by $10.5 billion. A decrease in payment rates or an increase in rates that is below the increase in our costs may adversely affect our results of operations. 

For federal fiscal year 2015, CMS increased the MS-DRG rate by 1.4%. This increase reflected a 2.9% market basket increase, the 0.2% reduction required by the Health Reform Law, a negative 0.5% productivity adjustment, and a negative 0.8% prospective documentation and coding adjustment. For federal fiscal year 2016, CMS increased the MS-DRG rate by 0.9%. This increase reflects a 2.4% market basket increase, the 0.2% reduction required by the Health Reform Law, a negative 0.5% productivity adjustment, and a negative 0.8% prospective documentation and coding adjustment. There is also a negative 0.2% adjustment to offset projected spending increases associated with admission and medical review criteria for inpatient services commonly known as the &#147;two midnight rule.&#148; Under the rule, for admissions on or after October 1, 2013, services provided to Medicare beneficiaries are only payable as inpatient hospital services when there is a reasonable expectation that the hospital care is medically necessary and will be required across two midnights, absent unusual circumstances. Stays expected to need less than two midnights of hospital care will be subject to medical review on a case-by-case basis. Quality Improvement Organizations (&#147;QIOs&#148;) are handling the reviews of short inpatient stays and will refer claim denials to Medicare Administrative Contractors (&#147;MACs&#148;) for payment adjustments. Enforcement through Recovery Audit Contractor (&#147;RAC&#148;) audits is expected to begin in 2016. 

CMS has implemented or is implementing a number of programs and requirements intended to transform Medicare from a passive payer to an active purchaser of quality goods and services. For example, hospitals receive a 2% reduction to their market basket updates if they fail to submit data for patient care quality indicators to the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (&#147;HHS&#148;). As of federal fiscal year 2015, hospitals that do not participate lose an additional one-quarter of the percentage increase in their payment updates. All of our hospitals paid under the Medicare inpatient PPS are participating in the quality initiative by submitting the requested quality data. While we will endeavor to comply with all data submission requirements as additional requirements continue to be added, our submissions may not be deemed timely or sufficient to entitle all of our hospitals to the full market basket adjustment. 

&#160; 

Further, Medicare does not allow an inpatient hospital discharge to be assigned to a higher paying MS-DRG if a selected hospital acquired condition (&#147;HAC&#148;) was not present on admission and it is the only condition resulting in the assignment of the higher paying MS-DRG. In this situation, the case is paid as though the secondary diagnosis was not present. There are currently 14 categories of conditions on the list of HACs. In addition, CMS has established three National Coverage Determinations that prohibit Medicare reimbursement for erroneous surgical procedures performed on an inpatient or outpatient basis. The Health Reform Law provides for reduced payments based on a hospital&#146;s HAC rates. As of federal fiscal year 2015, the 25% of hospitals with the worst risk-adjusted HAC rates in the designated performance period receive a 1% reduction in their inpatient PPS Medicare payments. 

The Health Reform Law also provides for reduced payments to hospitals based on readmission rates. Each federal fiscal year, inpatient payments are reduced if a hospital experiences &#147;excess&#148; readmissions within the 30-day time period from the date of discharge for conditions designated by CMS. For federal fiscal year 2016, these conditions are heart attack, heart failure, pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, total hip arthroplasty and total knee arthroplasty. Hospitals with what CMS defines as excess readmissions for these conditions receive reduced payments for all inpatient discharges, not just discharges relating to the conditions subject to the excess readmission standard. The amount by which payments are reduced is determined by comparing the hospital&#146;s performance for each condition using three years of discharge data to a risk-adjusted national average, subject to a cap established by CMS. As of federal fiscal year 2015, the reduction in payments to hospitals with excess readmissions is capped at 3%. Each hospital&#146;s performance is publicly reported by CMS. 

The Health Reform Law additionally establishes a hospital value-based purchasing program to further link payments to quality and efficiency. For federal fiscal year 2016, CMS will reduce the inpatient PPS payment amount for all discharges by 1.75%; the reduction increases to 2% for 2017 and subsequent years. The total amount collected from these reductions is pooled and used to fund payments to reward hospitals that meet certain quality performance standards established by CMS. CMS scores each hospital based on achievement (relative to other hospitals) and improvement ranges (relative to the hospital&#146;s own past performance) for each applicable performance standard. Because the Health Reform Law provides that the pool will be fully distributed, hospitals that meet or exceed the quality performance standards receive greater reimbursement under the value-based purchasing program than they would have otherwise. Hospitals that do not achieve the necessary quality performance receive reduced Medicare inpatient hospital payments. Hospitals are scored on a number of individual measures that are categorized into four domains: clinical care; efficiency and cost reduction; safety and patient and caregiver experience of care. CMS estimates that $1.5 billion will be available to hospitals as incentive payments in federal fiscal year 2016 under the value-based purchasing program. 

Historically, the Medicare program has set aside 5.10% of Medicare inpatient payments to pay for outlier cases. For federal fiscal year 2015, CMS established an outlier threshold of $24,626, and for federal fiscal year 2016, CMS decreased the outlier threshold to $22,539. We do not anticipate that the decrease to the outlier threshold for federal fiscal year 2016 will have a material impact on our results of operations. 

Outpatient 

CMS reimburses hospital outpatient services (and certain Medicare Part B services furnished to hospital inpatients who have no Part A coverage) on a PPS basis. CMS uses fee schedules to pay for physical, occupational and speech therapies, durable medical equipment, clinical diagnostic laboratory services, nonimplantable orthotics and prosthetics, freestanding surgery center services and services provided by independent diagnostic testing facilities. 

Hospital outpatient services paid under PPS are classified into groups called ambulatory payment classifications (&#147;APCs&#148;). Services for each APC are similar clinically and in terms of the resources they require. A payment rate is established for each APC. Depending on the services provided, a hospital may be paid for more than one APC for a patient visit. The APC payment rates are updated for each calendar year. The Health 

&#160; 

Reform Law provides for reductions to the market basket update, including reductions of 0.2% in calendar year 2016 and 0.75% in calendar years 2017, 2018 and 2019. For each calendar year, the Health Reform Law provides for the annual market basket update to be further reduced by a productivity adjustment based on the BLS 10-year moving average of changes in specified economy-wide productivity. At the time of enactment, CMS estimated that the combined market basket and productivity adjustments would reduce Medicare payments under the outpatient PPS by $26.3 billion from 2010 to 2019. For calendar year 2015, CMS increased APC payment rates by 2.2%, which represented the full market basket update of 2.9%, a negative 0.5% productivity adjustment and the negative 0.2% adjustment required by the Health Reform Law. For calendar year 2016, CMS has issued a final rule that it estimates will result in a 0.4% reduction in payments for hospital outpatient services. The change is based on a market basket increase of 2.4%, a negative 0.5% productivity adjustment and the negative 0.2% adjustment required by the Health Reform Law, along with other policy changes, including a 2.0% reduction to address what CMS views as inflated payments in past years for laboratory tests packaged with payments for hospital outpatient services. CMS requires hospitals to submit quality data relating to outpatient care to avoid receiving a 2% reduction to the market basket update under the outpatient PPS. 

Rehabilitation 

CMS reimburses inpatient rehabilitation facilities (&#147;IRFs&#148;) on a PPS basis. Under the IRF PPS, patients are classified into case mix groups based upon impairment, age, comorbidities (additional diseases or disorders from which the patient suffers) and functional capability. IRFs are paid a predetermined amount per discharge that reflects the patient&#146;s case mix group and is adjusted for area wage levels, low-income patients, rural areas and high-cost outliers. The Health Reform Law also provides for reductions to the market basket update, including reductions of 0.2% in federal fiscal year 2016 and 0.75% in federal fiscal years 2017, 2018 and 2019. For each federal fiscal year, the Health Reform Law provides for the annual market basket update to be further reduced by a productivity adjustment based on the BLS 10-year moving average of changes in specified economy-wide productivity. At the time of enactment, CMS estimated that the combined market basket and productivity adjustments would reduce Medicare payments under the IRF PPS by $5.7 billion from 2010 to 2019. For federal fiscal year 2015, CMS updated inpatient rehabilitation rates by 2.2%, which reflected a 2.9% market basket increase, a negative 0.5% productivity adjustment and a 0.2% reduction required by the Health Reform Law. For federal fiscal year 2016, CMS has issued a final rule it estimates will result in an overall update to inpatient rehabilitation rates of 1.8%, which reflects a new inpatient rehabilitation-specific 2.4% market basket increase, a negative 0.5% productivity adjustment, a 0.2% reduction required by the Health Reform Law and a 0.1% increase to aggregate payments due to updating the outlier threshold. In addition, IRFs are required to report quality measures to CMS or they will receive a 2% reduction to the market basket update. 

In order to qualify for classification as an IRF, at least 60% of a facility&#146;s inpatients during the most recent 12-month CMS-defined review period must have required intensive rehabilitation services for one or more of 13 specified conditions. IRFs must also meet additional coverage criteria, including patient selection and care requirements relating to pre-admission screenings, post-admission evaluations, ongoing coordination of care and involvement of rehabilitation physicians. A facility that fails to meet the 60% threshold, or other criteria to be classified as an IRF, will be paid under the acute care hospital inpatient or outpatient PPS, which generally provide for lower payment amounts. As of December 31, 2015, we had one rehabilitation hospital and 50 hospital rehabilitation units. 

Psychiatric 

Inpatient hospital services furnished in psychiatric hospitals and psychiatric units of general, acute care hospitals and critical access hospitals are reimbursed on a PPS basis (the &#147;IPF PPS&#148;), which is based upon a per diem payment, with adjustments to account for certain patient and facility characteristics. The IPF PPS contains an &#147;outlier&#148; policy for extraordinarily costly cases and an adjustment to a facility&#146;s base payment if it maintains a full-service emergency department. CMS has established the IPF PPS payment rate in a manner intended to be budget neutral. The rehabilitation, psychiatric and long-term care market basket update is used to update the IPF 

&#160; 

PPS. The Health Reform Law also provides for reductions to the market basket update, including the following reductions for the following federal fiscal years: 0.2% in 2016 and 2017, and 0.75% in 2018, 2019 and 2020. For each payment year, the Health Reform Law provides for the annual market basket update to be further reduced by a productivity adjustment based on the BLS 10-year moving average of changes in specified economy-wide productivity. At the time of enactment, CMS estimated that the combined market basket and productivity adjustments would reduce Medicare payments under the IPF PPS by $4.3 billion from 2010 to 2019. For federal fiscal year 2015, CMS increased inpatient psychiatric payment rates by 2.1%, including a market basket increase of 2.9%, reduced by a 0.5% productivity adjustment and 0.3% as required by the Health Reform Law. For federal fiscal year 2016, CMS issued a final rule that it estimates will increase inpatient psychiatric payment rates by 1.5%, which reflects a new inpatient psychiatric-specific market basket increase of 2.4%, reduced by a 0.5% productivity adjustment and 0.2% as required by the Health Reform Law, along with other payment adjustments. Inpatient psychiatric facilities are required to report quality measures to CMS or will receive a 2% reduction to the market basket update. As of December 31, 2015, we had three psychiatric hospitals and 54 hospital psychiatric units. 

Ambulatory Surgery Centers 

CMS reimburses ASCs using a predetermined fee schedule. Reimbursements for ASC overhead costs are limited to no more than the overhead costs paid to hospital outpatient departments under the Medicare hospital outpatient PPS for the same procedure. If CMS determines that a procedure is commonly performed in a physician&#146;s office, the ASC reimbursement for that procedure is limited to the reimbursement allowable under the Medicare Part B Physician Fee Schedule, with limited exceptions. All surgical procedures, other than those that pose a significant safety risk or generally require an overnight stay, are payable as ASC procedures. From time to time, CMS considers expanding the services that may be performed in ASCs, which may result in more Medicare procedures that historically have been performed in hospitals being moved to ASCs, reducing surgical volume in our hospitals. Also, more Medicare procedures that historically have been performed in ASCs may be moved to physicians&#146; offices. Commercial third-party payers may adopt similar policies. For each federal fiscal year, the Health Reform Law provides for an annual reduction to the ASC payment system by a productivity adjustment based on the BLS 10-year moving average of changes in specified economy-wide productivity. For calendar year 2015, CMS increased ASC payments by 1.4%, which included a consumer price index update of 1.9% and a negative 0.5% productivity adjustment. For calendar year 2016, CMS issued a final rule that provides for a 0.3% increase in ASC payments, which reflects a consumer price index update of 0.8% and a negative 0.5% productivity adjustment. In addition, CMS has established a quality reporting program for ASCs under which ASCs that fail to report on specified quality measures will receive a 2% reduction in reimbursement. 

Physician Services 

Physician services are reimbursed under the physician fee schedule (&#147;PFS&#148;) system, under which CMS has assigned a national relative value unit (&#147;RVU&#148;) to most medical procedures and services that reflects the various resources required by a physician to provide the services relative to all other services. While RVUs for various services may change in a given year, any alterations are required by statute to be virtually budget neutral, such that total payments made under the PFS may not differ by more than $20 million from what payments would have been if adjustments were not made. The Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 (&#147;PAMA&#148;) provides for annual reductions in PFS expenditures resulting from adjustments to relative values of misvalued codes. Each RVU is calculated based on a combination of work required in terms of time and intensity of effort for the service, practice expense (overhead) attributable to the service and malpractice insurance expense attributable to the service. These three elements are each modified by a geographic adjustment factor to account for local practice costs and are then aggregated. Historically, the aggregated amount was multiplied by a conversion factor (calculated by using the sustainable growth rate (&#147;SGR&#148;)) to arrive at the payment amount for each service. However, in April 2015, the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (&#147;MACRA&#148;) repealed the SGR physician payment methodology, effectively eliminating a payment reduction that was scheduled for physicians and other practitioners. Instead of tying payments to the SGR, MACRA provides for 0.5% annual updates for calendar years 2016 through 2019. 

&#160; 

In addition, MACRA requires the establishment of the Merit-Based Incentive Payment System (&#147;MIPS&#148;) beginning in 2019, under which physicians will receive payment incentives or payment reductions based on their performance with respect to clinical quality, resource use, clinical improvement activities, and meaningful use of electronic health records (&#147;EHRs&#148;). While consolidating certain existing physician incentive programs, MIPS also requires CMS to provide, beginning in 2019, incentive payments for physicians and other eligible professionals that participate in alternative payment models. 

Other 

Under PPS, the payment rates are adjusted for the area differences in wage levels by a factor (&#147;wage index&#148;) reflecting the relative wage level in the geographic area compared to the national average wage level and taking into account occupational mix. The redistributive impact of wage index changes is not anticipated to have a material financial impact for 2016. Based on the Health Reform Law&#146;s mandate, HHS submitted recommendations on reform to the Medicare wage index system, but Congress has not yet acted on the proposed reforms. 

Medicare reimburses hospitals for a portion (65%) of bad debts resulting from deductible and coinsurance amounts that are uncollectable from Medicare beneficiaries. 

CMS has implemented contractor reform whereby CMS competitively bids the Medicare fiscal intermediary and Medicare carrier functions to 12 MACs, which are geographically assigned and service both Part A and Part B providers within a given jurisdiction. While chain providers had the option of having all hospitals use one home office MAC, we chose to use the MACs assigned to the geographic areas in which our hospitals are located. CMS periodically re-solicits bids, and the MAC servicing a geographic area can change as a result of the bid competition. MAC transition periods can impact claims processing functions and the resulting cash flow. 

CMS contracts with third parties to promote the integrity of the Medicare program through review of quality concerns and detection and correction of improper payments. QIOs, for example, are groups of physicians and other health care quality experts that work on behalf of CMS to ensure that Medicare pays only for goods and services that are reasonable and necessary and that are provided in the most appropriate setting. Under the RAC program, CMS contracts with RACs on a contingency basis to conduct post-payment reviews to detect and correct improper payments in the fee-for-service Medicare program. The compensation for the RACs is based on their review of claims submitted to Medicare for billing compliance, including correct coding and medical necessity, and the amount of overpayments and underpayments they identify. CMS has implemented the RAC program on a permanent, nationwide basis as required by statute; however, CMS recently reduced the number of claims that RACs may audit by limiting the number of records that RACs may request from hospitals based on each provider&#146;s claim denial rate for the previous year. CMS plans to expand the RAC program to Medicare Advantage, as required by the Health Reform Law. 

We have established policies and procedures to respond to the RAC requests and payment denials. Payment recoveries resulting from RAC reviews and denials are appealable through administrative and judicial processes, and we pursue reversal of adverse determinations at appropriate appeal levels. We incur additional costs related to responding to RAC requests and denials, including costs associated with responding to requests for records and pursuing the reversal of payment denials and losses associated with overpayments that are not reversed upon appeal. Amounts that have not been reversed upon appeal have not been significant, but the number and amount of claims subject to RAC review have steadily increased. Currently, there are significant delays in the assignment of new Medicare appeals to Administrative Law Judges. Depending upon the growth of RAC programs and our success in appealing claims in future periods, our cash flows and results of operations could be negatively impacted. 

&#160; 

Managed Medicare 

Under the Managed Medicare program, the federal government contracts with private health plans to provide members with Medicare Part A, Part B and Part D benefits. Managed Medicare plans can be structured as HMOs, PPOs or private fee-for-service plans. The Medicare program allows beneficiaries to choose enrollment in certain managed Medicare plans. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 increased reimbursement to managed Medicare plans and expanded Medicare beneficiaries&#146; health care options. The Health Reform Law reduces, on a gradual basis through 2017, premium payments to managed Medicare plans such that CMS&#146; managed care per capita premium payments are, on average, equal to traditional Medicare. In addition, the Health Reform Law requires managed Medicare plans to keep annual administrative costs lower than 15% of annual premium revenue. The Health Reform Law also implements fee payment adjustments based on service benchmarks and quality ratings. Overall, the changes are expected to reduce payments to managed Medicare plans. In addition, the Health Reform Law expands the RAC program to include managed Medicare plans. In light of the current economic environment and the Health Reform Law, managed Medicare plans may experience reduced premium payments from CMS, which may lead to increased beneficiary premiums or limits on benefits which, in turn, may cause decreased enrollment in such plans. 

Medicaid 

Medicaid programs are funded jointly by the federal government and the states and are administered by states under approved plans. Most state Medicaid program payments are made under a PPS or are based on negotiated payment levels with individual hospitals. Medicaid reimbursement is often less than a hospital&#146;s cost of services. The Health Reform Law requires states to expand Medicaid coverage to all individuals under age 65 with incomes up to 133% of the federal poverty level (&#147;FPL&#148;) and to apply a &#147;5% income disregard&#148; to the eligibility standard, so that eligibility is effectively extended to those with incomes up to 138% of the FPL. However, states may opt out of the expansion without losing existing federal Medicaid funding. A number of states, including Texas and Florida, have opted out of the Medicaid expansion, but these states could choose to implement the expansion at a later date. It is unclear how many states will ultimately implement the Medicaid expansion provisions of the law. 

Because most states must operate with balanced budgets and because the Medicaid program is often the state&#146;s largest program, states can be expected to adopt or consider adopting legislation designed to reduce their Medicaid expenditures. The current economic environment has increased the budgetary pressures on most states, and these budgetary pressures have resulted and likely will continue to result in decreased spending, or decreased spending growth, for Medicaid programs in many states. 

Certain states in which we operate have adopted broad-based provider taxes to fund the non-federal share of Medicaid programs. Many states have also adopted, or are considering, legislation designed to reduce coverage, enroll Medicaid recipients in managed care programs and/or impose additional taxes on hospitals to help finance or expand the states&#146; Medicaid systems. However, for children, the Health Reform Law requires states to at least maintain Medicaid eligibility standards established prior to the enactment of the law until October 1, 2019. 

Federal funds under the Medicaid program may not be used to reimburse providers for medical assistance provided to treat certain provider-preventable conditions. Each state Medicaid program must deny payments to providers for the treatment of health care-acquired conditions designated by CMS as well as other provider-preventable conditions that may be designated by the state. 

Congress has expanded the federal government&#146;s involvement in fighting fraud, waste and abuse in the Medicaid program through the Medicaid Integrity Program. CMS employs private contractors, referred to as Medicaid Integrity Contractors (&#147;MICs&#148;), to perform post-payment audits of Medicaid claims and identify overpayments. In addition to MICs, several other contractors and state Medicaid agencies have increased their 

&#160; 

review activities. The Health Reform Law increases federal funding for the MIC program and expands the RAC program&#146;s scope to include Medicaid claims by requiring all states to enter into contracts with RACs to audit payments to Medicaid providers. 

Managed Medicaid 

Managed Medicaid programs enable states to contract with one or more entities for patient enrollment, care management and claims adjudication. The states usually do not relinquish program responsibilities for financing, eligibility criteria and core benefit plan design. We generally contract directly with one of the designated entities, usually a managed care organization. The provisions of these programs are state-specific. 

Enrollment in managed Medicaid plans has increased in recent years, as state governments seek to control the cost of Medicaid programs. However, general economic conditions in the states in which we operate may require reductions in premium payments to these plans and may reduce enrollment in these plans. 

Accountable Care Organizations and Bundled Payment Initiatives 

An Accountable Care Organization (&#147;ACO&#148;) is a network of providers and suppliers that work together to invest in infrastructure and redesign delivery processes to attempt to achieve high quality and efficient delivery of services. Promoting accountability and coordination of care, ACOs are intended to produce savings as a result of improved quality and operational efficiency. ACOs that achieve quality performance standards established by HHS are eligible to share in a portion of the amounts saved by the Medicare program. There are several types of ACO programs, including the Medicare Shared Savings Program (&#147;MSSP&#148;), which was established pursuant to the Health Reform Law, and the Next Generation ACO Model. As of January 2016, CMS has approved over 475 ACOs to participate in various Medicare ACO initiatives. 

The Health Reform Law created the Center for Medicare &#38; Medicaid Innovation with responsibility for establishing demonstration projects and other initiatives in order to identify, develop, test and encourage the adoption of new methods of delivering and paying for health care that create savings under the Medicare and Medicaid programs while improving quality of care. One initiative implemented by the Center for Medicare &#38; Medicaid Innovation is a voluntary bundled payment initiative known as the Bundled Payment for Care Improvement (&#147;BPCI&#148;) initiative. The BPCI initiative is comprised of four broadly defined models of care and links payments to participating providers for services provided during an episode of care. As required by the Health Reform Law, HHS established a separate five-year, voluntary, national pilot program on payment bundling for Medicare services. Under the program, organizations enter into payment arrangements that include financial and performance accountability for episodes of care. By rewarding providers for increasing quality and reducing costs and penalizing providers if costs exceed a set amount, these models are intended to lead to higher quality, more coordinated care at a lower cost to the Medicare program. Participating providers agree to receive one payment for services provided to Medicare patients for certain medical conditions or episodes of care. 

Beginning in April 2016, hospitals located in markets selected by CMS, including many of our facilities, will be required to participate in the Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement (&#147;CJR&#148;) model, a five-year bundled payment initiative focused on knee and hip replacements. Unlike the BPCI initiative, which is voluntary, the CJR initiative is mandatory in the selected geographic areas. The model aims to support better and more efficient care for beneficiaries by encouraging hospitals, physicians, and post-acute care providers to work together to improve quality and coordination of care from the initial hospitalization through recovery. The CJR model tests bundled payment and quality measurements by evaluating participating hospitals against quality standards and Medicare spending targets established by CMS for each episode of care. An episode of care begins with a patient&#146;s hospital admission, ends 90 days post-discharge, and includes all related items and services that are paid under Medicare Part A and Part B for all Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries, subject to exclusions enumerated by CMS. At the end of a model performance year, actual episode spending is compared to the Medicare target episode price for the responsible hospital. Depending on whether overall CMS spending per 

&#160; 

episode exceeds or falls below the target and whether quality standards are met, hospitals may receive supplemental Medicare payments or owe repayments to CMS. 

The Health Reform Law also provides for a bundled payment demonstration project for Medicaid services, but CMS has not yet implemented this project. HHS may select up to eight states to participate, and these state programs may target particular categories of beneficiaries, selected diagnoses or geographic regions of the state. The selected state programs will provide one payment for both hospital and physician services provided to Medicaid patients for certain episodes of inpatient care. 

Disproportionate Share Hospital Payments 

In addition to making payments for services provided directly to beneficiaries, Medicare makes additional payments to hospitals that treat a disproportionately large number of low-income patients (Medicaid and Medicare patients eligible to receive Supplemental Security Income). Disproportionate Share Hospital (&#147;DSH&#148;) payments are determined annually based on certain statistical information required by HHS and are paid as a percentage addition to MS-DRG payments. 

Under the Health Reform Law, Medicare DSH payments are reduced to 25% of the amount they otherwise would have been absent the law. The remaining 75% of the amount that would otherwise be paid under Medicare DSH is effectively pooled, and this pool is reduced further each year by a formula that reflects reductions in the national level of uninsured who are under 65 years of age. Thus, the greater the level of coverage for the previously uninsured nationally, the more the Medicare DSH payment pool will be reduced. Each DSH hospital is then to be paid, out of the reduced DSH payment pool, an amount allocated based upon its estimated cost of providing uncompensated care. 

Hospitals that provide care to a disproportionately high number of low-income patients may receive Medicaid DSH payments. The federal government distributes federal Medicaid DSH funds to each state based on a statutory formula. The states then distribute the DSH funding among qualifying hospitals. States have broad discretion to define which hospitals qualify for Medicaid DSH payments and the amount of such payments. The Health Reform Law, as modified by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013, provides for reductions to the Medicaid DSH hospital program in federal fiscal years 2016 through 2020. Subsequent legislation has delayed the implementation of the reductions until fiscal year 2018 and extended the reductions through fiscal year 2025. Under current law, Medicaid DSH will be reduced annually as follows: 2018 ($2 billion); 2019 ($3 billion); 2020 ($4 billion); 2021 ($5 billion); 2022 ($6 billion); 2023 ($7 billion); and 2024 and 2025 ($8 billion each). CMS issued a final rule in 2013 establishing the methodology for allocating the cuts among the states based on the volume of Medicaid inpatients and levels of uncompensated care in each state. Under that rule, states largely retained the ability to manage the reduced allotments and to allocate these cuts among providers within the state. However, due to the delays in the onset of the reductions, a new methodology will be required prior to fiscal year 2017. 

TRICARE 

TRICARE is the Department of Defense&#146;s health care program for members of the armed forces. For inpatient services, TRICARE reimburses hospitals based on a DRG system modeled on the Medicare inpatient PPS. For outpatient services, TRICARE reimburses hospitals based on a PPS that is similar to that utilized for services furnished to Medicare beneficiaries. 

Annual Cost Reports 

All hospitals participating in the Medicare, Medicaid and TRICARE programs, whether paid on a reasonable cost basis or under a PPS, are required to meet certain financial reporting requirements. Federal and, where applicable, state regulations require the submission of annual cost reports covering the revenues, costs and 

&#160; 

expenses associated with the services provided by each hospital to Medicare beneficiaries and Medicaid recipients. 

Annual cost reports required under the Medicare and Medicaid programs are subject to routine audits, which may result in adjustments to the amounts ultimately determined to be due to us under these reimbursement programs. These audits often require several years to reach the final determination of amounts due to or from us under these programs. Providers also have rights of appeal, and it is common to contest issues raised in audits of cost reports. 

Managed Care and Other Discounted Plans 

Most of our hospitals offer discounts from established charges to certain large group purchasers of health care services, including managed care plans and private insurance companies. Admissions reimbursed by commercial managed care and other insurers were 30% of our total admissions for each of the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Managed care contracts are typically negotiated for terms between one and three years. While we generally received contracted annual average increases that were expected to yield 4.0% to 5.0% from managed care payers during 2015, there can be no assurance that we will continue to receive increases in the future. It is not clear what impact, if any, the increased obligations on managed care payers and other health plans imposed by the Health Reform Law will have on our ability to negotiate reimbursement increases or the impact of plans offered through the Exchanges on us. 

Uninsured and Self-Pay Patients 

A high percentage of our uninsured patients are initially admitted through our emergency rooms. For the year ended December 31, 2015, approximately 83% of our admissions of uninsured patients occurred through our emergency rooms. The Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (&#147;EMTALA&#148;) requires any hospital that participates in the Medicare program to conduct an appropriate medical screening examination of every person who presents to the hospital&#146;s emergency room for treatment and, if the individual is suffering from an emergency medical condition, to either stabilize that condition or make an appropriate transfer of the individual to a facility that can handle the condition. The obligation to screen and stabilize emergency medical conditions exists regardless of an individual&#146;s ability to pay for treatment. The Health Reform Law requires health plans to reimburse hospitals for emergency services provided to enrollees without prior authorization and without regard to whether a participating provider contract is in place. Further, the Health Reform Law contains provisions that seek to decrease the number of uninsured individuals, including requirements and incentives for individuals to obtain, and large employers to provide, insurance coverage. These mandates are reducing the financial impact of screening for and stabilizing emergency medical conditions. However, many factors are unknown regarding the impact of the Health Reform Law, including how many previously uninsured individuals will obtain and maintain coverage as a result of the law, the change, if any, in the volume of inpatient and outpatient hospital services that are sought by and provided to previously uninsured individuals, any changes to the payer mix and any increases in plan structures that result in higher patient responsibility amounts. 

Electronic Health Record Incentives 

The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (&#147;ARRA&#148;) provides for Medicare and Medicaid incentive payments for eligible hospitals and for eligible professionals that adopt and meaningfully use certified EHR technology and provides for penalties for eligible hospitals and eligible professionals that do not adopt and meaningfully use EHR technology. Through December 2015, approximately $32 billion in incentive payments have been made through the Medicare and Medicaid EHR incentive programs to eligible hospitals and eligible professionals. 

Under the Medicare incentive program, eligible hospitals that demonstrate meaningful use will receive incentive payments for up to four fiscal years. As of federal fiscal year 2015, acute care hospitals that have failed 

&#160; 

to demonstrate meaningful use of certified EHR technology in an applicable prior reporting period receive reduced market basket updates under inpatient PPS. 

Eligible professionals who demonstrate meaningful use are entitled to incentive payments for up to five payment years. As of calendar year 2015, eligible professionals who have failed to demonstrate meaningful use of certified EHR technology in an applicable prior reporting period face Medicare payment reductions. 

The Medicaid EHR incentive program is voluntary for states to implement. For participating states, the Medicaid EHR incentive program provides incentive payments for acute care hospitals and eligible professionals that meet certain volume percentages of Medicaid patients, as well as children&#146;s hospitals. Providers may only participate in a single state&#146;s Medicaid EHR incentive program. Eligible professionals can only participate in either the Medicaid incentive program or the Medicare incentive program and can change this election only one time. Eligible hospitals may participate in both the Medicare and Medicaid incentive programs. 

To qualify for incentive payments under the Medicaid program, providers must either adopt, implement, upgrade or demonstrate meaningful use of certified EHR technology during their first participation year or successfully demonstrate meaningful use of certified EHR technology in subsequent participation years. Payments may be received for up to six participation years. There is no penalty for hospitals or professionals under Medicaid for failing to meet EHR meaningful use requirements. 

Hospital Utilization 

We believe the most important factors relating to the overall utilization of a hospital are the quality and market position of the hospital and the number and quality of physicians and other health care professionals providing patient care within the facility. Generally, we believe the ability of a hospital to be a market leader is determined by its breadth of services, level of technology, quality and condition of the facilities, emphasis on quality of care and convenience for patients and physicians. Other factors that impact utilization include the growth in local population, local economic conditions and market penetration of managed care programs. 

&#160; 

The following table sets forth certain operating statistics for our health care facilities. Health care facility operations are subject to certain seasonal fluctuations, including decreases in patient utilization during holiday periods and increases in the cold weather months. The data set forth in this table includes only those facilities that are consolidated for financial reporting purposes.

(a) Licensed beds are those beds for which a facility has been granted approval to operate from the applicable state licensing agency. (b) Represents the average number of licensed beds, weighted based on periods owned. (c) Represents the total number of patients admitted to our hospitals and is used by management and certain investors as a general measure of inpatient volume. (d) Equivalent admissions are used by management and certain investors as a general measure of combined inpatient and outpatient volume. Equivalent admissions are computed by multiplying admissions (inpatient volume) by the sum of gross inpatient revenue and gross outpatient revenue and then dividing the resulting amount by gross inpatient revenue. The equivalent admissions computation &#147;equates&#148; outpatient revenue to the volume measure (admissions) used to measure inpatient volume, resulting in a general measure of combined inpatient and outpatient volume. (e) Represents the average number of days admitted patients stay in our hospitals. (f) Represents the average number of patients in our hospital beds each day. (g) Represents the percentage of hospital licensed beds occupied by patients. Both average daily census and occupancy rate provide measures of the utilization of inpatient rooms. (h) Represents the number of patients treated in our emergency rooms. (i) Represents the number of surgeries performed on patients who were not admitted to our hospitals. Pain management and endoscopy procedures are not included in outpatient surgeries. (j) Represents the number of surgeries performed on patients who have been admitted to our hospitals. Pain management and endoscopy procedures are not included in inpatient surgeries. Competition 

Generally, other hospitals in the communities we serve provide services similar to those offered by our hospitals. Additionally, in recent years the number of freestanding specialty hospitals, surgery centers, emergency departments, urgent care centers and diagnostic and imaging centers in the geographic areas in which we operate has increased significantly. As a result, most of our hospitals operate in a highly competitive environment. In some cases, competing hospitals are more established than our hospitals. Some competing facilities are physician-owned or are owned by tax-supported government agencies and many others are owned by not-for-profit entities that may be supported by endowments, charitable contributions and/or tax revenues and are exempt from sales, property and income taxes. Such exemptions and support are not available to our hospitals 

&#160; 

and may provide the tax-supported or not-for-profit entities an advantage in funding capital expenditures. In certain localities there are large teaching hospitals that provide highly specialized facilities, equipment and services that may not be available at most of our hospitals. We also face competition from specialty hospitals and from both our own and unaffiliated freestanding ASCs for market share in certain high margin services. 

Psychiatric hospitals frequently attract patients from areas outside their immediate locale and, therefore, our psychiatric hospitals compete with both local and regional hospitals, including the psychiatric units of general, acute care hospitals. 

Our strategies are designed to ensure our hospitals are competitive. We believe our hospitals compete within local communities on the basis of many factors, including the quality of care, ability to attract and retain quality physicians, skilled clinical personnel and other health care professionals, location, breadth of services, technology offered, quality and condition of the facilities and prices charged. Hospitals must make public a list of their standard charges for items and services or their policies for providing a list of such charges in response to an inquiry. We have increased our focus on operating outpatient services with improved accessibility and more convenient service for patients, and increased predictability and efficiency for physicians. 

Two of the most significant factors to the competitive position of a hospital are the number and quality of physicians affiliated with or employed by the hospital. Although physicians may at any time terminate their relationship with a hospital we operate, our hospitals seek to retain physicians with varied specialties on the hospitals&#146; medical staffs and to attract other qualified physicians. We believe physicians refer patients to a hospital on the basis of the quality and scope of services it renders to patients and physicians, the quality of physicians on the medical staff, the location of the hospital and the quality of the hospital&#146;s facilities, equipment and employees. Accordingly, we strive to maintain and provide quality facilities, equipment, employees and services for physicians and patients. Our hospitals face competition from competitors that are implementing physician alignment strategies, such as employing physicians, acquiring physician practice groups and participating in ACOs or other clinical integration models. 

Another major factor in the competitive position of our hospitals is our ability to negotiate service contracts with purchasers of group health care services. Managed care plans attempt to direct and control the use of hospital services and obtain discounts from hospitals&#146; established gross charges. In addition, employers and traditional health insurers continue to attempt to contain costs through negotiations with hospitals for managed care programs and discounts from established gross charges. Generally, hospitals compete for service contracts with group health care services purchasers on the basis of price, market reputation, geographic location, quality and range of services, quality of the medical staff and convenience. Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to retain and renew our managed care contracts and enter into new managed care contracts on favorable terms. Other health care providers may impact our ability to enter into managed care contracts or negotiate increases in our reimbursement and other favorable terms and conditions. For example, some of our competitors may negotiate exclusivity provisions with managed care plans or otherwise restrict the ability of managed care companies to contract with us. The trend toward consolidation among non-government payers tends to increase their bargaining power over fee structures. In addition, various provisions of the Health Reform Law, including the Exchanges and limitations on rescissions of coverage and pre-existing condition exclusions, may lead to non-government payers increasingly demanding reduced fees or being unwilling to negotiate reimbursement increases. Most of the plans offered through the Exchanges provide for narrow networks that restrict the number of participating providers or tiered networks that impose significantly higher cost sharing obligations on patients that obtain services from providers in a disfavored tier. The importance of obtaining contracts with managed care organizations varies from community to community, depending on the market strength of such organizations. 

State certificate of need (&#147;CON&#148;) laws, which place limitations on a health care facility&#146;s ability to expand services and facilities, make capital expenditures and otherwise make changes in operations, may also have the 

&#160; 

effect of restricting competition. We currently operate health care facilities in a number of states with CON laws or that require other types of approvals for the establishment or expansion of certain facility types or services. Before issuing a CON or other approval, these states consider the need for additional or expanded health care facilities or services. In those states that do not require state approval or that set relatively high levels of expenditures before they become reviewable by state authorities, competition in the form of new services, facilities and capital spending is more prevalent. See Item 1, &#147;Business &#151; Regulation and Other Factors.&#148; 

We and the health care industry as a whole face the challenge of continuing to provide quality patient care while dealing with rising costs and strong competition for patients. Changes in medical technology, existing and future legislation, regulations and interpretations and managed care contracting for provider services by private and government payers remain ongoing challenges. 

Admissions, average lengths of stay and reimbursement amounts continue to be negatively affected by payer-required pre-admission authorization, utilization review and payer pressure to maximize outpatient and alternative health care delivery services for less acutely ill patients. The Health Reform Law expanded the use of prepayment review by Medicare contractors by eliminating statutory restrictions on their use. Increased competition, admission constraints and payer pressures are expected to continue. To meet these challenges, we intend to expand and update our facilities or acquire or construct new facilities where appropriate, to enhance the provision of a comprehensive array of outpatient services, offer market competitive pricing to private payer groups, upgrade facilities and equipment and offer new or expanded programs and services. 

Regulation and Other Factors 

Licensure, Certification and Accreditation 

Health care facility construction and operation are subject to numerous federal, state and local regulations relating to the adequacy of medical care, equipment, personnel, operating policies and procedures, maintenance of adequate records, fire prevention, rate-setting and compliance with building codes and environmental protection laws. Facilities are subject to periodic inspection by governmental and other authorities to assure continued compliance with the various standards necessary for licensing and accreditation. We believe our health care facilities are properly licensed under applicable state laws. Each of our acute care hospitals located in the United States is eligible to participate in Medicare and Medicaid programs and is accredited by The Joint Commission. If any facility were to lose its Medicare or Medicaid certification, the facility would be unable to receive reimbursement from federal health care programs. If any facility were to lose accreditation, the facility would be subject to state surveys, potentially be subject to increased scrutiny by CMS and likely lose payment from non-government payers. Management believes our facilities are in substantial compliance with current applicable federal, state, local and independent review body regulations and standards. The requirements for licensure, certification and accreditation are subject to change and, in order to remain qualified, it may become necessary for us to make changes in our facilities, equipment, personnel and services. The requirements for licensure, certification and accreditation also include notification or approval in the event of the transfer or change of ownership or certain other changes. Failure to provide required notifications or obtain necessary approvals in these circumstances can result in the inability to complete an acquisition or change of ownership, loss of licensure, lapses in reimbursement or other penalties. 

Certificates of Need 

In some states where we operate hospitals and other health care facilities, the construction or expansion of health care facilities, the acquisition of existing facilities, the transfer or change of ownership and the addition of new beds or services may be subject to review by and prior approval of, or notifications to, state regulatory agencies under a CON program. Such laws generally require the reviewing state agency to determine the public need for additional or expanded health care facilities and services. Failure to provide required notifications or obtain necessary state approvals can result in the inability to expand facilities, complete an acquisition or change ownership or other penalties. 

&#160; 

State Rate Review 

Some states have adopted legislation mandating rate or budget review for hospitals or have adopted taxes on hospital revenues, assessments or licensure fees to fund indigent health care within the state. In the aggregate, indigent tax provisions have not materially, adversely affected our results of operations. Although we do not currently operate facilities in states that mandate rate or budget reviews, we cannot predict whether we will operate in such states in the future, or whether the states in which we currently operate may adopt legislation mandating such reviews. 

Federal Health Care Program Regulations 

Participation in any federal health care program, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs, is heavily regulated by statute and regulation. If a hospital fails to substantially comply with the numerous conditions of participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs or performs certain prohibited acts, the hospital&#146;s participation in the federal health care programs may be terminated, or civil and/or criminal penalties may be imposed. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 requires civil monetary penalties to increase by up to 150% by August 1, 2016, and to increase annually thereafter based on updates to the consumer price index. 

Anti-kickback Statute 

A section of the Social Security Act known as the &#147;Anti-kickback Statute&#148; prohibits providers and others from directly or indirectly soliciting, receiving, offering or paying any remuneration with the intent of generating referrals or orders for services or items covered by a federal health care program. Courts have interpreted this statute broadly and held that there is a violation of the Anti-kickback Statute if just one purpose of the remuneration is to generate referrals, even if there are other lawful purposes. Furthermore, the Health Reform Law provides that knowledge of the law or the intent to violate the law is not required. Violations of the Anti-kickback Statute may be punished by a criminal fine of up to $25,000 for each violation or imprisonment, civil money penalties of up to $50,000 per violation and damages of up to three times the total amount of the remuneration and/or exclusion from participation in federal health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. In addition, submission of a claim for services or items generated in violation of the Anti-kickback Statute may be subject to additional penalties under the federal False Claims Act (&#147;FCA&#148;) as a false or fraudulent claim. 

The OIG, among other regulatory agencies, is responsible for identifying and eliminating fraud, abuse and waste. The OIG carries out this mission through a nationwide program of audits, investigations and inspections. The OIG provides guidance to the industry through various methods including advisory opinions and &#147;Special Fraud Alerts.&#148; These Special Fraud Alerts do not have the force of law, but identify features of arrangements or transactions that the government believes may cause the arrangements or transactions to violate the Anti-kickback Statute or other federal health care laws. The OIG has identified several incentive arrangements that constitute suspect practices, including: (a) payment of any incentive by a hospital each time a physician refers a patient to the hospital, (b) the use of free or significantly discounted office space or equipment in facilities usually located close to the hospital, (c) provision of free or significantly discounted billing, nursing or other staff services, (d) free training for a physician&#146;s office staff in areas such as management techniques and laboratory techniques, (e) guarantees which provide, if the physician&#146;s income fails to reach a predetermined level, the hospital will pay any portion of the remainder, (f) low-interest or interest-free loans, or loans which may be forgiven if a physician refers patients to the hospital, (g) payment of the costs of a physician&#146;s travel and expenses for conferences, (h) coverage on the hospital&#146;s group health insurance plans at an inappropriately low cost to the physician, (i) payment for services (which may include consultations at the hospital) which require few, if any, substantive duties by the physician, (j) purchasing goods or services from physicians at prices in excess of their fair market value, (k) rental of space in physician offices, at other than fair market value terms, by persons or entities to which physicians refer, and (l) physician-owned entities (frequently referred to as physician-owned distributorships or PODs) that derive revenue from selling, or arranging for the sale of, 

&#160; 

implantable medical devices ordered by their physician-owners for use on procedures that physician-owners perform on their own patients at hospitals or ASCs. The OIG has encouraged persons having information about hospitals who offer the above types of incentives to physicians to report such information to the OIG. 

The OIG also issues &#147;Special Advisory Bulletins&#148; as a means of providing guidance to health care providers. These bulletins, along with the Special Fraud Alerts, have focused on certain arrangements that could be subject to heightened scrutiny by government enforcement authorities, including: (a) contractual joint venture arrangements and other joint venture arrangements between those in a position to refer business, such as physicians, and those providing items or services for which Medicare or Medicaid pays, and (b) certain &#147;gainsharing&#148; arrangements, i.e., the practice of giving physicians a share of any reduction in a hospital&#146;s costs for patient care attributable in part to the physician&#146;s efforts. 

In addition to issuing Special Fraud Alerts and Special Advisory Bulletins, the OIG issues compliance program guidance for certain types of health care providers. The OIG guidance identifies a number of risk areas under federal fraud and abuse statutes and regulations. These areas of risk include compensation arrangements with physicians, recruitment arrangements with physicians and joint venture relationships with physicians. 

As authorized by Congress, the OIG has published safe harbor regulations that outline categories of activities deemed protected from prosecution under the Anti-kickback Statute. Currently, there are statutory exceptions and safe harbors for various activities, including the following: certain investment interests, space rental, equipment rental, practitioner recruitment, personnel services and management contracts, sale of practice, referral services, warranties, discounts, employees, group purchasing organizations, waiver of beneficiary coinsurance and deductible amounts, managed care arrangements, obstetrical malpractice insurance subsidies, investments in group practices, freestanding surgery centers, ambulance replenishing, and referral agreements for specialty services. 

The fact that conduct or a business arrangement does not fall within a safe harbor or is identified in a Special Fraud Alert, Special Advisory Bulletin or other guidance does not necessarily render the conduct or business arrangement illegal under the Anti-kickback Statute. However, such conduct and business arrangements may lead to increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities. 

We have a variety of financial relationships with physicians and others who either refer or influence the referral of patients to our hospitals, other health care facilities and employed physicians, including employment contracts, leases, medical director agreements and professional service agreements. We also have similar relationships with physicians and facilities to which patients are referred from our facilities and other providers. In addition, we provide financial incentives, including minimum revenue guarantees, to recruit physicians into the communities served by our hospitals. While we endeavor to comply with the applicable safe harbors, certain of our current arrangements, including joint ventures and financial relationships with physicians and other referral sources and persons and entities to which we refer patients, do not qualify for safe harbor protection. 

Although we believe our arrangements with physicians and other referral sources and referral recipients have been structured to comply with current law and available interpretations, there can be no assurance regulatory authorities enforcing these laws will determine these financial arrangements comply with the Anti-kickback Statute or other applicable laws. An adverse determination could subject us to liabilities under the Social Security Act and other laws, including criminal penalties, civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid or other federal health care programs. 

Stark Law 

The Social Security Act also includes a provision commonly known as the &#147;Stark Law.&#148; The Stark Law prohibits physicians from referring Medicare and Medicaid patients to entities with which they or any of their immediate family members have a financial relationship, if these entities provide certain &#147;designated health 

&#160; 

services&#148; reimbursable by Medicare or Medicaid unless an exception applies. The Stark Law also prohibits entities that provide designated health services reimbursable by Medicare and Medicaid from billing the Medicare and Medicaid programs for any items or services that result from a prohibited referral and requires the entities to refund amounts received for items or services provided pursuant to the prohibited referral on a timely basis. &#147;Designated health services&#148; include inpatient and outpatient hospital services, clinical laboratory services and radiology services. Sanctions for violating the Stark Law include denial of payment, civil monetary penalties of up to $15,000 per claim submitted and exclusion from the federal health care programs. Failure to refund amounts received as a result of a prohibited referral on a timely basis may constitute a false or fraudulent claim and may result in civil penalties and additional penalties under the FCA. The statute also provides for a penalty of up to $100,000 for a circumvention scheme. Civil monetary penalties will increase by up to 150% in 2016, and annually thereafter, as described above. 

There are exceptions to the self-referral prohibition for many of the customary financial arrangements between physicians and providers, including employment contracts, leases and recruitment agreements. Unlike safe harbors under the Anti-kickback Statute with which compliance is voluntary, a financial relationship must comply with every requirement of a Stark Law exception or the arrangement is in violation of the Stark Law. Although there is an exception for a physician&#146;s ownership interest in an entire hospital, the Health Reform Law prohibits physician-owned hospitals established after December 31, 2010 from billing for Medicare or Medicaid patients referred by their physician owners. As a result, the law effectively prevents the formation of new physician-owned hospitals that participate in Medicare or Medicaid. While the Health Reform Law grandfathers existing physician-owned hospitals, it does not allow these hospitals to increase the percentage of physician ownership and significantly restricts their ability to expand services. 

Through a series of rulemakings, CMS has issued final regulations implementing the Stark Law. While these regulations were intended to clarify the requirements of the exceptions to the Stark Law, it is unclear how the government will interpret many of these exceptions for enforcement purposes. Further, we do not always have the benefit of significant regulatory or judicial interpretation of the Stark Law and its implementing regulations. We attempt to structure our relationships to meet an exception to the Stark Law, but the regulations implementing the exceptions are detailed and complex, and we cannot assure that every relationship complies fully with the Stark Law. 

Similar State Laws 

Many states in which we operate also have laws similar to the Anti-kickback Statute that prohibit payments to physicians for patient referrals and laws similar to the Stark Law that prohibit certain self-referrals. The scope of these state laws is broad because they can often apply regardless of the source of payment for care, and little precedent exists for their interpretation or enforcement. These statutes typically provide for criminal and civil penalties, as well as loss of licensure. 

Other Fraud and Abuse Provisions 

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (&#147;HIPAA&#148;) broadened the scope of certain fraud and abuse laws by adding several criminal provisions for health care fraud offenses that apply to all health benefit programs. The Social Security Act also imposes criminal and civil penalties for making false claims and statements to Medicare and Medicaid. False claims include, but are not limited to, billing for services not rendered or for misrepresenting actual services rendered in order to obtain higher reimbursement, billing for unnecessary goods and services and cost report fraud. Federal enforcement officials have the ability to exclude from Medicare and Medicaid any investors, officers and managing employees associated with business entities that have committed health care fraud, even if the officer or managing employee had no knowledge of the fraud. Criminal and civil penalties may be imposed for a number of other prohibited activities, including failure to return known overpayments, certain gainsharing arrangements, billing Medicare amounts that are substantially in excess of a provider&#146;s usual charges, offering remuneration to influence a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary&#146;s 

&#160; 

selection of a health care provider, contracting with an individual or entity known to be excluded from a federal health care program, making or accepting a payment to induce a physician to reduce or limit services, and soliciting or receiving any remuneration in return for referring an individual for an item or service payable by a federal health care program. Like the Anti-kickback Statute, these provisions are very broad. Civil penalties may be imposed for the failure to report and return an overpayment within 60 days of identifying the overpayment or by the date a corresponding cost report is due, whichever is later. To avoid liability, providers must, among other things, carefully and accurately code claims for reimbursement, promptly return overpayments and accurately prepare cost reports. 

Some of these provisions, including the federal Civil Monetary Penalty Law, require a lower burden of proof than other fraud and abuse laws, including the Anti-kickback Statute. Civil monetary penalties that may be imposed under the federal Civil Monetary Penalty Law range from $10,000 to $50,000 per act. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 requires these penalties to increase by up to 150% by August 1, 2016, and annually thereafter, as described above. In some cases, violations of the Civil Monetary Penalty Law may result in penalties of up to three times the remuneration offered, paid, solicited or received. In addition, a violator may be subject to exclusion from federal and state health care programs. Federal and state governments increasingly use the federal Civil Monetary Penalty Law, especially where they believe they cannot meet the higher burden of proof requirements under the Anti-kickback Statute. Further, individuals can receive up to $1,000 for providing information on Medicare fraud and abuse that leads to the recovery of at least $100 of Medicare funds under the Medicare Integrity Program. 

The Federal False Claims Act and Similar State Laws 

We are subject to state and federal laws that govern the submission of claims for reimbursement and prohibit the making of false claims or statements. One of the most prominent of these laws is the FCA, which may be enforced by the federal government directly or by a qui tam plaintiff, or whistleblower, on the government&#146;s behalf. The government may use the FCA to prosecute Medicare and other government program fraud in areas such as coding errors, billing for services not provided and submitting false cost reports. In addition, the FCA covers payments made in connection with the Exchanges created under the Health Reform Law, if those payments include any federal funds. When a private party brings a qui tam action under the FCA, the defendant is not made aware of the lawsuit until the government commences its own investigation or makes a determination whether it will intervene. If a defendant is determined by a court of law to be liable under the FCA, the defendant may be required to pay three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties of between $5,500 and $11,000 for each separate false claim. Civil monetary penalties will increase by up to 150% in 2016, and annually thereafter, as described above. 

There are many potential bases for liability under the FCA. Liability often arises when an entity knowingly submits a false claim for reimbursement to the federal government. The FCA defines the term &#147;knowingly&#148; broadly. Though simple negligence will not give rise to liability under the FCA, submitting a claim with reckless disregard to its truth or falsity constitutes a &#147;knowing&#148; submission under the FCA and, therefore, may create liability. Submission of claims for services or items generated in violation of the Anti-kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim under the FCA. Whistleblowers and the federal government have taken the position, and some courts have held, that providers who allegedly have violated other statutes, such as the Stark Law, have thereby submitted false claims under the FCA. False claims under the FCA also include the knowing and improper failure to report and refund amounts owed to the government in a timely manner following identification of an overpayment. Effective March 14, 2016, an overpayment is deemed to be identified when a person has, or should have through reasonable diligence, determined that an overpayment was received and quantified the overpayment. 

Every entity that receives at least $5 million annually in Medicaid payments must have written policies for all employees, contractors or agents, providing detailed information about false claims, false statements and whistleblower protections under certain federal laws, including the FCA, and similar state laws. In addition, federal law provides an incentive to states to enact false claims laws comparable to the FCA. A number of states 

&#160; 

in which we operate have adopted their own false claims provisions as well as their own whistleblower provisions under which a private party may file a civil lawsuit in state court. We have adopted and distributed policies pertaining to the FCA and relevant state laws. 

HIPAA Administrative Simplification and Privacy and Security Requirements 

The Administrative Simplification Provisions of HIPAA and implementing regulations require the use of uniform electronic data transmission standards for certain health care claims and payment transactions submitted or received electronically. These provisions are intended to encourage electronic commerce in the health care industry. As required by the Health Reform Law, HHS is in the process of adopting standards for additional electronic transactions and establishing operating rules to promote uniformity in the implementation of each standardized electronic transaction. In addition, HIPAA requires that each provider use a National Provider Identifier. CMS published a final rule requiring the use of updated standard code sets for certain diagnoses and procedures known as ICD-10 code sets. Health plans and providers, including our hospitals, were required to transition to the ICD-10 code sets by October 1, 2015, which required significant administrative changes. 

The privacy and security regulations promulgated pursuant to HIPAA extensively regulate the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information, known as &#147;protected health information,&#148; and require covered entities, including health plans and most health care providers, to implement administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect the security of such information. Certain provisions of the security and privacy regulations apply to business associates (entities that handle protected health information on behalf of covered entities), and business associates are subject to direct liability for violation of the regulations. In addition, a covered entity may be subject to penalties as a result of a business associate violating HIPAA, if the business associate is found to be an agent of the covered entity. 

Covered entities must report breaches of unsecured protected health information to affected individuals without unreasonable delay but not to exceed 60 days of discovery of the breach by a covered entity or its agents. Notification must also be made to HHS and, in certain situations involving large breaches, to the media. HHS is required to publish on its website a list of all covered entities that report a breach involving more than 500 individuals. All non-permitted uses or disclosures of unsecured protected health information are presumed to be breaches unless the covered entity or business associate establishes that there is a low probability the information has been compromised. Various state laws and regulations may also require us to notify affected individuals in the event of a data breach involving individually identifiable information. 

Violations of the HIPAA privacy and security regulations may result in criminal penalties and in civil penalties of up to $50,000 per violation for a maximum of $1,500,000 in a calendar year for violations of the same requirement. HHS is required to perform compliance audits and has announced its intent to perform audits in 2016. In addition to enforcement by HHS, state attorneys general are authorized to bring civil actions seeking either injunction or damages in response to violations that threaten the privacy of state residents. HHS may resolve HIPAA violations through informal means, such as allowing a covered entity to implement a corrective action plan, but HHS has the discretion to move directly to impose monetary penalties and is required to impose penalties for violations resulting from willful neglect. We enforce a HIPAA compliance plan, which we believe complies with the HIPAA privacy and security regulations and under which a HIPAA compliance group monitors our compliance. The HIPAA privacy regulations and security regulations have and will continue to impose significant costs on our facilities in order to comply with these standards. 

There are numerous other laws and legislative and regulatory initiatives at the federal and state levels addressing privacy and security concerns. Our facilities remain subject to any federal or state privacy-related laws that are more restrictive than the privacy regulations issued under HIPAA. These laws vary and could impose additional penalties. For example, the Federal Trade Commission uses its consumer protection authority to initiate enforcement actions in response to data breaches. 

&#160; 

EMTALA 

All of our hospitals in the United States are subject to EMTALA. This federal law requires any hospital participating in the Medicare program to conduct an appropriate medical screening examination of every individual who presents to the hospital&#146;s emergency room for treatment and, if the individual is suffering from an emergency medical condition, to either stabilize the condition or make an appropriate transfer of the individual to a facility able to handle the condition. The obligation to screen and stabilize emergency medical conditions exists regardless of an individual&#146;s ability to pay for treatment. There are severe penalties under EMTALA if a hospital fails to screen or appropriately stabilize or transfer an individual or if the hospital delays appropriate treatment in order to first inquire about the individual&#146;s ability to pay. Penalties for violations of EMTALA include civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in the Medicare program. In addition, an injured individual, the individual&#146;s family or a medical facility that suffers a financial loss as a direct result of a hospital&#146;s violation of the law can bring a civil suit against the hospital. 

The government broadly interprets EMTALA to cover situations in which individuals do not actually present to a hospital&#146;s emergency room, but present for emergency examination or treatment to the hospital&#146;s campus, generally, or to a hospital-based clinic that treats emergency medical conditions or are transported in a hospital-owned ambulance, subject to certain exceptions. At least one court has interpreted the law also to apply to a hospital that has been notified of a patient&#146;s pending arrival in a non-hospital owned ambulance. EMTALA does not generally apply to individuals admitted for inpatient services. The government has expressed its intent to investigate and enforce EMTALA violations actively. We believe our hospitals operate in substantial compliance with EMTALA. 

Corporate Practice of Medicine/Fee Splitting 

Some of the states in which we operate have laws prohibiting corporations and other entities from employing physicians, practicing medicine for a profit and making certain direct and indirect payments to, or entering into fee-splitting arrangements with, health care providers designed to induce or encourage the referral of patients to, or the recommendation of, particular providers for medical products and services. Possible sanctions for violation of these restrictions include loss of license and civil and criminal penalties. In addition, agreements between the corporation and the physician may be considered void and unenforceable. These statutes vary from state to state, are often vague and have seldom been interpreted by the courts or regulatory agencies. 

Health Care Industry Investigations 

Significant media and public attention has focused in recent years on the hospital industry. This media and public attention, changes in government personnel and other factors have led to increased scrutiny of the health care industry. Except as may be disclosed in our SEC filings, we are not aware of any material investigations of the Company under federal or state health care laws or regulations. It is possible that governmental entities could initiate investigations or litigation in the future at facilities we operate and that such matters could result in significant penalties, as well as adverse publicity. It is also possible that our executives and managers could be included in governmental investigations or litigation or named as defendants in private litigation. 

Our substantial Medicare, Medicaid and other governmental billings result in heightened scrutiny of our operations. We continue to monitor all aspects of our business and have developed a comprehensive ethics and compliance program that is designed to meet or exceed applicable federal guidelines and industry standards. Because the law in this area is complex and constantly evolving, governmental investigations or litigation may result in interpretations that are inconsistent with our or industry practices. 

In public statements surrounding current investigations, governmental authorities have taken positions on a number of issues, including some for which little official interpretation previously has been available, that appear to be inconsistent with practices that have been common within the industry and that previously have not been challenged in this manner. In some instances, government investigations that have in the past been conducted under the civil provisions of federal law may now be conducted as criminal investigations. 

&#160; 

Both federal and state government agencies have increased their focus on and coordination of civil and criminal enforcement efforts in the health care area. The OIG and the Department of Justice (&#147;DOJ&#148;) have, from time to time, established national enforcement initiatives, targeting all hospital providers that focus on specific billing practices or other suspected areas of abuse. The Health Reform Law includes additional federal funding of $350 million over 10 years to fight health care fraud, waste and abuse, including $30 million in federal fiscal year 2016. In addition, governmental agencies and their agents, such as MACs, fiscal intermediaries and carriers, may conduct audits of our health care operations. Private payers may conduct similar post-payment audits, and we also perform internal audits and monitoring. 

In addition to national enforcement initiatives, federal and state investigations have addressed a wide variety of routine health care operations such as: cost reporting and billing practices, including for Medicare outliers; financial arrangements with referral sources; physician recruitment activities; physician joint ventures; and hospital charges and collection practices for self-pay patients. We engage in many of these routine health care operations and other activities that could be the subject of governmental investigations or inquiries. For example, we have significant Medicare and Medicaid billings, numerous financial arrangements with physicians who are referral sources to our hospitals, and joint venture arrangements involving physician investors. Certain of our individual facilities have received, and other facilities may receive, government inquiries from, and may be subject to investigation by, federal and state agencies. Any additional investigations of the Company, our executives or managers could result in significant liabilities or penalties to us, as well as adverse publicity. 

Health Care Reform 

The Health Reform Law changes how health care services are covered, delivered and reimbursed through expanded coverage of uninsured individuals, reduced growth in Medicare program spending, reductions in Medicare and Medicaid DSH payments, and the establishment of programs that tie reimbursement to quality and integration. In addition, the law reforms certain aspects of health insurance, expands existing efforts to tie Medicare and Medicaid payments to performance and quality, and strengthens fraud and abuse enforcement. 

Expanded Coverage 

The Health Reform Law will expand coverage through a combination of public program expansion and private sector health insurance and other reforms. 

Medicaid Expansion 

The primary public program coverage expansion is occurring through changes in Medicaid, and to a lesser extent, expansion of the Children&#146;s Health Insurance Program (&#147;CHIP&#148;). The most significant changes expand the categories of individuals eligible for Medicaid coverage and permit individuals with relatively higher incomes to qualify. The Health Reform Law requires all state Medicaid programs to provide, and the federal government to subsidize, Medicaid coverage to virtually all adults under 65 years old with incomes at or under 133% of the FPL and to apply a &#147;5% income disregard&#148; to the eligibility standard, so that eligibility is effectively extended to those with incomes up to 138% of the FPL. However, states may opt out of the expansion without losing existing federal Medicaid funding. States that choose not to implement the Medicaid expansion are foregoing funding established by the Health Reform Law to cover most of the expansion costs. A number of states, including Texas and Florida, have chosen not to participate in the expanded Medicaid program, but these states could choose to implement the expansion at a later date. For states that do not participate, the maximum income level required for individuals and families to qualify for Medicaid varies widely from state to state. 

As Medicaid is a joint federal and state program, the federal government provides states with &#147;matching funds&#148; in a defined percentage, known as the federal medical assistance percentage (&#147;FMAP&#148;). Beginning in 2014, states began receiving an enhanced FMAP for the individuals enrolled in Medicaid pursuant to the Health Reform Law. The FMAP percentage is as follows: 100% for calendar years 2014 through 2016; 95% for 2017; 

&#160; 

94% in 2018; 93% in 2019; and 90% in 2020 and thereafter. CMS has indicated that states that only partially expand their Medicaid programs will not receive an enhanced FMAP. 

Pursuant to the Health Reform Law, the federal government subsidizes states that create non-Medicaid plans for residents whose incomes are greater than 133% of the FPL but do not exceed 200% of the FPL. Approved state plans are eligible to receive federal funding. The amount of that funding per individual is equal to 95% of subsidies that would have been provided for that individual had he or she enrolled in a health plan offered through one of the Exchanges, as discussed below. 

Historically, states often have attempted to reduce Medicaid spending by limiting benefits and tightening Medicaid eligibility requirements. However, for children, the Health Reform Law requires states to at least maintain Medicaid eligibility standards that were established prior to the enactment of the law until October 1, 2019. 

Private Sector Expansion 

The expansion of health coverage through the private sector as a result of the Health Reform Law occurs through new requirements applicable to health insurers, employers and individuals. Health insurers must keep their annual nonmedical costs lower than 15% of premium revenue for the group market and lower than 20% in the small group and individual markets or rebate to enrollees the amount spent in excess of the percentage. In addition, health insurers are not permitted to deny coverage to children based upon a pre-existing condition and must allow dependent care coverage for children up to 26 years old. Health insurers are prohibited from imposing annual coverage limits, dropping coverage, excluding persons based upon pre-existing conditions or denying coverage for any individual who is willing to pay the premiums for such coverage. 

Larger employers are subject to new requirements and incentives to provide health insurance benefits to their full time employees. Employers with 50 or more employees that do not offer health insurance will be subject to a penalty if an employee obtains government-subsidized coverage through an Exchange. The employer penalties range from $2,000 to $3,000 per employee, subject to certain thresholds and conditions. 

The Health Reform Law uses various means to induce individuals who do not have health insurance to obtain coverage. Individuals are required to maintain health insurance for a minimum defined set of benefits or pay a tax penalty. The penalty in most cases is the greater of $695 or 2.5% of income in 2016, and indexed to a cost of living adjustment in subsequent years. The Internal Revenue Service (&#147;IRS&#148;), in consultation with HHS, is responsible for enforcing the tax penalty, although the Health Reform Law limits the availability of certain IRS enforcement mechanisms. In addition, for individuals and families below 400% of the FPL, the cost of obtaining health insurance through the Exchanges is subsidized by the federal government. Those with lower incomes are eligible to receive greater subsidies. It is anticipated that those at the lowest income levels will have the majority of their premiums subsidized by the federal government, in some cases in excess of 95% of the premium amount. 

To facilitate the purchase of health insurance by individuals and small employers, the Health Reform Law mandated that each state establish or participate in an Exchange or default to a federally-operated Exchange by January 1, 2014. Health insurers participating in an Exchange must offer a set of minimum benefits, as defined by HHS, and may offer more benefits. Health insurers must offer at least two, and may offer up to five, levels of plans that vary by the percentage of medical expenses that must be paid by the enrollee. These levels are referred to as platinum, gold, silver, bronze and catastrophic plans, with gold and silver being the two mandatory levels of plans. Each level of plan must require the enrollee to share the following percentages of medical expenses up to the deductible/copayment limit: platinum, 10%; gold, 20%; silver, 30%; bronze, 40%; and catastrophic, 100%. Health insurers may establish varying deductible/copayment levels, up to the statutory maximum. The health insurers must cover 100% of the amount of medical expenses in excess of the deductible/copayment limit. 

&#160; 

Public Program Spending 

As discussed in Item 1, &#147;Business &#151; Sources of Revenue,&#148; the Health Reform Law provides for spending reductions for Medicare, Medicaid and other federal health care programs. It also increasingly ties payment for services to quality outcomes, provides for the creation of ACOs, and creates incentives and other initiatives to better coordinate patient care across settings and over time. 

Physician-Owned Hospital Limitations 

Over the last decade, we have faced competition from hospitals that have physician ownership. The Health Reform Law prohibits newly created physician-owned hospitals from billing for Medicare patients referred by their physician owners. As a result, the law effectively prevents the formation of new physician-owned hospitals that participate in Medicare and Medicaid after December 31, 2010. While the law grandfathers existing physician-owned hospitals, it does not allow these hospitals to increase the percentage of physician ownership and significantly restricts their ability to expand services. 

Program Integrity and Fraud and Abuse 

The Health Reform Law makes several significant changes to health care fraud and abuse laws, provides additional enforcement tools to the government, increases cooperation between agencies by establishing mechanisms for the sharing of information and enhances criminal and administrative penalties for non-compliance. For example, the Health Reform Law: (1) provides $350 million in increased federal funding over 10 years to fight health care fraud, waste and abuse; (2) expands the scope of the RAC program to include MA plans and Medicaid; (3) authorizes HHS, in consultation with the OIG, to suspend Medicare and Medicaid payments to a provider of services or a supplier &#147;pending an investigation of a credible allegation of fraud;&#148; (4) provides Medicare contractors with additional flexibility to conduct random prepayment reviews; and (5) tightens up the rules for returning overpayments made by governmental health programs and expands FCA liability to include failure to timely repay identified overpayments. 

Impact of Health Reform Law on the Company 

The expansion of health insurance coverage under the Health Reform Law may result in an increase in the number of patients using our facilities who have either private or public program coverage. In addition, the Health Reform Law provides for initiatives that create possible sources of additional revenue, such as ACOs. However, any positive effects of the Health Reform Law could be offset, and the Company could be significantly impacted, by reductions to the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Although the Health Reform Law has had a net positive effect on the Company to date, before considering the impact of Medicare reductions that began in 2010, substantial uncertainty remains regarding the ongoing net effect of the Health Reform Law on the Company because the resolution of a number of material factors remains unclear as discussed in Item 1A. &#147;Risk Factors&#148;. 

General Economic and Demographic Factors 

The health care industry is impacted by the overall United States economy. Budget deficits at federal, state and local government entities have had a negative impact on spending for many health and human service programs, including Medicare, Medicaid and similar programs, which represent significant payer sources for our hospitals. We anticipate that the federal deficit, the growing magnitude of Medicare expenditures and the aging of the United States population will continue to place pressure on federal health care programs. Other risks we face during periods of economic weakness and high unemployment include potential declines in the population covered under managed care agreements, increased patient decisions to postpone or cancel elective and nonemergency health care procedures, increases in the uninsured and underinsured populations, increased adoption of health plan structures that shift financial responsibility to patients and further difficulties in our collecting patient receivables for copayment and deductible amounts. The Health Reform Law seeks to decrease 

&#160; 

over time the number of uninsured individuals, but it is difficult to predict the full impact of the Health Reform Law. 

Compliance Program 

We maintain a comprehensive ethics and compliance program that is designed to meet or exceed applicable federal guidelines and industry standards. The program is intended to monitor and raise awareness of various regulatory issues among employees and to emphasize the importance of complying with governmental laws and regulations. As part of the ethics and compliance program, we provide annual ethics and compliance training to our employees and encourage all employees to report any violations to their supervisor, an ethics and compliance officer or a toll-free telephone ethics line. The Health Reform Law requires providers to implement core elements of compliance program criteria to be established by HHS, on a timeline to be established by HHS, as a condition of enrollment in the Medicare or Medicaid programs, and we may have to modify our compliance programs to comply with these new criteria. 

Antitrust Laws 

The federal government and most states have enacted antitrust laws that prohibit certain types of conduct deemed to be anti-competitive. These laws prohibit price fixing, market allocation, bid-rigging, concerted refusal to deal, market monopolization, price discrimination, tying arrangements, acquisitions of competitors and other practices that have, or may have, an adverse effect on competition. Violations of federal or state antitrust laws can result in various sanctions, including criminal and civil penalties. Antitrust enforcement in the health care industry is currently a priority of the Federal Trade Commission and the DOJ. We believe we are in compliance with such federal and state laws, but courts or regulatory authorities may reach a determination in the future that could adversely affect our operations. 

Environmental Matters 

We are subject to various federal, state and local statutes and ordinances regulating the discharge of materials into the environment. We do not believe that we will be required to expend any material amounts in order to comply with these laws and regulations. 

Insurance 

As is typical in the health care industry, we are subject to claims and legal actions by patients in the ordinary course of business. Subject, in most cases, to a $15 million per occurrence self-insured retention, our facilities are insured by our 100% owned insurance subsidiary for losses up to $50 million per occurrence. The insurance subsidiary has obtained reinsurance for professional liability risks generally above a retention level of $25 million per occurrence. We also maintain professional liability insurance with unrelated commercial carriers for losses in excess of amounts insured by our insurance subsidiary. 

We purchase, from unrelated insurance companies, coverage for cyber security incidents, directors and officers liability and property loss in amounts we believe are adequate. The cyber security and directors and officers liability coverage each include a $5 million corporate deductible. In addition, we will continue to purchase coverage for our directors and officers on an ongoing basis. The property coverage includes varying deductibles depending on the cause of the property damage. These deductibles range from $500,000 per claim up to 5% of the affected property values for certain flood and wind and earthquake related incidents. 

Employees and Medical Staffs 

At December 31, 2015, we had approximately 233,000 employees, including approximately 59,000 part-time employees. References herein to &#147;employees&#148; refer to employees of our affiliates. We are subject to various 

&#160; 

state and federal laws that regulate wages, hours, benefits and other terms and conditions relating to employment. At December 31, 2015, certain employees at 38 of our domestic hospitals are represented by various labor unions. While no elections are expected in 2016, it is possible additional hospitals may unionize in the future. We consider our employee relations to be good and have not experienced work stoppages that have materially, adversely affected our business or results of operations. Our hospitals, like most hospitals, have experienced rising labor costs. In some markets, nurse and medical support personnel availability has become a significant operating issue to health care providers. To address this challenge, we have implemented several initiatives to improve retention, recruiting, compensation programs and productivity. 

Our hospitals are staffed by licensed physicians, including both employed physicians and physicians who are not employees of our hospitals. Some physicians provide services in our hospitals under contracts, which generally describe a term of service, provide and establish the duties and obligations of such physicians, require the maintenance of certain performance criteria and fix compensation for such services. Any licensed physician may apply to be accepted to the medical staff of any of our hospitals, but the hospital&#146;s medical staff and the appropriate governing board of the hospital, in accordance with established credentialing criteria, must approve acceptance to the staff. Members of the medical staffs of our hospitals often also serve on the medical staffs of other hospitals and may terminate their affiliation with one of our hospitals at any time. 

We may be required to continue to enhance wages and benefits to recruit and retain nurses and other medical support personnel or to hire more expensive temporary or contract personnel. As a result, our labor costs could increase. We also depend on the available labor pool of semi-skilled and unskilled employees in each of the markets in which we operate. Certain proposed changes in federal labor laws and the National Labor Relations Board&#146;s (the &#147;NLRB&#148;) modification of its election procedures could increase the likelihood of employee unionization attempts. To the extent a significant portion of our employee base unionizes, our costs could increase materially. In addition, the states in which we operate could adopt mandatory nurse-staffing ratios or could reduce mandatory nurse-staffing ratios already in place. State-mandated nurse-staffing ratios could significantly affect labor costs, and have an adverse impact on revenues if we are required to limit patient admissions in order to meet the required ratios.
