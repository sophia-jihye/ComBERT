 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

&#160; 

Business Overview 

Rito Group Corp., a Nevada corporation (&#8220;the Company&#8221;) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on March 24, 2015. 

&#160; 

Rito Group Corp is a company that operates through its wholly owned subsidiary, Sino Union International Limited, a Company organized under the laws of the British Colony, Anguilla. It should be noted that our wholly owned subsidiary, Sino Union International Ltd. owns 100% of Rito International Enterprise Company Limited, a Hong Kong Company. 

At this time, we operate exclusively through our wholly owned subsidiary and share the same business plan of our subsidiary which is the sale of miscellaneous retail goods. Sino Union International Limited also shares the same business plan of Rito International Enterprise Company Limited. 

&#160; 

We are a development stage Company. Thus far the Company has been actively searching for companies that may be interested in listing their own products for sale on our &#8220;Rito Online Mall&#8221;, which is now still at the designing stage and is believed to be launched once the development is finalized. The Rito Online Mall provides a platform for merchants and customers to facilitate transactions and take advantage of the growth opportunity we have identified in Hong Kong&#8217;s E-Commerce Industry. 

&#160; 

The products Rito Online mall tends to include are handmade accessories, necklaces, watches, cookware, and numerous other products that we feel will be highly marketable to the population of Hong Kong in particular. Given the ever increasing competitive market we plan to operate in, Rito Group Corp feels that by utilizing the emerging E-Commerce business model known as Online to Offline (O2O) to give us a strategic advantage based around the shopping patterns of the average Hong Kong citizen. 

&#160; 

Rito Online Mall plans to feature products from many different retailers, disclosed in greater detail below. In order to generate revenue from the Rito Online Mall all of our members are required to pay a base membership fee. In order to list on our website vendors do not need to pay a membership or listing fee. And our members serve as our sales force and assist in selling the products listed by vendors on the Rito Online Mall. For members successful in selling products on the mall, they will have their names entered in as a reference and they will receive a commission on the sale of products. The membership fees and commissions have not been determined yet, and will be evaluated and implemented as our business continues to develop. 

&#160; 

Store-based retailing remains the preferred channel for most consumers in Hong Kong. This is possibly motivated by the sheer abundance of chain and independent retailers conveniently located around Hong Kong. In addition, within Hong Kong a significant part of the culture is to go from store to store and purchase goods as opposed to ordering them online. Citizens prefer to go to the store to look at goods versus simply ordering them online, order and wait. By finding what they are looking for on our online mall and being given the option to go to our physical location to view our display products (which will be identical to those offered at the store, but for display purposes only and not for sale) and see them before they order this will cater to the growing internet usage of the region while also keeping an important aspect of the culture intact. 

&#160; 

We currently have one physical location which has displayed pieces of the items available on our platform for consumers to look at and test prior to purchasing the products online. We have leased one retail store in Shenzhen, one of which opened in September 2015. The target demographic for this marketing strategy is primarily middle-class individuals of all ages who want to improve their quality of life. To that end the online shop will mainly list high quality products with international brand recognition. In the future, Rito plans to open numerous showrooms in Asia, not strictly limited to Hong Kong, so that we can reach an even larger market should our initial model within Hong Kong prove to be as successful as we project. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#160; 

&#160; 

The Company invested in the E-commerce Customers Relationship Management System, namely &#8220;U&#24800;-CRM U-Hui-CRM&#8221;, related to provide customer management, without limitation, all Intellectual Property Rights and Technical Information. This management system is owned by Rito Group Corp. At present, it should be noted that this management system is in the development stage, and while plans have been created for how this system will work and how it will be designed, it is not finalized and operational at this point in time. In the meantime, before this management system is finalized, the Company tends to use an existing payment method, which is Paypal, to help facilitate online business transactions payment. Nevertheless, &#8220;U&#24800;-CRM U-Hui-CRM&#8221; is still owned by the Company and will be used once this management system is finalized and ready for operation.

One sector consists of self-operated vendors modeled after Amazon and Groupon, including jd.com, meituan.com and the group buy channel of dianping.com. The second sector consists of third-party platform operators such tmall.com, which focuses on facilitating the sales of goods.

Our competitors also include industry, or content-specific, vertical websites whose information serves the same underlying industries as some of the products that are listed on our online Mall.
