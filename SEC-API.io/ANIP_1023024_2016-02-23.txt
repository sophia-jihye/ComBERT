 Item 1. Business 

&#160;

ANI Pharmaceuticals is an integrated specialty pharmaceutical company developing, manufacturing, and marketing branded and generic prescription pharmaceuticals. We focus on niche and high barrier to entry opportunities including controlled substances, anti-cancer (oncolytics), hormones and steroids, and complex formulations. We have two pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities located in Baudette, Minnesota, which are capable of producing oral solid dose products, as well as liquids and topicals, controlled substances, and potent products that must be manufactured in a fully-contained environment. Our strategy is to use our assets to develop, acquire, manufacture, and market branded and generic specialty prescription pharmaceuticals.

&#160;

On June 19, 2013, pursuant to a merger agreement dated as of April 12, 2013, ANIP Acquisition Company d/b/a ANI Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (&#34;ANIP&#34;) became a wholly-owned subsidiary of BioSante Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (&#8220;BioSante&#8221;) in an all-stock, tax-free reorganization (the &#34;Merger&#34;). The Merger was accounted for as a reverse acquisition, pursuant to which ANIP was considered the acquiring entity for accounting purposes. Since the Merger, we have been operating under the leadership of the ANIP management team and ANIP's historical results of operations have replaced BioSante's historical results of operations for all periods prior to the Merger. The results of operations of both companies are included in our consolidated financial statements for all periods after completion of the Merger.

&#160;

BioSante was a publicly-held pharmaceutical company focused on developing high value, medically-needed products. ANIP entered into the Merger to secure additional capital and gain access to capital market opportunities as a public company.

&#160;

In addition, in July 2013, our stockholders approved and we subsequently effected (i) a one-for-six reverse stock split of our common stock and class C special stock, with a proportional reduction in the number of authorized shares of our common stock, class C special stock and blank check preferred stock, and (ii) a change of name from &#8220;BioSante Pharmaceuticals, Inc.&#8221; to &#8220;ANI Pharmaceuticals, Inc.&#8221; Unless otherwise required by the context, references in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to the &#34;Company,&#34; &#34;we,&#34; us,&#34; and &#34;our&#34; refer to ANI Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a Delaware corporation formed in April 2001, formerly known as BioSante Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Our principal executive offices are located at 210 Main Street West, Baudette, Minnesota, 56623, our telephone number is (218) 634-3500, and our website address is www.anipharmaceuticals.com.

&#160;

Mission and Strategy 

&#160; 

We are an integrated specialty pharmaceutical company developing, manufacturing and marketing branded and generic prescription pharmaceuticals. We focus on niche and high barrier to entry opportunities including controlled substances, anti-cancer (oncolytics), hormones and steroids, and complex formulations. Our two facilities have a combined manufacturing, packaging and laboratory capacity totaling 173,000 square feet. The facilities are specialized with diverse capabilities, enabling us to manufacture liquid, powder, and oral solid-dose products, topicals, controlled substances, and products that must be manufactured in a fully contained environment. We also perform contract manufacturing for other pharmaceutical companies.

&#160;

In addition to laboratories that support the requirements of raw material, finished product, and stability testing, we have a 1,000 square foot pilot laboratory offering liquid, suspension and solid dose development capabilities. This pilot laboratory offers a full range of analytical capabilities including method development, validation and de-formulation, and is licensed by the Drug Enforcement Administration (&#8220;DEA&#8221;). Finally, a separate development suite located within our high-potency manufacturing facility offers additional capabilities for product development.

&#160;

Our strategy is to use our assets to develop, acquire, manufacture, and market branded and generic specialty prescription pharmaceuticals. By executing this strategy, we believe we will be able to continue to grow our business, expand and diversify our product portfolio, and create long-term value for our investors.

&#160;

2&#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

We believe our strategies effectively leverage our human and capital assets and will result in measurable growth of our business. Since 2011, we have successfully:

&#160;

&#183; Increased prescription product sales through a combination of market share gains on existing products and new product launches, including Methazolamide, Etodolac, Propafenone, Vancomycin, Oxycodone oral solution, Nimodipine, and Flecainide. &#183; Acquired the New Drug Applications (&#8220;NDA&#8221;) for and began marketing Reglan, Lithobid, and Vancocin. &#183; Filed six Abbreviated New Drug Applications (&#8220;ANDAs&#8221;). &#183; Increased our product pipeline, through development, partnership, and acquisition, to 85 total products. &#183; Closed a public offering of common stock, netting $46.7 million. &#183; Closed a public offering of $143.8 million of convertible debt, with simultaneous bond hedge and warrant transactions. 

&#183; Acquired NDAs for Testosterone 1% Gel, Corticotropin, and Corticotropin-Zinc. &#160;

We believe that our cash resources and forecasted cash flows from operations will be sufficient to enable us to meet our operational needs for the foreseeable future.

&#160; 

Product Development Considerations 

&#160;

We consider a variety of criteria in determining which products to develop or acquire, all of which relate to the level of potential competition and expected profitability upon product launch. These criteria include:

&#160;

&#183; Formulation Complexity. Our development and manufacturing capabilities enable us to manufacture pharmaceuticals that are difficult to produce, including highly potent, extended release, combination, and low dosage products. This ability to manufacture a variety of complex products is a competitive strength that we intend to leverage in selecting products to develop or manufacture. &#183; Patent Status. We seek to develop products whose branded bioequivalents do not have long-term patent protection or existing patent challenges. &#183; Market Size. When determining whether to develop or acquire an individual product, we review the current and expected market size for that product at launch, as well as forecasted price erosion upon conversion from branded to generic pricing. We endeavor to manufacture products with sufficient market size to enable us to enter the market with a strong likelihood of being able to price our products both competitively and at a profit. &#183; Profit Potential. We research the availability and cost of active pharmaceutical ingredients in determining which products to develop or acquire. In determining the potential profit of a product, we forecast our anticipated market share, pricing, including expected price erosion caused by competition from other generic manufacturers, and the estimated cost of manufacturing. &#183; Manufacturing. We generally seek to develop and manufacture products at our own manufacturing plants in order to optimize the utilization of our facilities, ensure quality control in our products, and maximize profit potential. &#183; Competition. When determining whether to develop or acquire a product, we research existing and expected competition. We seek to develop products for which we can obtain sufficient market share, and may decline to develop a product if we anticipate significant competition. Our specialized manufacturing facilities provide a means of entering niche markets, such as hormone therapies, in which fewer generic companies are able to compete. &#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

Products and Markets 

&#160; 

Products 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, our products include both branded and generic pharmaceuticals, specifically:

&#160;

Generic Products &#160; Branded Products Esterified Estrogen with Methyltestosterone &#160; Cortenema Etodolac &#160; Lithobid Flecainide &#160; Reglan Fluvoxamine &#160; Vancocin Hydrocortisone Enema &#160; &#160; Methazolamide &#160; &#160; Metoclopramide Syrup &#160; &#160; Nimodipine &#160; &#160; Opium Tincture &#160; &#160; Oxycodone Oral Solution &#160; &#160; Propafenone &#160; &#160; Vancomycin &#160; &#160; &#160;

Esterified Estrogen with Methyltestosterone (&#8220;EEMT&#8221;) is used to treat moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms of menopause that are not improved by estrogen alone. For the year ended December 31, 2015, EEMT comprised 51% of our net sales, versus 42% of net sales in 2014 and 33% of net sales in 2013.

&#160;

Etodolac is used to treat mild to moderate pain caused by osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis, as well as other conditions.

&#160;

Flecainide is used to treat arrhythmia (irregular heartbeat) in patients and to help patients maintain a normal heart rate.

&#160;

Fluvoxamine is used to treat patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder and social anxiety disorder. It is generally used when the patient&#8217;s symptoms interfere with the patient&#8217;s ability to function socially and occupationally.

&#160;

Hydrocortisone Enema and its branded equivalent, Cortenema, are used for the treatment of ulcerative colitis, especially distal forms, including ulcerative proctitis, ulcerative proctosigmoiditis, and left-sided ulcerative colitis. The products have also proved useful in some cases involving the transverse and ascending colons.

&#160;

Methazolamide is indicated in the treatment of ocular conditions where lowering intraocular pressure is likely to be of therapeutic benefit, such as chronic open-angle glaucoma, secondary glaucoma, and preoperatively in acute angle-closure glaucoma where lowering the intraocular pressure is desired before surgery.

&#160;

Metoclopramide and its branded equivalent, Reglan, are prescribed for periods of four to twelve weeks in adults with symptomatic, documented gastroesophageal reflux who fail to respond to conventional therapy. The products relieve daytime heartburn and heartburn after meals and also help ulcers in the esophagus to heal. The products also relieve symptoms associated with acute and recurrent diabetic gastric stasis and help treat symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, heartburn, feeling full long after a meal, and loss of appetite.

&#160;

Nimodipine is used to improve neurological outcomes by reducing the incidence and severity of ischemic deficits in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage from ruptured brain aneurysms.

&#160;

Opium Tincture is used is to treat diarrhea in adults by slowing the movement of the intestines and decreasing the number and frequency of bowel movements.

&#160;

Oxycodone oral solution is used to relieve acute moderate to severe pain and chronic pain.

&#160;

Propafenone is used to treat arrhythmia (irregular heartbeat) in patients and to help patients maintain a normal heart rate.

&#160;

4&#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

Lithobid is indicated in the treatment of manic episodes of bipolar disorder. Lithobid is also indicated as a maintenance treatment for individuals with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder. Maintenance therapy reduces the frequency and intensity of manic episodes.

&#160;

Vancomycin and its branded equivalent, Vancocin, are indicated for the treatment of C. difficile-associated diarrhea, as well as enterocolitis caused by staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant strains). The capsules are not effective for other types of infections, as the drugs are not systematically absorbed.

&#160;

Markets 

&#160;

In determining which products to pursue for development, we target products that are complex to manufacture and therefore have higher barriers to entry. These factors provide opportunities for growth, utilizing our competitive strengths at the same time that they decrease the number of potential competitors in the markets for these products. These markets currently include controlled substances, oncolytics, hormones and steroids, and complex formulations, including extended release and combination products.

&#160;

Controlled Substances 

&#160;

One of our manufacturing facilities in Baudette, Minnesota is licensed by the DEA for the manufacture and distribution of Schedule II controlled substances, which are drugs considered to have a high abuse risk but that also have safe and accepted medical uses. In addition to our existing pipeline of four ANDAs, we have identified additional product development opportunities in this market.

&#160;

Oncolytics 

&#160;

Due to the capabilities of our containment facility and our expertise in manufacturing segregation, we are focused on developing and manufacturing niche oncolytic (anti-cancer) drugs. In particular, we are targeting products subject to priority review by the FDA, more specifically those with no blocking patents and no generic competition. We filed an ANDA for an anti-cancer drug with the FDA in 2014, and have received a Target Action Date of February 26, 2016, per FDA communications.

&#160;

Hormone and Steroid Drugs 

&#160;

The market for hormone and steroid drugs includes hormone therapy to alleviate menopausal symptoms in women, contraceptives, testosterone replacement therapies for men, and therapies for treating hormone-sensitive cancers. 

&#160;

Hormone Therapy (&#8220;HT&#8221;) has been an accepted medical treatment for alleviating the symptoms of menopause since the 1930s, with formal FDA approval for that use granted in 1942. Initially, HT consisted of estrogen only, but has evolved to include combination therapies of estrogen, progesterone and androgens. We target niche products in the HT and steroid product market for several reasons, including:

&#160;

&#183; Hormone and steroid products are a core competency based on our manufacturing and product development teams' long history of manufacturing these types of products; and &#183; The aging baby boom population, of which women represent a majority, is expected to support continued growth in the HT market. &#160; 

Complex Formulations 

&#160;

Our manufacturing facilities can be used to manufacture complex formulations, including, but not limited to, extended release and combination products, which have higher barriers to entry and, therefore, fewer competitors. In addition to our two products currently on the market, our pipeline includes five extended-release products and six combination products.

&#160;

5&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

Contract Manufacturing 

&#160;

We manufacture pharmaceutical products for several branded and generic companies, who outsource production in order to:

&#160;

&#183; Free-up internal resources to focus on sales and marketing as well as research and development; &#183; Employ internal capacity to manufacture higher volume or more critical products; and &#183; Utilize our specialized equipment and expertise. &#160;

Given our specialized manufacturing capabilities, we are focused on attracting niche contract manufacturing opportunities that offer high margins.

&#160;

Manufacturing, Suppliers, and Raw Materials 

&#160;

We require a supply of quality raw materials, including active pharmaceutical ingredients (&#8220;API&#8221;), and components to manufacture and package our pharmaceutical products. In order to manufacture Opium Tincture and Oxycodone oral solution, we must submit a request to the DEA for a quota to purchase the amount of opium and oxycodone needed to manufacture the respective products. Without approved quotas from the DEA, we would not be able to purchase these ingredients from our suppliers.

&#160;

We source the raw materials for our products from both domestic and international suppliers that we select on the basis of their quality, reliability of supply, and long-term financial stability. Generally, we qualify only a single source of API for use in each product due to the cost and time required to validate and qualify a second source of supply. Any change in one of our API suppliers must usually be approved through a Prior Approval Supplement (&#8220;PAS&#8221;) by the FDA. Certain of our APIs for our drug products, including those that are marketed without approved NDAs or ANDAs, such as EEMT, are sourced from international suppliers. From time to time, we have experienced temporary disruptions in the supply of certain of such imported API due to FDA inspections.

&#160; 

Government Regulation 

&#160; 

The pharmaceutical industry is highly regulated by multiple U.S. government agencies, such as the FDA, the DEA, and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (&#8220;CMS&#8221;). As a result, we are subject to extensive and complex rules and regulations, which are subject to revision from time to time. While we have experience with these regulations, there can be no assurance that we will be able to fully comply with all applicable regulations.

&#160; 

Branded and Generic Pharmaceutical Products 

&#160;

All prescription pharmaceutical products, whether branded or generic, must be approved by the FDA. All applications for FDA approval must contain information relating to product formulation, raw material suppliers, stability, manufacturing processes, packaging, labeling and quality control. Information to support the bioequivalence of generic drug products or the safety and effectiveness of new drug products for their intended use is also required to be submitted. There are generally two types of applications used for obtaining FDA approval of new products:

&#160;

New Drug Application (&#8220;NDA&#8221;) &#8212;An NDA is filed when approval is sought to market a newly developed branded product and, in certain instances, for a new dosage form, a new delivery system, or a new indication for an approved drug. We market Cortenema, generic Hydrocortisone Enema, Lithobid, generic Fluvoxamine, Reglan, Vancocin, and generic Vancomycin under approved NDAs.

&#160;

Abbreviated New Drug Application (&#8220;ANDA&#8221;) &#8212;An ANDA is filed when approval is sought to market a generic equivalent of a drug approved under an NDA. We market Etodolac, Flecainide, Methazolamide, Metoclopramide, Nimodipine, Oxycodone oral solution, and Propafenone under approved ANDAs.

&#160;

The ANDA development process is generally less time-consuming and less complex than the NDA development process. It typically does not require new preclinical and clinical studies, because it relies on the studies establishing safety and efficacy conducted for the branded drug approved through the NDA process. The ANDA process, however, typically requires one or more bioequivalence studies to show that the ANDA drug is bioequivalent to the previously approved reference listed drug (&#8220;RLD&#8221;).

&#160;

6&#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (the &#8220;Hatch-Waxman Act&#8221;) provides that generic drugs may enter the market after the approval of an ANDA, which requires (1) that bioequivalence to the branded product be demonstrated through clinical studies, and (2) either the expiration, invalidation or circumvention of any patents or the end of any other relevant market exclusivity periods related to the branded drug.

&#160;

Accordingly, generic products generally provide a safe, effective, and cost-efficient alternative to users of branded products. Growth in the generic pharmaceutical industry has been driven by the increased market acceptance of generic drugs, as well as the number of branded drugs for which patent terms and/or other market exclusivities have expired.

&#160;

Generic products are generally commercialized after the expiration of patent protection for the branded product and after the end of a period of non-patent market exclusivity. In addition to patent exclusivity, the holder of the NDA may be entitled to a period of non-patent market exclusivity, during which the FDA cannot approve an application for a generic product. Also, if the NDA is a new chemical entity (&#8220;NCE&#8221;), the FDA may not approve an ANDA for a generic product for up to five years following approval of the NDA for the NCE. If an NDA is not an NCE, but the holder of the NDA conducted clinical trials essential to approval of the NDA or a supplement thereto, the FDA may not approve a generic equivalent to the NDA for three years. Certain other periods of exclusivity may be available if the branded drug is indicated for treatment of a rare disease or is studied for pediatric indications.

&#160;

In order to obtain FDA approval of NDAs and ANDAs, our manufacturing procedures and operations must conform to FDA requirements and guidelines, generally referred to as &#8220;cGMP.&#8221; The requirements for FDA approval encompass all aspects of the production process, including validation and recordkeeping, the standards around which are continuously changing and evolving. As a result, we must consistently monitor and comply with these changes.

&#160;

Our facilities, procedures, operations and testing of products are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA, the DEA, and other authorities. In addition, the FDA conducts pre-approval and post-approval reviews and plant inspections to determine whether our systems and processes are in compliance with cGMP and other FDA regulations. Our suppliers are subject to similar regulations and periodic inspections.

&#160;

Controlled Substances 

&#160;

The DEA regulates certain drug products containing controlled substances, pursuant to the U.S. Controlled Substances Act (&#8220;CSA&#8221;). Opium, which is a significant component of our Opium Tincture product, is classified as a controlled substance. Oxycodone, a significant component of our Oxycodone oral solution product, is also classified as a controlled substance. CSA and DEA regulations impose specific requirements on manufacturers and other entities that handle these substances including registration, recordkeeping, reporting, storage, security, and distribution. Recordkeeping requirements include accounting for the amount of product received, manufactured, stored, and distributed. Companies handling controlled substances also are required to maintain adequate security and to report suspicious orders, thefts, and significant losses. The DEA periodically inspects facilities for compliance with the CSA and its regulations. Failure to comply with current and future regulations of the DEA could lead to a variety of sanctions, including revocation or denial of renewal of DEA registrations, injunctions, or civil or criminal penalties.

&#160;

In addition, we must submit a request to the DEA for a quota to purchase the amount of opium and oxycodone we need to manufacture Opium Tincture and Oxycodone oral solution. Without approved quotas from the DEA, we would not be able to purchase these ingredients from our suppliers. As a result, we are dependent upon the DEA to approve quotas large enough to support our continued manufacture of Opium Tincture and Oxycodone oral solution.

&#160;

Unapproved Products 

&#160; 

Two of our products, EEMT and Opium Tincture, are marketed without approved NDAs or ANDAs. The FDA's policy with respect to the continued marketing of unapproved products appears in the FDA's September 2011 Compliance Policy Guide Sec. 440.100 titled &#34;Marketed New Drugs without Approved NDAs or ANDAs.&#34; Under this policy, the FDA has stated that it will follow a risk-based approach with regard to enforcement against marketing of unapproved products. The FDA evaluates whether to initiate enforcement action on a case-by-case basis, but gives higher priority to enforcement action against products in certain categories, such as those with potential safety risks or that lack evidence of effectiveness. While we believe that, so long as we comply with applicable manufacturing standards, the FDA will not take action against us under the current enforcement policy, we can offer no assurances that the FDA will continue this policy or not take a contrary position with any individual product or group of products.

&#160; 

7&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

Medicaid/Medicare 

&#160;

Medicaid and Medicare, both of which are U.S. federal health care programs administered by CMS, are major purchasers of pharmaceutical products, including those we produce.

&#160;

Medicaid is administered by the states and jointly funded by the federal and state governments. Its focus is on low income populations. State drug coverage policies under Medicaid may vary significantly state by state. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (&#8220;PPACA&#8221;), as amended by the Health Care and Education and Reconciliation Act of 2010, together known as the Affordable Care Act (&#34;ACA&#34;), required states to expand their Medicaid programs to individuals with incomes up to 138% of the federal poverty level. Although the United States Supreme Court in 2011 made the Medicaid expansion optional, many states are expanding their Medicaid programs. This expansion of Medicaid coverage may increase usage of pharmaceutical products.

&#160;

The ACA also made changes to Medicaid law that could negatively impact us. In particular, pharmaceutical manufacturers must enter into rebate agreements with state Medicaid agencies, which require manufacturers to pay rebates based on their drugs dispensed to Medicaid beneficiaries. The ACA raised the rebate percentages for both generic and branded pharmaceuticals effective January 1, 2010. The required rebate is currently 13% of the average manufacturer price for sales of Medicaid-reimbursed products marketed under ANDAs. Sales of Medicaid-reimbursed products marketed under NDAs require manufacturers to rebate the greater of 23.1% of the average manufacturer price or the difference between the average manufacturer price and the &#34;best price&#34; (as defined in the Medicaid statute) during a specific period. Federal and/or state governments may continue to enact measures aimed at reducing the cost of drugs to the Medicaid program.

&#160;

Medicare is run by the federal government and is largely focused on the elderly and disabled. The Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 (&#8220;MMA&#8221;) created Medicare Part D to provide prescription drug coverage for Medicare beneficiaries. The MMA has increased usage of pharmaceuticals, a trend that we believe will continue to benefit the generic pharmaceutical industry. The ACA made some changes to Part D to make it easier for Medicare beneficiaries to obtain drugs, such as reducing coinsurance amounts. The ACA also required pharmaceutical companies to provide discounts to Medicare Part D beneficiaries for the cost of branded prescription drugs. Under the Medicare Coverage Gap Discount Program authorized by the ACA, any pharmaceutical product marketed under an NDA, regardless of whether the product is marketed as a &#34;generic,&#34; is subject to the discount requirement. Our Hydrocortisone Enema, Fluvoxamine, and Vancomycin products, while marketed as &#34;generics,&#34; are marketed under approved NDAs and, therefore, are subject to the discount requirement. While we may benefit from Medicare changes that have reduced obstacles to drug usage, resulting sales increases, if any, may be offset by existing and future legislative efforts to curb the cost of drugs to the Medicare program.

&#160;

Most of our products are covered by Medicaid and Medicare. Our reporting and payment obligations under the Medicaid rebate program and other governmental purchasing and rebate programs are complex and may involve subjective decisions. Any determination that we have failed to comply with those obligations could subject us to penalties and sanctions, and we could be subject to federal or state false claims litigation.

&#160;

Research and Development 

&#160;

We develop new generic products through a combination of internal development and fee-for-service arrangements with other firms. Additionally, we license and co-develop products through collaborations with other companies as noted below. During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, our research and development expenses were $2.9 million, $2.7 million, and $1.7 million, respectively.

&#160;

IDT Australia Limited 

&#160; 

In August 2015, we entered into a distribution agreement with IDT Australia Limited (&#8220;IDT&#8221;) to market several products in the U.S. (the &#8220;IDT Agreement&#8221;). The products, all of which are approved ANDAs, require various FDA filings and approvals prior to commercialization. In general, IDT will be responsible for regulatory submissions to the FDA and the manufacturing of certain products. We made an upfront payment to IDT of $1.0 million and will make additional milestone payments upon FDA approval for commercialization of certain products. Upon approval, IDT will manufacture some of the products and we will manufacture the other products. We will market and distribute all the products under our label in the United States, remitting a percentage of profits from sales of the drugs to IDT. The $1.0 million upfront payment was recorded as a marketing and distribution rights intangible asset and will be amortized in full over its seven-year useful life.

&#160;

8&#160;

&#160;

In April 2014, we entered into a second collaboration agreement with Sofgen to develop an oral soft gel prescription product (the &#34;April 2014 Sofgen Agreement&#34;). The product will also be subject to an ANDA filing once developed. In general, Sofgen will be responsible for the development, manufacturing and regulatory submission of the product, including preparation of the ANDA, and we will make payments based on the completion of certain milestones. Upon approval, Sofgen will manufacture the drug and we will be market and distribute the product under our label in the United States, remitting a percentage of profits from sales of the drug to Sofgen.

&#160;

Under the April 2014 Sofgen Agreement, Sofgen will own all the rights, title and interest in the product. During the term, both parties are prohibited from developing, selling or distributing any product in the United States that is identical or bioequivalent to the product covered under the agreement. The agreement can be terminated or amended under certain specified circumstances. The agreement&#8217;s initial term is ten years from the launch of the product, which term will automatically renew for two year terms until either party terminates the agreement.

&#160;

RiconPharma LLC 

&#160;

In July 2011, we entered into a collaborative arrangement with RiconPharma LLC (&#8220;RiconPharma&#8221;). Under the parties' master product development and collaboration agreement (the &#8220;RiconPharma Agreement&#8221;), we and RiconPharma have agreed to collaborate in a cost, asset and profit sharing arrangement for the development, manufacturing, regulatory approval and marketing of pharmaceutical products in the United States.

&#160;

In general, RiconPharma is responsible for developing the products and we are responsible for manufacturing, sales, marketing and distribution of the products. The parties are jointly responsible for directing any bioequivalence studies. We are responsible for obtaining and maintaining all necessary regulatory approvals, including the preparation of all ANDAs.

&#160;

9&#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

Under the RiconPharma Agreement and unless otherwise specified in an amendment, the parties will own equally all the rights, title and interest in the products. To the extent permitted by applicable law, we will be identified on the product packaging as the manufacturer and distributor of the product. During the term, both parties are prohibited from developing, manufacturing, selling or distributing any products that are identical or bioequivalent to products covered under the agreement. The agreement may be terminated or amended under certain specified circumstances.

&#160;

Patents, Trademarks, and Licenses 

&#160;

We own the trademark names for each of our branded products, Cortenema, Cortrophin, Cortrophin-Zinc, Lithobid, Reglan, and Vancocin. Generally, the branded pharmaceutical business relies upon patent protection to ensure market exclusivity for the life of the patent. We do not own or license any patents associated with these products. Further, patent protection and market exclusivity for these branded products have expired. Therefore, we consider the trademark names to be of material value and we act to protect these rights from infringement. However, our business is not dependent upon any single trademark. Trademark protection continues in some countries as long as used; in other countries, as long as registered. Registration is for fixed terms and may be renewed indefinitely. We believe that sales of our branded products have benefited and will continue to benefit from the value of the product name.

&#160;

We have licensed the right to manufacture and market Fluvoxamine Maleate, an authorized generic version of Luvox &#174; IR, from Jazz Pharmaceuticals, which in turn acquired the rights to Luvox &#174; IR from Solvay Pharmaceuticals, Inc. This license is in addition to a manufacturing and supply agreement with Jazz Pharmaceuticals, under which we manufacture and supply Jazz Pharmaceuticals' requirements for Luvox &#174; IR. Under the license agreement, Jazz Pharmaceuticals transferred responsibility for the related NDA to us. The license agreement may be terminated by Jazz Pharmaceuticals if the Solvay license agreement is terminated, if we breach or default in the performance or observance of any material provisions of the agreement or the related supply agreement and such breach or default is not cured within 60 days after written notice is received, in the case of voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy filings by/against us, if we do not make royalty payments when due, or in the event we receive an adverse finding letter from the FDA relating to the NDA and is either not able to cure or provide evidence of a reasonable plan to cure within 30 days of receipt of such adverse finding letter, among other events. We may terminate the agreement with the consent of Jazz Pharmaceuticals, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld.

&#160;

Customers 

&#160; 

Our customers purchase and distribute our products. Our products are sold by four major retail pharmacy chains: Walgreens, CVS, RiteAid and Wal-Mart, and are included in the source programs of four major national wholesalers: Cardinal, McKesson, AmerisourceBergen and Morris Dickson. In addition, our customers include national mail order houses, including Anda, ExpressScripts, and Omnicare, as well as group purchasing organizations.

&#160;

In recent years, the wholesale distributor network for pharmaceutical products has been subject to increasing consolidation, which has increased the concentration of our wholesale customers. In addition, the number of retail market chains and, in particular, the number of independent drug stores and small chains, has decreased as retail consolidation has occurred, also increasing the concentration of our retail customers. As a result of this trend toward consolidation, a smaller number of companies each control a larger share of pharmaceutical distribution channels. For the year ended December 31, 2015, approximately 64% of our net revenues were attributable to three wholesalers: McKesson Corporation (26%), Cardinal Health, Inc. (20%), and AmerisourceBergen Corporation (18%). For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, AmerisourceBergen Corporation, McKesson Corporation, and Cardinal Health, Inc. accounted for approximately 69% and 55% of our net revenues, respectively. In addition, as noted below, our customers also distribute our products. The loss of any of these customers, including in their role as distributors, could have a material adverse effect on our business.

&#160;

Due to a strategic partnership between Amerisource Bergen and Walgreens established in 2014, Amerisource Bergen has begun handling product distribution for Walgreens. Due to this and other strategic partnerships between wholesalers and pharmacy chains, we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, increases in net sales to the wholesalers, with corresponding decreases in net sales to the pharmacy chains.

&#160;

Consistent with industry practice, we maintain a return policy that allows customers to return product within a specified period prior to and subsequent to the expiration date. Generally, product may be returned for a period beginning six months prior to its expiration date to up to one year after its expiration date. See &#34;Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition&#8212;Critical Accounting Estimates&#34; for a discussion of our accruals for chargebacks, rebates, returns, and other allowances.

Sales, Marketing, and Distribution 

&#160;

We market, sell, and distribute our products in the United States. Our products are distributed through the following channels:

&#160;

&#183; Wholesalers. We have contracts with four major wholesalers in the United States: Cardinal, McKesson, AmerisourceBergen, and Morris Dickson, as well as access to their respective retail source programs. &#183; Retail Market Chains. We conduct business with four major retail chains in the United States: Walgreens, CVS, RiteAid, and Wal-Mart. &#183; Distributors and Mail Order Pharmacies. We have contracts with several major distributors and mail order pharmacies in the United States, including Anda, ExpressScripts, and Omnicare. &#183; Group Purchasing Organizations. We have contracts with group purchasing organizations in the United States, such as Premiere, MedAssets, Minnesota Multi-State, and the Federal Supply Schedule (&#8220;FSS&#8221;). &#160;

Competition 

&#160;

Our products face limited competition due to complexities in formulation, active pharmaceutical ingredient sourcing, materials handling and manufacturing, and regulatory hurdles. Nevertheless, we compete with numerous other pharmaceutical companies, including large, global pharmaceutical manufacturers capable of addressing these complexities and hurdles with respect to products that we currently produce and products that are in our pipeline. In addition, our products are subject to competition from other generic products and non-prescription alternative therapies.

&#160;

Our branded pharmaceutical products currently face competition from generic products and may continue to face competition from generic products in the future. In order to launch a generic product, a manufacturer must apply to the FDA for an ANDA showing that the generic product is therapeutically equivalent to the RLD. (See &#8220;Government Regulation.&#8221;)

&#160;

The primary means of competition among generic drug manufacturers are pricing, contract terms, service levels, and reliability. To compete effectively, we seek to consistently produce high-quality, reliable, and effective products. We also establish active working relationships with each of our customers, continually gather important market information in order to respond successfully to requests for proposals, maintain sufficient inventories to assure high service levels, and work to reduce product costs by sourcing and qualifying alternative suppliers whenever possible.

&#160;

Our sales can be impacted by new studies that indicate that a competitor's product has greater efficacy than one of our products. If competitors introduce new products with therapeutic or cost advantages, our products can be subject to progressive price reductions and/or decreased volume of sales.

&#160;

Principal competitors for the pharmaceutical market in which we do business include Amneal Pharmaceuticals, Creekwood Pharmaceuticals, Endo Pharmaceuticals, Glenmark Pharmaceuticals, Lannett, Mallinckrodt, Mylan, Par Pharmaceutical Companies, Purdue Pharma, Roxane Laboratories, Sandoz, Teva Pharmaceuticals, USA, and Watson Pharmaceuticals.

&#160;

Pharmaceutical Industry Trends 

&#160; 

In recent years, the pharmaceutical industry has experienced significant consolidation, particularly in distribution channels and amongst generic and brand drug companies.

&#160;

The wholesale distributor network for pharmaceutical products has been subject to increasing consolidation, which has increased the concentration of our wholesale customers. In addition, the number of retail market chains and, in particular, the number of independent drug stores and small chains, has decreased as retail consolidation has occurred, also increasing the concentration of our retail customers. As a result of this trend toward consolidation, a smaller number of companies each control a larger share of pharmaceutical distribution channels.

&#160;

In addition, consolidation amongst pharmaceutical companies has created opportunities by reducing the number of competitors. However, as competitors grow larger through consolidation, so do their resources. Larger competitors may be able to aggressively decrease prices in order to gain market share on certain products and may have resources that would allow them to more effectively market their products to potential customers.

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

Product Liability 

&#160;

Product liability litigation represents an inherent risk to all firms in the pharmaceutical industry. We utilize traditional third-party insurance policies with regard to our product liability claims. Such insurance coverage at any given time reflects current market conditions, including cost and availability, when the policy is written.

&#160;

All manufacturers of the drug Reglan and its generic equivalent metoclopramide, including ANI, are facing allegations from plaintiffs in various states, including California, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania, claiming bodily injuries as a result of ingestion of metoclopramide or its brand name, Reglan, prior to the FDA's February 2009 Black Box warning requirement. In August 2012, we were dismissed with prejudice from all New Jersey cases. We consider our exposure to this litigation to be limited due to several factors: (1) the only generic metoclopramide that we manufactured prior to the implementation of the FDA's warning requirement was an oral solution introduced after May 28, 2008; (2) our market share for the oral solution was a very small portion of the overall metoclopramide market; and (3) once we received a request for change of labeling from the FDA, we submitted our proposed changes within 30 days, and such changes were subsequently approved by the FDA.

&#160;

At the present time, we are unable to assess the likely outcome of the cases in the remaining states. Our insurance company has assumed the defense of this matter. We cannot provide assurances that the outcome of these matters will not have an adverse effect on our business, financial position, and operating results. Furthermore, like all pharmaceutical manufacturers, we may be exposed to other product liability claims in the future, which could limit our coverage under future insurance policies or cause those policies to become more expensive, which could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.

&#160; 

Backlog 

&#160;

We had a backlog of $0.5 million, $1.2 million, and $2.1 million at December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively, relating to contract manufacturing purchase orders from customers.

&#160;

Employees 

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015 our workforce included 108 full-time employees.

&#160; 

Seasonality of Business 

&#160; 

We do not believe our business is subject to seasonality. However, our business can be affected by the business practices of our business partners. To the extent that the availability of inventory or materials from or development practices of our partners is seasonal, our sales may be subject to fluctuations quarter to quarter or year to year.

&#160;

Segment Information 

&#160;

We operate in one segment and all our operations are in the United States. Total revenues from external customers for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 were $76.3 million, $56.0 million, and $30.1 million, respectively. Net income for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 was $15.4 million, $28.7 million, and $0.3 million, respectively. Total assets at December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 were $285.3 million, $259.6 million, and $44.5 million, respectively.
