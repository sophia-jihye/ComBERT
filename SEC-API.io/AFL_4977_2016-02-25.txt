General Description 

Aflac Incorporated (the Parent Company) was incorporated in 1973 under the laws of the state of Georgia. Aflac Incorporated is a general business holding company and acts as a management company, overseeing the operations of its subsidiaries by providing management services and making capital available. Its principal business is supplemental health and life insurance, which is marketed and administered through its subsidiary, American Family Life Assurance Company of Columbus (Aflac), which operates in the United States (Aflac U.S.) and as a branch in Japan (Aflac Japan). Most of Aflac's policies are individually underwritten and marketed through independent agents. Aflac U.S. markets and administers group products through Continental American Insurance Company (CAIC), branded as Aflac Group Insurance. Our insurance operations in the United States and our branch in Japan service the two markets for our insurance business. 

Aflac offers voluntary insurance policies in Japan and the United States that provide a layer of financial protection against income and asset loss. We continue to diversify our product offerings in both Japan and the United States. Aflac Japan sells voluntary supplemental insurance products, including cancer plans, general medical indemnity plans, medical/sickness riders, care plans, living benefit life plans, ordinary life insurance plans and annuities. Aflac U.S. sells voluntary supplemental insurance products including products designed to protect individuals from depletion of assets (accident, cancer, critical illness/ care, hospital intensive care, hospital indemnity, fixed-benefit dental, and vision care plans) and loss-of-income products (life and short-term disability plans). 

We are authorized to conduct insurance business in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, several U.S. territories and Japan. Aflac Japan's revenues, including realized gains and losses on its investment portfolio, accounted for 70% &#32;of the Company's total revenues in 2015 , compared with 72% &#32;in 2014 &#32;and 74% &#32;in 2013 . The percentage of the Company's total assets attributable to Aflac Japan was 83% &#32;at December 31, 2015 , compared with 82% &#32;at December 31, 2014 .

Insurance Products - Japan 

Aflac Japan's insurance products are designed to help consumers pay for medical and nonmedical costs that are not reimbursed under Japan's national health insurance system. Changes in Japan's economy and an aging population have put increasing pressure on Japan's national health care system. As a result, more costs are being shifted to Japanese 

consumers, who in turn have become increasingly interested in insurance products that help them manage those costs. Aflac Japan has responded to this consumer need by enhancing existing products and developing new products. 

Aflac Japan's product portfolio has expanded beyond traditional health-related products to include more life products. Some of the life products that we offer in Japan provide death benefits and cash surrender values. These products are available as stand-alone policies and riders. Some plans, such as our WAYS product, have features that allow policyholders to convert a portion of their life insurance to medical, nursing care, or fixed annuity benefits at a predetermined age. Our child endowment product offers a death benefit until a child reaches age 18. It also pays a lump-sum benefit at the time of the child's entry into high school, as well as an educational annuity for each of the four years during his or her college education. We believe that life insurance (first sector product) provides further opportunities for us to sell our cancer and medical insurance (third sector products) through cross-selling opportunities. 

In early 2002, we introduced EVER, a stand-alone, whole-life medical product which offers a basic level of hospitalization coverage with an affordable premium. Since its initial introduction, we have expanded our suite of EVER product offerings to appeal to specific types of Japanese consumers and achieve greater market penetration. The most recent upgrade to our EVER product, released in June 2015, included riders to be associated with three critical illnesses (cancer, stroke and heart attack) to better respond to consumer&#8217;s needs for coverage of serious illnesses. These riders provide policyholders with a benefit upon the diagnosis for those three critical illnesses, waiver of premium payment thereafter and unlimited hospital days for such critical illnesses. Gentle EVER, our non-standard medical product, is designed to meet the needs of certain consumers who cannot qualify for our base EVER plan. An upgrade to our Gentle EVER product, released in July 2012, included expanded benefits and an attached advanced medical care rider. &#32; We continue to believe that the entire medical category will remain an important part of our product portfolio in Japan. 

Aflac pioneered the cancer insurance market in Japan in 1974, and we remain the number one provider of cancer insurance today. Over the years, we&#8217;ve customized our cancer product to respond to, and anticipate, the needs of our consumers and the advances in medical treatments. The cancer insurance plans we offer in Japan provide a lump-sum benefit upon initial diagnosis of internal cancer and benefits for treatment received due to internal cancer such as fixed daily benefits for hospitalization, outpatient services and convalescent care, and surgical and terminal care benefits. In September 2014, Aflac Japan introduced New Cancer DAYS, a new cancer product which provides enhanced coverage, including outpatient treatments and multiple cancer occurrence benefits. At the same time, premiums for this product have been lowered for most ages compared to prior plans. In October 2014, Aflac Japan introduced a unique Aflac-branded cancer product for Japan Post (see the Distribution - Japan and Regulation - Japan sections for background information). As the number one provider of cancer insurance in Japan, we believe these products further strengthen our brand, and most importantly, provide valuable benefits to consumers who are looking for solutions to manage cancer-related costs. We are convinced that the affordable cancer products Aflac Japan provides will continue to be an important part of our product portfolio. 

We also offer traditional fixed-income annuities and care policies. For additional information on Aflac Japan's products and composition of sales, see the Aflac Japan Segment subsection of MD&#38;A in this report. 

Insurance Products - U.S. 

We design our U.S. insurance products to provide supplemental coverage for people who already have major medical or primary insurance coverage. Most of our U.S. policies are individually underwritten and marketed through independent agents. Additionally, we started to market and administer group insurance products in 2009. 

Our individually issued policies are portable and pay benefits regardless of other insurance. Most products' benefits are paid in cash directly to policyholders; therefore, our customers have the opportunity to use this cash to help with expenses of their choosing. Our individually issued health insurance plans are typically guaranteed-renewable for the lifetime of the policyholder (to age 75 for short-term disability policies). Our group insurance policies are underwritten on a group basis and often have some element of guaranteed issue. 

Aflac U.S. offers accident coverage on both an individual and group basis. These policies are designed to protect against losses resulting from accidents. The accident portion of the policy includes lump-sum benefits for accidental death, dismemberment and specific injuries as well as fixed benefits for hospital confinement. In 2015 , &#32;we introduced a new individual accident plan with new benefits for home modifications, improved wellness benefits and a new benefit that provides an additional payout for injuries related to participations in an organized sporting activity. 

Aflac U.S. offers short-term disability benefits on both an individual and group basis. In 2013, we introduced a completely redesigned group short-term disability product with enhanced benefit options and higher income replacement amounts. In 2014, this group short-term disability product was introduced in additional states, formally completing the active launch of the product to the U.S. market. 

Aflac U.S. offers coverage for critical illnesses on both an individual and group basis. These policies are designed to protect against losses resulting from critical illnesses such as heart attack, stroke, or cancer. On an individually underwritten basis we offer cancer plans, critical illness plans, and critical care and recovery plans (formerly called specified health event). On a group basis we offer critical illness plans. In 2015, an updated group critical illness plan was introduced that provides benefits for 30 additional conditions in addition to more consumer options. 

&#160; 

Aflac U.S. offers hospital indemnity coverage on both an individual and group basis. Our hospital indemnity products provide policyholders fixed dollar benefits triggered by hospitalization due to accident or sickness, or just sickness alone. Indemnity benefits for inpatient and outpatient surgeries, as well as various other diagnostic events, are also available. We also offer a lump sum rider than can be added to our individual accident, short-term disability and hospital indemnity products. This rider may not be available on all products in all states. This rider provides a lump sum payment for a range of critical illness events including traumatic brain injury, Type 1 diabetes, advanced Alzheimer&#8217;s disease and many more. In January 2016, a new group hospital indemnity plan was introduced that includes 11 new benefits, including telemedicine and health screening. This plan provides flexibility, allowing our clients to personalize their plan designs to complement the underlying medical coverage that is offered to employees. 

Aflac U.S. also offers additional coverages to those listed above, including dental, vision and life policies. Aflac U.S. offers fixed-benefit dental coverage on both an individual and group basis. Aflac U.S. offers Vision Now SM , an individually issued policy which provides benefits for serious eye health conditions and loss of sight as well as coverage for corrective eye materials and exam benefits. Aflac U.S. also offers term and whole-life policies on both an individual and group basis. 

For additional information on Aflac's U.S. products and composition of sales, see the Aflac U.S. Segment subsection of MD&#38;A in this report. 

Distribution - Japan 

The traditional channels through which we have sold our products are independent corporate agencies, individual agencies and affiliated corporate agencies. The independent corporate agencies and individual agencies that sell our products give us better access to workers at a vast number of small businesses in Japan. Agents' activities are primarily focused on insurance sales, with customer service support provided by the Aflac Contact Center. Independent corporate agencies and individual agencies contributed 47.0% &#32;of new annualized premium sales in 2015 , compared with 46.1% &#32;in 2014 &#32;and 43.8% &#32;in 2013 . Affiliated corporate agencies are originally formed when companies establish subsidiary businesses to sell our insurance products to their employees as part of a benefit package, and then expand to sell our products to other parties such as suppliers and customers. These agencies help us reach employees at large worksites, and some of them are also successful in approaching customers outside their business groups. Affiliated corporate agencies, which include Japan Post, contributed 35.4% &#32;of new annualized premium sales in 2015 , compared with 30.0% &#32;in 2014 &#32;and 23.1% &#32;in 2013 . During 2015 , we recruited more than 300 &#32;new sales agencies. As of December 31, 2015 , Aflac Japan was represented by approximately 13,100 &#32;sales agencies, with approximately 114,000 &#32;licensed sales associates employed by those agencies. We believe that new agencies will continue to be attracted to Aflac Japan's &#32; competitive commissions, attractive products, superior customer service and strong brand image. 

We have sold our products to employees of banks since our entry into Japan in 1974. However, December 2007 marked the first time it was permissible for banks to sell our type of insurance products to their customers. By the end of 2015 , we had agreements with 372 &#32;banks, approximately 90% &#32;of the total number of banks in Japan, to sell our products. We believe we have more banks selling our supplemental health insurance products than any of our competitors. Japanese consumers rely on banks to provide traditional bank services, and also to provide insurance solutions and other services. We believe our long-standing and strong relationships within the Japanese banking sector, along with our strategic preparations, have proven to be an advantage, particularly starting when this channel opened up for our products. Our partnerships throughout the banking sector provide us with a wider demographic of potential customers than we would otherwise have been able to reach, and it also allows banks to expand their product and service offerings to consumers. Banks contributed 14.9% &#32;of Aflac Japan new annualized premium sales in 2015 , compared with 21.5% &#32;in 2014 &#32;and 31.3% &#32;in 2013 . 

Aflac Japan and Japan Post Holdings entered into a new agreement in July 2013, further expanding a partnership 

that was established in 2008 (see Regulation-Japan). At the end of June 2014, Japan Post Insurance (Kampo) received Financial Services Agency (FSA) regulatory approval to enter into an agency contract with Aflac Japan to begin distributing Aflac Japan's cancer insurance products at all of Kampo's 79 directly managed sales offices. Aflac Japan has developed a unique Aflac-branded cancer product for Japan Post and Kampo that was introduced on October 1, 2014. In the fourth quarter of 2014, the number of postal outlets selling our cancer products expanded to approximately 10,000, and starting July 1, 2015, Japan Post expanded the number of post offices that offer Aflac's cancer products to more than 20,000 postal outlets. We believe this alliance with Japan Post will further benefit our cancer insurance sales. 

For additional information on Aflac Japan's distribution, see the Aflac Japan Segment subsection of MD&#38;A in this report. 

Distribution - U.S. 

As of December 31, 2015 , our U.S. sales force was composed of sales associates and brokers who are licensed to sell accident and health insurance. Many are also licensed to sell life insurance. 

Sales associates and brokers are independent contractors and are paid commissions based on first-year and renewal premiums from their sales of insurance products. In addition to receiving commissions on personal production, district and regional sales coordinators may also receive override commissions and incentive bonuses. 

Beginning in the third quarter and continuing into the fourth quarter of 2014, Aflac U.S. implemented tactical initiatives centered around providing competitive compensation to our sales hierarchy and positioning us to more effectively and consistently execute on the U.S. sales strategy across all states. These measures were designed to more effectively link sales management's success to Aflac's success. For example, we enhanced compensation through an incentive bonus for the first level of our sales management, district sales coordinators, who are primarily responsible for selling Aflac products and training new sales associates. Additionally, we eliminated the commission-based position of state sales coordinator. To better manage our state operations, we introduced the new position of market director, effective October 1, 2014. Market directors are salaried with the opportunity to earn sales-related bonuses. We believe these changes have enhanced and will continue to enhance performance management and better align compensation with new business results. 

We concentrate on marketing our insurance products at the worksite. This method offers policies to individuals through employment, trade and other associations. Historically, our policies have been individually underwritten with premiums generally paid by the employee. Additionally, Aflac's individual policies are portable, meaning that individuals may retain their full insurance coverage upon separation from employment or such affiliation, generally at the same premium. We collect a major portion of premiums on such sales through payroll deduction or other forms of centralized billing. With our brokerage sales expansion and CAIC, branded as Aflac Group Insurance, we offer group voluntary insurance products desired by many large employers. These products are sold on a group basis and often have some element of guaranteed issue. Worksite marketing enables sales associates and brokers to reach a greater number of prospective policyholders and lowers distribution costs, compared with individually marketed business. 

Aflac U.S. utilizes dual-channel distribution to market our insurance products to businesses of all sizes. Our career agent channel focuses on marketing Aflac to the small business market, which consists of employers with less than 100 employees. As such, we have aligned our recruiting, training, compensation, marketing and incentives for our career agents to encourage specific activity and sales of individual policies in this market. Our newest channel is the broker channel, which is a sales division of Aflac Group. The broker channel focuses on selling to the mid- and large-case market, which is comprised of employers with more than 100 employees and typically an average size of 1,000 employees or more. Since regional and national brokers have traditionally served the mid- and large-case market, the highly trained and experienced sales professionals of the broker channel are assigned a geographic market to strengthen relationships with the top brokers and sell Aflac products to their clients. As a result, we are represented on more than 80 benefit administration platforms, sometimes referred to as exchanges, of various brokers. 

For additional information on Aflac's U.S. distribution, see the Aflac U.S. Segment subsection of MD&#38;A in this report. 

Competition - Japan 

In 1974, Aflac was granted an operating license to sell life insurance in Japan, making Aflac the second non-Japanese life insurance company to gain direct access to the Japanese insurance market. Through 1981, we faced limited competition for cancer insurance policy sales. However, Japan has experienced two periods of deregulation since we entered the market. The first came in the early 1980s, when nine mid-sized insurers, including domestic and foreign companies, were allowed to sell cancer insurance products for the first time. The second period began in 2001 when all life and non-life insurers were allowed to sell stand-alone cancer and medical insurance products as well as other stand-alone health insurance products. As a result, the number of insurance companies offering stand-alone cancer and medical insurance has more than doubled since the market was deregulated in 2001. However, based on our growth of annualized premiums in force and agencies, we do not believe that our market-leading position has been significantly impacted by increased competition. Furthermore, we believe the continued development and maintenance of operating efficiencies will allow us to offer affordable products that appeal to consumers. Aflac is the largest life insurer in Japan in terms of cancer and medical policies in force. As of December 31, 2015 , we exceeded 23 million &#32;individual policies in force in Japan. 

Aflac has had substantial success selling cancer policies in Japan, with more than 14 million &#32; cancer policies in force as of December 31, 2015 . Aflac continued to be the number one seller of cancer insurance policies in Japan throughout 2015 . We believe we will remain a leading provider of cancer insurance coverage in Japan, principally due to our experience in the market, low-cost operations, expansive marketing system (see Distribution - Japan above) and product expertise. 

We have also experienced substantial success selling medical insurance in Japan. While other companies have recognized the opportunities that we have seen in the medical insurance market and offered new products, we endeavor to make our products stand out for their value to consumers. 

In addition to third sector products, Aflac Japan sells life insurance products such as WAYS (described in the Products section of this report). The market for ordinary life products of this kind is highly competitive. We will continue to pursue the development and marketing of specialty products that meet specific needs within the general life insurance market. 

Competition - U.S. 

Aflac competes against several voluntary supplemental insurance carriers on a national and regional basis. We believe our policies, premium rates, and sales commissions are competitive by product type. Moreover, we believe that Aflac products are distinct from competitive offerings given our product focus (including features, benefits, and our claims service model), distribution capabilities, and brand awareness. For many companies with which we compete, voluntary supplemental insurance products are sold as a secondary business. A growing number of major medical and life insurance carriers are also entering into the voluntary supplemental insurance market. For Aflac, supplemental insurance products are our primary business and are sold via a large distribution network of independent sales associates and brokers (see Distribution - U.S. above). Aflac's advertising campaigns have increased our name awareness and understanding by consumers and businesses of the value our products provide. 

Both private and publicly-traded insurers offer major medical insurance for hospitalization and medical expenses. Much of this insurance is sold on a group basis to accounts that are both fully and self-insured. The federal and state governments also pay substantial costs of medical treatment through various programs. Major medical insurance generally covers a substantial portion of the medical expenses incurred by an insured. Aflac policies are designed to provide coverage that supplements major medical insurance by paying cash directly to the policyholder to use for expenses their major medical insurance is not designed to cover. Thus, we do not compete directly with major medical insurers except those who sell supplemental insurance products as a secondary business. Any reduction of coverage, increase in employee participation costs, or increased deductibles and copayments by major medical commercial or government insurance carriers could favorably affect our business opportunities. Since the implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), some employers have shifted a larger burden of the cost of care to their employees, primarily through increases in premiums, copays, and/or deductibles. Since Aflac products provide an additional level of financial protection for policyholders, we believe the increased financial exposure some employees may face creates a favorable opportunity for our products. Further, given the profitability erosion some major medical carriers are facing in their core lines of business, we have seen a more competitive landscape as they seek entry into Aflac's supplemental product segments in an effort to offset this impact. 

One Day Pay SM &#32;is a claims initiative that we have introduced at Aflac U.S. to process, approve and pay eligible claims in just one day. We believe that along with our brand and relevant products, this claims practice has helped Aflac stand out from competitors. 

Investments and Investment Results 

Net investment income was $3.1 billion &#32;in 2015 &#32;and $3.3 billion &#32;in both 2014 &#32;and 2013 . The decrease in the reported net investment income in U.S. dollar terms for 2015 was primarily due to a weakening of the weighted-average yen/dollar exchange rate when compared to previous periods. In addition, a reduction in investable cash flows and lower investment yields for new purchases in both Japan and the United States have hampered the growth rate of net investment income. In 2015, we continued to address the challenge of investing in this low-interest-rate environment by increasing our allocation to higher yielding asset classes, while still adhering to our strategic asset allocation. For further information on our investments and investment results, see the Insurance Operations and Analysis of Financial Condition sections of MD&#38;A and Notes 3, 4 and 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this report. 

Regulation - Japan 

The financial and business affairs of Aflac Japan are subject to examination by Japan's FSA. Aflac Japan files annual reports and financial statements for the Japanese insurance operations based on a March 31 fiscal year end, prepared in accordance with Japanese regulatory accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the FSA. Japanese regulatory basis earnings are determined using accounting principles that differ materially from U.S. GAAP. For example, under Japanese regulatory accounting practices, policy acquisition costs are expensed immediately; policy benefit and claim reserving methods and assumptions are different; premium income is recognized on a cash basis; different consolidation criteria apply to variable interest entities (VIEs); different accounting applies to reinsurance; and investments can have a separate accounting classification and treatment referred to as policy reserve matching bonds (PRM). Capital and surplus of Aflac Japan, based on Japanese regulatory accounting practices, was $4.7 billion &#32;at December 31, 2015 , compared with $5.6 billion &#32;at December 31, 2014 . 

The FSA maintains a solvency standard, which is used by Japanese regulators to monitor the financial strength of insurance companies. As of December 31, 2015 , Aflac Japan's solvency margin ratio (SMR) was 828% , compared with 857% &#32;at December 31, 2014 . Aflac Japan's SMR is sensitive to interest rate, credit spread and foreign exchange rate changes. See the Capital Resources and Liquidity Section of MD&#38;A for a discussion of measures we have taken to mitigate the sensitivity of Aflac Japan's SMR. 

We typically repatriate a portion of Aflac Japan's accumulated earnings, as determined on a Japanese regulatory accounting basis, to Aflac U.S. provided that Aflac Japan has adequately protected policyholders' interests as measured by its SMR. The FSA may not allow profit repatriations to Aflac U.S. if the transfers would cause Aflac Japan to lack sufficient financial strength for the protection of Japanese policyholders. In the near term, we do not expect these requirements to adversely affect the funds available for profit repatriations, nor do we expect these requirements to adversely affect the funds available for payments of allocated expenses to Aflac U.S. and management fees to the Parent Company. 

In 2005, legislation aimed at privatizing Japan's postal system (Japan Post) was enacted into law. The privatization laws split Japan Post into four operating entities that began operating in October 2007. In 2007, one of these entities selected Aflac Japan as its provider of cancer insurance to be sold through its post offices, and, in 2008, we began selling cancer insurance through these post offices. Japan Post has historically been a popular place for consumers to purchase insurance products. Legislation to reform the postal system passed the Diet in April 2012 and resulted in the merger of two of the postal operating entities (the one that delivers the mail and the one that runs the post offices) on October 1, 2012. In July 2013, Aflac Japan entered into a new agreement with Japan Post Holdings to further expand a partnership that was established in 2008. See the Distribution-Japan section for further developments in 2015. 

The Japanese insurance industry has a policyholder protection corporation that provides funds for the policyholders of insolvent insurers. For additional information regarding the policyholder protection fund, see the Policyholder Protection subsection of MD&#38;A in this report. 

In June 2013, a revision to the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act established a post-funded Orderly Resolution Regime for financial institutions to prevent a financial crisis in the event of a financial institution&#8217;s failure. This regime came into effect in March 2014 and has not had, and is not expected to have, a material impact on the Company's operations in Japan. 

As a branch of our principal insurance subsidiary, Aflac Japan is also subject to regulation and supervision in the United States (see Regulation - U.S.). For additional information regarding Aflac Japan's operations and regulations, see 

the Aflac Japan Segment subsection of MD&#38;A and Notes 2 and 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this report. 

Regulation - U.S. 

The Parent Company and its insurance subsidiaries, Aflac (a Nebraska-domiciled insurance company), American Family Life Assurance Company of New York (Aflac New York, a New York-domiciled insurance company) and CAIC (a South Carolina-domiciled insurance company) are subject to state regulations in the United States as an insurance holding company system. Such regulations generally provide that transactions between companies within the holding company system must be fair and equitable. In addition, transfers of assets among such affiliated companies, certain dividend payments from insurance subsidiaries, and material transactions between companies within the system, including management fees, loans and advances are subject to prior notice to, or approval by, state regulatory authorities. These laws generally require, among other things, the insurance holding company and each insurance company directly owned by the holding company to register with the insurance departments of their respective domiciliary states and to furnish annually financial and other information about the operations of companies within the holding company system. 

Like all U.S. insurance companies, Aflac is subject to regulation and supervision in the jurisdictions in which it does business. In general, the insurance laws of the various jurisdictions establish supervisory agencies with broad administrative powers relating to, among other things: 

&#8226; 

granting and revoking licenses to transact business 

&#8226; 

regulating trade and claims practices 

&#8226; 

licensing of insurance agents and brokers 

&#8226; 

approval of policy forms and premium rates 

&#8226; 

standards of solvency and maintenance of specified policy benefit reserves and minimum loss ratio requirements 

&#8226; 

capital requirements 

&#8226; 

limitations on dividends to shareholders 

&#8226; 

the nature of and limitations on investments 

&#8226; 

deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders 

&#8226; 

filing of financial statements prepared in accordance with statutory insurance accounting practices prescribed or permitted by regulatory authorities 

&#8226; 

periodic examinations of the market conduct, financial, and other affairs of insurance companies 

The insurance laws of Nebraska that govern Aflac's activities provide that the acquisition or change of &#8220;control&#8221; of a domestic insurer or of any person that controls a domestic insurer cannot be consummated without the prior approval of the Nebraska Department of Insurance. A person seeking to acquire control, directly or indirectly, of a domestic insurance company or of any person controlling a domestic insurance company (in the case of Aflac, the Parent Company) must generally file with the Nebraska Department of Insurance (NEDOI) an application for change of control containing certain information required by statute and published regulations and provide a copy to Aflac. In Nebraska, control is generally presumed to exist if any person, directly or indirectly, acquires 10% or more of an insurance company or of any other person or entity controlling the insurance company. The 10% presumption is not conclusive and control may be found to exist at less than 10%. Similar laws apply in New York and South Carolina, the domiciliary jurisdictions of the Parent Company's other insurance subsidiaries, Aflac New York and CAIC. 

State insurance departments conduct periodic examinations of the books and records, financial reporting, policy filings and market conduct of insurance companies domiciled in their states, generally once every three to five years. Examinations are generally carried out in cooperation with the insurance departments of other states under guidelines promulgated by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC). In 2013, the Nebraska insurance regulator, along with the New York insurance regulator, completed a coordinated risk-focused full scope financial examination for the four-year period and three-year period, respectively, ended December 31, 2011 for Aflac and Aflac New York as part of the normal examination process. These examinations found no material deficiencies. Also, in 2011 the South Carolina insurance regulator completed a risk-focused full scope financial examination for the three-year period ended December 31, 2010 for CAIC as part of the normal examination process and found no material deficiencies. In 2016, the Nebraska and New York insurance regulators will commence a routine examination of the four-year period ended December 31, 2015, and the South Carolina insurance regulator will commence a routine examination of the five-year period ended December 31, 2015. 

The NAIC continually reviews regulatory matters , such as risk-based capital (RBC) modernization (Operational Risk and C-1 Investment Risk) and principles-based reserving, and recommends changes and revisions for adoption by state legislators and insurance departments. The NAIC uses a risk-based capital formula relating to insurance risk, business risk, asset risk and interest rate risk to facilitate identification by insurance regulators of inadequately capitalized insurance companies based upon the types and mix of risk inherent in the insurer's operations. The formulas for determining the amount of risk-based capital specify various weighting factors that are applied to financial balances or various levels of activity based on the perceived degree of risk. Regulatory compliance is determined by a ratio of a company's regulatory total adjusted capital to its authorized control level risk-based capital as defined by the NAIC. Companies below specific trigger points or ratios are classified within certain levels, each of which requires specified corrective action. The levels are company action, regulatory action, authorized control, and mandatory control. Aflac's NAIC risk-based capital ratio remains high and reflects a very strong capital and surplus position. As of December 31, 2015 , based on year-end statutory accounting results, Aflac's company action level RBC ratio was 933% . 

Federal legislation and administrative policies in several areas, including health care reform legislation, financial services reform legislation, securities regulation, pension regulation, privacy, tort reform legislation and taxation, can significantly and adversely affect insurance companies. Various forms of federal oversight and regulation of insurance have been passed by the U.S. Congress and signed into law by the president. For example, the ACA, federal health care reform legislation, gives the U.S. federal government direct regulatory authority over the business of health insurance. The reform includes major changes to the U.S. health care insurance marketplace. Among other changes, the reform legislation includes an individual medical insurance coverage mandate, provides for penalties on certain employers for failing to provide adequate coverage, creates health insurance exchanges, and addresses coverage and exclusions as well as medical loss ratios. The legislation also includes changes in government reimbursements and tax credits for individuals and employers and alters federal and state regulation of health insurers. These changes, directed toward major medical health insurance coverage which Aflac does not offer, will continue to be implemented over the next several years. While the ACA was enacted in 2010, the major elements of the law became effective on January 1, 2014. We believe that the ACA, as enacted, does not materially affect the design of our insurance products. However, indirect consequences of the legislation and regulations could present challenges and/or opportunities that could potentially have an impact on our sales model, financial condition and results of operations. 

&#32;On December 18, 2015, the president signed into law the Consolidated Appropriations Act which included a revision to delay implementation of the Excise Tax on High Cost Plans, better known as the "Cadillac tax.&#8221; This tax was originally scheduled to begin in 2017, was previously delayed until 2018, and is now scheduled to begin in 2020. The tax consists of 40% of the cost of employer sponsored health coverage in excess of certain dollar thresholds. In general, only Aflac specified disease and fixed indemnity (i.e. supplemental health) products offered on a pre-tax basis are taken into account under this tax. 

&#160; The legislation also makes the tax deductible by the payer. If employers fund coverage on a pre-tax basis, Aflac, as the insurer, would be liable for its pro-rata share of any tax on excess coverage, determined based on the cost of Aflac coverage compared to the total cost of the applicable health coverage in which each employee is enrolled. Making the tax deductible would then reduce the economic impact of any tax that is imposed and payable by Aflac. 

Many employers are concerned about the tax and what impact it will have on benefit offerings in the future. There is confusion in the market about how the tax is calculated and who pays the tax, presenting a risk that some employers will mistakenly conclude that &#32; all supplemental health products are included in the calculation for the tax regardless of pre-tax funding status or whether an employer&#8217;s health coverage exceeds the trigger for the tax. Some employers may decide simply to drop coverage of affected supplemental health products, rather than convert it to an after-tax basis. During this extended implementation period, Aflac will be assessing the impact of this tax; educating employers about the tax; and investigating ways to mitigate the impact of the tax. Having employees pay for the coverage on an after-tax basis would exempt affected supplemental health products from the tax. 

In 2010, the president signed into law the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, commonly known as the Dodd-Frank Act, which, among other things, created a Financial Stability Oversight Council (the Council). In April 2012, the Council released a final rule describing the general process it will follow in determining whether to designate a nonbank financial company for supervision by the Board of Governors of the U.S. Federal Reserve System (the Board). The Council may designate by a two-thirds vote whether certain nonbank financial companies, including certain insurance companies and insurance holding companies, could pose a threat to the financial stability of the United States, in which case such nonbank financial companies would become subject to prudential regulation by the Board. On April 3, 2013, the Board published a final rule that establishes the requirements for determining when a nonbank financial company is "predominantly engaged in financial activities" - a prerequisite for designation by the Council. Prudential regulation by the Board includes supervision of capital requirements, leverage limits, liquidity requirements and 

examinations. The Board may limit such company&#8217;s ability to enter into mergers, acquisitions and other business combination transactions, restrict its ability to offer financial products, require it to terminate one or more activities, or impose conditions on the manner in which it conducts activities. The Council designated two insurers in 2013 and an additional insurer in 2014 as a Systemically Important Financial Institution (SIFI). On December 18, 2014, the president signed the Insurance Capital Standards Clarification Act into law. This legislation clarifies the Board&#8217;s authority to apply insurance-based capital standards for insurance companies subject to federal supervision. Although Aflac is a nonbank financial company predominantly engaged in financial activities as defined in the Dodd-Frank Act, we do not believe Aflac will be considered a company that poses a threat to the financial stability of the United States. 

Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act and regulations issued thereunder may have an impact on Aflac's derivative activity, including activity on behalf of Aflac Japan, in particular rules to require central clearing and collateral for certain types of derivatives. In 2014, the five U.S. banking regulators and the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) re-proposed for comment their rules regarding collateral for uncleared swaps. Final rules were issued by the five U.S. banking regulators on October 22, 2015 and by the CFTC on December 16, 2015. Such rules may result in increased collateral requirements or affect other aspects of Aflac's derivatives activity. 

The Dodd-Frank Act also established a Federal Insurance Office (FIO) under the U.S. Treasury Department to monitor all aspects of the insurance industry and of lines of business other than certain health insurance, certain long-term care 

insurance and crop insurance. Traditionally, U.S. insurance companies have been regulated primarily by state insurance departments. In December 2013, the FIO released a report entitled "How To Modernize And Improve The System Of Insurance Regulation In The United States." The report was required by the Dodd-Frank Act, and included 18 recommended areas of near-term reform for the states, including addressing capital adequacy and safety/soundness issues, reform of insurer resolution practices, and reform of marketplace regulation. The report also listed nine recommended areas for direct federal involvement in insurance regulation. Some of the recommendations outlined in the FIO report released in December 2013 have been implemented. Of the nine recommended areas for direct federal involvement in insurance regulation that are applicable to Aflac, the president has signed the National Association of Registered Agents and Brokers Reform Act into law in January 2015, which simplifies the agent and broker licensing process across state lines. The FIO has also engaged with the supervisory colleges to monitor financial stability and identify regulatory gaps for large national and internationally active insurers. 

The process of implementing the Dodd-Frank Act is ongoing and continues to involve additional rulemaking from time to time. At the current time, it is not possible to predict with any degree of certainty what impact, if any, the Dodd-Frank Act will have on our U.S. business, financial condition, or results of operations. 

Since September 2013, the NEDOI has chaired Aflac&#8217;s Supervisory College which was established consistent with international regulatory standards and supervisory best practices as a forum for cooperation and communication between the Company's primary supervisors. Japan's Financial Services Agency attends Aflac&#8217;s Supervisory College. Three Supervisory Colleges have taken place since its establishment and the regulators have agreed to continue this process. 

Under state insurance guaranty association laws and similar laws in international jurisdictions, we are subject to assessments, based on the share of business we write in the relevant jurisdiction, for certain obligations of insolvent insurance companies to policyholders and claimants. In the United States, some states permit member insurers to recover assessments paid through full or partial premium tax offsets. The Company's policy is to accrue assessments when the entity for which the insolvency relates has met its state of domicile's statutory definition of insolvency, the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable and the related premium upon which the assessment is based is written. In most states, the definition is met with a declaration of financial insolvency by a court of competent jurisdiction. For additional information regarding state insurance guaranty assessments, see the U.S. Regulatory Environment subsection of MD&#38;A in this report.
