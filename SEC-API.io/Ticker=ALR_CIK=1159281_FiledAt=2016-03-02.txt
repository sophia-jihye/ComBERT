GENERAL 

We are a corporation formed in 2001 under the laws of the State of Maryland. We operate senior living communities, including independent living communities, assisted living communities and skilled nursing facilities, or SNFs. As of December 31, 2015 , we operated 274 senior living communities located in 32 states with &#160; 31,417 living units, including 243 primarily independent and assisted living communities with 28,610 living units and 31 SNFs with 2,807 living units. As of December 31, 2015 , we owned and operated 33 communities ( 3,215 living units), we leased and operated 181 communities ( 20,012 living units) and we managed 60 &#160; communities ( 8,190 living units). Our 274 senior living communities included 10,749 independent living apartments , 15,503 assisted living suites and 5,165 skilled nursing beds . The foregoing numbers exclude, as of December 31, 2015, one assisted living community with 32 living units that we own which i s being offered for sale and is classified as a discontinued operation. 

As of December 31, 2015 , we leased from Senior Housing Properties Trust or its subsidiaries, or SNH , &#160; 177 senio r living communities pursuant to four long term leases. For more information about our leases with SNH , see &#8220; Properties &#8212;Our SNH Leases and Management Agreements &#8221; in Part I, Item 2 below . 

Our principal executive offices are located at 400 Centre Street, Newton, Massachusetts 02458, and our telephone number is (617) 796 &#8209;8387. 

TYPES OF PROPERTIES 

Our present business plan contemplates the ownership, leasing and management of independent living communities, assisted living communities and SNFs. Some of our properties combine more than one type of service in a single building or campus. 

Independent Living Communities. Independent living communities provide high levels of privacy to residents and require residents to be capable of relatively high degrees of independence. An independent living apartment usually bundles several services as part of a regular monthly charge. For example, the base charge may include one or two meals per day in a central dining room, weekly maid service or services of a social director. Additional services are generally available from staff employees on a fee for service basis. In some independent living communities, separate parts of the community are dedicated to assisted living or nursing services. As of December 31, 2015 , our continuing operations included 10,749 independent living apartments in 94 communities. 

Assisted Living Communities. Assisted living communities are typically comprised of one bedroom units which include private bathrooms and efficiency kitchens. Services bundled within one charge usually include three meals per day in a central dining room, daily housekeeping, laundry, medical reminders and 24 hour availability of assistance with the activities of daily living such as dressing and bathing. Professional nursing and healthcare services are usually available at the community as requested or at regularly scheduled times. As of December 31, 2015 , our continuing operations included 15,503 assisted living suites in 217 communities. 

Skilled Nursing Facilities. SNFs generally provide extensive nursing and healthcare services similar to those available in hospitals, without the high costs associated with operating theaters, emergency rooms or intensive care units. A typical purpose built SNF generally includes one or two beds per room with a separate bathroom in each room and shared dining facilities. SNFs are staffed by licensed nursing professionals 24 hours per day. As of December 31, 2015 , our continuing operations included 5,165 skilled nursing beds in 72 communities. 

&#160;

OUR RECENT HISTORY 

Senior Living 

We have historically grown our business through acquisitions, through initiation of long term leases and &#160; through entering into long term contracts to manage independent and assi sted living communities. 

In 2015, we made the following additions to our senior living business: 

&#183; 

In May 2015, we began managing 14 assisted living communities in four states with a combined 838 living units that SNH acquired at that time. We manage these 14 assisted living communities pursuant to 14 separate management agreements on terms substantially similar to our other management agreements with SNH for assisted living communities. For more information about our management agreements with SNH, see &#8220; Properties &#8212;Our SNH Leases and Management Agreements&#8221; in Part I, Item 2 below. 

&#183; 

In November 2015, we acquired two independent living communities with 68 and 84 living units, respectively, for an aggregate purchase price of $26.2 million, excluding closing costs. We funded this acquisition with cash on hand and by assuming $17.3 million of mortgage debt. 

Discontinued Operations 

Under our leases with SNH, we may request that SNH sell certain noneconomic properties we lease from SNH, which, if sold, would reduce our rent payable to SNH, as determined pursuant to formulas in the applicable lease. For more information about our leases with SNH, see &#8220; Properties &#8212;Our SNH Leases and Management Agreements&#8221; in Part I, Item 2 below. 

We and SNH previously agreed that SNH would offer for sale 11 senior living communities we lease from SNH, which we have classified as discontinued operations. In 2013 and 2014, we and SNH sold seven of these communities, and as a result of these sales, our annual rent payable to SNH decreased by $1.9 million in accordance with the terms of the applicable leases. During 2015, we and SNH sold the remaining four senior living communities as follows: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

In February 2015, we and SNH sold a vacant assisted living community located in Pennsylvania for $0.3 million; as a result of this sale, our annual rent payable to SNH decreased by $22,500 in accordance with the terms of the applicable lease. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

In July 2015, we and SNH sold a SNF located in Iowa for $0.2 million; as a result of this sale, our annual rent payable to SNH decreased by $15,500 in accordance with the terms of the applicable lease. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

In August 2015, we and SNH sold a SNF located in Wisconsin for $0.9 million; as a result of this sale, our annual rent payable to SNH decreased by $0.1 million in accordance with the terms of the applicable lease. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

In December 2015, we and SNH sold a vacant senior living community located in Iowa for $21,000; as a result of this sale, our annual rent payable to SNH decreased by $2,100 in accordance with the terms of the applicable lease. 

&#160; 

In June 2013, we began to offer for sale an assisted living community we own with 32 living units located in Alabama. We continue to market this assisted living community for sale but can provide no assurance that we will sell this community, or what the terms or timing of any sale may be. 

&#160;

Debt Financing 

We have a $150.0 million secured revolving credit facility that currently matures on April 13, 2016. In February 2016, we notified the lenders under this credit facility of our intent to exercise our option to extend the maturity date of this facility to April 13, 2017. Subject to the payment of an extension fee and meeting certain other conditions, the maturity date of our credit facility will be extended one year to April 13, 2017. 

In June 2015, we prepaid a mortgage with an outstanding principal balance of $4.9 million that required annual interest of 8.99%. In connection with this prepayment, we recorded a gain of $0.7 million on early extinguishment of debt, net of unamortized premiums and a 1% prepayment penalty, during the second quarter of 2015. 

OUR GROWTH STRATEGY 

We believe that the aging of the U.S. population will increase demand for senior living communities. Our principal growth strategy is to profit from this anticipated demand by operating communities that provide high quality services to residents who pay with private resources. 

Growth in Existing Senior Living Operations 

We seek to improve the profitability of our existing operations by increasing our revenues and improving our operating margins. We attempt to increase revenues by increasing occupancies and rates. We attempt to improve margins by limiting increases in expenses and otherwise improving operating efficiencies. For example, during the recent economic recession experienced in the United States, the senior living industry generally experienced declining occupancy. However, during this same period we improved our operating margins and profitability by increasing rates and limiting increases in expenses. As the U.S. economy and housing market gradually improve, we expect that our occupancy may increase and our profitability may grow; however, the condition of the U.S. economy and the housing market are beyond our control and may not improve, and any improvements may not be sustained and these conditions could decline. Further, reductions in government payments for our services, such as those experienced during 2013 and 2014 as a result of sequestration rate cuts, may negatively impact our results of operations. For more information about government payments for our services, see &#8220; Business &#8212;Government Regulation and Reimbursement&#8221; in Part I, Item 1 below. 

We also seek to improve profitability through strategic capital allocation at our existing senior living communities. We expect to continue to invest significant capital in our communities to increase occupancy and rates, and to improve overall operating performance. In addition to routine renovations and upgrades, we plan to expand certain of our senior living communities when and as opportunities arise. For example, we are currently in the process of adding approximately 70 units among certain of our senior living communities, and we intend to pursue additional expansion projects in 2016. 

Growth through A cquisitions or L easing or M anaging A dditional S enior L iving C ommunities 

We intend to continue to grow our business by adding senior living communities where residents&#8217; private resources account for a large majority of revenues to our portfolio, either by acquiring communities directly or by entering leases or management agreements with SNH or others. Since we became a public company in 2001, we have acquired or begun to lease &#160; 183 senior living communities included in our continuing operations as of December 31, 2015 that realized approximately 88% &#160; of their revenues from residents&#8217; private resources rather than from Medicare and Medicaid in t he year ended December 31, 2015 . In the future, we expect to continue to grow our business by adding communities that we either own, lease or manage where the majority of the revenues are realized from residents&#8217; private resources rather than from Medicare and Medicaid. 

Growth through Continued Development of Five Star Brand and Company Specific Initiatives 

We are continuously attempting to develop public awareness of the Five Star brand through various marketing efforts and initiatives that we believe differentiate us from other senior living operators. For example, providing an 

&#160;

exceptional dining experience to residents is often a top priority for senior living residents; therefore, during past few years we redefined the senior living dining experience by partnering with a celebrity chef and developing the Five Star Culinary Institute for the chefs at our senior living communities. In addition, in 2015 we introduced the &#8220;Lifestyle 360&#8221; resident program, a program focused on the elements of wellness (social, intellectual, spiritual, emotional and physical). We believe these programs, among others, create brand equity among current and prospective residents and their families and provide us with an opportunity to enhance our operating performance. 

OPERATING STRUCTURE 

We have four operating divisions. Three of our divisions are each responsible for multiple geographic regions with respect to our senior living communities that consist of independent living , assisted living and skilled nursing bed s. One of our divisions is responsible for our rehabilitation and wellness inpatient and outpatient clinics which are associated with our senior living communities. Each division is headed by a divisional vice president with extensive experience in the senior living industry. We have several regional offices through which our divisions operate . Each regional office is responsible for multiple communities and is headed by a regional director of operations with extensive experience in the senior living industry. Each regional office is typically supported by a clinical or wellness director, a rehabilitation services director, a regional accounts manager, a human resources specialist and a sales and marketing specialist. Regional staff are responsible for all of our senior living community operations within a geographic region, including: 

&#183; 

resident services; 

&#183; 

Medicare and Medicaid billing; 

&#183; 

marketing and sales; 

&#183; 

hiring of community personnel; 

&#183; 

compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements; and 

&#183; 

supporting our development and acquisition plans within their region. 

Our corporate office staff, located in Massachusetts, provides services such as: 

&#183; 

the establishment of company wide policies and procedures relating to resident care; 

&#183; 

human resources policies and procedures; 

&#183; 

information technology; 

&#183; 

private pay billing for our independent living apartments and assisted living communities; 

&#183; 

maintenance of licensing and certification; 

&#183; 

legal and compliance ; 

&#183; 

central purchasing; 

&#183; 

budgeting and supervision of maintenance and capital expenditures; 

&#183; 

implementation of our growth strategy; and 

&#183; 

accounting , auditing and finance functions, including operations, budgeting, certain accounts receivable and collections functions, accounts payable, payroll , tax and financial reporting. 

&#160;

As described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 &#8209;K, we have a business management agreement with The RMR Group LLC, or RMR LLC , pursuant to which RMR LLC provides to us certain business management services, including internal audit, capital markets, legal and investor relations, among other matters. 

STAFFING 

Independent and Assisted Living Community Staffing. Each of the independent and assisted living communities we operate has an executive director responsible for the day to day operations of the community, including quality of care, resident services, sales and marketing, financial performance and staff supervision. The executive director is supported by department heads who oversee the care and service of the residents, a wellness director who is responsible for coordinating the services necessary to meet the healthcare needs of our residents and a marketing director who is responsible for marketing and promoting our services and brand . In addition, these communities typically also have a dining services coordinator, an activities coordinator and a property maintenance coordinator. 

Skilled Nursing Facility Staffing. Each of our SNFs is managed by a state licensed administrator who is supported by other professional personnel, including a director of nursing, an activities director, a marketing director, a social services director, a business office manager, and physical, occupational and speech therapists. Our directors of nursing are state licensed nurses who supervise our registered nurses, licensed practical nurses and nursing assistants. Staff size and composition vary depending on the size and occupancy of each SNF and on the type of care provided by the SNF. Our SNFs also contract with physicians who provide certain medical services. 

EMPLOYEES 

As of March 1, 2016 , we had approximately 24,800 employees, including approximately 15,750 full time equivalents. We believe our relations with our employees are good. 

GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND REIMBURSEMENT 

The healthcare industry is subject to extensive and frequently changing federal, state and local laws and regulations. These laws and regulations vary by jurisdiction but may address, among other things, licensure, personnel training, staffing ratios, types and quality of medical care, physical facility requirements, government healthcare program participation, fraud and abuse, payments for patient services and patient records. 

We are subject to, and our operations must comply with, these laws and regulations. From time to time, our communities receive notices from federal, state and local agencies regarding noncompliance with such requirements. Upon receipt of these notices, we review them for correctness and, based on our review, we either take corrective action or contest the allegation of noncompliance. When corrective action is required, we work with the relevant agency to address and remediate any violations. Challenging and appealing any notices or allegations of noncompliance require the expenditure of significant legal fees and management attention. Any adverse determination concerning any of our licenses or eligibility for Medicare or Medicaid reimbursement, any penalties, repayments or sanctions, and the increasing costs of required compliance with applicable laws may adversely affect our ability to meet our financial obligations and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations. Also, adverse findings with regard to any one of our communities may have an adverse impact on our licensing and ability to operate other communities. 

The healthcare industry depends significantly upon federal and state programs for revenues and, as a result, is affected by the budgetary policies of both the federal and state governments. Reimbursements under the Medicare and Medicaid programs for skilled nursing, physical therapy and rehabilitation and wellness services provided operating revenues at our outpatient clinics and some of our senior living communities (principally our SNFs). We deriv ed approximately 22% , &#160; 23% and 23 % of our consolidated revenues from continuing operations from Medicare and Medicaid programs for each of the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 , respectively. 

In addition to existing government regulation, we are aware of numerous healthcare regulatory initiatives on the federal, state and local levels, which may affect our business operations if implemented. 

&#160;

Independent Living Communities. Government benefits are not generally available for services at independent living communities, and residents in those communities use private resources to pay for their living units and the services they receive. The rates in these communities are determined by local market conditions and operating costs. However, a number of federal Supplemental Security Income program benefits pay housing costs for elderly or disabled recipients to live in these types of residential communities. The Social Security Act requires states to certify that they will establish and enforce standards for any category of group living arrangement in which a significant number of Supplemental Security Income recipients reside or are likely to reside. Categories of living arrangements that may be subject to these state standards include independent living communities and assisted living communities. Because independent living communities usually offer common dining facilities, in many jurisdictions they are required to obtain licenses applicable to food service establishments in addition to complying with land use and life safety re quirements. In addition, in some states, state or county health departments, social service agencies or offices on aging have jurisdiction over group residential communities for seniors and license independent living communities. To the extent that independent living communities include units to which assisted living or nursing services are provided, these units are subject to applicable state licensing regulations. If the communities receive Medicaid or Medicare funds, they are subject to certification standards and conditions of p articipation. In some states, insurance or consumer protection agencies regulate independent living communities in which residents pay entrance fees or prepay for services. 

Assisted Living Communities. A majority of states provide or are approved to provide Medicaid payments for personal care and medical services to some residents in licensed assisted living communities under waivers granted by or under Medicaid state plans approved by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, of the United States Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS. State Medicaid programs control costs for assisted living and other home and community based services by various means such as restrictive financial and functional eligibility standards, enrollment limits and waiting lists. Because rates paid to assisted living community operators are generally lower than rates paid to SNF operators, some states use Medicaid funding of assisted living as a means of lowering the cost of services for residents who may not need the higher level of health services provided in SNFs. States that administer Medicaid programs for services in assisted living communities are responsible for monitoring the services at, and physical conditions of, the participating communities. 

As a result of the large number of states using Medicaid funds to purchase services at assisted living communities and the growth of assisted living in recent years, states have adopted licensing standards applicable to assisted living communities. According to the National Center for Assisted Living and the HHS Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation , all states regulate assisted living and residential care communities, although states do not use a uniform approach. Most state licensing standards apply to assisted living communities regardless of whether they accept Medicaid funding. Also, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, a few states require certificates of need, or CONs, from state health planning authorities before new assisted living communities may be developed. Based on our analysis of recent economic and regulatory trends, we believe that assisted living communities that become dependent upon Medicaid or other public payments for a majority of their revenues may decline in value because Medicaid and other public rates may fail to keep up with increasing costs. We also believe that assisted living communities located in states that adopt CON requirements or other limitations on the development of new assisted living communities may increase in value because those limitat ions may help ensure higher nongovernment rates and reduced competition . 

HHS, the Senate Special Committee on Aging, and the Government Accountability Office, or the GAO, have studied and reported on the development of assisted living and its role in the continuum of long term care and as an alternative to SNFs. Since 2003, CMS has commenced a series of actions to increase its oversight of state quality assurance programs for assisted living communities and has provided guidance and technical assistance to states to improve their ability to monitor and improve the quality of services paid for through Medicaid waiver programs. CMS is encouraging state Medicaid programs to expand their use of home and community based services as alternatives to institutional services, pursuant to provisions of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, or the DRA, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively, the ACA, and other authorities, through the use of several programs. One such program, the Community First Choice &#160; Option, or the CFC Option, grants states that choose to participate in the program a 6% increase in federal matching payments for related medical assistance expenditures. As of December 2015, five states had obtained a State Plan Amendment to participate in the CFC Option. We are unable to predict the effect of the implementation of the CFC Option and other 

&#160;

similar programs, but their impact may be adverse and material to our operations and our future financial results of operations. 

Skilled Nursing Facilities&#8212;Reimbursement. A majority of all SNF revenues in the United States comes from publicly funded programs. According to CMS, Medicaid is the largest source of public funding for SNFs, &#160; followed by Medicare. In 2014, approximately 32% of nursing care facility and continuing care retirement community revenues came from Medicaid and 23% from Medicare. SNFs are highly regulated businesses. The federal and state governments regularly monitor the quality of care provided at SNFs. State health departments conduct surveys of resident care and inspect the physical condition of SNF properties. These periodic inspections and occasional changes in life safety and physical plant requirements sometimes require SNF operators to make significant capital improvements. These mandated capital improvements have usually resulted in Medicare and Medicaid rate adjustments, albeit on the basis of amortization of expenditures over expected useful lives of the improvements. Under the Medicare prospective payment system, or the PPS, for SNFs, capital costs are part of the prospective rate and are not community specific. The PPS and other recent legislative and regulatory actions with respect to state Medicaid rates limit the reimbursement levels for some SNF services. At the same time, federal and state enforcement agencies have increased oversight of SNFs, making licensing and certification of these communities more rigorous . 

CMS implemented the PPS for SNFs pursuant to the Balance d Budget Act of 1997 . Under the PPS, SNFs receive a fixed payment for each day of care provided to residents who are Medicare beneficiaries. The PPS requires SNFs to assign each resident to a care group depending on that resident &#8217; s medical characteristics and service needs. These care groups are known as Resource Utilization Groups, or RUGs, and CMS establishes a per diem payment rate for each RUG. CMS currently uses the RUG &#8209;IV case mix classification system and a resident assessment instrument called the Minimum Data Set 3.0, which SNFs must use to collect clinical data to assign residents to RUG &#8209;IV reimbursement categories. Medicare PPS payments cover substantially all services provided to Medicare residents in SNFs, including ancillary services such as rehabilitation therapies. 

CMS updates PPS payment rates each year by a market basket update to account for inflation and periodically implements changes to the RUG categories and payment rates. &#160; Since federal fiscal year 2012, the ACA also reduces PPS payment rates each year by a productivity adjustment based on national economic productivity statistics. &#160; In 2011, CMS adopted a final rule designed to recalibrate Medicare PPS rates for SNFs, which resulted in a reduction in aggregate Medicare payment rates for SNFs of approximately 11.1%, or $3.87 billion, in federal fiscal year 2012. For federal fiscal year 2013, CMS adopted a final rule updating Medicare PPS rates for SNFs which resulted in an increase in aggregate Medicare payment rates of approximately 1.8%. CMS estimated this update resulted in an overall increase of $670 million in Medicare payments to SNFs in federal fiscal year 2013 as compared to federal fiscal year 2012. On October 1, 2013, CMS adopted a final rule updating Medicare payments to SNFs for federal fiscal year 2014, which CMS estimated would increase payments to SNFs by an aggregate of 1.3%, or approximately $470 million, compared to federal fiscal year 2013. On July 31, 2014, CMS released a final rule updating Medicare payments to SNFs for federal fiscal year 2015, which CMS estimated would increase payments to SNFs by an aggregate of 2.0%, or approximately $750 million, compared to federal fiscal year 2014 . 

On July 30, 2015, CMS adopted a final rule updating Medicare payments to SNFs for federal fiscal year 2016, which CMS estimated would increase payments to SNFs by an aggregate of 1.2%, or approximately $430 million, compared to federal fiscal year 2015. Due to the previous reduction of Medicare payment rates of approximately 11.1% for federal fiscal year 2012 discussed above, however, Medicare payment rates will be lower for federal fiscal year 2016 than they were in federal fiscal year 2011. The &#160; Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015, or MACRA, discussed below, limits the market basket increase for SNFs to 1.0% in federal fiscal year 2018. It is unclear whether these adjustments in Medicare rates will compensate for the increased costs we may incur for services to our residents whose services are paid for by Medicare. 

&#160; 

The Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012, which was enacted in &#160; February 2012, incrementally reduced &#160; the SNF reimbursement rate for Medicare bad debt from 100% to 65% by federal fiscal year 2015 for beneficiaries dually &#160; eligible for Medicare and Medicaid. Because nearly 90% of SNF bad debt has historically been related to dual &#160; eligible beneficiaries, this rule has a substantial negative effect on SNFs, including some that we operate. The same law also reduced the SNF Medicare bad debt reimbursement rate for Medicare beneficiaries not eligible for &#160; 

&#160;

Medicaid from 70% to 65% in federal fiscal year &#160; 2013 and going forward. 

&#160; 

In addition, the Budget Control Act of 2011 and the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 &#160; allow for automatic reductions in federal spending by means of a process called sequestration, which reduces Medicare payment rates by 2.0% through 2023. In 2014 and 2015, Congress approved two additional one year extensions of Medicare sequestration, through 2025. Medicaid is exempt from the automatic reductions, as are certain Medicare benefits. The automatic 2.0% payment cuts took effect on April 1, 2013, and had an adverse effect on our operations and financial results during 2014 and 2015. Recent legislation appears to have modified some aspects of the sequestration process, but at this time it is unclear what impact this legislation may have on Medicare payments we receive. &#160; Any future reductions in Medicare payment rates could be adverse and material to our operations and to our future financial results of operations. 

&#160; 

The federal government is seeking to slow the growth of Medicare and Medicaid payments for SNF services by several methods. In 2006, the government implemented limits on Medicare payments for outpatient therapies and then, pursuant to the DRA, created an exception process under which beneficiaries could request an exception from the cap and be granted the amount of services deemed medically necessary by Medicare. On April 1, 2014, the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014, or PAMA, extended the Medicare outpatient therapy cap exception process through March 31, 2015, further postponing the implementation of firm limits on Medicare payments for outpatient therapies. PAMA also extended the 0.5% increase to the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule, or MPFS, rates through December 31, 2014 and provided no increase in the MPFS rates, to which our Medicare outpatient therapy rates are tied, in the period between January 1, 2015 and March 31, 2015. In April 2015, Congress passed MACRA, which extended the outpatient therapy cap exceptions process from March 31, 2015 through December 31, 2017, further postponing the implementation of strict limits on Medicare payments for outpatient therapies. MACRA also repealed the Sustainable Growth Rate, or SGR, formula for calculating updates to MPFS rates, which would have led to a 21.2% rate reduction effective April 1, 2015, and replaced the SGR formula with a different reimbursement methodology. Under MACRA, there will be MPFS conversion factor updates of 0.0% from January 1, 2015 through June 30, 2015, 0.5% from July 1, 2015 through December 31, 2015, 0.5% each year from 2016 through 2019 and 0.0% from 2020 through 2025. In addition, starting in 2019, providers may be subject to either Merit-Based Incentive System, or MIPS, payment adjustments or alternative payment model, or APM, incentive payments. MIPS is a new Medicare program that combines certain parts of existing quality and incentive programs into a single program that addresses quality, resource use, clinical practice improvement and meaningful use of electronic health records. APMs are new models approved by CMS for paying healthcare providers for services provided to Medicare beneficiaries, such as bundled payment. 

&#160; 

Additionally, PAMA established a SNF value-based purchasing program, which is intended to increase quality of care and reduce preventable hospitalizations. Under this program, HHS will assess SNFs based on hospital readmissions and make these assessments available to the public by October 1, 2017. As part of PAMA implementation, in the SNF PPS final rule for fiscal year 2016, CMS adopted a 30 day all-cause, all-condition hospital readmission measure for SNFs, which, by October 1, 2016, will be replaced with an all-condition, risk-adjusted potentially preventable hospital readmission rate for SNFs. Under PAMA, beginning in federal fiscal year 2019, Medicare payment rates will be partially based on SNFs&#8217; performance scores on this measure. To fund the program, CMS will reduce Medicare payments to all SNFs by 2.0% through a withhold mechanism starting on October 1, 2018 and then redistribute between 50% and 70% of the withheld payments as incentive payments to those SNFs with the highest rankings on this measure. 

&#160; 

In October 2014, President Obama signed into law the Improving Medicare Post-Acute Care Transformation Act of 2014, or the IMPACT Act, which requires certain post-acute care providers, including SNFs, to begin collecting and reporting various types of data. Specifically, HHS will require SNFs to begin reporting certain quality measures and resource use measures in a standardized and interoperable format by October 1, 2016 and begin reporting certain patient assessment data in such a format by October 1, 2018. Beginning in federal fiscal year 2018, SNFs that fail to timely comply with the reporting requirements will be subject to a 2.0% reduction in their Medicare payment rates for that fiscal year. Beginning October 1, 2018, HHS will make this data publicly available pursuant to certain procedures to be established. The IMPACT Act also requires the Secretary of HHS and the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission to submit reports to Congress recommending a future Medicare PPS for post-acute care providers and analyzing both its effects on the reported metrics and financial effect on post-acute care providers . 

&#160;

The DRA established the five year Money Follows the Person demonstration project in 2007 to award competitive grants to 30 states to provide home and community based long term care services to qualified individuals relocated from SNFs, and to increase federal medical assistance for each qualifying beneficiary for a limited time period. The ACA expanded eligibility for this program and extended this program for an additional five years through 2016. &#160; According to the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, as of December 2015, 43 states and the District of Columbia had operational Money Follows the Person programs. 

The DRA also established the Post-Acute Care Payment Reform demonstration project under which CMS compared and assessed patient care needs, costs and outcomes of services at different post-acute care sites over three years. In January 2012 CMS issued a report to Congress regarding the project stating that CMS successfully used a new uniform patient assessment tool to measure patient acuity in acute care hospitals and post-acute settings, providing the basis for the potential development of new standardized information reporting requirements and more uniform post-acute case mix payment systems. States are also permitted to include home and community based services as optional services under their Medicaid state plans or through Medicaid waiver programs, and states opting to do so may establish more stringent needs based criteria for SNF services than for home and community based services. The ACA expands the services that states may provide and limits their ability to set caps on enrollment, waiting lists or geographic limitations on home and community based services. 

In addition, the DRA increased the &#8220;look-back&#8221; period for prohibited asset transfers that disqualify individuals from Medicaid SNF benefits from three to five years. The period of Medicaid ineligibility begins on the date of the prohibited transfer or the date an individual has entered the SNF and would otherwise be eligible for Medicaid coverage, whichever occurs later, rather than on the date of the prohibited transfer, effectively extending the Medicaid penalty period and placing added burdens on SNFs to collect charges directly from residents and their transferees. 

Although Medicaid is exempt from the sequestration process described above, some of the states in which we operate either have not raised Medicaid rates by amounts sufficient to offset increasing costs or have frozen or reduced, or are expected to freeze or reduce Medicaid rates. Some states are expanding their use of managed care, partly to control Medicaid program costs. According to the CMS Office of the Actuary, Medicaid enrollment is estimated to have increased 13.2% in 2014 due primarily to the expansion in Medicaid eligibility under the ACA, which began in 2014, and is projected to increase at an average annual rate of 1.6% from 2015 through 2024. 

We are unable to predict the impact on us of these or other recent legislative and regulatory actions or proposed actions with respect to federal Medicare rates, state Medicaid rates, and the federal payments to states for Medicaid programs. 

Skilled Nursing Facilities&#8212;Quality Improvement Initiatives. In addition to the reimbursement and rate changes discussed above, payments to SNFs will be increasingly determined by the quality of care provided. The federal government has enhanced its focus on developing and imposing quality-related regulations, standards, and programs to improve the quality of care provided at SNFs and to better align payment to quality outcomes. As noted above, PAMA established a value-based purchasing program, which focuses on SNF quality as measured by hospital readmissions. Further, the IMPACT Act will require SNFs to begin reporting certain quality measures, some of which will eventually be publically available. We are unable to predict the impact of these quality improvement initiatives on our Medicare reimbursement rates. 

CMS has developed and enforces Conditions of Participation that healthcare organizations must meet in order to participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. These standards are designed to improve quality of care and protect the health and safety of beneficiaries. In July 2015, CMS released a proposed rule to comprehensively update the Conditions of Participation for long &#160; term care facilities that participate in Medicare and Medicaid, such as our SNFs. The proposed rule would institute a broad range of new requirements, some of which stem from statutory modifications under the &#160; ACA and &#160; the &#160; IMPACT Act. In particular, the proposed rule would require our SNFs to: train staff on care for residents with dementia and on &#160; abuse prevention; consider residents&#8217; health &#160; needs &#160; when making decisions about the kinds and levels of staffing; ensure that staff have the appropriate skills &#160; and competencies to provide &#160; individualized &#160; care; augment care planning activities, including &#160; considering residents&#8217; goals and preferences and, on discharge, &#160; giving residents necessary follow &#160; up information and improving communication with receiving 

&#160;

facilities or services; permit dietitians and therapy providers to write orders under certain circumstances; provide greater food choice for residents; implement an updated infection prevention and control program, including requiring each of our SNFs to designate an infection prevention and control officer; and strengthen residents&#8217; rights. In addition, the proposed rule would require our SNFs to: alter their staffing levels and competencies based on the results of mandated facility assessments; develop, implement and maintain a compliance and ethics program and quality assurance and performance improvement program; and implement new practices surrounding the preparation &#160; and implementation &#160; of care plans and discharge summaries, among other new &#160; requirements. CMS extended the comment period end date for this proposed rule from September 14, 2015 to October 14, 2015. CMS has stated its intention to finalize the rule prior to the three-year statutory deadline for finalization, or by July 2018. These proposals, if finalized, would increase &#160; the cost of operations for long &#160; term care facilities that participate in Medicare and Medicaid, such as our SNFs. &#160; CMS estimates &#160; that the per facility cost of complying with all of the new requirements would be approximately $46,000 in the first year, and approximately $41,000 each year thereafter. &#160; We believe that CMS estimates of cost increases arising from these new requirements may be low. In addition, as part of ACA implementation, in the SNF PPS rule for federal fiscal year 2016, CMS amended the Conditions of Participation to require SNFs to submit staffing information based on payroll and other verifiable data to CMS. 

In August 2015, CMS announced that it will conduct the second phase of another SNF quality improvement program, the Initiative to Reduce Avoidable Hospitalizations Among Nursing Facility Residents, a pilot program first announced in 2012, which will be continued in partnership with selected organizations from October 2016 to October 2020. In this phase of the initiative, participants will test whether a new payment model for SNFs and practitioners, together with clinical and educational interventions that participants are currently implementing, will further reduce avoidable hospitalizations, lower combined Medicare and Medicaid spending and improve the quality of care received by long stay SNF residents. 

As these quality improvement initiatives increase in size and scope, the federal government will likely monitor the impact of these programs more closely. For example, in October 2015, the GAO released a report calling for CMS to improve its data collection and oversight of SNFs to facilitate enhanced monitoring of the success of the agency&#8217;s quality improvement activities, and HHS concurred with GAO&#8217;s recommendations. We are unable to predict the impact on us of these or other recent legislative and regulatory quality improvement actions or proposed actions. 

Skilled Nursing Facilities&#8212;Survey and Enforcement. &#160; Pursuant to the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1987, &#160; Congress enacted major reforms to federal and state regulatory systems for SNFs that participate in the &#160; Medicare and Medicaid programs. Since then, the GAO has reported that, although much progress has been made, substantial problems remain in the effectiveness of federal and state regulatory activities. The HHS Office of Inspector General, or the OIG, has issued several reports concerning quality of care and billing practices in SNFs, and the GAO has issued several reports recommending that CMS and states strengthen their compliance and enforcement practices, including federal oversight of state actions and to ensure that SNFs provide adequate care and states act more consistently. Moreover, in its fiscal year 2016 work plan, the OIG specifically stated that it will review compliance with various aspects of the SNF PPS, including the documentation requirement in support of claims paid by Medicare. In recent years, the OIG and the GAO have also repeatedly called for increased oversight and payment system reform for SNFs. 

In June 2015, the OIG issued a report calling for CMS to accelerate efforts to implement a new method for paying SNFs for therapy, based on findings that many SNFs incorrectly or inconsistently used CMS&#8217;s new patient assessments. The OIG also recommended that CMS reduce the financial incentive for SNFs to use assessments differently when decreasing and increasing therapy services and strengthen the oversight of SNF billing for changes in therapy. CMS concurred with these recommendations. In September 2015, the OIG issued a second report questioning the appropriateness of payments to SNFs under the Medicare SNF PPS, and stating that Medicare payments for therapy greatly exceeded SNFs&#8217; costs for therapy. The OIG recommended that CMS evaluate the extent to which Medicare payment rates for therapy should be reduced, change the method for paying for therapy, adjust Medicare payments to eliminate any increases that are unrelated to beneficiary characteristics and strengthen oversight of SNF billing. CMS concurred with these recommendations and noted that it is working to identify potential alternative methodologies for paying for SNF PPS services, including therapy. 

&#160;

In addition to scrutiny from the GAO and the OIG, the Senate Special Committee on Aging and other congressional committees have also held hearings on related SNF issues. As a result, CMS has undertaken several initiatives to increase the effectiveness of Medicare and Medicaid SNF survey and enforcement activities. CMS has been taking steps to identify and focus enforcement efforts on &#160; SNFs and chains of SNF operators with findings of substandard care or repeat violations of Medicare and Medicaid standards. CMS has increased its oversight of state survey agencies and has improved the process by which data is captured from these surveys. As an added measure of improving patient care, the ACA provides for the funding of a state background check system for job applicants to long term care providers &#160; who will have direct access to &#160; patients. CMS has begun the administration of this program, and, as of August 2015, has awarded funding to approximately half of the states. 

In addition, CMS adopted regulations expanding federal and state authority to impose civil monetary penalties in instances of noncompliance. When CMS or state agencies identify deficiencies under state licensing and Medicare and Medicaid standards, they may impose sanctions and remedies such as denials of payment for new Medicare and Medicaid admissions, civil monetary penalties, state oversight, temporary management or receivership and loss of Medicare and Medicaid participation or licensure on SNF operators. Our communities may incur sanctions and penalties from time to time. If we are unable to cure deficiencies that have been identified or that are identified in the future, or if appeals of proposed sanctions or penalties are not successful, decertification or additional sanctions or penalties may be imposed. These consequences may adversely affect our ability to meet our financial obligations and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations. 

Certificates of Need. As a mechanism to prevent overbuilding and subsequent healthcare price inflation, most states limit the number of SNFs and hospitals by requiring developers to obtain CONs before new facilities may be built or additional beds may be added to existing facilities. As noted above, a few states also limit the number of assisted living facilities by requiring CONs. In addition, some states (such as California and Texas) that have eliminated &#160; CON &#160; laws have retained other means of limiting new development, including moratoria, licensing laws or limitations upon participation in the state Medicaid program. These governmental requirements limit expansion, which we believe may make existing SNFs more valuable by limiting competition. 

Healthcare Reform. The ACA, signed into law in March 2010, has resulted in changes to insurance, payment systems and healthcare delivery systems. The ACA is intended to expand access to health insurance coverage and reduce the growth of healthcare expenditures while simultaneously maintaining or improving the quality of healthcare. Some of the provisions of the ACA took effect immediately, whereas others will take effect at later dates. Due to the complexity of the ACA, its ramifications may only become apparent through later regulatory and judicial interpretations. 

The ACA establishes an Independent Payment Advisory Board to submit legislative proposals to Congress and take other actions with a goal of reducing Medicare spending growth. When and if such spending reductions take effect they may be adverse and material to our financial results. The ACA also provides for the National Pilot Program on Payment Bundling to develop and evaluate making bundled payments for services provided during an episode of care, to include hospital and physician services and post &#8209;acute care such as SNF services. The pilot program can be expanded at any point after January 2016 if it meets its goals. The ACA also includes the development of Medicare value &#8209;based purchasing plans to include quality measures as a basis for bonuses and several initiatives to encourage states to develop and expand home and community based services under Medicaid. 

The ACA includes various other provisions affecting Medicare and Medicaid providers, including expanded public disclosure requirements for SNFs and other providers, enforcement reforms and increased funding for Medicare and Medicaid program integrity control initiatives. The ACA has resulted in several changes to existing healthcare fraud and abuse laws, established additional enforcement tools and funding to the government, and provided for increased cooperation between agencies by establishing mechanisms for sharing information relating to noncompliance. Furthermore, the ACA has resulted in enhanced criminal and administrative penalties for noncompliance. For example, the ACA amended the Anti &#8209;Kickback Statute to provide that a claim that includes items or services resulting from a violation of the Anti &#8209;Kickback Statute now constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act. 

In June 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld two major provisions of the ACA&#8212;the individual mandate, which requires most Americans to maintain health insurance or to pay a penalty, and the Medicaid expansion, which requires 

&#160;

states to expand their Medicaid programs by 2014 to cover all individuals under the age of 65 with incomes not exceeding 133% of the federal poverty level. In upholding the Medicaid expansion, the U.S. Supreme Court held that it violated the U.S. Constitution as drafted but remedied the violation by modifying the expansion to preclude the Secretary of HHS from withholding existing federal Medicaid funds from states that fail to comply with Medicaid expansion, instead allowing the Secretary only to deny new expansion funding. Under the ACA, the federal government will pay for 100% of a state&#8217;s Medicaid expansion costs for the first three years (2014 &#8209;2016) and gradually reduce its subsidy to 90% for 2020 and future years . Based on the ruling, states may choose not to participate in the Medicaid expansion program without risking the loss of existing federal Medicaid funding. As of Febr uary 24 , 2016, 31 states plus the District of Columbia had elected to expand Medicaid eligibility as provided under the ACA, 1 7 states had elected not to broaden Medicaid eligibility, and t wo remained undecided; those states that ultimately choose not to participate in Medicaid expansion will forgo the federal funds that would otherwise be available for that purpose. It is unclear what effect the U.S. Supreme Court ruling may have on future federal funding for states&#8217; Medicaid programs. We expect that the ending of certain temporary federal payments to states in 2021, &#160; and &#160; other &#160; budgetary constraints on state governments , may cause some states to &#160; reduce Medicaid payments to healthcare services providers like us . 

In addition, in June 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court decided that income tax credits under the ACA are available to individuals who purchase health insurance on an exchange created by the federal government, in the same way such credits are available to individuals who purchase health insurance on an exchange created by a state. Such subsidies provide certain eligible taxpayers with the ability to purchase or maintain health insurance. 

We cannot estimate the type and magnitude of the potential Medicare and Medica id policy changes, rate reductions or other changes and the impact on us of the possible failure of these programs to increase rates to match our increasing expenses, but they may be material to and adversely affect our future results of operations. Similarly, we are unable to predict the impact on us of the insurance reforms, payment reforms, and healthcare delivery systems reforms contained in and to be developed pursuant to the ACA. Expanded insurance availability may provide more paying customers for the services we provide. If the changes implemented under the ACA result in reduced payments for our services or the failure of Medicare, Medicaid or insurance payment rates to cover our costs, however, our future financial results could be adversely and materially affected. 

In addition, other aspects of the ACA that affect employers generally, including the employer shared responsibility provisions that the Internal Revenue Service began enforcing on January 1, 2015, may have an impact on the design and cost of the health coverage that we offer to our employees. Due to the scope and complexity of the provisions of the ACA that apply to employers and employer group health plans, it is difficult to predict the overall impact of the ACA on our employee benefit plans and our cost of doing business over the coming years. We will continue to analyze how to provide our employees with cost &#8209;effective coverage, taking into account the various requirements of the ACA and the impact of any changes on our ability to attract and retain employees. For information on some recent changes that we have made to the health insurance coverage we offer employees in response to the rising cost of health insurance generally, please see &#8220;Business&#8212;Insurance&#8221; in Part I, Item 1 below. 

Other Matters. Federal and state efforts to target false claims, fraud and abuse and violations of anti &#8209;kickback laws, physician referral laws (including the Ethics in Patient Referrals Act of 1989), privacy laws and consumer protection laws by Medicare and Medicaid providers and providers under other public and private programs have increased in recent years, as have civil monetary penalties, treble damages, repayment requirements and criminal sanctions for noncompliance. The federal False Claims Act, as amended and expanded by the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009, and the ACA, provides significant civil money penalties and treble damages for false claims and authorizes individuals to bring claims on behalf of the federal government for false claims. The federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law authorizes the Secretary of HHS to impose substantial civil penalties, treble damages, and program exclusions administratively for false claims or violations of the federal Anti &#8209;Kickback Statute. In addition, the ACA increased penalties under federal sentencing guidelines by between 20% and 50% for healthcare fraud offenses involving more than $1.0 million. State Attorneys General typically enforce consumer protection laws relating to senior living services, clinics and other healthcare facilities. 

Governmental authorities are devoting increasing attention and resources to the prevention, detection, and prosecution of healthcare fraud and abuse. The OIG has guidelines for SNFs intended to assist them in developing 

&#160;

voluntary compliance programs to prevent fraud and abuse; these guidelines recommend that CMS identify SNFs that are billing for higher paying RUGs and more closely monitor compliance with patient therapy assessments as methods of fraud prevention. CMS contractors are expanding the retroactive audits of Medicare claims submitted by SNFs and other providers, and recouping alleged overpayments for services determined by auditors not to have been medically necessary or not to meet Medicare coverage criteria as billed. State Medicaid programs and other third party payers are conducting similar medical necessity and compliance audits. The ACA facilitates the Department of Justice&#8217;s, or the DOJ&#8217;s, ability to investigate allegations of wrongdoing or fraud at SNFs, in part because of increased cooperation and data sharing among CMS, the OIG, the DOJ and the states. On January 12, 2016, the OIG and the DOJ announced a settlement and corporate integrity agreement with the largest provider of contract therapy services in the nation, as well as settlements with four SNFs, all alleged to have submitted false claims for therapy services provided to SNF patients. The significant nature of the settlements indicates that the federal government is increasingly focused on the appropriateness of billing practices of, and medical necessity of services provided at, SNFs. In addition, the ACA requires all states to terminate the Medicaid participation of any provider that has been terminated under Medicare or any Medicaid state plan. Moreover, state Medicaid fraud control agencies may investigate and prosecute assisted living communities and SNFs, clinics and other healthcare facilities under fraud and patient abuse and neglect laws. 

Current state laws and regulations allow enforcement officials to make determinations as to whether the care provided at our communities exceeds the level of care for which a particular community is licensed. A finding that a community is delivering care beyond the scope of its license could result in the immediate discharge and transfer of residents. Some states and the federal government allow certain citations of one community to impact other communities operated by the same entity or a related entity, including communities in other states. Revocation of a license or certification at one community could therefore impact our ability to obtain new licenses or certifications or to maintain or renew existing licenses and certifications at other communities, and trigger defaults under our leases, our management agreements with SNH and the agreement governing our credit facility (as described below), or adversely affect our ability to operate or obtain financing in the future. In addition, an adverse finding by state officials could serve as the basis for lawsuits by private plaintiffs and lead to investigations under federal and state laws, which could result in civil and/or criminal penalties against the community as well as a related entity . 

Our communities must comply with laws designed to protect the confidentiality and security of individually identifiable patient information. Under the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or the HITECH Act, our communities that are &#8220; covered entities &#8221; within the meaning of HIPAA must comply with rules adopted by HHS governing the privacy, security, use and disclosure of individually identifiable information, including financial information and protected health information, or PHI, and security rules for electronic PHI. HIPAA and the HITECH Act are intended to ensure patient privacy and the efficiency of healthcare claims and payment transactions. There may be both civil monetary penalties and criminal sanctions for noncompliance with such federal laws. Under the HITECH Act, penalties for violation of certain provisions may be as high as $50,000 per violation for a maximum civil penalty of $1.5 million per calendar year. On January 17, 2013, HHS released the HIPAA Omnibus Rule, or the Omnibus Rule, which went into effect on March 26, 2013 and required compliance with most provisions by September 23, 2013. Pursuant to the Omnibus Rule, &#8220; covered entities &#8221; were required to make certain modifications to any business associate agreements that they have in place with their &#8220; business associates &#8221; within the meaning of HIPAA, depending on the circumstances. In addition, the Omnibus Rule required &#8220; covered entities &#8221; to modify and redistribute their notices of privacy practices to include certain provisions relating to the use of PHI. Further, the Omnibus Rule modified the standard for providing breach notices, which was previously based on an analysis of the harm resulting from any disclosure, to a more objective analysis on whether any PHI was actually acquired or viewed as a result of the breach. In addition to HIPAA, many states have enacted their own security and privacy laws relating to individually identifiable information, including financial information and PHI. In some states, these laws are more burdensome than HIPAA. In instances in which the state provisions are more stringent than &#160; or differ from HIPAA, our communities must comply with applicable federal and state standards. 

Our communities must comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act, or the ADA, and similar state and local laws to the extent that such communities are &#8220; public accommodations &#8221; as defined in those statutes. The obligation to comply with the ADA and other similar laws is an ongoing obligation, and we continue to assess our communities and make appropriate modifications. 

&#160;

Other legislative proposals introduced in Congress, proposed by federal or state agencies or under consideration by some state governments include the option of block grants for states rather than federal matching money for certain state Medicaid services, laws authorizing or directing Medicare to negotiate rate reductions for prescription drugs, additional Medicare and Medicaid enforcement procedures and federal and state cost containment measures, such as freezing Medicare or Medicaid SNF payment rates at their current levels and reducing or eliminating annual Medicare or Medicaid inflation allowances or gradually reducing rates for SNFs. 

Some of the states in which we operate either have not raised Medicaid rates by amounts sufficient to offset increasing costs or have frozen or reduced, or are expected to freeze or reduce, Medicaid rates. Medicaid spending grew an estimated 11% in 2014 due to increased enrollment as some states chose to expand Medicaid coverage under the ACA. From 2015 through 2024, Medicaid spending is expected to grow by an average annual rate of 5.9%, mainly driven by increased spending per beneficiary due to aging of the population and more gradual growth in enrollment. Effective June 30, 2011, Congress ended certain temporary increases in federal payments to states for Medicaid programs that had been in effect since 2008. We expect the ending of these temporary federal payments, combined with other state budgetary pressures, to result in continued challenging state fiscal conditions, particularly in those states that are not participating in Medicaid expansion. As a result, some state budget deficits may increase, and certain states may continue to reduce Medicaid payments to healthcare services providers like us as part of an effort to balance their budgets. These state-level cuts have the potential to negatively impact our revenue from Medicaid sources. 

INSURANCE 

Litigation against senior living and healthcare companies continues to increase, and liability insurance costs continue to increase as a result. In addition, our employee benefit costs, including health insurance and workers&#8217; compensation insurance costs, continue to increase. To partially offset these insurance cost increases, we have taken a number of actions, including: 

&#183; 

becoming fully self insured for all health related claims of covered employees; 

&#183; 

increasing the deductible or retention amounts for which we are liable under our liability insurance; 

&#183; 

establishing an offshore captive insurance company which participates in our liability and workers&#8217; compensation insurance programs, which may allow us to reduce our net insurance costs by retaining the earnings on our reserves, provided our claims experience matches that projected by various statutory and actuarial formulas; 

&#183; 

increasing the amounts that some of our employees are required to pay for health insurance coverage and copayments for health services and pharmaceutical prescriptions and decreasing the amount of certain healthcare benefits as well as adding a high deductible health insurance plan as an option for our employees; 

&#183; 

hiring insurance and other professional advisors to help us establish programs to reduce our insured workers&#8217; compensation and professional and general liabilities, including a program to monitor and proactively settle liability claims and to reduce workplace injuries; 

&#183; 

hiring insurance and other professional advisors to help us establish appropriate reserves for our retained liabilities and captive insurance programs; and 

&#183; 

organizing Affiliates Insurance Company, or AIC, with RMR LLC and other companies, including SNH, to which RMR LLC provides management services, in order to obtain more control over our insurance costs. For more information regarding our participation in insurance arranged by AIC, please see Note 15 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 &#8209;K. 

&#160;

We partially self insure up to certain limits for workers&#8217; compensation, professional liability and property coverage. Claims in excess of these limits are insured up to contractual limits, over which we are self insured. Our current insurance arrangements are generally renewable annually. We do not know if our insurance charges and self insurance reserve requirements will increase, and we cannot predict the amount of any such increase, or to what extent, if at all, we may be able to offset any increase through use of higher deductibles, retention amounts, self insurance or other means in the future. For more information about certain of our insurance initiatives see Note 15 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 &#8209;K. 

COMPETITION 

The senior living services business is highly competitive. We compete with numerous other senior living community operators, as well as companies that provide senior living services, such as home healthcare companies and other real estate based service providers. We have large lease obligations and limited financeable assets. Some of our existing competitors are larger than us and have greater financial resources than us. We may expand our business with SNH and our relationships with SNH and RMR LLC may provide us with competitive advantages; however, SNH is not obligated to provide us with opportunities to lease or manage additional properties. Some of our competitors are not for profit entities which have endowment income and may not face the same financial pressures that we do. We cannot assure that we will be able to compete successfully or operate profitably. &#160; For additional information on competition and the risks associated with our business, please see &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in Part I, Item 1A below. 

ENVIRONMENTAL AND CLIMATE CHANGE MATTERS 

Under various laws, owners as well as tenants and operators of real estate may be required to investigate and clean up or remove hazardous substances present at or migrating from properties they own, lease or operate and may be held liable for property damage or personal injuries that result from hazardous substances. These laws also expose us to the possibility that we may become liable to reimburse governments or third parties for damages and costs they incur in connection with hazardous substances. Under our leases with SNH, we have also agreed to indemnify SNH for any such liabilities related to the properties on which our senior living communities that we lease from SNH are located. We reviewed environmental conditions surveys of certain of our leased and owned communities. Based upon those surveys, we do not believe that there are environmental conditions at any of our properties that have had or will have a material adverse effect on us. However, no assurances can be given that conditions are not present at our properties or that costs we may be required to incur in the future to remediate contamination will not have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition and results of operations . 

The current political debate about climate change has resulted in various treaties, laws and regulations which are intended to limit carbon emissions. We believe these laws being enacted or proposed may cause energy costs at our senior living communities to increase. In the long term, we believe any such increased costs will be passed through and paid by our residents and other customers through rate increases . However, in the short term, these increased costs, if material in amount, could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. For more information regarding climate change matters and their possible adverse impact on us, please see &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Impact of Climate Change&#8221; in Part II, Item 7 below.
