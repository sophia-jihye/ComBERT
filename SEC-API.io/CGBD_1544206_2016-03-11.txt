 Item 1. Business 

GMS Finance is a Maryland corporation structured as an externally managed, non-diversified closed-end investment company. GMS Finance is externally managed by CGMSIM, an investment adviser that is registered with the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the &#147;Advisers Act&#148;). The CGMSIM team managing our investments (the &#147;CGMSIM Investment Team&#148;) forms the exclusive Carlyle platform for U.S. middle market debt investments. 

GMS Finance&#146;s investment objective is to generate current income and capital appreciation primarily through debt investments in U.S. middle market companies, which we define as companies with approximately $10 million to $100 million of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (&#147;EBITDA&#148;). GMS Finance seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing primarily in first lien senior secured loans (which may include stand-alone first lien loans; &#147;last out&#148; first lien loans, which are loans that have a secondary priority behind &#147;first out&#148; first lien loans; &#147;unitranche&#148; loans, which are loans that combine features of first lien, second lien or subordinated loans, generally in a first lien position; and secured corporate bonds with features similar to the features of these categories of first lien loans) and second lien senior secured loans (which may include senior secured loans, and, to a lesser extent, secured corporate bonds, with a secondary priority behind first lien loans) (collectively, &#147;Middle Market Senior Loans&#148;). The Middle Market Senior Loans are generally made to private U.S. middle market companies that are, in many cases, controlled by private equity firms. Depending on market conditions, GMS Finance expects that between 70% and 80% of the value of its assets will be invested in Middle Market Senior Loans, with the balance invested in higher-yielding investments, which may include middle market junior loans such as corporate mezzanine loans, equity co-investments, broadly syndicated first lien and second lien senior secured loans, high-yield bonds, structured finance obligations and/or other opportunistic investments. We expect that the composition of our portfolio will change over time given our Investment Adviser&#146;s view on, among other things, the economic and credit environment (including with respect to interest rates) in which we are operating. 

The growth and development of our Company has been guided by several fundamental tenets: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Experienced Investment Team &#151;The Company is managed by an experienced management team of investment professionals with extensive middle market lending experience. Our Adviser&#146;s investment 

&#160;

&#160; committee that is responsible for reviewing and approving our Middle Market Senior Loan investments (the &#147;CGMSIM Investment Committee&#148;) consists of seasoned investment professionals from across the Global Market Strategies (&#147;GMS&#148;) segment of Carlyle. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Attractive Origination Model &#151;The CGMSIM Investment Team&#146;s multi-channel origination model produces attractive investment opportunities through a variety of sources including over 200 private equity firms, other middle market lenders, financial advisors and experienced management teams to source debt investments in middle market companies and to source other high-yielding investments that provide attractive risk-adjusted returns. The CGMSIM Investment Team has cultivated very strong relationships with private equity sponsors and debt capital providers, with whom we work with closely in sourcing and executing transactions. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Diligent Investment Strategy &#151;Our investment decisions are based on in-depth, fundamental underwriting and credit research grounded in a conservative credit orientation. This systematic, consistent approach is augmented by industry expertise and tenured underwriting professionals who both lead the CGMSIM Investment Team and serve on the CGMSIM Investment Committee. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Leverage the GMS Platform &#151; The Company benefits from the well branded and scalable origination and underwriting platform of GMS. The CGMSIM Investment Team leverages the industry expertise of 11 structured credit research analysts who currently advise the GMS collateralized loan obligations (&#147;CLOs&#148;) funds and cover approximately 20 industries. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Leverage the Carlyle Network &#151;Carlyle, a leading global alternative asset manager, provides infrastructure, including back-office support, reporting assistance and accounting resources, and investment insight through proprietary deal flow, industry experience and sector knowledge. The following highlights illustrate our accomplishments since the commencement of our operations: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Capital Commitments and Investments &#151;As of March 11, 2016, we have raised a total of $1.2 billion in total capital commitments in GMS Finance. Of that total, and inclusive of the use of leverage and recycled proceeds from sales and paydowns, we have deployed $1.1 billion in 87 funded first lien debt investments, $233.8 million in 28 funded second lien debt investments, $126.6 million in 27 structured finance obligations and $2.2 million in 2 equity investments through December 31, 2015. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Credit Facilities and the 2015-1 Notes &#151;On May 24, 2013, the Company&#146;s wholly-owned subsidiary, Borrower Sub, entered into a senior secured revolving credit facility (as amended, the &#147;Revolving Credit Facility&#148;) with a maximum principal amount of $400 million. In addition, on March 21, 2014, the Company entered into a senior secured revolving credit facility (as amended, the &#147;Facility&#148;) with a maximum principal amount of $150 million. Further, on June 26, 2015, the Company completed a $400 million term debt securitization (the &#147;2015-1 Debt Securitization&#148;). The notes offered in the 2015-1 Debt Securitization (the &#147;2015-1 Notes&#148;) were issued by the 2015-1 Issuer, a wholly-owned and consolidated subsidiary of the Company. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Credit Platform Enhancements &#151;The CGMSIM Investment Team has continued to expand and enhance all facets of the credit platform supporting the Company. Additional senior origination professionals were added during the year which meaningfully expanded the direct sourcing capabilities. The origination platform now has offices in New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles covering over 200 private equity firms. The scale of the direct origination platform allows the Company to maximizes the investment opportunity set and increase overall investment selectivity. Direct origination has several important benefits including optimizing transaction economics, improving the strength of the loan documentation, and providing greater access to due diligence materials. Additional senior resources were added to the capital markets group, further enhancing investment sourcing and syndication capabilities with other lenders, including banks, finance companies, credit funds, and other business development companies. Additional professionals were added to the underwriting and portfolio management team to support the overall increase in investment activity and portfolio growth. This 

&#160;

&#160; team works closely with the origination and capital markets professionals, as well as the GMS industry research analysts in executing all facets of transaction due diligence and portfolio management. Further enhancements and additions will be made as appropriate to ensure that the CGMSIM Investment Team continues to have best in class execution across each segment of the business. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Strong Management Alignment With Investors &#151;Certain members of Carlyle&#146;s senior management team, Carlyle employees and operating executives, and certain partners and affiliates of Carlyle committed to purchase an aggregate of approximately $63.0 million of common stock, of which $29.4 million was funded as of December 31, 2015. Prior to a Qualified IPO, from time to time, CGMSIM intends to pay certain individuals providing services to CGMSIM, including members of the CGMSIM Investment Team, in shares of our common stock and/or in cash a portion of the net after-tax incentive fees that CGMSIM receives from us (not to exceed 25%) in consideration of their services on behalf of CGMSIM. To the extent that any such payment is in shares of our common stock, CGMSIM will purchase such shares from us and distribute the shares to the individuals eligible for such payment, and, to the extent that any such payment is in cash, CGMSIM will require the individuals eligible for such payment to make capital commitments to purchase newly issued shares of our common stock. In addition, following the completion of a Qualified IPO, from time to time, CGMSIM intends to purchase shares of our common stock in the open market at a purchase price, in the aggregate, equal to approximately 25% of each installment of the net after-tax incentive fees that CGMSIM receives from us, subject to market conditions. CGMSIM may then distribute those shares to members of the CGMSIM Investment Team and other individuals eligible for such payment in consideration of their services on behalf of CGMSIM. GMS Finance 

GMS Finance is a Maryland corporation formed on February 8, 2012. On May 2, 2013, GMS Finance filed its election to be regulated as a business development company (&#147;BDC&#148;) under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (together with the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the &#147;Investment Company Act&#148;). GMS Finance has elected to be treated, and intends to continue to comply with the requirements to qualify annually, as a regulated investment company (&#147;RIC&#148;) under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, (the &#147;Code&#148;). 

On May 2, 2013, GMS Finance completed its Initial Closing and subsequently commenced substantial investment operations. Prior to May 2, 2013, GMS Finance had not commenced operations and was a development stage company as defined by Accounting Standards Codification (&#147;ASC&#148;) 915, Development Stage Entity . During this time, GMS Finance focused substantially all of its efforts on establishing its business. If GMS Finance has not consummated an initial public offering of its common stock that results in an unaffiliated public float of at least 15% of the aggregate capital commitments received prior to the date of such initial public offering (a &#147;Qualified IPO&#148;) by May 2, 2018, then our Board of Directors (subject to any necessary stockholder approvals and applicable requirements of the Investment Company Act) will use its best efforts to wind down and/or liquidate and dissolve the Company. 

GMS Finance is an &#147;emerging growth company&#148; as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the &#147;JOBS Act&#148;). GMS Finance will remain an emerging growth company for up to five years following an initial public offering, although if the market value of the common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of any June 30 before that time, GMS Finance would cease to be an emerging growth company as of the following December 31. 

The Borrower Sub is a Delaware limited liability company that was formed on January 3, 2013. The Borrower Sub invests in first and second lien senior secured loans. The Borrower Sub is consolidated in our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K commencing from the date of its formation, January 3, 2013. 

&#160;

On June 26, 2015, the Company completed the 2015-1 Debt Securitization.

The 2015-1 Issuer is consolidated in our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K commencing from the date of its formation, May 8, 2015. 

GMS Finance is externally managed by our Investment Adviser, an investment adviser registered under the Advisers Act. Our Administrator provides the administrative services necessary for us to operate. Both the Investment Adviser and the Administrator are wholly-owned subsidiaries of Carlyle Investment Management L.L.C. (&#147;CIM&#148;), a subsidiary of Carlyle. 

As a BDC, GMS Finance is required to comply with certain regulatory requirements. As part of these requirements, the Company must not acquire any assets other than &#147;qualifying assets&#148; specified in the Investment Company Act unless, at the time the acquisition is made, at least 70% of its total assets are qualifying assets (with certain limited exceptions). 

GMS Finance has elected to be treated, and intends to continue to comply with the requirements to qualify annually, as a RIC under the Code, and operates in a manner so as to qualify for the tax treatment applicable to RICs. To qualify as a RIC, GMS Finance must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements and timely distribute to its stockholders generally at least 90% of its investment company taxable income, as defined by the Code, for each year. Pursuant to this election, GMS Finance generally does not have to pay corporate level taxes on any income that it distributes to stockholders, provided that GMS Finance satisfies those requirements. 

About Our Adviser 

Our investment activities are managed by our Investment Adviser. CGMSIM is responsible for sourcing potential investments, conducting research and due diligence on prospective investments and equity sponsors, analyzing investment opportunities, structuring our investments and monitoring our investments and portfolio companies on an ongoing basis. For providing these services, the Investment Adviser receives fees from us pursuant to an investment advisory agreement (the &#147;Investment Advisory Agreement&#148;). For more information on the Investment Advisory Agreement, including the fees consisting of two components&#151;a base management fee and an incentive fee, see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. 

The CGMSIM Investment Committee, which also serves as the investment committee to NF Investment Corp. (&#147;NFIC&#148;), is led by Michael J. Petrick, Managing Director of Carlyle, Chairman of the CGMSIM Investment Committee, Head of GMS and Chairman of the GMS Finance and NFIC Boards of Directors, and Michael A. Hart, Managing Director of Carlyle, President of GMS Finance and NFIC and member of the GMS Finance and NFIC Boards of Directors. Other members of the CGMSIM Investment Committee include senior GMS investment professionals who are responsible for reviewing and approving our investments. The CGMSIM Investment Committee members are seasoned investment professionals with experience through different credit cycles. 

Pursuant to a personnel agreement between the Investment Adviser and The Carlyle Group Employee Co., L.L.C. (&#147;Carlyle Employee Co.&#148;), an affiliate of the Investment Adviser, Carlyle Employee Co. provides the Investment Adviser with access to investment professionals that comprise the CGMSIM Investment Team. As of March 11, 2016, the CGMSIM Investment Team includes a team of approximately 18 investment professionals designated from Carlyle&#146;s GMS platform. 

Our executive officers and directors, the employees of the Investment Adviser and members of the CGMSIM Investment Committee serve or may serve as investment advisors, officers, directors or principals of entities or investment funds that operate in the same or a related line of business as we do and/or investment 

&#160;

funds, accounts and other similar arrangements advised by Carlyle. An affiliated investment vehicle currently formed, such as NFIC, or formed in the future and managed by the Investment Adviser or its affiliates may have overlapping investment objectives and strategies with our own and, accordingly, may invest in asset classes similar to those targeted by us. As a result, the Investment Adviser and/or its affiliates may face conflicts in allocating investment opportunities between us and such other entities. Accordingly, we may not be given the opportunity to participate in certain investments made by investment funds managed by advisors affiliated with the Investment Adviser. However, the Investment Adviser and its affiliates will endeavor to allocate investment opportunities in a fair and equitable manner and consistent with applicable allocation procedures. See &#147; Risk Factors&#151;Risks Related to Our Business and Structure &#151; There are significant potential conflicts of interest, including the management of NFIC, other funds affiliated with Carlyle by our Investment Adviser&#146;s key investment professionals, which could impact our investment returns &#148; in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K for more information. 

Prior to a Qualified IPO, from time to time, CGMSIM intends to pay certain individuals providing services to CGMSIM, including members of the CGMSIM Investment Team, in shares of our common stock and/or in cash a portion of the net after-tax incentive fees that CGMSIM receives from us (not to exceed 25%) in consideration of their services on behalf of CGMSIM. To the extent that any such payment is in shares of our common stock, CGMSIM will purchase such shares from us and distribute the shares to the individuals eligible for such payment, and, to the extent that any such payment is in cash, CGMSIM will require the individuals eligible for such payment to make capital commitments to purchase newly issued shares of our common stock. In addition, following the completion of a Qualified IPO, from time to time, CGMSIM intends to purchase shares of our common stock in the open market at a purchase price, in the aggregate, equal to approximately 25% of each installment of the net after-tax incentive fees that CGMSIM receives from us, subject to market conditions. CGMSIM may then distribute those shares to members of the CGMSIM Investment Team and other individuals eligible for such payment in consideration of their services on behalf of CGMSIM. 

On February 26, 2014, the SEC granted us and NFIC, as well as future funds advised by CGMSIM, exemptive relief (&#147;Exemptive Relief&#148;) to co-invest in suitable investments, subject to certain terms and conditions in the Exemptive Relief. In addition, we and NFIC may invest alongside other affiliated funds and persons in certain circumstances where doing so is consistent with applicable law and SEC staff interpretations, including the entities&#146; investment objectives and policies. For example, we may invest alongside such funds consistent with guidance promulgated by the SEC staff permitting us and such other funds to purchase interests in a single class of privately placed securities so long as certain conditions are met, including that CGMSIM, acting on our behalf and on behalf of its other clients, and other affiliated funds and persons negotiates no term other than price. 

About Carlyle 

Carlyle is one of the world&#146;s largest and most diversified multi-product global alternative asset management firms. Carlyle and its affiliates advise an array of specialized investment funds and other investment vehicles that invest across a range of industries, geographies, asset classes and investment strategies. Since its founding in Washington, D.C. in 1987, Carlyle has grown to become a leading global alternative asset manager with more than $183 billion in assets under management (&#147;AUM&#148;) across 126 funds and 160 fund of funds vehicles as of December 31, 2015. Carlyle has more than 1,700 employees, including more than 700 investment professionals in 36 offices across six continents, and serves over 1700 active carry fund investors from 78 countries. 

Carlyle&#146;s GMS platform was established in 1999 with its first high yield fund. As of December 31, 2015, it advises a group of 68 active funds that pursue investment strategies including long/short credit, long/short emerging markets equities, macroeconomic strategies, commodities trading, and structured transactions, quantitative market strategies, leveraged loans and structured credit, energy mezzanine opportunities, middle market lending and distressed debt. 

&#160;

Primary areas of focus for Carlyle&#146;s GMS teams include: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Structured Credit Funds. The structured credit funds invest primarily in performing senior secured bank loans through structured vehicles and other investment vehicles. In 2015, Carlyle closed five new U.S. CLOs and three CLOs in Europe with a total of $2.8 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively, of AUM at December 31, 2015. As of December 31, 2015, the structured credit team advised 43 structured credit funds and one carry fund in the United States, Europe, and Asia totaling, in the aggregate, approximately $18.4 billion in AUM. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Distressed and Corporate Opportunities. The distressed and corporate opportunities funds generally invest in liquid and illiquid securities and obligations, including secured debt, senior and subordinated unsecured debt, convertible debt obligations, preferred stock and public and private equity of financially distressed companies in defensive and asset-rich industries. In certain investments, these funds may seek to restructure pre-reorganization debt claims into controlling positions in the equity of reorganized companies. As of December 31, 2015, Carlyle&#146;s distressed and corporate opportunities team advised two funds totaling, in the aggregate, over $1.4 billion in AUM. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Middle Market Finance. The middle market finance business is comprised of Carlyle&#146;s BDCs (including us), a CLO consisting of middle market senior, first lien loans, and Carlyle&#146;s corporate mezzanine funds, which invest in the first-lien, second-lien and mezzanine loans of middle-market companies, typically defined as companies with annual EBITDA ranging from $10 million to $100 million that lack access to the broadly syndicated loan and bond markets. As of December 31, 2015, Carlyle&#146;s middle market investment team advised five funds totaling, in the aggregate, approximately $2.2 billion in AUM. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Energy Mezzanine Opportunities. The energy mezzanine opportunities team invests primarily in privately negotiated mezzanine debt investments in North American energy and power projects and companies. As of December 31, 2015, Carlyle&#146;s energy mezzanine opportunities team advised two funds with approximately $4.3 billion in AUM. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Long/Short Credit. Claren Road Asset Management LLC (&#147;Claren Road&#148;) advises two long/short credit hedge funds focusing on the global high grade and high yield markets totaling, in the aggregate, over $3.4 billion in AUM as of December 31, 2015, which includes $2.3 billion of AUM that is subject to outstanding redemption requests as of the beginning of the first quarter of 2016. Claren Road seeks to profit from market mispricing of long and/or short positions in corporate bonds and loans, and their derivatives, across investment grade, below investment grade (high yield) or distressed companies. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Emerging Market Equity and Macroeconomic Strategies. Emerging Sovereign Group LLC (&#147;ESG&#148;) advises six emerging markets equities and macroeconomic hedge funds with $4.3 billion in the aggregate of AUM as of December 31, 2015, which includes $0.7 billion of AUM that is subject to outstanding redemption requests as of the beginning of the first quarter of 2016. ESG&#146;s emerging markets equities funds invest in publicly-traded equities across a range of developing countries. ESG&#146;s macroeconomic funds pursue investment strategies in developed and developing countries, and opportunities resulting from changes in the global economic environment. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Commodities . Carlyle Commodity Management LLC (f/k/a Vermillion Asset Management LLC), a New York-based commodities investment manager (&#147;CCM&#148;) advises five hedge funds and two structured product fund totaling, in the aggregate, approximately $1.3 billion of AUM as of December 31, 2015, which includes $0.1 billion of AUM that is subject to outstanding redemption requests as of the beginning of the first quarter of 2016. CCM&#146;s investment strategies include relative value, enhanced index and long-biased physical commodities, commodity sector-focused funds, and structured transactions. CCM seeks to produce positive, uncorrelated returns, through a liquid, relative-value, low volatility approach to trading both physical commodities and their derivatives and structuring transactions in physical commodities. &#160;

NFIC is an externally managed, non-diversified closed-end investment company that has elected to be regulated as a BDC under the Investment Company Act and has elected to be treated as a RIC under the Code. NFIC seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing primarily in Middle Market Senior Loans, subject to, in the case of second lien senior secured loans, a limit of 10% of NFIC&#146;s total assets. In addition, NFIC may invest up to 10% of its total assets in high yield securities whose risk profile, as determined at the sole discretion of the Investment Adviser, is similar to or better than the risk profile of Middle Market Senior Loans. NFIC has the same Adviser and Administrator as us. Refer to the sec.gov website for further information on NFIC. 

Carlyle sponsors several investment funds, accounts and other similar arrangements with strategies overlapping with our strategy, including, without limitation, NFIC, Carlyle Energy Mezzanine Opportunities Fund and successor funds, Carlyle Strategic Partners series of funds, as well as carry funds, hedge funds, managed accounts and structured credit CLO funds. The terms of certain of these investment funds, accounts or other similar arrangements require Carlyle to allocate investment opportunities to such investment funds in priority to allocations to other vehicles, such as us. As a result, there are circumstances where investments appropriate for us are instead allocated, in whole or in part, to such other investment funds, accounts or other similar arrangements. Where Carlyle otherwise has discretion to allocate investment opportunities among various funds, accounts and other similar arrangements, it should be noted that Carlyle may determine to allocate such investment opportunities away from us. Apart from the circumstances described above, Carlyle is presented with investment opportunities that generally fall within our investment objective and that of other Carlyle investment funds or managed accounts, whether focused on a debt strategy or otherwise, and in such circumstances Carlyle allocates such opportunities among us and such other Carlyle funds on a basis that Carlyle determines to be fair and reasonable taking into account the sourcing of the transaction, the nature of the investment focus of each such other Carlyle investment fund, the relative amounts of capital available for investment, the nature and extent of involvement in the transaction on the part of the respective teams of investment professionals, any requirements contained in the partnership agreements of such other Carlyle funds and other considerations deemed relevant by Carlyle in good faith. Consistent with the foregoing, Carlyle expects that other Carlyle investment funds will make investments in the debt of private companies. In addition, Carlyle expects that we will make investments in geographic regions in which other Carlyle investment funds have been or may be specifically organized to invest. 

In addition, NFIC invests in Middle Market Senior Loans, and thus substantially all investment opportunities that fall within our investment objective may also fall within NFIC&#146;s investment objective. On February 26, 2014, the SEC granted us and NFIC, as well as future funds advised by CGMSIM, Exemptive Relief to co-invest in suitable investments, subject to certain terms and conditions in the Exemptive Relief. 

While Carlyle and CGMSIM seek to implement their respective allocation processes in a fair and equitable manner under the particular circumstances, there can be no assurance that it will result in equivalent allocation of or participation in investment opportunities or equivalent performance of investments allocated to us as compared to the other entities. 

Carlyle may also from time to time form or have financial or operational interests in the management of one or more hedge funds or similar alternative investment vehicles which may be permitted to allocate a portion of their portfolios to long-dated, illiquid, restricted, or other similar securities and investment opportunities (which may include private equity and mezzanine investments), and whose investment strategies may therefore overlap with ours. It is therefore possible that such hedge funds may consider the same investment opportunities as us. Generally, any private debt investments that may be made by such hedge funds would (i) only be made as part of a broader investment portfolio and be limited to a minority percentage of the hedge fund&#146;s overall portfolio and (ii) generally be expected to be passive minority investments, made on an opportunistic basis. Nevertheless, it cannot be completely ruled out that such hedge funds may on any given occasion compete with us for the same investment opportunity. 

&#160;

About Our Administrator 

CGMSFA, a Delaware limited liability company, serves as our Administrator. Pursuant to an administration agreement between us and the Administrator (the &#147;Administration Agreement&#148;), the Administrator provides services to us and we reimburse the Administrator for its costs and expenses and our allocable portion of overhead incurred by the Administrator in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including our allocable portion of the compensation of certain of our officers and staff. In addition, the Administrator has entered into a sub-administration agreement with Carlyle Employee Co. (the &#147;Carlyle Employee Co. Sub-Administration Agreement&#148;) and a sub-administration agreement with CELF Advisors LLP (&#147;CELF&#148; and such agreement, the &#147;CELF Sub-Administration Agreement&#148;), which provide the Administrator with access to personnel. The Administrator has also entered into a sub-administration agreement with State Street Bank and Trust Company (&#147;State Street&#148; and such agreement, the &#147;State Street Sub-Administration Agreement&#148;), which serves as our custodian, transfer agent, distribution paying agent and registrar. 

Competition 

Our primary competitors in providing financing to middle market companies include public and private funds, other BDCs, including affiliated funds, commercial and investment banks, commercial finance companies and, to the extent they provide an alternative form of financing, private equity and hedge funds. Many of our potential competitors are substantially larger and have considerably greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. For example, some competitors may have a lower cost of funds and access to funding sources that are not available to us. In addition, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments than we do, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments and establish more relationships than us. Furthermore, many of our competitors are not subject to the regulatory restrictions that the Investment Company Act and the Code impose on us. The competitive pressures we face may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Also, as a result of this competition, we may not be able to take advantage of attractive investment opportunities from time to time, and we can offer no assurance that we will be able to identify and make investments that are consistent with our investment objective. 

We expect to use the expertise of the members of the CGMSIM Investment Committee and the CGMSIM Investment Team to assess investment risks and determine appropriate pricing for our investments. In addition, we expect that the relationships developed by the CGMSIM Investment Team will enable us to learn about and compete effectively for, financing opportunities with attractive middle market companies in the industries in which we seek to invest. For additional information concerning the competitive risks we face, see Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K &#147;Risk Factors&#151;Risks Related to Our Investments&#151;We operate in a highly competitive market for investment opportunities, and compete with investment vehicles sponsored or advised by our affiliates&#148;. 

Staffing 

We do not currently have any employees. Our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer and Chief Operating Officer presently serve as a principal or managing director of Carlyle and are retained by CGMSFA pursuant to the Carlyle Employee Co. Sub-Administration Agreement. Our Chief Compliance Officer and Secretary presently serves as a director of Carlyle and is retained by CGMSFA pursuant to the CELF Sub-Administration Agreement. Each of these professionals performs their respective functions for us under the terms of our Administration Agreement. 

Our day-to-day investment operations are managed by CGMSIM. Pursuant to its personnel agreement with Carlyle Employee Co., CGMSIM has access to the members of the CGMSIM Investment Committee, and a team of additional experienced investment professionals who, collectively, comprise the CGMSIM Investment Team. CGMSIM may hire additional investment professionals to provide services to GMS Finance. 

&#160;

Investment Strategy and Approach 

Our investment objective is to generate current income and capital appreciation primarily through debt investments in U.S. middle market companies. We seek to achieve our investment objective by investing primarily in Middle Market Senior Loans of private U.S. middle market companies and opportunistically pursuing investments with high risk-adjusted returns across the capital structure and company size depending on broader market conditions. We seek to generate strong risk-adjusted net returns by assembling a diversified portfolio of investments across a broad range of industries and instruments. 

We target U.S. middle market companies, generally controlled by private equity investment firms that require capital for growth, acquisitions, recapitalizations, refinancings and leveraged buyouts. We may also make opportunistic loans to independently owned and publicly held middle market companies. We seek to partner with strong management teams executing long-term growth strategies. Target businesses typically exhibit some or all of the following characteristics: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; EBITDA of $10&#151;$100 million; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Minimum of 35% original sponsor cash equity; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Sustainable leading positions in their respective markets; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Scalable revenues and operating cash flow; &#160;

See the Consolidated Schedules of Investments as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 in our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for more information on these investments, including a list of companies and type, cost and fair value of investments. 

Investment Process&#151;Middle Market Senior Loans 

We view our investment process as consisting of four distinct phases described below: 

Origination. Our Investment Adviser sources middle market investment opportunities through the CGMSIM Investment Team&#146;s extensive network of relationships with private equity firms, other middle market senior lenders, and investment and commercial banks. The CGMSIM Investment Team supplements these relationships through personal visits and marketing campaigns focused on maximizing investment deal flow. It is their responsibility to identify specific opportunities, to refine opportunities through candid exploration of the underlying facts and circumstances and to apply creative and flexible thinking to solve clients&#146; financing needs. The origination personnel are located in New York, Illinois and California. Each originator maintains long-standing relationships with potential sources of deal flow and is responsible for covering a specified target market. We believe those originators&#146; strength and breadth of relationships across a wide range of markets generate numerous financing opportunities, which should enable our Investment Adviser to be highly selective in recommending investments. 

Credit Evaluation. Our Investment Adviser utilizes a systematic, consistent approach to credit evaluation with a particular focus on an acceptable level of debt repayment and deleveraging under a &#147;base case&#148; set of projections, which we refer to as the &#147;Base Case,&#148; which typically reflects a more conservative estimate than the set of projections provided by a prospective portfolio company, which we refer to as the &#147;Management Case.&#148; In addition, our Investment Adviser leverages the industry-specific expertise within the GMS platform. Our Investment Adviser has access to 11 GMS Structured Credit research analysts who cover approximately 20 industries and advise GMS&#146; CLO funds. The key criteria that our Investment Adviser considers include (i) strong and resilient underlying business fundamentals, (ii) a substantial equity cushion in the form of capital ranking junior in right of payment to our investment and (iii) a conclusion that the overall Base Case and in some cases a &#147;downside case&#148; allows for adequate debt repayment and deleveraging. Our Investment Adviser focuses on the criteria for evaluating prospective portfolio companies discussed above under &#147;Competitive Strengths.&#148; In evaluating a particular company, our Investment Adviser puts more emphasis on credit considerations (such as (i) debt repayment and deleveraging under a Base Case set of projections, (ii) the ability of the company to maintain a modest liquidity cushion under a Base Case set of projections, and (iii) the ability of the company to service its fixed charge obligations under a Base Case set of projections) than on profit potential and loan pricing. Our Investment Adviser&#146;s due diligence process for middle market credits typically entails: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; a thorough review of historical and pro forma financial information; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; on-site visits; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; meetings with management; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; a review of loan documents and material contracts; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; third-party &#147;quality of earnings&#148; accounting due diligence; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; when appropriate, background checks on key managers; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; third-party research relating to the company&#146;s business, industry, markets, products and services and competitors; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; the commission of third-party market studies when appropriate; and &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; sensitivity of Management Case projections Execution. In executing transactions for us, our Investment Adviser applies a thorough, consistent approach to credit evaluation, and maintains discipline with respect to credit, pricing and structure to ensure the ultimate 

&#160;

success of the financing. Upon completion of due diligence, the investment professionals working on a proposed portfolio investment deliver a memorandum to the CGMSIM Investment Committee. Once an investment has been approved by a majority of the CGMSIM Investment Committee, including an affirmative vote by the Chairman of the CGMSIM Investment Committee or his designee, it moves through a series of steps, including initial documentation using standard document templates and the establishment of negotiating boundaries, final documentation, including resolution of business points and the execution of original documents held in escrow. Upon completion of final documentation, a loan is funded after execution of a final closing memorandum. 

Monitoring. We view active portfolio monitoring as a vital part of our investment process. We consider regular dialogue with company management and sponsors as well as detailed, internally generated monitoring reports to be critical to our performance. Our Investment Adviser has implemented a monitoring template designed to reasonably ensure compliance with these standards. This template is used as a tool by our Investment Adviser to assess investment performance relative to plan. In addition, our portfolio companies may rely on us to provide them with financial and capital markets expertise. 

As part of the monitoring process, our Investment Adviser has developed risk policies pursuant to which it regularly assesses the risk profile of each of our debt investments and rates each of them based on the following categories, which we refer to as &#147;Internal Risk Ratings&#148;: 

Internal Risk Ratings Definitions 

&#160;

Rating 

&#160; Definition 

1 &#160; Performing&#151;Low Risk: Borrower is operating more than 10% ahead of the Base Case. 2 &#160; Performing&#151;Stable Risk: Borrower is operating within 10% of the Base Case (above or below). This is the initial rating assigned to all new borrowers. 3 &#160; Performing&#151;Management Notice: Borrower is operating more than 10% below the Base Case. A financial covenant default may have occurred, but there is a low risk of payment default. 4 &#160; Watch List: Borrower is operating more than 20% below the Base Case and there is a high risk of covenant default, or it may have already occurred. Payments are current although subject to greater uncertainty, and there is moderate to high risk of payment default. 5 &#160; Watch List&#151;Possible Loss: Borrower is operating more than 30% below the Base Case. At the current level of operations and financial condition, the borrower does not have the ability to service and ultimately repay or refinance all outstanding debt on current terms. Payment default is very likely or may have occurred. Loss of principal is possible. 6 &#160; Watch List&#151;Probable Loss: Borrower is operating more than 40% below the Base Case, and at the current level of operations and financial condition, the borrower does not have the ability to service and ultimately repay or refinance all outstanding debt on current terms. Payment default is very likely or may have already occurred. Additionally, the prospects for improvement in the borrower&#146;s situation are sufficiently negative that impairment of some or all principal is probable. Our Investment Adviser has developed a risk rating model that is based on evaluating portfolio company performance in comparison to the Base Case when considering certain credit metrics including, but not limited to, adjusted EBITDA and net senior leverage as well as specific events including, but not limited to, default and impairment. 

&#160;

Our Investment Adviser monitors and, when appropriate, changes the investment ratings assigned to each debt investment in our portfolio. In connection with our quarterly valuation process, our Investment Adviser reviews our investment ratings on a regular basis. The following table summarizes the Internal Risk Ratings as of December 31, 2015 and 2014:

Investment Process&#151;Opportunistic Investments 

For opportunistic investments, our Investment Adviser seeks to leverage the GMS platform to identify investments that fit our investment mandate. We use the proprietary deal flow generated by the GMS platform to enhance portfolio returns. Our Investment Adviser&#146;s evaluation of structured finance obligations for investment opportunities begins with due diligence. The due diligence focuses on appropriate factors, such as the manager, underlying assets, ratings, structure and key risks. Information is derived from a number of sources, including third-party structured finance analysis platforms. The structured finance obligations deal committee reviews and approves each deal. The structured finance obligations deal committee includes a majority of the members of the CGMSIM Investment Committee and is chaired by Mr. Petrick, the Chairman of the CGMSIM Investment Committee, the Chairman of our Board of Directors and Head of GMS. As part of our monitoring process, our Investment Adviser has developed risk policies pursuant to which it regularly assesses the risk profile of each of the structured finance obligation investments. 

Election to be Taxed as a RIC 

The Company has elected to be treated, and intends to continue to comply with the requirements to qualify annually, as a RIC under the Code. As a RIC, we generally do not have to pay corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes on any income that we distribute to our stockholders as dividends. To qualify as a RIC, we must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements. In addition, we must distribute to our stockholders, for each taxable year, at least 90% of our &#147;investment company taxable income,&#148; which is generally our net ordinary taxable income plus the excess of realized net short-term capital gains over realized net long-term capital losses (the &#147;Annual Distribution Requirement&#148;). The following discussion assumes that we qualify as a RIC and have satisfied the Annual Distribution Requirement. 

If we: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; qualify as a RIC; and &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement, then we are not subject to U.S. federal income tax on the portion of our net taxable income we distribute (or are deemed to distribute) to stockholders. We are subject to U.S. federal income tax at regular corporate rates on any income or capital gains not distributed (or deemed distributed) to our stockholders. 

&#160;

In addition, if we fail to distribute in a timely manner an amount at least equal to the sum of (1) 98% of our ordinary income for the calendar year, (2) 98.2% of our capital gain net income (both long-term and short-term) for the one-year period ending October 31 in that calendar year and (3) any income realized, but not distributed, in the preceding year (the &#147;Excise Tax Distribution Requirements&#148;), we are liable for a 4% excise tax on the portion of the undistributed amounts of such income that are less than the amounts required to be distributed based on the Excise Tax Distribution Requirements. For this purpose, however, any ordinary income or capital gain net income retained by us that is subject to corporate income tax for the tax year ending in that calendar year is considered to have been distributed by year end (or earlier if estimated taxes are paid). We currently intend to make sufficient distributions each taxable year to satisfy the Excise Tax Distribution Requirements. 

In order to qualify as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we must, among other things: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; continue to qualify as a BDC under the Investment Company Act at all times during each taxable year; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; derive in each taxable year at least 90% of our gross income from dividends, interest, payments with respect to loans of certain securities, gains from the sale of stock or other securities or foreign currencies, net income from certain &#147;qualified publicly traded partnerships,&#148; or other income derived with respect to our business of investing in such stock or securities or foreign currencies (the &#147;90% Gross Income Test&#148;); and &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; diversify our holdings so that at the end of each quarter of the taxable year: &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; at least 50% of the value of our assets consists of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities, securities of other RICs, and other securities if such other securities of any one issuer do not represent more than 5% of the value of our assets or more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of the issuer; and &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; no more than 25% of the value of our assets is invested in the securities, other than U.S. government securities or securities of other RICs, of one issuer, or two or more issuers that are controlled, as determined under applicable Code rules, by us and that are engaged in the same or similar or related trades or businesses, or of certain &#147;qualified publicly traded partnerships&#148; (the &#147;Diversification Tests&#148;). Moreover, our ability to dispose of assets to meet our distribution requirements may be limited by (1) the illiquid nature of our portfolio and/or (2) other requirements relating to our qualification as a RIC, including the Diversification Tests. If we dispose of assets in order to meet the Annual Distribution Requirement or the Excise Tax Distribution Requirements, we may make such dispositions at times that, from an investment standpoint, are not advantageous. If we are prohibited from making distributions or are unable to raise additional debt or equity capital or sell assets to make distributions, we may not be able to make sufficient distributions to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement, and therefore would not be able to maintain our qualification as a RIC. Additionally, we may make investments that result in the recognition of ordinary income rather than capital gain, or that prevent us from accruing a long-term holding period. These investments may prevent us from making capital gain distributions as described below. We intend to monitor our transactions, make the appropriate tax elections and make the appropriate entries in our books and records when we make any such investments in order to mitigate the effect of these rules. 

A RIC is limited in its ability to deduct expenses in excess of its &#147;investment company taxable income&#148; (which is, generally, ordinary income plus net realized short-term capital gains in excess of net realized long-term capital losses). If our expenses in a given year exceed gross taxable income, we would have a net operating loss for that year. However, a RIC is not permitted to carry forward net operating losses to subsequent years. In addition, expenses can be used only to offset investment company taxable income, not net capital gain. Due to these limits on the deductibility of expenses, we may for U.S. federal income tax purposes have aggregate taxable income for several years that we distribute and that is taxable to our stockholders even if such income is greater than the aggregate net income we actually earned during those years. Such distributions may be made 

&#160;

from our cash assets or by liquidation of investments, if necessary. We may realize gains or losses from such liquidations. In the event we realize net capital gains from such transactions, a holder may receive a larger capital gain distribution than the holder would have received in the absence of such transactions. 

Our Regulatory Structure&#151;Regulation as a Business Development Company 

General 

A BDC is regulated under the Investment Company Act. A BDC must be organized in the United States for the purpose of investing in or lending to primarily private companies and making significant managerial assistance available to them. A BDC may use capital provided by public stockholders and from other sources to make long-term, private investments in businesses. A publicly-traded BDC provides stockholders the ability to retain the liquidity of a publicly traded stock while sharing in the possible benefits, if any, of investing in primarily privately owned companies. Until a Qualified IPO, we do not intend to list our common stock on a stock exchange and it will not be publicly traded. 

We may not change the nature of our business so as to cease to be, or withdraw our election as, a BDC unless authorized by vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities, as required by the Investment Company Act. A majority of the outstanding voting securities of a company is defined under the Investment Company Act as the lesser of: (a) 67% or more of such company&#146;s voting securities present at a meeting if more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of such company are present or represented by proxy, or (b) more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of such company. We do not anticipate any substantial change in the nature of our business. 

As with other companies regulated by the Investment Company Act, a BDC must adhere to certain substantive regulatory requirements. A majority of our directors must be persons who are not interested persons, as that term is defined in the Investment Company Act. Additionally, we are required to provide and maintain a bond issued by a reputable fidelity insurance company to protect the BDC. Furthermore, as a BDC, we are prohibited from protecting any director or officer against any liability to us or our stockholders arising from willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of such person&#146;s office. 

As a BDC, we are generally required to meet an asset coverage ratio, defined under the Investment Company Act as the ratio of our total assets (less all liabilities and indebtedness not represented by senior securities) to our outstanding senior securities, of at least 200% after each issuance of senior securities. We may also be prohibited under the Investment Company Act from knowingly participating in certain transactions with our affiliates without the prior approval of our directors who are not interested persons and, in some cases, prior approval by the SEC. As a BDC, we are generally limited in our ability to invest in any portfolio company in which our Investment Adviser or any of its affiliates currently has an investment or to make any co-investments with our Investment Adviser or its affiliates without an exemptive order from the SEC, subject to certain exceptions. 

We do not intend to acquire securities issued by any investment company that exceed the limits imposed by the Investment Company Act. Under these limits, except for registered money market funds, we generally cannot acquire more than 3% of the voting stock of any investment company, invest more than 5% of the value of our total assets in the securities of one investment company or invest more than 10% of the value of our total assets in the securities of investment companies in the aggregate. The portion of our portfolio invested in securities issued by investment companies ordinarily will subject our stockholders to additional indirect expenses. Our investment portfolio is also subject to diversification requirements by virtue of our intended status to be a RIC for U.S. tax purposes. See Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K &#147; Risk Factors&#151;Risks Related to Our Business and Structure &#148; for more information. 

In addition, investment companies registered under the Investment Company Act and private funds that are excluded from the definition of &#147;investment company&#148; pursuant to either Section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of the 

&#160;

Investment Company Act may not acquire directly or through a controlled entity more than 3% of our total outstanding voting stock (measured at the time of the acquisition), unless the funds comply with an exemption under the Investment Company Act. As a result, certain of our investors may hold a smaller position in our shares than if they were not subject to these restrictions. 

We are generally not able to issue and sell our common stock at a price below net asset value per share. See Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K &#147;Risk Factors&#151;Risks Related to Our Business and Structure&#151;Regulations governing our operation as a BDC affect our ability to, and the way in which we will, raise additional capital. &#148; We may, however, sell our common stock, or warrants, options or rights to acquire our common stock, at a price below the then-current net asset value of our common stock if our Board of Directors determines that such sale is in our best interests and the best interests of our stockholders, and our stockholders approve such sale. In addition, we may generally issue new shares of our common stock at a price below net asset value in rights offerings to existing stockholders, in payment of dividends and in certain other limited circumstances. 

We will be periodically examined by the SEC for compliance with the Investment Company Act. 

As a BDC, we are subject to certain risks and uncertainties. See Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K &#147; Risk Factors&#151;Risks Related to Our Business and Structure. &#148; 

Qualifying Assets 

We may invest up to 30% of our portfolio opportunistically in &#147;non-qualifying assets,&#148; which will be driven primarily through opportunities sourced through the GMS platform. However, under the Investment Company Act, a BDC may not acquire any asset other than assets of the type listed in Section 55(a) of the Investment Company Act, which are referred to as &#147;qualifying assets,&#148; unless, at the time the acquisition is made, qualifying assets represent at least 70% of the BDC&#146;s total assets. The principal categories of qualifying assets relevant to our proposed business are the following: 

&#160;

&#160; (1) Securities purchased in transactions not involving any public offering from the issuer of such securities, which issuer (subject to certain limited exceptions) is an eligible portfolio company, or from any person who is, or has been during the preceding 13 months, an affiliated person of an eligible portfolio company, or from any other person, subject to such rules as may be prescribed by the SEC. An eligible portfolio company is defined in the Investment Company Act as any issuer which: &#160;

&#160; (a) is organized under the laws of, and has its principal place of business in, the United States; &#160;

&#160; (b) is not an investment company (other than a small business investment company wholly owned by the BDC) or a company that would be an investment company but for certain exclusions under the Investment Company Act; and &#160;

&#160; (c) satisfies any of the following: &#160;

&#160; i. does not have any class of securities that is traded on a national securities exchange; &#160;

&#160; ii. has a class of securities listed on a national securities exchange, but has an aggregate market value of outstanding voting and non-voting common equity of less than $250 million; &#160;

&#160; iii. is controlled by a BDC or a group of companies including a BDC and the BDC has an affiliated person who is a director of the eligible portfolio company; or &#160;

&#160; iv. is a small and solvent company having total assets of not more than $4.0 million and capital and surplus of not less than $2.0 million. &#160;

&#160; (2) Securities of any eligible portfolio company which we control. &#160;

&#160; (3) Securities purchased in a private transaction from a U.S. issuer that is not an investment company or from an affiliated person of the issuer, or in transactions incident thereto, if the issuer is in bankruptcy and subject to reorganization or if the issuer, immediately prior to the purchase of its securities, was 

&#160;

&#160; unable to meet its obligations as they came due without material assistance other than conventional lending or financing arrangements. &#160;

&#160; (4) Securities of an eligible portfolio company purchased from any person in a private transaction if there is no ready market for such securities and we already own 60% of the outstanding equity of the eligible portfolio company. &#160;

&#160; (5) Securities received in exchange for or distributed on or with respect to securities described in (1) through (4) above, or pursuant to the exercise of warrants or rights relating to such securities. &#160;

&#160; (6) Cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities or high-quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment. Managerial Assistance to Portfolio Companies 

A BDC must have been organized under the laws of, and have its principal place of business in, any state or states within the United States and must be operated for the purpose of making investments in the types of securities described in (1), (2) or (3) above. However, in order to count portfolio securities as qualifying assets for the purpose of the 70% test, the BDC must either control the issuer of the securities or must offer to make available to the issuer of the securities (other than small and solvent companies described above) significant managerial assistance; except that, where the BDC purchases such securities in conjunction with one or more other persons acting together, one of the other persons in the group may make available such managerial assistance. Making available managerial assistance means, among other things, any arrangement whereby the BDC, through its directors, officers or employees, offers to provide, and, if accepted, does so provide, significant guidance and counsel concerning the management, operations or business objectives and policies of a portfolio company. 

Temporary Investments 

Pending investment in other types of &#147;qualifying assets,&#148; as described above, our investments may consist of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities or high-quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment, which we refer to, collectively, as &#147;temporary investments,&#148; so that 70% of our assets are qualifying assets. We may also invest in U.S. Treasury bills or in repurchase agreements, provided that such agreements are fully collateralized by cash or securities issued by the U.S. government or its agencies. A repurchase agreement involves the purchase by an investor, such as us, of a specified security and the simultaneous agreement by the seller to repurchase it at an agreed-upon future date and at a price which is greater than the purchase price by an amount that reflects an agreed-upon interest rate. There is no percentage restriction on the proportion of our assets that may be invested in such repurchase agreements. However, if more than 25% of our gross assets constitute repurchase agreements from a single counterparty, we would not meet the diversification tests in order to qualify as a RIC. Thus, we do not intend to enter into repurchase agreements with a single counterparty in excess of this limit. Our Investment Adviser will monitor the creditworthiness of the counterparties with which we enter into repurchase agreement transactions. 

Senior Securities 

We are permitted, under specified conditions, to issue multiple classes of indebtedness and one class of stock senior to our common stock if our asset coverage, as defined in the Investment Company Act, is at least equal to 200% immediately after each such issuance. In addition, while any senior securities remain outstanding, we must make provisions to prohibit any distribution to our stockholders or the repurchase of such securities or shares unless we meet the applicable asset coverage ratios at the time of the distribution or repurchase. We may also borrow amounts up to 5% of the value of our total assets for temporary or emergency purposes without regard to asset coverage. 

&#160;

Code of Ethics 

We and CGMSIM have each adopted a code of ethics pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under the Investment Company Act and Rule 204A-1 under the Advisers Act, respectively, that establishes procedures for personal investments and restricts certain transactions by our personnel. Our codes of ethics generally do not permit investments by our and CGMSIM&#146;s personnel in securities that may be purchased or sold by us. 

Compliance Policies and Procedures 

We and CGMSIM have each adopted and implemented written policies and procedures reasonably designed to detect and prevent violation of the federal securities laws and are required to review these compliance policies and procedures annually for their adequacy and the effectiveness of their implementation and designate a Chief Compliance Officer to be responsible for administering the policies and procedures. 

Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended (the &#147;Sarbanes-Oxley Act&#148;) imposes a wide variety of new regulatory requirements on publicly-held companies and their insiders. Many of these requirements affect us. For example: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; pursuant to Rule 13a-14 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#147;Exchange Act&#148;), our President and Chief Financial Officer must certify the accuracy of the financial statements contained in our periodic reports; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; pursuant to Item 307 of Regulation S-K, our periodic reports must disclose our conclusions about the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; pursuant to Rule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act, our management must prepare a report regarding its assessment of our internal control over financial reporting and, starting from the date on which we cease to be an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act, must obtain an audit of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting performed by our independent registered public accounting firm; and &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; pursuant to Item 308 of Regulation S-K and Rule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act, our periodic reports must disclose whether there were significant changes in our internal controls over financial reporting or in other factors that could significantly affect these controls subsequent to the date of their evaluation, including any corrective actions with regard to material weaknesses. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires us to review our current policies and procedures to determine whether we comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder. We will continue to monitor our compliance with all regulations that are adopted under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and will take actions necessary to ensure that we are in compliance therewith. 

Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures 

We have delegated our proxy voting responsibility to our Investment Adviser, CGMSIM. The proxy voting policies and procedures of CGMSIM are set forth below. These guidelines are reviewed periodically by CGMSIM and our directors who are not &#147;interested persons&#148; as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the Investment Company Act (&#147;Independent Directors&#148;), and, accordingly, are subject to change. 

An investment adviser registered under the Advisers Act has a fiduciary duty to act solely in the best interests of its clients. As part of this duty, CGMSIM recognizes that it must vote portfolio securities in a timely manner free of conflicts of interest and in the best interests of its clients. 

These policies and procedures for voting proxies are intended to comply with Section 206 of, and Rule 206(4)-6 under, the Advisers Act. 

&#160;

CGMSIM will vote proxies relating to our portfolio securities in what CGMSIM perceives to be the best interest of our stockholders. CGMSIM will review on a case-by-case basis each proposal submitted to a stockholder vote to determine its impact on the portfolio securities held by us. Although CGMSIM will generally vote against proposals that may have a negative impact on our portfolio securities, CGMSIM may vote for such a proposal if there exist compelling long-term reasons to do so. 

CGMSIM&#146;s proxy voting decisions will be made by the CGMSIM Investment Committee. To ensure that the vote is not the product of a conflict of interest, CGMSIM will require that: (1) anyone involved in the decision making process disclose to the CGMSIM Investment Committee, and Independent Directors, any potential conflict that he or she is aware of and any contact that he or she has had with any interested party regarding a proxy vote; and (2) employees involved in the decision making process or vote administration are prohibited from revealing how CGMSIM intends to vote on a proposal in order to reduce any attempted influence from interested parties.
