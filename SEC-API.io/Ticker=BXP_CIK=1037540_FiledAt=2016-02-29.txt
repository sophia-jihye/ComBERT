 Item 1 . Business 

General 

BXP is a fully integrated, self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust, or &#8220;REIT,&#8221; and one of the largest owners and developers of office properties in the United States. 

Our properties are concentrated in four markets&#8212;Boston, New York, San Francisco and Washington, DC. For information concerning the operations of our segments, see Note 14 &#32;to the Consolidated Financial Statements. At December 31, 2015 , we owned or had interests in 168 &#32;commercial real estate properties, aggregating approximately 46.5 million &#32;net rentable square feet, including eleven &#32;properties under construction/redevelopment totaling approximately 4.6 million &#32;net rentable square feet. As of December 31, 2015 &#32;our properties consisted of: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

158 &#32;office properties, including 127 &#32;Class A office properties (including nine &#32;properties under construction/redevelopment) and 31 &#32;Office/Technical properties; 

&#8226; 

one &#32;hotel; 

&#8226; 

five &#32;retail properties; and 

&#8226; 

four &#32;residential properties (including two under construction). 

We own or control undeveloped land parcels totaling approximately 457.1 &#32;acres, which could support approximately 12.7 million &#32;square feet of additional development. 

We consider Class A office properties to be centrally-located buildings that are professionally managed and maintained, attract high-quality tenants and command upper-tier rental rates, and that are modern structures or have been modernized to compete with newer buildings. We consider Office/Technical properties to be properties that support office, research and development, laboratory and other technical uses. Our definitions of Class A office and Office/Technical properties may be different than those used by other companies. 

We are a full-service real estate company, with substantial in-house expertise and resources in acquisitions, development, financing, capital markets, construction management, property management, marketing, leasing, accounting, risk management, tax and legal services. BXP manages BPLP as its sole general partner. As of December 31, 2015 , we had approximately 765 employees. Our thirty senior officers have an average of thirty-one years of experience in the real estate industry, including an average of nineteen years of experience with us. Our principal executive office and Boston regional office are located at The Prudential Center, 800 Boylston Street, Suite 1900, Boston, Massachusetts 02199 and our telephone number is (617) 236-3300. In addition, we have regional offices at 599 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York 10022; Four Embarcadero Center, San Francisco, California 94111 and 2200 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20037.

The name &#8220;Boston Properties&#8221; and our logo (consisting of a stylized &#8220;b&#8221;) are registered service marks of BPLP. 

Boston Properties Limited Partnership 

BPLP is a Delaware limited partnership, and the entity through which we conduct substantially all of our business and own, either directly or through subsidiaries, substantially all of our assets. BXP is the sole general partner and, as of February 22, 2016 , the owner of approximately 89.4% of the economic interests in BPLP. Economic interest was calculated as the number of common partnership units of BPLP owned by BXP as a percentage of the sum of (1) the actual aggregate number of outstanding common partnership units of BPLP, (2) the number of common units issuable upon conversion of all outstanding long term incentive plan units of BPLP, or LTIP Units, other than LTIP Units issued in the form of Multi-Year Long-Term Incentive Plan Awards (&#8220;MYLTIP Awards&#8221;) that remain subject to performance conditions, assuming all conditions have been met for the conversion of the LTIP Units, (3) the 2012 Outperformance Awards that were issued in the form of LTIP Units and earned as of February 6, 2015 (the &#8220;2012 OPP Units&#8221;) and (4) the 2013 MYLTIP Units that were issued in the form of LTIP Units and earned as of February 4, 2016 (the "2013 MYLTIPS"). An LTIP Unit is generally the economic equivalent of a share of BXP&#8217;s restricted common stock, although LTIP Units issued in the form of MYLTIP Awards are only entitled to receive one- 

tenth (1/10 th ) of the regular quarterly distributions (and no special distributions) prior to being earned. BXP&#8217;s general and limited partnership interests in BPLP entitles BXP to share in cash distributions from, and in the profits and losses of, BPLP in proportion to BXP&#8217;s percentage interest and entitles BXP to vote on all matters requiring a vote of the limited partners. 

Preferred units of BPLP have the rights, preferences and other privileges as are set forth in an amendment to the limited partnership agreement of BPLP. As of December 31, 2015 &#32;and February 22, 2016 , BPLP had one series of Preferred Units outstanding consisting of 80,000 Series B Preferred Units. The Series B Preferred Units have a liquidation preference of $2,500.00 per share (or an aggregate of approximately $193.6 million &#32;at December 31, 2015 &#32;and February 22, 2016 , after deducting the underwriting discount and transaction expenses). The Series B Preferred Units were issued by BPLP on March 27, 2013 in connection with BXP&#8217;s issuance of 80,000 shares (8,000,000 depositary shares each representing 1/100th of a share) of 5.25% Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (the &#8220;Series B Preferred Stock&#8221;). BXP contributed the net proceeds from the offering to BPLP in exchange for Series B Preferred Units having terms and preferences generally mirroring those of the Series B Preferred Stock. BXP will pay cumulative cash dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock at a rate of 5.25% &#32;per annum of the $2,500.00 &#32;liquidation preference per share. BXP may not redeem the Series B Preferred Stock prior to March 27, 2018, except in certain circumstances relating to the preservation of BXP&#8217;s REIT status. On or after March 27, 2018, BXP may redeem the Series B Preferred Stock for a cash redemption price of $2,500.00 &#32;per share, plus all accrued and unpaid dividends. The Series B Preferred Stock is not redeemable by the holders, has no maturity date and is not convertible into any other security of the Company or its affiliates. 

Transactions During 2015 &#32; 

Ground and Air Rights Lease 

On July 31, 2015, we entered into a 99 -year ground and air rights lease (the &#8220;Lease&#8221;) with the Massachusetts Department of Transportation (&#8220;MDOT&#8221;) with respect to the parking garage located at 100 Clarendon Street (the &#8220;Clarendon Garage&#8221;) and the concourse level of the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority&#8217;s Back Bay Station (the &#8220;Station&#8221;). The Lease amends and restates the air rights lease which the Company had assumed in 2010 at the time it acquired its interests in both the Clarendon Garage and the office tower located at 200 Clarendon Street (formerly known as the John Hancock Tower). The Lease requires us to pay a total of approximately $37.0 million &#32;and provides us with options to acquire certain air rights above both the Clarendon Garage and the Station with the amount of developable square footage associated with the air rights to be determined at a later date. The previous lease had 45 &#32;years remaining in its term. Upon execution of the Lease, we made a $5.0 million &#32;payment and the Lease requires our remaining obligation to be used to fund improvements to the Station. 

Dispositions 

For information explaining why BXP and BPLP may have different gains on sales of real estate, see the Explanatory Note. 

On February 19, 2015, we completed the sale of a parcel of land within our Washingtonian North property located in Gaithersburg, Maryland for a gross sale price of $8.7 million . Net cash proceeds totaled approximately $8.4 million, resulting in a gain on sale of real estate totaling approximately $3.5 million. The parcel contains approximately 8.5 &#32;acres of our approximately 27 &#32;acre property. 

On March 17, 2015, we completed the sale of our Residences on The Avenue property located in Washington, DC for a gross sale price of $196.0 million . Net cash proceeds totaled approximately $192.5 million , resulting in a gain on sale of real estate totaling approximately $91.4 million . We have agreed to provide net operating income support of up to $6.0 million &#32;if the property&#8217;s net operating income fails to achieve certain thresholds. As of December 31, 2015, our remaining obligation is approximately $5.2 million. This amount has been recorded as a reduction to the gain on sale. The Residences on The Avenue is comprised of 335 &#32;apartment units and approximately 50,000 &#32;net rentable square feet of retail space, subject to a ground lease that expires on February 1, 2068. 

On September 18, 2015, a consolidated entity in which we have a 50% &#32;interest completed the sale of its 505 9th Street, N.W. property located in Washington, DC for approximately $318.0 million , including the assumption by the buyer of approximately $117.0 million &#32;of mortgage indebtedness (See Note 6 &#32;to the Consolidated Financial Statements). 505 9th Street, N.W. is an approximately 322,000 &#32;net rentable square foot Class A office building. Net cash proceeds totaled approximately $194.6 million , of which our share was approximately $97.3 million . We recognized a gain on sale of real estate totaling approximately $199.5 million &#32;and $199.7 million &#32;for BXP and BPLP, respectively, of which approximately $101.1 million &#32;was allocated to the outside partners and is included within Noncontrolling Interests in Property Partnerships in our Consolidated Statements of Operations (See Note 11 &#32;to the Consolidated Financial Statements). 

On October 1, 2015, we completed the sale of an additional parcel of land within our Washingtonian North property located in Gaithersburg, Maryland for a gross sale price of approximately $13.3 million. Net cash proceeds, which included reimbursements for certain infrastructure costs, totaled approximately $13.8 million, resulting in a gain on sale of real estate totaling approximately $2.0 million. The parcel sold consisted of approximately 5.8 acres of our remaining approximately 18.3 acre property. &#32; 

On December 17, 2015, we completed the sale of our Innovation Place property for a gross sale price of $207.0 million. Net cash proceeds totaled approximately $199.3 million, resulting in a gain on sale of real estate totaling approximately $79.1 and $80.1 million for BXP and BPLP, respectively. Innovation Place, located in San Jose, California, is a 26-acre site with one occupied and three vacant existing office buildings and a total of approximately 574,000 square feet (approximately 463,000 square feet of which are vacant) located at 3100-3130 Zanker Road. The remainder of the site is currently used for 1,699 surface parking spaces, but the land supports an additional 537,000 square feet of office/R&#38;D development and two parking structures with a total of approximately 3,000 parking spaces. &#32; 

Developments/Redevelopments 

As of December 31, 2015 , we had eleven &#32;properties under construction/redevelopment comprised of nine &#32;office properties and two &#32;residential properties, which aggregate approximately 4.6 million &#32;square feet. We estimate the total investment to complete these projects, in the aggregate, is approximately $2.6 billion &#32;of which we had already invested approximately &#32; $1.1 billion &#32;as of December 31, 2015 . For a detailed list of the properties under construction/redevelopment see the following &#8220;Liquidity and Capital Resources&#8221; within &#8220;Item 7&#8212;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.&#8221; 

On May 1, 2015, we commenced the redevelopment of Reservoir Place North, a Class A office project with approximately 73,000 &#32;net rentable square feet located in Waltham, Massachusetts. 

On July 23, 2015, we commenced construction of our Cambridge Residential project, a residential project aggregating approximately 164,000 &#32;square feet comprised of 274 &#32;apartment units and approximately 9,000 &#32;square feet of retail space located in Cambridge, Massachusetts. On August 13, 2015, we acquired an approximately 8,700 &#32;square foot parcel of land necessary for the development for a purchase price of approximately $2.0 million . 

On July 23, 2015, we commenced construction of our Reston Signature Site project, a residential project aggregating approximately 514,000 &#32;square feet comprised of 508 &#32;apartment units and approximately 24,000 &#32;square feet of retail space located in Reston Town Center in Reston, Virginia. 

On August 14, 2015, we partially placed in-service 601 Massachusetts Avenue, a Class A office project with approximately 478,000 &#32;net rentable square feet located in Washington, DC. 

On September 10, 2015, we partially placed in-service The Point (formerly 99 Third Avenue Retail), a retail project with approximately 16,000 net rentable square feet of retail space located in Waltham, Massachusetts. This project was fully placed in-service on November 1, 2015. 

On November 1, 2015, we completed and fully placed in-service 535 Mission Street, a Class A office project with approximately 307,000 net rentable square feet located in San Francisco, California. 

On December 2, 2015, we completed and fully placed in-service 690 Folsom Street, an office and retail project with approximately 26,000 net rentable square feet located in San Francisco, California. 

Secured Debt Transactions 

On September 18, 2015, in connection with the sale of 505 9th Street, N.W. located in Washington, DC by a consolidated entity in which we have a 50% &#32;interest, the consolidated entity assigned to the buyer the mortgage loan collateralized by the property totaling approximately $117.0 million . The assigned mortgage loan bears interest at a fixed rate of 5.73% &#32;per annum and matures on November 1, 2017 (See Note 3 &#32;to the Consolidated Financial Statements). 

On October 1, 2015, we used available cash to repay the mortgage loan collateralized by our Kingstowne Two and Kingstowne Retail properties located in Alexandria, Virginia totaling approximately $29.8 million. The mortgage loan bore interest at a fixed rate of 5.99% per annum and was scheduled to mature on January 1, 2016. There was no prepayment penalty. 

On December 15, 2015, we legally defeased the mortgage loan collateralized by our 100 &#38; 200 Clarendon Street (formerly known as the John Hancock Tower and Garage) properties located in Boston, Massachusetts. The mortgage loan had an outstanding principal balance of $640.5 million, bore interest at a fixed rate of 5.68% per annum and was scheduled to 

mature on January 6, 2017. The cash outlay required for the defeasance in the net amount of approximately $667.3 million was based on the purchase price of U.S. government securities that will generate sufficient cash flow to fund continued interest payments on the loan from the effective date of the defeasance through, and the repayment of the loan on, October 6, 2016, which is the date on which we could repay the loan at par. In connection with the defeasance, the mortgage and other liens on the property were extinguished and all existing collateral, including various guarantees, were released. As a result of the defeasance, we recognized a loss from early extinguishment of debt of approximately $22.0 million, consisting of approximately $26.8 million, which is the difference between the purchase price for the U.S. government securities acquired for the defeasance and the outstanding principal balance of the mortgage loan, and approximately $1.4 million of unamortized deferred financing costs, offset by approximately $4.8 million from the acceleration of the remaining balance of the historical fair value debt adjustment and approximately $1.4 million of accrued interest expense through the effective date of the defeasance. &#32; 

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities 

On February 19, 2015, BPLP commenced a planned interest rate hedging program. To date, BPLP has entered into forward-starting interest rate swap contracts which fix the 10-year swap rate at a weighted-average rate of approximately 2.423% per annum on notional amounts aggregating $550.0 million. The interest rate swap contracts were entered into in advance of a financing by BPLP with a target commencement date in September 2016 and maturity in September 2026. BPLP entered into the interest rate swap contracts designated and qualifying as cash flow hedges to reduce its exposure to the variability in future cash flows attributable to changes in the 10-year swap rate in contemplation of obtaining 10-year fixed-rate financing in September 2016. &#32; 

In addition, our 767 Fifth Partners LLC consolidated entity (the entity in which we have a 60% interest and that owns 767 Fifth Avenue (the General Motors Building) in New York City) entered into forward-starting interest rate swap contracts, including two contracts entered into subsequent to December 31, 2015, which fix the 10-year swap rate at a weighted-average rate of approximately 2.619% per annum on notional amounts aggregating $450.0 million. These interest rate swap contracts were entered into in advance of a financing with a target commencement date in June 2017 and maturity in June 2027. Our 767 Fifth Partners LLC consolidated entity entered into the interest rate swap contracts designated and qualifying as cash flow hedges to reduce its exposure to the variability in future cash flows attributable to changes in the 10-year swap rate in contemplation of obtaining 10-year fixed-rate financing in June 2017 (See Notes 7 and 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). &#32; 

Equity Transactions 

On June 25, 2015, BPLP redeemed the remaining 12,667 Series Four Preferred Units for cash totaling approximately $0.6 million. 

During the year ended December 31, 2015, BXP acquired an aggregate of 424,236 common units of limited partnership interest, including 65,192 common units issued upon the conversion of LTIP Units and 2012 OPP awards presented by the holders for redemption, in exchange for an equal number of shares of common stock. During the year ended December 31, 2015, BXP issued 11,447 shares of common stock as a result of stock options being exercised. 

Special Dividend 

On December 17, 2015, BXP&#8217;s Board of Directors declared a special cash dividend of $1.25 per common share, in addition to its regular quarterly dividend of $0.65 per common share, which were paid on January 28, 2016 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on December 31, 2015. The decision to declare a special dividend was primarily a result of the taxable gains associated with the sale of approximately $584 million of assets in 2015. BXP&#8217;s Board of Directors did not make any change to its policy with respect to regular quarterly dividends. The payment of the regular quarterly dividend of $0.65 per share and the special dividend of $1.25 per share resulted in a total dividend of $1.90 per share on January 28, 2016. Common and LTIP unitholders of limited partnership interest in BPLP, as of the close of business on December 31, 2015, received the same total distribution per unit, on January 28, 2016. 

Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures 

On May 8, 2015, we entered into a joint venture with an unrelated third party to redevelop an existing building into a Class A office building totaling approximately 115,000 &#32;net rentable square feet at 1265 Main Street in Waltham, Massachusetts. The joint venture partner contributed real estate and improvements, with an aggregate fair value of approximately $9.4 million , for its initial 50% &#32;interest in the joint venture. For our initial 50% &#32;interest, we will contribute cash totaling approximately $9.4 million &#32;as the joint venture incurs costs. The joint venture has entered into a fifteen -year lease with a tenant to occupy 100% &#32;of the building. 

On June 26, 2015, we entered into a joint venture with an unrelated third party to develop Dock72, an office building totaling approximately 670,000 &#32;net rentable square feet located at the Brooklyn Navy Yard in Brooklyn, New York. Each partner contributed cash totaling approximately $9.1 million &#32;for their initial 50% &#32;interest in the joint venture. The joint venture entered into a 96 -year ground lease, comprised of an initial term of 46 &#32;years, which may be extended by the joint venture to 2111, subject to certain conditions. The joint venture also entered into a 20 -year lease with a tenant to occupy approximately 222,000 &#32;net rentable square feet at the building. In addition, the joint venture entered into an option agreement pursuant to which it may lease an additional land parcel at the site, which could support between 600,000 &#32;and 1,000,000 &#32;net rentable square feet of development. In connection with the execution of the option agreement, the joint venture paid a non-refundable option payment of $1.0 million . 

On September 22, 2015, a joint venture in which we have a 50% &#32;interest completed and fully placed in-service Annapolis Junction Building Seven, a Class A office project with approximately 127,000 &#32;net rentable square feet located in Annapolis, Maryland. 

On September 30, 2015, a joint venture in which we have a 50% &#32;interest extended the loan collateralized by its Annapolis Junction Building Six property. At the time of the extension, the outstanding balance of the construction loan totaled approximately $13.4 million &#32;and was scheduled to mature on November 17, 2015. The extended loan has a total commitment amount of $15.9 million , bears interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR plus 2.25% &#32;per annum and matures on November 17, 2016 . Annapolis Junction Building Six is a Class A office property with approximately 119,000 &#32;net rentable square feet located in Annapolis, Maryland. 

On October 22, 2015, a joint venture in which we have a 50% interest commenced construction of the Hub on Causeway at North Station containing approximately 385,000 net rentable square feet of retail and office space located in Boston, Massachusetts. 

On December 22, 2015, a joint venture in which we have a 50% interest completed and fully placed in-service Annapolis Junction Building Eight, a Class A office project with approximately 126,000 net rentable square feet located in Annapolis, Maryland. 

Stock Option and Incentive Plan 

On January 21, 2015, BXP&#8217;s Compensation Committee approved a new equity-based, multi-year, long-term incentive program (the &#8220;2015 MYLTIP&#8221;) as a performance-based component of our overall compensation program. Under the Financial Accounting Standards Board&#8217;s Accounting Standards Codification (&#8220;ASC&#8221;) 718 &#8220;Compensation - Stock Compensation,&#8221; the 2015 MYLTIP has an aggregate grant fair value of approximately $15.7 million, which amount will generally be amortized into earnings over the four-year plan period under the graded vesting method (See Note 17 &#32;to the Consolidated Financial Statements). 

On February 6, 2015, the measurement period for our 2012 OPP Unit awards ended and BXP&#8217;s total stockholder return (&#8220;TSR&#8221;) performance was sufficient for employees to earn and therefore become eligible to vest in a portion of the 2012 OPP Unit awards. The final outperformance pool was determined to be approximately $32.1 million, or approximately 80% of the total maximum outperformance pool of $40.0 million. As a result, 174,549 2012 OPP Units were automatically forfeited. 

Business and Growth Strategies 

Business Strategies 

Our primary business objective is to maximize return on investment so as to provide our investors with the greatest possible total return in all points of the economic cycle. Our strategies to achieve this objective are: 

&#8226; 

to target a few carefully selected geographic markets, including Boston, New York, San Francisco and Washington, DC, and to be one of the leading, if not the leading, owners, developers and managers in each of those markets with a full-service office in each market providing property management, leasing, development, construction and legal expertise. We select markets and submarkets with a diverse economic base and a deep pool of prospective tenants in various industries and where tenants have demonstrated a preference for high-quality office buildings and other facilities. We have explored and may continue to explore for future investment select domestic and international markets that exhibit these same traits; 

&#8226; 

to emphasize markets and submarkets within those markets where the lack of available sites and the difficulty of receiving the necessary approvals for development and the necessary financing constitute high barriers to the creation 

of new supply, and where skill, financial strength and diligence are required to successfully develop, finance and manage high-quality office, research and development space, as well as selected retail and residential space; 

&#8226; 

to take on complex, technically challenging development projects, leveraging the skills of our management team to successfully develop, acquire or reposition properties that other organizations may not have the capacity or resources to pursue; 

&#8226; 

to own and develop high-quality real estate designed to meet the demands of today&#8217;s tenants who require sophisticated telecommunications and related infrastructure, support services, sustainable features and amenities, and to manage those facilities so as to become the landlord of choice for both existing and prospective clients; 

&#8226; 

to opportunistically acquire assets which increase our penetration in the markets in which we have chosen to concentrate, as well as potential new markets, which exhibit an opportunity to improve or preserve returns through repositioning (through a combination of capital improvements and shift in marketing strategy), changes in management focus and leasing; 

&#8226; 

to explore joint venture opportunities with existing property owners located in desirable locations, who seek to benefit from the depth of development and management expertise we are able to provide and our access to capital, and/or to explore joint venture opportunities with strategic institutional partners, leveraging our skills as owners, operators and developers of Class A office space and mixed-use complexes; 

&#8226; 

to pursue on a selective basis the sale of properties or interests therein, including core properties, to either (1) take advantage of the demand for our premier properties and realize the value we have created or (2) pare from our portfolio properties that we believe have slower future growth potential; 

&#8226; 

to seek third-party development contracts, which can be a significant source of revenue and enable us to retain and utilize our existing development and construction management staff, especially when our internal development is less active or when new development is less-warranted due to market conditions; and 

&#8226; 

to enhance our capital structure through our access to a variety of sources of capital and proactively manage our debt expirations. I n the current economic climate with historically low interest rates we have and will continue to attempt to lower the cost of our debt capital and seek opportunities to lock in such low rates through early debt repayment, refinancings and interest rate hedges. 

Growth Strategies 

External Growth Strategies 

We believe that our development experience and our organizational depth position us to continue to selectively develop a range of property types, including high-rise urban developments, mixed-use developments (including office, residential and retail), low-rise suburban office properties and research and laboratory space, within budget and on schedule. We believe we are also well positioned to achieve external growth through acquisitions. Other factors that contribute to our competitive position include: 

&#8226; 

&#160; our control of sites (including sites under contract or option to acquire) in our markets that could support in excess of 12.7 million &#32;additional square feet of new office, retail and residential development; 

&#8226; 

our reputation gained through 46 &#32;years of successful operations and the stability and strength of our existing portfolio of properties; 

&#8226; 

our relationships with leading national corporations, universities and public institutions, including government agencies, seeking new facilities and development services; 

&#8226; 

our relationships with nationally recognized financial institutions that provide capital to the real estate industry; 

&#8226; 

our track record and reputation for executing acquisitions efficiently provide comfort to domestic and foreign institutions, private investors and corporations who seek to sell commercial real estate in our market areas; 

&#8226; 

our ability to act quickly on due diligence and financing; 

&#8226; 

our relationships with institutional buyers and sellers of high-quality real estate assets; and 

&#8226; 

our ability to procure entitlements from multiple municipalities to develop sites and attract land owners to sell or partner with us. 

Opportunities to execute our external growth strategy fall into three categories: 

&#8226; 

Development in selected submarkets. &#32;We believe the additional development of well-positioned office buildings, residential buildings and mixed-use complexes could be justified in our markets. We believe in acquiring land after taking into consideration timing factors relating to economic cycles and in response to market conditions that allow for its development at the appropriate time. While we purposely concentrate in markets with high barriers-to-entry, we have demonstrated throughout our 46 -year history, an ability to make carefully timed land acquisitions in submarkets where we can become one of the market leaders in establishing rent and other business terms. We believe that there are opportunities at key locations in our existing and other markets for a well-capitalized developer to acquire land with development potential. 

In the past, we have been particularly successful at acquiring sites or options to purchase sites that need governmental approvals for development. Because of our development expertise, knowledge of the governmental approval process and reputation for quality development with local government regulatory bodies, we generally have been able to secure the permits necessary to allow development and to profit from the resulting increase in land value. We seek complex projects where we can add value through the efforts of our experienced and skilled management team leading to attractive returns on investment. 

Our strong regional relationships and recognized development expertise have enabled us to capitalize on unique build-to-suit opportunities. We intend to seek and expect to continue to be presented with such opportunities in the near term allowing us to earn relatively significant returns on these development opportunities through multiple business cycles. 

&#8226; 

Acquisition of assets and portfolios of assets from institutions or individuals. &#32;We believe that due to our size, management strength and reputation, we are well positioned to acquire portfolios of assets or individual properties from institutions or individuals if valuations meet our criteria. In addition, we believe that our market knowledge and our liquidity and access to capital may provide us with a competitive advantage when pursuing acquisitions. There may be enhanced opportunities to purchase assets with near-term financing maturities or possibly provide debt on assets at enhanced yields. Opportunities to acquire properties may also come through the purchase of first mortgage or mezzanine debt. We may also acquire properties for cash, but we are also particularly well-positioned to appeal to sellers wishing to contribute on a tax-deferred basis their ownership of property for equity in a diversified real estate operating company that offers liquidity through access to the public equity markets in addition to a quarterly distribution. Our ability to offer common and preferred units of limited partnership in BPLP to sellers who would otherwise recognize a taxable gain upon a sale of assets or BXP&#8217;s common stock may facilitate this type of transaction on a tax-efficient basis. In addition, we may consider mergers with and acquisitions of compatible real estate firms. 

&#8226; 

Acquisition of underperforming assets and portfolios of assets . We believe that because of our in-depth market knowledge and development experience in each of our markets, our national reputation with brokers, financial institutions and others involved in the real estate market and our access to competitively-priced capital, we are well-positioned to identify and acquire existing, underperforming properties for competitive prices and to add significant additional value to such properties through our effective marketing strategies, repositioning/redevelopment expertise and a responsive property management program. We have developed this strategy and program for our existing portfolio, where we provide high-quality property management services using our own employees in order to encourage tenants to renew, expand and relocate in our properties. We are able to achieve speed and transaction cost efficiency in replacing departing tenants through the use of in-house and third-party vendors&#8217; services for marketing, including calls and presentations to prospective tenants, print advertisements, lease negotiation and construction of tenant improvements. Our tenants benefit from cost efficiencies produced by our experienced work force, which is attentive to preventive maintenance and energy management. 

Internal Growth Strategies 

We believe that opportunities will exist to increase cash flow from our existing properties because they are of high quality and in desirable locations within markets where, in general, the creation of new supply is limited by the lack of available sites and the difficulty of obtaining the necessary approvals for development on vacant land and financing. Our strategy for maximizing the benefits from these opportunities is three-fold: (1) to provide high-quality property management services using our employees in order to encourage tenants to renew, expand and relocate in our properties, (2) to achieve speed and transaction cost efficiency in replacing departing tenants through the use of in-house services for marketing, lease negotiation and construction of tenant improvements and (3) to work with new or existing tenants with space expansion or contraction needs maximizing the cash flow from our assets. We expect to continue our internal growth as a result of our ability to: &#160; 

&#8226; 

Cultivate existing submarkets and long-term relationships with credit tenants. &#32;In choosing locations for our properties, we have paid particular attention to transportation and commuting patterns, physical environment, adjacency to established business centers, proximity to sources of business growth and other local factors. 

The average lease term of our in-place leases, including unconsolidated joint ventures, was approximately 6.9 &#32;years at December 31, 2015 &#32;and we continue to cultivate long-term leasing relationships with a diverse base of high-quality, financially stable tenants. Based on leases in place at December 31, 2015 , leases with respect to approximately 7.1% of the total square feet in our portfolio, including unconsolidated joint ventures, will expire in calendar year 2016. &#160; 

&#8226; 

Directly manage our office properties to maximize the potential for tenant retention. &#32;We provide property management services ourselves, rather than contracting for this service, to maintain awareness of and responsiveness to tenant needs. We and our properties also benefit from cost efficiencies produced by an experienced work force attentive to preventive maintenance and energy management and from our continuing programs to assure that our property management personnel at all levels remain aware of their important role in tenant relations. 

&#8226; 

Replace tenants quickly at best available market terms and lowest possible transaction costs . We believe that we are well-positioned to attract new tenants and achieve relatively high rental rates as a result of our well-located, well-designed and well-maintained properties, our reputation for high-quality building services and responsiveness to tenants, and our ability to offer expansion and relocation alternatives within our submarkets. 

&#8226; 

Extend terms of existing leases to existing tenants prior to expiration . We have also successfully structured early tenant renewals, which have reduced the cost associated with lease downtime while securing the tenancy of our highest quality credit-worthy tenants on a long-term basis and enhancing relationships. 

Policies with Respect to Certain Activities 

The discussion below sets forth certain additional information regarding our investment, financing and other policies. These policies have been determined by BXP&#8217;s Board of Directors and, in general, may be amended or revised from time to time by the Board of Directors. 

Investment Policies 

Investments in Real Estate or Interests in Real Estate 

Our investment objectives are to provide quarterly cash dividends/distributions to our securityholders and to achieve long-term capital appreciation through increases in our value. We have not established a specific policy regarding the relative priority of these investment objectives. 

We expect to continue to pursue our investment objectives primarily through the ownership of our current properties, development projects and other acquired properties. We currently intend to continue to invest primarily in developments of properties and acquisitions of existing improved properties or properties in need of redevelopment, and acquisitions of land that we believe have development potential, primarily in our existing markets of Boston, New York, San Francisco and Washington, DC. We have explored and may continue to explore for future investment select domestic and international markets that exhibit these same traits. Future investment or development activities will not be limited to a specified percentage of our assets. We intend to engage in such future investment or development activities in a manner that is consistent with the maintenance of BXP&#8217;s status as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. In addition, we may purchase or lease income-producing commercial and other types of properties for long-term investment, expand and improve the real estate presently owned or other properties purchased, or sell such real estate properties, in whole or in part, when circumstances warrant. We do not have a policy that restricts the amount or percentage of assets that will be invested in any specific property, however, our investments may be restricted by our debt covenants. 

We may also continue to participate with third parties in property ownership, through joint ventures or other types of co-ownership. These investments may permit us to own interests in larger assets without unduly restricting diversification and, therefore, add flexibility in structuring our portfolio. 

Equity investments may be subject to existing mortgage financing and other indebtedness or such financing or indebtedness as may be incurred in connection with acquiring or refinancing these investments. Debt service on such financing or indebtedness will have a priority over any distributions with respect to BXP&#8217;s common stock. Investments are also subject to our policy not to be treated as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the &#8220;1940 Act&#8221;). &#160; 

Investments in Real Estate Mortgages 

While our current portfolio consists primarily of, and our business objectives emphasize, equity investments in commercial real estate, we may, at the discretion of the Board of Directors of BXP, invest in mortgages and other types of real estate interests consistent with BXP&#8217;s qualification as a REIT. Investments in real estate mortgages run the risk that one or more borrowers may default under such mortgages and that the collateral securing such mortgages may not be sufficient to enable us to recoup our full investment. We may invest in participating, convertible or traditional mortgages if we conclude that we may benefit from the cash flow, or any appreciation in value of the property or as an entrance to the fee ownership. 

Securities of or Interests in Entities Primarily Engaged in Real Estate Activities 

Subject to the percentage of ownership limitations and gross income and asset tests necessary for BXP&#8217;s REIT qualification, we also may invest in securities of other REITs, other entities engaged in real estate activities or securities of other issuers, including for the purpose of exercising control over such entities. 

Dispositions 

Our decision to dispose or partially dispose of properties is based upon the periodic review of our portfolio and the determination by the Board of Directors of BXP that such action would be in our best interests. Any decision to dispose of a property will be authorized by the Board of Directors of BXP or a committee thereof. Some holders of limited partnership interests in BPLP, including Mortimer B. Zuckerman, could incur adverse tax consequences upon the sale of certain of our properties that differ from the tax consequences to BXP. Consequently, holders of limited partnership interests in BPLP may have different objectives regarding the appropriate pricing and timing of any such sale. Such different tax treatment derives in most cases from the fact that we acquired these properties in exchange for partnership interests in contribution transactions structured to allow the prior owners to defer taxable gain. Generally this deferral continues so long as we do not dispose of the properties in a taxable transaction. Unless a sale by us of these properties is structured as a like-kind exchange under Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code or in a manner that otherwise allows deferral to continue, recognition of the deferred tax gain allocable to these prior owners is generally triggered by a sale. One of our assets is subject to a tax protection agreement, which may limit our ability to dispose of it or require us to pay damages to the prior owner in the event of a taxable sale. 

Financing Policies &#160; 

The agreement of limited partnership of BPLP and BXP&#8217;s certificate of incorporation and bylaws do not limit the amount or percentage of indebtedness that we may incur. Further, we do not have a policy limiting the amount of indebtedness that we may incur, nor have we established any limit on the number or amount of mortgages that may be placed on any single property or on our portfolio as a whole. However, our mortgages, credit facilities and unsecured debt securities contain customary restrictions, requirements and other limitations on our ability to incur indebtedness. 

The Board of Directors of BXP will consider a number of factors when evaluating our level of indebtedness and when making decisions regarding the incurrence of indebtedness, including the purchase price of properties to be acquired with debt financing, the estimated market value of our properties upon refinancing, the entering into agreements such as interest rate swaps, caps, floors and other interest rate hedging contracts and the ability of particular properties and us as a whole to generate cash flow to cover expected debt service. &#160; 

Policies with Respect to Other Activities 

As the sole general partner of BPLP, BXP has the authority to issue additional common and preferred units of limited partnership interest of BPLP. BXP has issued, and may in the future issue, common or preferred units of limited partnership interest to persons who contribute their direct or indirect interests in properties to us in exchange for such common or preferred units. We have not engaged in trading, underwriting or agency distribution or sale of securities of issuers other than BPLP and we do not intend to do so. At all times, we intend to make investments in such a manner as to enable BXP to maintain its qualification as a REIT, unless, due to changes in circumstances or to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (or the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder), the Board of Directors of BXP determines that it is no longer in the best interest of BXP to qualify as a REIT. We may make loans to third parties, including, without limitation, to joint ventures in which we participate or in connection with the disposition of a property. We intend to make investments in such a way that we will not be treated as an investment company under the 1940 Act. Our policies with respect to these and other activities may be reviewed and modified or amended from time to time by the Board of Directors of BXP. &#160; 

Sustainability 

As one of the largest owners and developers of office properties in the United States, we actively work to promote our growth and operations in a sustainable and responsible manner across our four regions. Our sustainability strategy is broadly focused on the economic, social and environmental aspects of our activities, which include the design and construction of our new developments and the operation of our existing buildings. We are focused on creating healthy workspaces and high performance properties while simultaneously mitigating operational costs and the potential external impacts of energy, water, waste and greenhouse gas emissions. As a company with a core strategy of long-term ownership, we are committed to charitable giving, volunteerism and public realm investments that make a positive impact on the communities in which we conduct business. Through these efforts, we demonstrate that operating and developing commercial real estate can be conducted with a conscious regard for the environment while mutually benefiting our tenants, investors, employees and the communities in which we operate. 

During 2015, the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") selected BXP as a joint winner of NAREIT&#8217;s Office Leader in the Light Award - the highest achievement for all office REITs and real estate companies. BXP was selected by a panel of judges that evaluated disclosures summarizing implemented energy and water conservation measures, renewable energy procurement, waste diversion and the results of the Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark (&#8220;GRESB&#8221;) assessment. In the GRESB assessment, BXP ranked 24 th &#32;out of 688 global companies, among the top 4% of all participants. 2015 was the fourth straight year that BXP has ranked in the top quartile of GRESB assessment participants, earning another &#8220;Green Star&#8221; recognition. 

Our sustainability strategy, key performance indicators and achievements are disclosed on our website at http://www.bostonproperties.com under the heading &#8220;Sustainability&#8221;. 

Competition 

We compete in the leasing of office, retail and residential space with a considerable number of other real estate companies, some of which may have greater marketing and financial resources than are available to us. In addition, our hotel property competes for guests with other hotels, some of which may have greater marketing and financial resources than are available to us and to the manager of our one hotel, Marriott International, Inc. &#160; 

Principal factors of competition in our primary business of owning, acquiring and developing office properties are the quality of properties, leasing terms (including rent and other charges and allowances for tenant improvements), attractiveness and convenience of location, the quality and breadth of tenant services provided, and reputation as an owner and operator of quality office properties in the relevant market. Additionally, our ability to compete depends upon, among other factors, trends of the national and local economies, investment alternatives, financial condition and operating results of current and prospective tenants, availability and cost of capital, construction and renovation costs, taxes, utilities, governmental regulations, legislation and population trends. &#160; 

In addition, we currently have four residential properties (including two under construction) and may in the future decide to acquire or develop additional residential properties. As an owner and operator of apartments, we will also face competition for prospective residents from other operators whose properties may be perceived to offer a better location or better amenities or whose rent may be perceived as a better value given the quality, location and amenities that the resident seeks. We will also compete against condominiums and single-family homes that are for sale or rent. Because the scale of our residential portfolio is relatively small, we expect to continue to retain third parties to manage our residential properties. 

Our Hotel Property 

We operate our hotel property through a taxable REIT subsidiary. The taxable REIT subsidiary, a wholly-owned subsidiary of BPLP, is the lessee pursuant to a lease for the hotel property. As lessor, BPLP is entitled to a percentage of gross receipts from the hotel property. The hotel lease allows economic benefits of ownership to flow to us. Marriott International, Inc. continues to manage the hotel property under the Marriott name and under terms of the existing management agreements. Marriott has been engaged under a separate long-term incentive management agreement to operate and manage the hotel on behalf of the taxable REIT subsidiary. In connection with these arrangements, Marriott has agreed to operate and maintain our hotel in accordance with its system-wide standard for comparable hotels and to provide the hotel with the benefits of its central reservation system and other chain-wide programs and services. Under a management agreement for the hotel, Marriott acts as the taxable REIT subsidiary&#8217;s agent to supervise, direct and control the management and operation of the hotel and receives as compensation base management fees that are calculated as a percentage of the hotel&#8217;s gross revenues, and supplemental incentive fees if the hotel exceeds negotiated profitability breakpoints. In addition, the taxable REIT subsidiary compensates Marriott, on the basis of a formula applied to the hotel&#8217;s gross revenues, for certain system-wide services provided by Marriott, 

including central reservations, marketing and training. During 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , Marriott received an aggregate of approximately $2.9 million, $1.0 million and $1.2 million, respectively, from our taxable REIT subsidiary.

&#8226; 

The Board of Directors has adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, which governs business decisions made and actions taken by BXP&#8217;s directors, officers and employees. A copy of this code is available on our website at http://www.bostonproperties.com under the heading &#8220;Corporate Governance&#8221; and subheading &#8220;Code of Conduct and Ethics.&#8221; BXP intends to disclose on this website any amendment to, or waiver of, any provisions of this Code applicable to the directors and executive officers of BXP that would otherwise be required to be disclosed under the rules of the SEC or the New York Stock Exchange. 

&#8226; 

The Board of Directors has established an ethics reporting system that employees may use to anonymously report possible violations of the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, including concerns regarding questionable accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters, by telephone or over the internet. 

&#8226;

Recent Tax Legislation Affecting BXP and BPLP &#32; 

Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 

On November 2, 2015, Congress enacted the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015. Among other things, this Act changes the rules applicable to federal income tax audits of partnerships (such as BPLP) and the collection of any tax resulting from any such audits or other tax proceedings. Under the new rules, the partnership itself must pay any &#8220;imputed underpayments,&#8221; consisting of delinquent taxes, interest, and penalties deemed to arise out of an audit of the partnership, unless certain alternative methods are available and the partnership elects to utilize them. 

The new rule generally does not apply to audits of taxable years beginning before January 1, 2018, and many of the details, including the means by which a partnership can avail itself of the alternative methods and the manner in which the alternative methods may apply to REITs, will be determined through yet-to-be-proposed Treasury Regulations. Therefore, it is not clear at this time what effect this new legislation will have on us. However, it is possible that in the future, BXP or BPLP, or both, could be subject to, or otherwise bear the economic burden of, federal income tax, interest, and penalties resulting from a federal income tax audit as a result of the changes enacted by the Act. 

Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 

On December 18, 2015, Congress enacted the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015. This legislation modifies a number of rules pertaining to qualification as a REIT and the taxation of REITs and their shareholders, including, among others, the following changes to certain rules described in the disclosure set forth in our prospectus: 

&#8226; 

For tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, not more than 20% of our total assets may be represented by securities of one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries. At this time, the securities we own in our taxable REIT subsidiaries do not, in the aggregate, exceed 20% of the total value of our assets. 

&#8226; 

A 100% excise tax is imposed on &#8220;redetermined TRS service income,&#8221; which is income of a taxable REIT subsidiary attributable to services provided to, or on behalf of its associated REIT and which would otherwise be increased on distribution, apportionment, or allocation under Section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (i.e., as a result of a determination that the income was not arm&#8217;s length).
