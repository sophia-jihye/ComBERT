 ITEM 1. 

BUSINESS 

Overview

We are a leading provider of mission-critical, sophisticated software products and software-enabled services that allow financial services providers to automate complex business processes and effectively manage their information processing requirements. Our portfolio of software products and rapidly deployable software-enabled services allows our clients to automate and integrate front-office functions such as trading and modeling, middle-office functions such as portfolio management and reporting, and back-office functions such as accounting, performance measurement, reconciliation, reporting, processing and clearing. Our solutions enable our clients to focus on core operations, better monitor and manage investment performance and risk, improve operating efficiency and reduce operating costs. We provide our solutions globally to more than 10,000 clients, principally within the institutional asset and wealth management, alternative investment management, financial advisory and financial institutions vertical markets. In addition, our clients include commercial lenders, real estate investment trusts (REITs), corporate treasury groups, insurance and pension funds, municipal finance groups and real estate property managers.

We provide the global financial services industry with a broad range of software-enabled services, which consist of software-enabled outsourcing services and subscription-based on-demand software that are managed and hosted at our facilities, and specialized software products, which are deployed at our clients&#8217; facilities. Our software-enabled services, which combine the strengths of our proprietary software with our domain expertise, enable our clients to contract with us to provide many of their mission-critical and complex business processes. For example, we utilize our software to offer comprehensive fund administration services for alternative investment managers, including fund manager services, transfer agency services, funds-of-funds services, tax processing and accounting. We offer clients the flexibility to choose from multiple software delivery options, including on-premise applications and hosted, multi-tenant or dedicated applications. Additionally, we provide certain clients with targeted, blended solutions based on a combination of our various software and software-enabled services. We believe that our software-enabled services provide superior client support and an attractive alternative to clients that do not wish to install, manage and maintain complicated financial software.

Our business model is characterized by substantial contractually recurring revenues, high operating margins and significant cash flow. We generate revenues primarily through our high-value software-enabled services, which are typically sold on a long-term subscription basis and integrated into our clients&#8217; business processes. Our software-enabled services are generally provided under non-cancelable contracts with initial terms of one to five years that require monthly or quarterly payments and are subject to automatic annual renewal at the end of the initial term unless terminated by either party. We also generate revenues by licensing our software to clients through either perpetual or term licenses and by selling maintenance services. Maintenance services are generally provided under annually renewable contracts. As a consequence, a significant portion of our revenues consists of subscription payments and maintenance fees and is contractually recurring in nature. Our pricing typically scales as a function of our clients&#8217; assets under management, the complexity of asset classes managed, the volume of transactions, and the level of service the client requires.

Our contractually recurring revenue model helps us minimize the fluctuations in revenues and cash flows typically associated with up-front, perpetual software license revenues and enhances our ability to manage costs. Our contractually recurring revenues, which include as our software-enabled services and maintenance and term licenses revenues, represented 92% of total revenues in the year ended December 31, 2015. We have experienced average revenue retention rates in each of the last five years of greater than 90% on our software-enabled services and maintenance and term licenses contracts for our core enterprise products. We believe that the high value-added nature of our products and services has enabled us to maintain our high revenue retention rates and significant operating margins.

We generated revenues of $1,000.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to revenues of $767.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. In 2015, we generated 74% of our revenues from clients in North America and 26% from clients outside North America. Our revenues are highly diversified, with our largest client in 2015 accounting for less than 5% of our revenues. Additional financial information, including geographic information, is available in our consolidated financial statements and Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements.

Our Industry

We serve a number of vertical markets within the financial services industry, including alternative investment funds, investment management firms, insurance companies, registered investment advisors (RIAs), wealth managers, banks and brokerage firms. We believe that financial services providers will increasingly turn to information technology, or IT, solutions, provided by an independent vendor, as a result of economic challenges and heightened regulatory requirements. Financial service firms are in a search for more risk-averse business strategies and simplified regulatory compliance. As a result, we believe the financial services industry will continue to increase its investments in IT solutions in 2016.

Market Trends 

The demand for our products and services comes from a number of distinct sources: new hedge fund and private equity fund formation, new business lines and combinations of business lines at existing clients, replacement of legacy and competitor systems and expansion of our existing client relationships. Underlying these demand drivers are several industry trends, including:

&#160;

&#9679; 

Asset Classes and Securities Products Growing in Volume and Complexity. Investment professionals must increasingly track and invest in numerous asset classes that are far more complex than traditional equity and debt instruments. These assets require more sophisticated systems to automate functions such as trading and modeling, portfolio management, accounting, performance measurement, reconciliation, reporting, processing and clearing. Manual tracking of orders and other transactions is not effective for these assets. In addition, as the business knowledge requirements increase, financial services firms see increasing value in outsourcing the management of these assets to firms such as SS&#38;C that offer software-enabled services.

&#160;

&#9679; 

Regulatory changes. Our clients must comply with rules, regulations, directives, and standards from governmental and self-regulating organizations. Even years after the enactment of Dodd-Frank, Form PF, AIFMD, FATCA, EMIR and other local reforms, many of the rules are still being defined. We expect regulatory changes to increase the complexity of compliance and the demand for our products and services and motivate clients to develop systems infrastructure and research management processes to comply with regulatory requirements.

&#160;

&#9679; 

Technological paradigm shift . We have recently seen an increased demand for software delivery options, including cloud-based services, social collaboration and information access through mobile devices. Cloud solutions allow firms to use a broader range of capabilities without incurring implementation or maintenance costs, with software that can be upgraded with limited disruption to a company&#8217;s current operations. Accessibility and demands for collaboration is also a key driver of cloud adoption. Mobility is increasingly relevant for the investment management industry and therefore we believe clients have increased expectations of anytime, anywhere access to portfolio and client data, as well as the ability to communicate and collaborate.

&#160;

&#9679; 

Increased demands for transparency, efficiency, and risk management . Firms continue to focus on operational risk, resulting from discoveries of fraud and mismanagement during the 2008-2012 U.S. financial crisis and concerns regarding transparency and counterparty exposure. This continued focus has led investment management firms to strive to provide investment data accurately, institutionalize investment operations, and automate their investment process. On the wealth management and advisory sides of our business, we have seen further evolution of the relationship between the end client and a firm, with investors demanding transparency and a customized client experience. We expect that wealth managers will need to become familiar with their clients&#8217; preferences for account access and communication and cater to them. Finally, both institutional and individual investors, faced with increasingly competitive low-fee and automated options, are pushing investment managers for greater efficiencies and lower fees.

Competitive Strengths

The following are our core strengths that we believe enable us to differentiate ourselves in the markets we serve:

Enhanced capability through software ownership. 

We use our proprietary software products and infrastructure to provide our software-enabled services, strengthening our overall operating margins and providing a competitive advantage. Because we primarily use our own proprietary software in the execution of our software-enabled services and generally own and control our products&#8217; source code, we can quickly identify and deploy product improvements and respond to client feedback, enhancing the competitiveness of our software and software-enabled service offerings. This continuous feedback process provides us with a significant advantage over many of our competitors, specifically those software competitors that do not provide a comparable model and therefore do not have the same level of hands-on experience with their products.

Global industry leader with strong market position focused on software and software-enabled services for the financial industry. 

We are a global business providing a broad portfolio of over 90 software products and software-enabled services and have 80 offices worldwide. As of December 31, 2015, we had 5,335 development, service and support professionals with significant expertise across the industries that we serve and a deep working knowledge of our clients&#8217; businesses. We provide highly flexible, scalable and cost-effective solutions that enable our clients to track complex securities, better employ sophisticated investment strategies, scale efficiently and meet evolving regulatory requirements. We believe our product and service offerings position us as a leader within the specific verticals of the financial services software and services market in which we compete. Our products and services allow our clients to automate and integrate their front-office, middle-office and back-office functions, thus enabling straight-through processing that increases productivity and reduces costs. 

Trusted provider to our highly diversified and growing client base. 

By providing mission-critical, reliable software products and services for 30 years, we have become a trusted provider to the financial services industry. We have developed a large and growing installed base within multiple segments of the financial services industry. Our clients include some of the largest and most well-recognized firms in the financial services industry. We believe that our high-quality products and superior services have led to long-term client relationships, some of which date from our earliest days of operations. Our strong client relationships, coupled with the fact that many of our current clients use our products for a relatively small portion of their total funds and investment vehicles under management, provide us with a significant opportunity to sell additional solutions to our existing clients and drive future revenue growth at lower cost.

Independent fund administration services. 

The third-party service providers that participate in the alternative investment market include fund managers, auditors, fund administrators, attorneys, custodians and prime brokers. Each provider performs a valuable function with the intention of providing transparency of the fund&#8217;s assets and the valuation of those assets. Conflicts of interest may arise when the above parties attempt to provide more than one of these services. The industry is increasingly recognizing these conflicts and, as a result, seeking independent fund administrators such as SS&#38;C.

Experienced management team with strong integrating and operating track record. 

We were founded in 1986 by William C. Stone, who has served as our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer since our inception. Our senior management team has a track record of operational excellence and an average of more than 20 years of experience in the software and financial services industries, and a proven ability to acquire and integrate complementary businesses, as demonstrated by the 43 businesses we have acquired since 1995 . By leveraging our domain expertise and knowledge, we have developed, and continue to improve, our mission-critical software products and services to enable our clients to overcome the complexities inherent in their businesses. Our management team is highly committed to our long-term success, and our Chief Executive Officer is highly invested in our long-term potential, as evidenced by his beneficial ownership of 16.8% of our equity as of February 24, 2015 . 

Business Strategies

Our strategy is to continue to deliver compelling solutions and value propositions to our customers in the software and software-enabled services market. The following are key elements to our strategy for achieving this objective:

Build upon and extend our leadership position in software and software-enabled services in the financial industry. 

Since our founding in 1986, we have focused on building substantial financial services domain expertise through close working relationships with our clients. We have developed a deep knowledge base that enables us to respond to our clients&#8217; most complex financial, accounting, actuarial, tax and regulatory needs. We intend to maintain and enhance our technological leadership by using our domain expertise to build valuable new software-enabled services and solutions, continuing to invest in internal development and opportunistically acquiring products and services that address the highly specialized needs of the financial services industry.

Our internal product development team works closely with marketing and client service personnel to ensure that product evolution reflects developments in the marketplace and trends in client requirements. In addition, we intend to continue to develop our products in a cost-effective manner by leveraging common components across product families. We believe that we enjoy a competitive advantage because we can address the investment and financial management needs of high-end clients by providing industry-tested products and services, including cloud-based services and related mobility platforms that meet global market demands and enable our clients to automate and integrate their front-, middle- and back-office functions for improved productivity, reduced manual intervention and bottom-line savings. SS&#38;C&#8217;s products for niche market players in the financial services industry to the largest institutions in the world. Furthermore, our client base of 10,000 clients represents a fraction of the total number of financial services providers globally. We believe there is opportunity to grow our client base over time as our products become more widely adopted. We believe we also have an opportunity to capitalize on the increasing adoption of outsourcing mission-critical operations by financial services providers as they continue to replace inadequate legacy solutions and custom in-house solutions that are inflexible and costly to maintain Our software-enabled services revenues increased from $552.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 to $670.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, representing a compound annual growth rate of 10.1%.

Capitalize on longer-term secular growth trends. 

With our global footprint and best-in-class product offerings, we aim to capture a significant share of the IT spend of alternative asset, institutional asset and wealth managers through leveraging the deeply embedded service offering we provide and outdistancing 

the competition. We expect regulatory changes to increase the compl exity of compliance and the demand for our products and services, as well as motivate clients to develop infrastructure and research management processes to mitigate regulatory exposure. We plan to benefit from the growing software spend in the increasingl y complex and more highly regulated financial services landscape. 

Continue to capitalize on acquisitions of complementary businesses and technologies. 

We intend to continue to employ a highly disciplined and focused acquisition strategy to broaden and enhance our product and service offerings, expand our intellectual property portfolio, add new clients and supplement our internal development efforts. We believe our acquisitions have been an extension of our research and development effort that has enabled us to purchase proven products and remove the uncertainties associated with software development projects. We will seek to opportunistically acquire, at reasonable valuations, businesses, products and technologies in our existing or complementary vertical markets that will enable us to better satisfy our clients&#8217; rigorous and evolving needs. We have a proven ability to integrate complementary businesses as demonstrated by the 43 businesses we have acquired since 1995. Our experienced senior management team leads a rigorous evaluation of our targets to ensure that they satisfy our product or service needs and will successfully integrate with our business while meeting our targeted financial goals. As a result, our acquisitions have contributed marketable products or services that have added to our revenues. Through the broad reach of our direct sales force and our large installed client base, we believe we can market these acquired products and services to a large number of prospective clients. Additionally, we have been able to improve the operational performance and profitability of our acquired businesses, creating significant value for our stockholders.

Strengthen our international presence. 

We believe that there is a significant market opportunity to provide software and services to financial services providers outside North America. In the year ended December 31, 2015, we generated 26% of our revenues from clients outside North America. We are building our international operations in order to increase our sales outside North America. We plan to continue to expand our international market presence by leveraging our existing software products and software-enabled services. For example, we believe that the rapidly growing alternative investment management market in Europe presents a compelling growth opportunity.

Increase profitability through margin expansion.

We have a proven track record of increasing operating margins both organically and inorganically. We expect to continue to improve margins through cost reductions, operating efficiencies, and realization of cost synergies. We also expect to drive increased margins through delivering innovative end-to-end solutions that provide significant value to customers and warrant premium pricing. We have significant scale with best-in-class solutions and software-enabled services across the delivery spectrum, which we believe, combined with a diversified service offering and client base, drives stable revenues and increased operating leverage. Our operating flexibility allows us to scale our costs based on client demands. Additionally, our low capital expenditure and working capital requirements further drive strong cash flow conversions.

Our Acquisitions

As mentioned above, we intend to continue to employ a highly disciplined and focused acquisition strategy. Our past acquisitions have enabled us to expand our product and service offerings into new markets or client bases within the financial services industry. The addition of new products and services has also enabled us to market other products and services to acquired client bases. We believe our acquisitions have been an extension of our research and development effort and have enabled us add to our product and service offerings without incurring the uncertainties sometimes associated with software development projects.

Since 1995, we have acquired 43 businesses within our industry. These acquisitions have contributed marketable products and services, which have added to our revenues and earnings. We have generally been able to improve the operating performance and profitability of our acquired businesses. We seek to reduce the costs of the acquired businesses by consolidating sales and marketing efforts and by eliminating redundant administrative tasks and research and development expenses. In many cases, we have also been able to increase revenues generated by acquired products and services by leveraging our existing products and services, larger sales capabilities and client base.

We generally seek to acquire companies that satisfy our financial metrics, including expected return on investment. Through our acquisitions, we seek companies that:

&#160;

&#9679; 

provide complementary products or services in the financial services industry;

&#160;

&#9679; 

possess proven technology and an established client base that will provide a source of ongoing revenue and to whom we may be able to sell existing products and services;

&#160;

&#9679; 

expand our intellectual property portfolio to complement our business;

&#160;

&#9679; 

address a highly specialized problem or a market niche in the financial services industry; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

expand our global reach into strategic geographic markets; and

&#160;

&#9679; 

have solutions that lend themselves to being delivered as software-enabled services.

We believe, based on our experience, that there are numerous solution providers addressing highly particularized financial services needs or providing specialized services that would meet our disciplined acquisition criteria.

Acquisitions are discussed further in Liquidity and Capital Resources and in Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements, including our agreement to acquire Citigroup&#8217;s Alternative Investor Services business.

We also use telemarketing to support sales of our real estate property management products and work through alliance partners that sell our software-enabled services to their correspondent banking clients.

Our marketing personnel have extensive experience in marketing to the financial services industry and are responsible for identifying market trends, evaluating and developing marketing opportunities, generating client leads and providing sales support. Our marketing activities focus on cost-effective means of reaching current and potential clients, including:

&#160;

&#160;

&#9679;

&#160;

&#9679; 

seminars and symposiums,

&#160;

&#9679; 

trade shows and conferences, and

&#9679; 

e-marketing campaigns.

Product Development and Engineering 

We believe we must introduce new products and offer product innovation on a regular basis to maintain our competitive advantage. To meet these goals, we use multidisciplinary teams of highly trained personnel and leverage this expertise across all product lines. We have invested heavily in developing a comprehensive product analysis process to ensure a high degree of product functionality and quality. Maintaining and improving the integrity, quality and functionality of existing products is the responsibility of individual product managers. Product engineering management efforts focus on enterprise-wide strategies, implementing best-practice technology regimens, maximizing resources and mapping out an integration plan for our entire umbrella of products as well as third-party products. For the years ended December 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015, our research and development expenses were $53.9 million, $57.3 million and $110.4 million, respectively.

We have generally issued a major release of our core products during the second or third quarter of each fiscal year, which includes both functional and technical enhancements. We also provide an annual release in the fourth quarter to reflect evolving regulatory changes in time to meet clients&#8217; year-end reporting requirements.

Proprietary Rights

We rely on a combination of trade secret, copyright, trademark and patent law, nondisclosure agreements and technical measures to protect our proprietary technology. We have registered trademarks for many of our products and will continue to evaluate the registration of additional trademarks as appropriate. We generally enter into confidentiality and/or license agreements with our employees, distributors, clients and potential clients. We seek to protect our software, documentation and other written materials under trade secret and copyright laws, which afford limited protection. These efforts may be insufficient to prevent third parties from asserting intellectual property rights in our technology. Furthermore, it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy portions of our products or to reverse engineer or otherwise obtain and use proprietary information, and third parties may assert ownership rights in our proprietary technology. For additional risks relating to our proprietary technology, please see &#8220;Risk Factors &#8212; Risks &#8220;Relating to Our Business&#8221; &#8212; If we are unable to protect our proprietary technology and other confidential information, our success and our ability to compete will be subject to various risks, such as third-party infringement claims, unauthorized use of our technology, disclosure of our proprietary information or inability to license technology from third parties.

Rapid technological change characterizes the software development industry. We believe factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel, new product developments, frequent product enhancements, name recognition and reliable service and support are more important to establishing and maintaining a leadership position than legal protections of our technology.
