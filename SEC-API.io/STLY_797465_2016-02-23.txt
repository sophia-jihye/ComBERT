 Item 1. &#160; Business 

&#160;

General 

&#160;

Established in 1924, we are a leading design, marketing and overseas sourcing resource in the middle-to-upscale segment of the wood residential furniture market. We offer a diversified product line supported by an overseas sourcing model. We market our brands through a network of brick-and-mortar furniture retailers, online retailers and interior designers worldwide. We also market and sell directly to the consumer through a localized approach to e-commerce order fulfillment through our brick-and-mortar customers. We were incorporated in Delaware in 1984. 

&#160;

Products 

&#160;

Our products are marketed as fashionable wood residential home furnishings which differentiate from other products in the market through styling execution as well as wide selections for the entire home including dining, bedroom, living room, home office, home entertainment, accent items and nursery and youth furniture. Our target consumer ranges from an affluent, discerning consumer utilizing the talents of an interior designer, to a more practical consumer driven to purchase by convenience, immediate gratification from stock availability or a particular retail event. Regardless, we target a consumer who values the interior aesthetics of the home. 

&#160;

We believe that our products represent good value and that the quality and design of our furniture combined with our broad selection and dependable service differentiates our products in the marketplace. 

&#160;

We provide products in a variety of wood species and finishes. Our products are designed to appeal to a broad range of consumer tastes in the middle-to-upscale segment and cover all major style categories. 

&#160;

We continually design and develop new styles to replace those we discontinue and to expand our product lines into markets where opportunity for growth exists. Our in-house product development process, which normally takes approximately one year but can be shorter or longer based upon the complexity of the concept, begins with identifying customer preferences and marketplace trends and conceptualizing product ideas. Company designers produce a variety of sketches from which prototype furniture pieces are built for review prior to full-scale engineering and production. We consult with our marketing and operations personnel, core suppliers, independent sales representatives and selected customers throughout this process and introduce our new product designs primarily at international furniture markets in High Point, North Carolina and Las Vegas, Nevada, which are each held two times per year for a total of four markets. 

&#160;

During the second quarter of 2014, we announced the end of domestic production of our Young America nursery and youth furniture brand since revenues remained below levels needed to reach profitability as a domestic manufacturer within a reasonable amount of time. Marketed as a product offering with salient features such as a wide variety of semi-custom color choices, broad item selection and the cache of a product Made in USA, the Young America brand could not be duplicated through an overseas sourcing model. The sale and closure of the supporting manufacturing facility in the second half of 2014 represented the end of our domestic manufacturing of nursery and youth furniture. 

&#160;

In January 2015, we announced our plans to re-enter the nursery and youth furniture market with a mid-year product launch sourced overseas. Our Stone &#38; Leigh brand of nursery and youth was introduced at the High Point Market in April 2015. 

&#160;

Marketing/Brands 

&#160;

We believe that the diversity of our product offerings enables us to anticipate and address changing consumer preferences and provide retailers a complete wood furniture resource in the middle-to-upscale segment. Our products are marketed under the Stanley Furniture brand, but also under sub-brands including Coastal Living&#174; and Stone &#38; Leigh. We market our brand through a series of efforts targeted both to the wholesale trade and directly to the consumer. Coastal Living&#174; is a registered trademark of Time Inc. Lifestyle Group and is used under license. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Distribution 

&#160;

We have developed a broad domestic and international customer base. We sell our furniture mainly through independent sales representatives to a variety of wholesale customers such as owner-operated furniture stores, interior design &#38; architecture professionals, decorators, smaller specialty retailers, regional furniture chains, buying clubs and e-commerce retailers. We also market and sell directly to the consumer through a localized approach to e-commerce order fulfillment through our brick-and-mortar customer. We believe this broad network reduces exposure to fluctuations in regional economic conditions, places our brand in as many venues as possible where the consumer may shop and allows us to capitalize on emerging channels of distribution. We offer tailored marketing programs to address each specific distribution channel. Our independent sales representatives along with our customer care managers sell and support our products. 

&#160;

In 2015 , we sold product to approximately 1,400 customers and recorded approximately 10% of our sales from international customers. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of our sales in 2015 and no part of the business is dependent upon a single customer, the loss of which would have a material effect on our business. The loss of several major customers could have a material impact on our business. 

&#160;

Overseas Sourcing 

&#160;

Our product is currently sourced from independently owned factories in Southeast Asia, primarily in Vietnam. We operate a support organization to manage partner-vendor relationships. In early 2016, we established a strategic manufacturing alliance with one such source in Vietnam outside of Ho Chi Minh City: Starwood Manufacturing VN Corporation. This strategic alliance allows for the utilization of a stand-alone, dedicated manufacturing facility in which we have the ability to engineer our designs specifically for the efficiency of this factory, schedule and supervise production to satisfy our specific customers&#146; demands and provide quality assurance. We maintain exclusive rights to utilize the stand-alone facility for as long as we meet certain volume goals for the facility&#146;s capacity utilization. While we are not obligated to utilize the capacity of the facility should certain market-driven and/or competitive factors not make this factory our best choice, our intentions are to transition substantially all of our products to this facility. 

&#160;

We are subject to the usual risks inherent in importing products manufactured abroad, including, but not limited to, supply disruptions and delays, port related issues that lead to delays, currency exchange rate fluctuations, economic and political developments and instability, as well as the laws, policies and actions of foreign governments and the United States affecting trade, including tariffs. 

&#160;

A sudden disruption in our supply chain from Starwood or any of our key vendors could significantly compromise our ability to fill customers&#146; orders and service gaps and short-term increases in cost would likely result. However, we believe that we could source most impacted products from other overseas suppliers. We believe maintaining more control over the various aspects of the manufacturing and sourcing process mitigates risk, and therefore believe that our strategic manufacturing alliance give our company a potential competitive operational advantage versus certain competitors. 

&#160;

We enter into standard purchase arrangements with certain overseas suppliers, including Starwood, for finished goods inventory. The terms of these arrangements are customary for our industry and do not contain any long-term purchase obligations. We generally negotiate firm pricing with our foreign suppliers in U.S. Dollars for a term of one year. We accept exposure to exchange rate movement after this period and do not use any derivative instruments to manage or hedge currency risk. We generally expect to recover any substantial price increases from these suppliers in the price we charge for these goods. 

&#160;

Logistics 

&#160;

We warehouse our products primarily in domestic warehouses with some warehousing abroad. We consider our facilities to be generally modern, well equipped and well maintained. We use a small group of furniture specific transportation providers for delivery. While most of our products are delivered to retailers from our warehouses, we also ship directly to customers from Asia and provide white-glove delivery services directly to the end consumer from our domestic warehouses. 

&#160;

Products are ordered from overseas suppliers based upon both actual and forecasted demand. Because long lead times are generally associated with overseas operations, we strive to maintain inventory levels that will service most of our wholesale customers&#146; orders within a maximum of 30 days from receipt of their order. Our backlog of unshipped orders was $6.2 million at December 31, 2015 and $6.6 million at December 31, 2014. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

The furniture industry is highly competitive, fragmented, and includes a large number of competitors. The barriers to entry are very low, and there is little feasible intellectual property protection in our industry to prevent competitors from imitating furniture designs of another manufacturer. Very few of our competitors manufacture wood residential furniture in the United States. 

&#160;

We compete with a host of varying business models within the industry including, but not limited to, former manufacturers who have adopted a strictly pass-through model from overseas vendor to wholesale customers; national lifestyle retailers who sell directly to the retail consumer through an omni -channel distribution and marketing model (use of physical channels and digital channels to offer a seamless and unified customer experience); and overseas vendors who sell directly to wholesale customers. Some competitors have greater financial resources and often offer extensively advertised, highly promoted product. 

&#160;

Competitive factors in the middle-to-upscale segment of the industry include design, quality, service, selection and price. We believe the flexibility and control we maintain over our operations model, the continued diversification of our distribution, our long-standing customer relationships, our customer responsiveness, our consistent support of high-quality and diverse product lines, the heritage of our brand and our experienced management team are all competitive advantages. 

&#160;

Associates 

&#160;

At December 31, 2015, we employed approximately 71 associates domestically and 29 associates overseas, all of which are full-time employees. We consider our relationship with our associates to be good. None of our associates are represented by a labor union. 

&#160;

Trademarks 

&#160;

Our trade names represent many years of continued business, and we believe these names are well recognized and associated with excellent quality and styling in the furniture industry. We own a number of trademarks and design patents, none of which are considered to be material. 

&#160;

Governmental Regulations 

&#160;

We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations in the areas of safety, health and environmental protection. Compliance with these laws and regulations has not in the past had any material effect on our earnings, capital expenditures or competitive position. However, the impact of such compliance in the future cannot be predicted. We believe that we are in material compliance with applicable federal, state and local safety, health and environmental regulations.
