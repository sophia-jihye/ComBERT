 Item 1. Business &#160;

&#160;

We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Florida on August 11, 2014. OptiLeaf, Inc. was formed to provide a world-class fully integrated turn-key growth management system for the cannabis industry to help dispensary owners, grow operations and caregivers increase their sales and reduce costs, increase their company&#8217;s productivity and profitability and reduce or eliminate the need for manual labor while maximizing yield. We are presently a development state company with no customers, sales, suppliers or inventory as of this filing.

&#160;

OptiLeaf&#8217;s target market will include dispensary owners, grow operations, and caregivers. We believe this industry will continue to grow, and as it does we will have a greater number of potential customers for our product. There can be no assurance that we will be able to capture any portion of this market.

&#160;

OptiLeaf will endeavor offer a complete line of hardware and software technological solution for the cannabis industry. Our software, once developed, will be a seed-to-sale growth management system, designed to not only offer a complete grow automation system, but to enhance every aspect of the medical cannabis business. We believe our wireless sensor networks, once developed, will include an array of products that control, monitor, and automate all aspects of the grow house operations. We believe our principal product, OptiLeaf GrowPro Elite, will, once developed, provide a complete, robust state-of-the-art hardware and software solution for large cultivation operations with multiple locations. We have not completed development of any products as of this Offering, and there can be no assurance that any such products will be finalized and brought to market, or that the products will gain market acceptance if they are.

&#160;

We are endeavoring to build a multi-purpose growth management software suite. OptiLeaf has added proprietary hardware components, which, together with software, provide a turn-key growth management system. We believe the system will allow growers to realize significant labor savings as common grow house tasks are fully automated. We believe our integrated hardware will be capable of monitoring and adjusting light, soil moisture, CO2, temperature, ventilation, nutrients, and humidity as needed, in real time and around-the-clock. Our user interface, data tracking, and remote access capabilities allow growers to monitor, adjust, and manage their facilities as needed from anywhere in the world. We have not completed development of any products as of this Offering, and there can be no assurance that our software will be fully developed or that it will gain market acceptance once it is.

&#160;

Once developed, it is our plan that our products will be manufactured in the USA and Asia, managed by a team possessing years of experience with domestic and overseas production. OptiLeaf does not directly distribute, sell, grow, harvest cannabis or any substances that violate United States law or the Controlled Substances Act, nor does it intend to do so in the future.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

While individual components of our contemplated system are available from our main competitors, OptiLeaf believes it will have the first and only system to completely integrate all aspects of growth automation and management into one system.

&#160;

We will be, when and if our products our developed, a technology provider to the cannabis industry. As such, we are operating within an industry that is very complex in terms of legal requirements and compliance. Cannabis is an illegal drug under Federal Law, and is illegal in many states as well. Certain states have made cannabis legal for medicinal use only, but in very few circumstances is it legal to possess or sell cannabis. Although we plan on being a technology provider only, and do not plan of growing, selling or possessing any cannabis, we nevertheless must comply with, and our business must comply with, a myriad of state and local laws and regulations regarding our operations, and our operations, as well as our profitability, can be significantly affected by all of these laws and how they affect the businesses or our customers. OptiLeaf does not, and will not, grow, harvest or sell cannabis or any other controlled substance, as that term is defined under any federal, state or local law. There can be no assurance that we will finalize development of our products, or gain market acceptance for the products when and if fully developed.

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015, we have taken the following steps to become an operating company:

&#160;

&#160; 1. We finished and launched our website www.optileaf.com. &#160;

&#160; 2. We engaged the services of Byrd &#38; Byrd, PL as our legal counsel. &#160;

&#160; 3. We created our innovative multi-purpose growth management software suite and added proprietary hardware components, which together with our software suite, provide a turn-key growth management system. &#160;

&#160; 4. We registered our trademark &#8220;OptiLeaf&#8221; and our slogan &#8220;Technology for Optimal Growth with the USPTO (United States Patent Trademark Office). &#160;

Our Service 

&#160;

Once fully developed, our software will be a seed-to-sale growth management system designed to offer a complete grow automation system that will enhance every aspect of the cannabis business. Once developed, our leading edge, wireless sensor network includes an array of products that control, monitor, and automate every aspect of grow house operation. We believe our principal product, OptiLeaf GrowPro Elite, will provide, once fully developed and launched, a complete, robust, state-of-the-art hardware and software solution for the large cultivation operation with multiple locations. We are presently a development state company with no customers, sales, suppliers or inventory as of this filing, and there can be no assurance that our products will ever become fully developed, or will gain market acceptance when and if fully developed.

&#160;

OptiLeaf will endeavor to become the premier vendor for seed-to-sale growth management systems for the cannabis industry.

&#160;

OptiLeaf has endeavored to gather information that is relevant to the psychographic profile of our target market. Some of the characteristics discovered include cost savings, increased productivity and profitability, and reduction or elimination of the need for manual labor while maximizing yield.

&#160;

Customer satisfaction will be a high priority for OptiLeaf. Our main goal is to ensure that our products are made using the highest quality components so that there are few, if any, returns due to product defects. Still, we recognize the fact that however good our product is, there will be times when it simply does not meet the needs of some customers. To ensure a positive experience and image in the minds of these and all customers, we will offer a money-back guarantee. Our objective is to make our customer service so satisfying that even if a customer decides to return a particular product, we will retain that person as a loyal customer, who won't hesitate to refer friends and associates, and perhaps make other purchases from OptiLeaf in the future.

&#160;

Our Product 

&#160;

Once developed, the heart of our system will be the innovative multi-purpose growth management software suite. OptiLeaf plans to add proprietary hardware components, which we believe, together with software, will provide a turn-key growth management system. The system, once developed and implemented, will potentially allow growers to realize significant labor savings as common grow house tasks are fully automated. Once developed, we believe our integrated hardware is capable of monitoring and adjusting light, soil moisture, CO2, temperature, ventilation, nutrients, and humidity as needed, in real time and around-the-clock. Once developed, we believe our user interface, data tracking, and remote access capabilities could potentially allow growers to monitor, adjust, and manage their facilities as needed from anywhere in the world, however, none of our products are fully developed or available for sale or use at this time, and there can be no assurance that our products will ever become fully developed, or will gain market acceptance when and if fully developed.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Our Strategy 

&#160; 

OptiLeaf will offer a complete line of hardware and software technological solution for the cannabis industry.

&#160;

Our software is a seed-to-sale growth management system, designed to not only offer a complete grow automation system, but to enhance every aspect of the medical cannabis business.

&#160;

Our wireless sensor networks will include an array of products that control, monitor, and automate all aspects of the grow house operations. Our principal product, OptiLeaf GrowPro Elite, provides a complete, robust state-of-the-art hardware and software solution for large cultivation operations with multiple locations.

&#160;

The heart of our system will be a multi-purpose growth management software suite. OptiLeaf will add proprietary hardware components, which, together with software, will provide a turn-key growth management system. The system will potentially allow growers to realize significant labor savings as common grow house tasks are fully automated. Our integrated hardware is capable of monitoring and adjusting light, soil moisture, CO2, temperature, ventilation, nutrients, and humidity as needed, in real time and around-the-clock. Our user interface, data tracking, and remote access capabilities allow growers to monitor, adjust, and manage their facilities as needed from anywhere in the world.

&#160;

OptiLeaf does not directly distribute, sell, grow, harvest cannabis or any substances that violate United States law or the Controlled Substances Act, nor does it intend to do so in the future.

&#160;

While individual components of our system are available from our main competitors, OptiLeaf believes it has the first and only system to completely integrate all aspects of growth automation and management into one system.

&#160;

Marketing 

&#160; 

OptiLeaf&#8217;s most important marketing goal as a start-up is to build product and brand awareness. The way the Company goes about this task will vary from one market segment to another.

&#160;

OptiLeaf will concentrate on a marketing campaign that uses a combination of advertising and public relations. Using these methods, OptiLeaf will 1) attempt to educate dispensaries, grow operations, and caregivers, 2) spawn awareness of its product line and 3) position its products to create a connection to the area that is ideal.

&#160;

The goal is to build a customer-oriented business that establishes long-term relationships with customers, not single-transaction deals.

&#160;

Image/Branding 

&#160;

To build a successful brand, OptiLeaf will identify how its brand can be leveraged for success. Based on its research and understanding of the Target Prospect, OptiLeaf will endeavor to position itself as the leader in quality automated cannabis growing systems. From this effort, the Company expects to gain a number of clients that recognize the value that the OptiLeaf system offers them. OptiLeaf&#8217;s branding strategy is to promote the image of its products in the cannabis industry and establish a strong foundation for its brand. By sharing personal brand experiences with potential customers, we will create a positive consumer perception. We anticipate that this strategy will place us in a &#34;first in value&#34; position and give evidence of our advantage over the competition.

&#160;

An important question that we repeatedly ask ourselves is, &#34;Are we building a business or a brand?&#34; The answer is both. As a result of our business, our brand will evolve into a recognizable symbol which will represent performance, quality, and superior service, ensuring that OptiLeaf becomes known as the industry leader in providing the most advanced technology for optimal plant growth in the cannabis industry.

&#160;

Re-positioning our seed-to-sale growth management system and our wireless sensor network product as an investment rather than a cost will generate interest and response among prospective customers. For our sales strategy to be effective, acquisition of our product must be viewed as a cost saving measure. We will demonstrate that OptiLeaf&#8217;s comprehensive technological solution will greatly reduce labor expenses while maximizing yield. This fully integrated turn-key growth management system will help our customers increase sales and reduce costs, while increasing productivity and profitability.

&#160;

The selling basis for our software products is OptiLeaf&#8217;s propriety line of wireless sensors and controllers with which our software is tightly integrated. This fully integrated turn-key growth management system will help our customers increase sales and reduce costs, thus increasing productivity and profitability.

&#160;

Operations 

&#160; 

OptiLeaf&#8217;s operational strategies behind the development of our products and services are based on design, innovation, and added value. When developing a new product, we want to be the leader by introducing innovative features that will allow cannabis cultivators to lower their costs, boost yields, and maximize production capacity. Furthermore, when OptiLeaf develops new goods or services, we will package them with support services as well as immediate observable and psychological benefits. Our focus is on how our products and services stand against the competition and how our technical measures relate to the customers&#8217; needs.

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Our primary operation strategy is to focus on quality and service. Our products must meet our eight dimensions of quality: performance, conformance, features, durability, reliability, serviceability, aesthetics, and perceived quality. Based on our operational strategies, we believe OptiLeaf's products and services will be superior to the competition. We recognize that there are some limitations imposed by trade-offs that must be made due to the nature of the product. For example, reliability may be sacrificed in order to achieve maximum speed.

&#160;

We plan to operate our business from two principal locations:

&#160;

1. Wichita, Kansas. In Wichita, we will conduct product design, development, manufacturing and related activities.,

2. Colorado Springs, Colorado. We plan to have our sales office in Colorado Springs, and this is where we will conduct our sales and marketing efforts. However, at this time we have not entered into a formal lease or other arrangement for the Colorado Springs office since we have not yet begun our sales and marketing efforts.

&#160;

Our business operations are divided into the following core functions:

&#160;

Equipment 

&#160; 

Based on our facilities and operations capabilities, the following list of equipment will be necessary to begin operations and fulfill product demand.

&#160;

The initial investment needed to gear up for production is $145,000. This amount breaks down as follows:

&#160;

&#160; &#9679; Equipment needed to assemble components - $8,000 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Furnishing the facilities - $15,000 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Packaging Materials - $25,000 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Parts and components - $97,000 &#160;

Staffing 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, we have 5 full time employees. The number of employees will be determined by the projected number of customers and that will need to be attended to.

&#160;

Due to the size and nature of OptiLeaf's activities, it will be necessary to have two administrative employees in Colorado to run the Company efficiently.

&#160;

OptiLeaf will employ a sales force of four associates whose home base will be the Colorado office. Each associate will be assigned a region and made responsible for developing lucrative distribution channels for OptiLeaf's products and services in his or her given territory. This will come in the future and we are not actively looking for those employees now.

&#160;

OptiLeaf&#8217;s assembly (manufacturing) operations will be in Kansas and will require a staff of four based on the size and quantity output of our facility.

&#160;

Given the projected number of customers and potential customers that OptiLeaf plans to interact with each day, either online, on the phone or face-to-face, a customer service associate will be needed.

&#160;

Due to the number of projected purchases that OptiLeaf expects per day, an associate will likely be needed for billable activities.

&#160;

To be successful, our business dictates that we pay particular attention to the quality of employees that we hire. Our staff will consist of highly-skilled and well-trained employees who must complete our industry-specific training program. OptiLeaf will increase its staff as the demand for our products and services increases.

&#160;

OptiLeaf will use its network of contacts and acquaintances to seek prospects with the proper education and training who want to work in the cannabis industry. Headhunters for the industry will be used and full-time positions will be offered to interns who show promise.

&#160;

Where possible, OptiLeaf will look to the local community for its staffing requirements and will place ads in local listings. Hiring local talent will be beneficial to both OptiLeaf and to potential employees: employees benefit by having a short commute to work and the company benefits by having a more alert, well-rested, happy staff.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

We recognize the value of good employees and the importance of making the right decision the first time around. To assist us in our selection, we will use a staffing agency to find candidates who will be the best fit for our business. This method saves OptiLeaf valuable time because the agency will pre-screen all candidates and refer only those that are right for the position.

&#160;

OptiLeaf accepts the responsibility to train its employees to be successful and productive. To this end, the Company will establish a formal training program and conduct careful evaluation to ensure that training is carried out effectively and that training goals are met. Because it is planned, organized, and performed at our location, we feel that this is the best training method for our business. The timeline from start to finish will be two days of criteria training, followed by on-the-job training. The new employee will be given a series of quizzes designed to measure his/her progress. By proceeding in this manner, OptiLeaf will be able to keep track of and improve the training process and its customer service.

&#160;

OptiLeaf requires that all personnel in a supervisory position exercise their responsibilities in a diligent manner. Supervisors are responsible for seeing that all daily objectives are met, as well as interacting with their staff and ensuring that long-term goals are on the right track. Other responsibilities include providing weekly reports to their superiors as relevant information must be communicated on a real-time basis.

&#160;

Inventory Handling 

&#160; 

The key to profitability is moving inventory from receiving within 24 hours. Proper controls such as budgeting, forecasting, reporting, consolidation and planning are essential to successful inventory management.

&#160;

Our finished goods inventory will need to be inspected regularly to ensure that it is ready for delivery upon customer order. Our business operates on the theory of &#34;just-in-time&#34; inventory. Only a limited number of finished goods inventory should be kept on hand to avoid overstock in case of a sudden drop in customer orders.

&#160;

Inventory will be monitored by the Inventory Manager on a bi-weekly basis and counted for accuracy on a monthly basis. Consistent monitoring will ensure that we always have proper levels of inventory and allow for shrinkage due to factors outside our control (i.e. breakage or internal theft). To discourage theft, the number of employees allowed to handle inventory will be restricted.

&#160;

OptiLeaf will utilize the FIFO method of both accounting for and managing the physical handling of inventory, which assumes that the first product that makes its way into inventory will be the first product sold.

&#160;

OptiLeaf will use a specific identification method which will allow the actual cost of the purchased inventory item to be identified by either purchase date or a designated number.

&#160;

Suppliers 

&#160; 

OptiLeaf will rely on overseas manufacturers to supply various components of its product line. The most important benefit of using this type of supplier is that we are able to remain cost competitive in our local market. We believe that this will give us a competitive advantage that can be used to increase the sales and profits of our business.

&#160;

We plan on buying most of our inventory directly from the manufacturer. Because we generally will be placing large orders, dealing directly with the manufacturer will yield the lowest cost per unit. The down side of working with these large manufacturers is that we are not able to order in smaller quantities, resulting in having a considerable sum of money tied up in each order. When a smaller quantity of product is necessary, we will use a smaller business-to-business manufacturer.

&#160;

These manufacturers will require 30 days advance notice for each order. Shipments from China typically take 7-10 days for delivery by air or 20-30 days by ocean freighter.

&#160;

Customer Service and Support 

&#160;

Timely order fulfillment is crucial to customer satisfaction. OptiLeaf will hire additional assistants as needed to monitor and manage the delivery, billing, warranty service and repair of its products. This helps to ensure customer satisfaction and repeat sales.

&#160;

To improve operating efficiency, we plan to use Amazon.com as our order fulfillment company. Their facilities are &#34;state-of-the-art&#34; and their customer satisfaction record is unsurpassed. By outsourcing this function, we can keep internal staffing needs at a minimum and avoid having to expand our telephone network and computer systems. We will also save on shipping costs due to the high volume discounts Amazon.com earns by serving multiple businesses from one location.

&#160;

Our customers emphasize that good service and after-sales support are among their major concerns. A hot-line service will be available to all registered customers enrolled in OptiLeaf's maintenance / support program.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Customer satisfaction will be a high priority for OptiLeaf. Our main goal is to ensure that our products are made using the highest quality components so that there are few, if any, returns due to product defects. Still, we recognize the fact that however good our product is, there will be times when it simply does not meet the needs of some customers. To ensure a positive experience and image in the minds of these and all customers, we will offer a money-back guarantee. Our objective is to make our customer service so satisfying that even if a customer decides to return a particular product, we will retain that person as a loyal customer, who won't hesitate to refer friends and associates, and perhaps make other purchases from OptiLeaf in the future.

&#160;

We will use the following policies:

&#160;

&#34;If, for some reason you are not 100% satisfied with our hardware, you may return it for a full refund within 30 days of receipt. Please call our customer service to obtain a Return Merchandise Authorization number [RMA#]. Refunds are made only on the price of the product, plus any applicable taxes collected at the time of purchase. Shipping costs are not refundable.&#34; 

&#160; 

&#34;If the product is found to be defective, OptiLeaf will pay the shipping charges needed to return the defective item to us, as well as those needed to ship the replacement item to the consumer.&#34; 

&#160; 

&#34;Try our software for free for 90 days. The setup fee is non-refundable.&#34; 

&#160;

&#34;Refunds for returns will be issued within 30 days of receipt of returned merchandise in salable condition, accompanied by the assigned RMA#. Refunds for payments made by cash and/or check are made by check. Credit card refunds are credited directly to the credit card used to make the purchase.&#8221; 

&#160; 

We intend to follow industry standards by implementing a returns and adjustments policy that encourages the customer to try our products. By reducing the risk to the customer in the event that our product doesn't meet their needs and by offering a generous and timely refund policy, we hope to ensure total customer satisfaction.

&#160;

Subcontractors 

&#160; 

In order to control our expenses, OptiLeaf plans on subcontracting a portion of our advertising and marketing to third parties. This will potentially allow us to bring in professionals with expertise that we have not yet acquired.

&#160;

Government Regulation 

&#160;

OptiLeaf does not directly distribute, sell, grow, harvest cannabis or any substances that violate United States law or the Controlled Substances Act, nor does it intend to do so in the future. We are a technology provider to the cannabis industry. As such, we are operating within an industry that is very complex in terms of legal requirements and compliance. Cannabis is an illegal drug under Federal Law, and is illegal in many states as well. Certain states have made cannabis legal for medicinal use only, but in very few circumstances is it legal to possess or sell cannabis. Although we plan on being a technology provider only, and do not plan of growing, selling or possessing any cannabis, we nevertheless must comply with, and our business must comply with, a myriad of state and local laws and regulations regarding our operations, and our operations, as well as our profitability, can be significantly affected by all of these laws and how they affect the businesses or our customers.

&#160;

In addition, we are subject to a number of laws and regulations that affect companies generally and specifically those conducting business on the internet, many of which are still evolving and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. Existing and future laws and regulations may impede our growth. These regulations and laws may cover online marketing, e-mail marketing, telemarketing, taxation, privacy, data protection, pricing, content, copyrights, distribution, mobile communications, electronic contracts and other communications, consumer protection, web services, the provision of online payment services, unencumbered internet access to our services, the design and operation of websites, and the characteristics and quality of products and services. It is not clear how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership, libel, and personal privacy apply to the internet, e-commerce, digital content and web services. Unfavorable regulations and laws could diminish the demand for our products and services and increase our cost of doing business.

&#160;

Litigation 

&#160;

From time to time, we may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings, which arise, in the ordinary course of business. However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm our business. We are currently not aware of any such legal proceedings or claims that we believe will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results.

&#160;
