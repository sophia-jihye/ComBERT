 ITEM 1. Business. 

For convenience, the terms &#8220;Discovery,&#8221; &#8220;DCI,&#8221; the &#8220;Company,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us&#8221; or &#8220;our&#8221; are used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to refer to both Discovery Communications, Inc. and collectively to Discovery Communications, Inc. and one or more of its consolidated subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise requires. 

We were formed on September 17, 2008 as a Delaware corporation in connection with Discovery Holding Company (&#8220;DHC&#8221;) and Advance/Newhouse Programming Partnership (&#8220;Advance/Newhouse&#8221;) combining their respective ownership interests in Discovery Communications Holding, LLC (&#8220;DCH&#8221;) and exchanging those interests with and into Discovery (the &#8220;Discovery Formation&#8221;). As a result of the Discovery Formation, DHC and DCH became wholly owned subsidiaries of Discovery, with Discovery becoming the successor reporting entity to DHC. 

OVERVIEW 

We are a global media company that provides content across multiple distribution platforms, including pay-TV, free-to-air and broadcast television, websites, digital distribution arrangements and content licensing agreements. As one of the world&#8217;s largest pay-TV programmers, we provide original and purchased content and live events to more than 2.8 billion &#32;cumulative viewers worldwide through networks that we wholly or partially own. We distribute customized content in the U.S. and over 220 &#32;other countries and territories in over 40 &#32;languages. Our global portfolio of networks includes prominent television brands such as Discovery Channel, one of the first nonfiction networks and our most widely distributed global brand, TLC, Animal Planet, Investigation Discovery, Science and Velocity (known as Turbo outside of the U.S.). We also operate a diversified portfolio of production studios, websites and curriculum-based education products and services. In 2015, we acquired 100% control of Eurosport, a leading sports entertainment pay-TV programmer across Europe and Asia. 

Our objectives are to invest in content for our networks to build viewership, optimize distribution revenue, capture advertising sales, and create or reposition branded channels and businesses that can sustain long-term growth and occupy a desired content niche with strong consumer appeal. Our strategy is to maximize the distribution, ratings and profit potential of each of our branded networks. In addition to growing distribution and advertising revenues for our branded networks, we are extending content distribution across new platforms, including brand-aligned websites, web-native networks, on-line streaming, mobile devices, video on demand (&#8220;VOD&#8221;) and broadband channels, which provide promotional platforms for our television content and serve as additional outlets for advertising and distribution revenue. Audience ratings are a key driver in generating advertising revenue and creating demand on the part of cable television operators, direct-to-home ("DTH") satellite operators, telecommunication service providers, and other content distributors who deliver our content to their customers. 

Our content spans genres including survival, exploration, sports, lifestyle, general entertainment, heroes, adventure, crime and investigation, health and kids. We have an extensive library of content and own most rights to our content and footage, which enables us to exploit our library to launch brands and services into new markets quickly. Our content can be re-edited and updated in a cost-effective manner to provide topical versions of subject matter that can be utilized around the world. Substantially all of our content is produced in high definition (&#8220;HD&#8221;) format. 

Subscriber statistics set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K include both wholly owned networks and networks operated by equity method investees. Domestic subscriber statistics are based on Nielsen Media Research. International subscriber and viewer statistics are derived from internal data coupled with external sources when available. As used herein, a &#8220;subscriber&#8221; is a single household that receives the applicable network from its cable television operator, DTH satellite operator, telecommunication service provider, or other television provider, including those who receive our networks from pay-TV providers without charge pursuant to various pricing plans that include free periods and/or free carriage. The term &#8220;cumulative subscribers&#8221; refers to the sum of the total number of subscribers to each of our networks or content services. By way of example, two households that each receive five of our networks from their pay television provider represent two subscribers, but 10 cumulative subscribers. The term "viewer" is a single household that receives the signal from one of our networks using the appropriate receiving equipment without a subscription to a pay television provider. 

Although the Company utilizes certain brands and content globally, we classify our operations as follows: two reportable segments: U.S. Networks, consisting principally of domestic television networks and websites and International Networks, consisting primarily of international television networks and websites; and two combined operating segments referred to as Education and Other, consisting principally of curriculum-based product and service offerings and production studios. Our segment presentation is consistent with our management structure and the financial information management uses to make decisions about operating matters, such as the allocation of resources and business performance assessments. Financial information for our segments and the geographical areas in which we do business is set forth in Item 7, &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of 

Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; and Note 21 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8221; in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our global brands are:

U.S. NETWORKS 

U.S. Networks generated revenues of $ 3.1 billion &#32;and adjusted operating income before depreciation and amortization ("Adjusted OIBDA") of $1.8 billion &#32;during 2015 , which represented 49% &#32;and 74% &#32;of our total consolidated revenues and Adjusted OIBDA, respectively. Our U.S. Networks segment principally consists of national television networks. Our U.S. Networks segment owns and operates ten national television networks, including fully distributed television networks such as Discovery Channel, TLC and Animal Planet. Discovery Channel, TLC and Animal Planet collectively generated 67% &#32;of U.S. Networks&#8217; total revenue. In addition, this segment holds an equity method interest in OWN: Oprah Winfrey Network ("OWN"). 

U.S. Networks generates revenues from fees charged to distributors of our television networks&#8217; first run content, which include cable, DTH satellite and telecommunication service providers, referred to as affiliate fees; fees from digital distributors for licensed content that was previously distributed on our television networks, referred to as digital distribution revenue; fees from advertising sold on our television networks and websites; fees from providing sales representation and network distribution services and content to equity method investee networks; and revenue from licensing our brands for consumer products. 

Typically, our television networks are aired pursuant to multi-year carriage agreements that provide for the level of carriage that our networks will receive and for annual graduated rate increases. Carriage of our networks depends on package inclusion, such as whether networks are on the more widely distributed, broader packages or lesser-distributed, specialized packages, also referred to as digital tiers. In December 2015, we announced our first authenticated U.S. TV Everywhere product, Discovery GO, that is available to certain subscribers. Discovery GO connects viewers with live and on-demand access to award-winning shows and series from nine U.S. networks in the Discovery portfolio: Discovery Channel, TLC, Animal Planet, ID, Science Channel, Velocity, Destination America, American Heroes Channel ("AHC") and Discovery Life. 

Advertising revenue is based on the price received for available advertising spots and is dependent upon a number of factors including the number of subscribers to our channels, viewership demographics, the popularity of our programming, and our ability to sell commercial time over a portfolio of channels. In the U.S., advertising time is sold in the upfront and scatter markets. In the upfront market, advertisers buy advertising time for upcoming seasons and, by committing to purchase in advance, lock in the advertising rates they will pay for the upcoming year. Many upfront advertising commitments include options whereby advertisers may reduce purchase commitments. In the scatter market, advertisers buy advertising closer to the time when the commercials will be run, which often results in a pricing premium compared to the upfront rates. The mix of upfront and scatter market advertising time sold is based upon the economic conditions at the time that upfront sales take place impacting the sell-out levels management is willing or able to obtain. The demand in the scatter market then impacts the pricing achieved for our remaining advertising inventory. Scatter market pricing can vary from upfront pricing and can be volatile. 

&#32;In addition to the global networks described in the overview section above, we operate networks in the U.S. that utilize the following brands: 

&#8226;

On September 23, 2014 , we purchased from Hasbro an additional 10% &#32;ownership interest in Discovery Family Channel(formerly known as the Hub Network), which was previously a 50% &#32;owned equity method investee, for $64 million . As a result, we now have a controlling financial interest in Discovery Family Channel and account for it as a consolidated subsidiary.

INTERNATIONAL NETWORKS

This segment generates revenue from operations in virtually every pay-TV market in the world through an infrastructure that includes operational centers in London, Warsaw, Milan, Singapore and Miami. Global brands include Discovery Channel, Animal Planet, TLC, ID, Science Channel and Turbo (known as Velocity in the U.S.), along with brands exclusive to International Networks, including Eurosport, Real Time, DMAX and Discovery Kids.

(a) Number of subscribers corresponds to the sum of the subscribers to each of the SBS Nordic broadcast networks in Sweden, Norway, Finland and Denmark subject to retransmission agreements with pay television providers. 

Similar to U.S. Networks, a significant source of revenue for International Networks relates to fees charged to operators who distribute our linear networks. Such operators primarily include cable and DTH satellite service providers. International television markets vary in their stages of development. Some markets, such as the U.K., are more advanced digital television markets, while 

others remain in the analog environment with varying degrees of investment from operators to expand channel capacity or convert to digital technologies. Common practice in some markets results in long-term contractual distribution relationships, while customers in other markets renew contracts annually. Distribution revenue for our International Networks segment is largely dependent on the number of subscribers that receive our networks or content, the rates negotiated in the distributor agreements, and the market demand for the content that we provide. 

The other significant source of revenue for International Networks relates to advertising sold on our television networks, similar to U.S. Networks. Advertising revenue is dependent upon a number of factors, including the development of pay and free-to-air television markets, the number of subscribers to and viewers of our channels, viewership demographics, the popularity of our programming, and our ability to sell commercial time over a group of channels. In certain markets, our advertising sales business operates with in-house sales teams, while we rely on external sales representation services in other markets. In developing television markets, we expect that advertising revenue growth will result from continued subscriber growth, our localization strategy, and the shift of advertising spending from traditional broadcast networks to channels in the multi-channel environment. In relatively mature markets, such as Western Europe, we anticipate that growth in advertising revenue will come from increasing viewership and advertising pricing on our existing television networks, launching new services and through acquisitions. 

During 2015 , distribution, advertising and other revenues were 53% , 44% &#32;and 3% , respectively, of total net revenues for this segment. While the Company has traditionally operated cable networks, an increasing portion of the Company's international ad revenue is generated by free-to-air or broadcast networks. Pay-TV networks and free-to-air or broadcast networks, which include the SBS networks, generated 47% &#32;and 49% &#32;of International Networks' 2015 &#32;advertising revenue, respectively. Radio networks generated 4% &#32;of International Networks' 2015 &#32;advertising revenue. 

On December 21, 2012, we acquired a 20% &#32;ownership interest in Eurosport, which includes both Eurosport International and Eurosport France, which was accounted for as an equity method investment. On May 30, 2014 , we acquired a controlling 31% &#32;interest in Eurosport International for &#8364; 259 million &#32;($ 351 million ) and committed to acquire a similar controlling interest in Eurosport France upon resolution of certain regulatory matters. The outstanding regulatory matters in France were subsequently resolved, and on March 31, 2015 , we completed our acquisition of an additional 31% &#32;equity interest in Eurosport France for &#8364;36 million &#32;( $38 million ), giving us a 51% &#32;stake in Eurosport. (See Note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.) On October 1, 2015, we acquired the remaining 49% &#32;of Eurosport for &#8364;491 million &#32;( $548 million ). (See Note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.) 

On April 9, 2013, we acquired the television and radio operations of SBS Nordic from Prosiebensat.1 Media AG for cash of approximately &#8364;1.4 billion &#32;($ 1.8 billion ), including closing purchase price adjustments. As of the year ended December 31, 2015 , we recorded a pre-tax loss of $12 million &#32;on the sale of our radio businesses in Northern Europe to Bauer Media Group ("Bauer") for total consideration, net of cash disposed, of &#8364;60 million &#32;( $67 million ), which includes &#8364;54 million &#32;( $61 million ) of net cash received at closing on June 30, 2015 &#32;and &#8364;6 million &#32;( $6 million ) for the fair value of contingent consideration. We determined that the disposal did not meet the definition of a discontinued operation because it does not represent a strategic shift that has a significant impact on our operations and consolidated financial results. (See Note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.) 

&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;On October 7, 2015 , we recorded a pretax loss of $5 million &#32;for the contribution of our Russian business to a joint venture (the &#8220;New Russian Business&#8221;) with a Russian media company, National Media Group ("NMG"). We now hold a 20% &#32;interest in the New Russian Business, which was established to comply with changes in Russian legislation limiting foreign ownership. We no longer consolidate the contributed Russian business, which was a component of our International Networks operating segment and we will account for our ownership interest in the New Russian Business as an equity method investment. (See Note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.) 

In 2015 , we acquired a 100% equity interest in several other unrelated businesses for total cash and contingent consideration of $91 million , net of cash acquired. The acquisitions included a free-to-air network in Italy, cable networks in Denmark, a free-to-air network in Turkey and a pay-TV sports channel in Asia. (See Note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.) All acquired businesses are components of our International Networks operating segment. 

On January 10, 2013, we purchased an additional 30% &#32;ownership interest in Discovery Japan, which was previously a 50% &#32;owned equity method investee. As a result, we now have a controlling financial interest in Discovery Japan and account for it as a consolidated subsidiary. We recognized a $ 92 million &#32;gain upon consolidation for the difference in the carrying value and the fair value of the previously held equity interest. (See Note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.) 

Acquisitions are included in our operating results upon their acquisition date and dispositions are excluded from our operating results following their disposition date. (See Note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.) 

Effective January 1, 2015, we realigned our International Networks management reporting structure into the following regions: Northern Europe, which includes primarily the Nordics and U.K.; Southern Europe, which primarily includes Italy and 

Spain; Central and Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (&#8220;CEEMEA&#8221;), which has been expanded to include Germany; Latin America; Asia-Pacific; and Eurosport. Previously, International Networks&#8217; regional operations reporting structure was segregated into the following regions: Western Europe, which included the U.K. and western European countries; Nordics; CEEMEA; Latin America; Asia-Pacific; and Eurosport. This realignment did not impact our consolidated financial statements other than to change the regions in which we describe our operating results for the International Networks segment. 

EDUCATION AND OTHER 

Education and Other generated revenues of $ 173 million &#32;during 2015 , which represented 3% &#32;of our total consolidated revenues. Education is comprised of curriculum-based product and service offerings and generates revenues primarily from subscriptions charged to K-12 schools for access to an online suite of curriculum-based VOD tools, professional development services, digital textbooks and, to a lesser extent, student assessments and publication of hard copy curriculum-based content. Other is comprised of production studios that develop content for our networks and other television service providers throughout the world. Our wholly owned production studios provide services to our U.S. Networks and International Networks segments at cost. The revenues and offsetting expenses associated with these inter-segment production services are not reflected in the results of operations for Education and Other as they have been eliminated within the Production Studios operating segment. 

On November 12, 2015, the Company acquired 5 million shares, or 3.4%, of Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. ("Lionsgate"), an entertainment company involved in the production of movies and television, for $195 million . (See Note 4 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.) 

On September 23, 2014 , the Company acquired a 50% &#32;equity method ownership interest in All3Media, a production studio company, with an enterprise value of &#163;556 million &#32;( $912 million ) as of December 31, 2015 &#32;for a cash payment of approximately &#163;90 million &#32;( $147 million ). All3Media recapitalized its debt structure to effect the transaction. (See Note 4 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.) 

On February 28, 2014, we acquired Raw TV Limited, a factual entertainment production company in the U.K., to improve the sourcing of content for our networks. (See Note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.) 

On November 1, 2013 , we acquired an education business in the U.K. to complement our existing service offerings and expand our operations internationally. (See Note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.) 

Our production studios are an operating segment that has been combined with our Education segment. Neither of these operating segments meet the quantitative thresholds for reporting as a separate reportable segment and are aggregated for reporting purposes to reconcile reporting segments to consolidated results. 

CONTENT DEVELOPMENT 

Our content development strategy is designed to increase viewership, maintain innovation and quality leadership, and provide value for our network distributors and advertising customers. Our content is sourced from a wide range of third-party producers, which include some of the world&#8217;s leading nonfiction production companies as well as independent producers, and wholly owned production studios. 

Our production arrangements fall into three categories: produced, coproduced and licensed. Produced content includes content that we engage third parties or wholly owned production studios to develop and produce. We retain editorial control and own most or all of the rights, in exchange for paying all development and production costs. Coproduced content refers to program rights on which we have collaborated with third parties to finance and develop either because at times world-wide rights are not available for acquisition or we save costs by collaborating with third parties. Licensed content is comprised of films or series that have been produced by third parties. Payments for sports rights made in advance of the event are recognized as prepaid content license assets. 

International Networks maximizes the use of content from our U.S. Networks. Much of our content tends to be culturally neutral and maintains its relevance for an extended period of time. As a result, a significant amount of our content translates well across international borders and is made even more accessible through extensive use of dubbing and subtitles in local languages. Our content can be re-edited and updated in a cost-effective manner to provide topical versions of subject matter that can be utilized around the world. International Networks executes a localization strategy by offering content from U.S. Networks, customized content and localized schedules via our distribution feeds. While our International Networks segment maximizes the use of content from U.S. Networks, we also develop local content that is tailored to individual market preferences and license the rights to air films, television series and sporting events from third-party producers. 

Our largest single cost is content expense, which includes content amortization, content impairments and production costs. We amortize the cost of capitalized content rights based on the proportion that the current year's estimated revenues bear to the 

estimated remaining total lifetime revenues, which normally results in an accelerated amortization method over the estimated useful lives. However, certain networks also utilize a straight-line method of amortization over the estimated useful lives of the content. Content is amortized primarily over periods of three &#32;to four &#32;years. The costs for multi-year sports programming arrangements are expensed when the event is broadcast based on the estimated relative value of each season in the arrangement. Content assets are reviewed for impairment when impairment indicators are present, such as low viewership or limited expected use. Impairment losses are recorded for content asset carrying value in excess of net realizable value. 

REVENUES 

We generate revenues principally from fees charged to operators who distribute our network content, which primarily include cable, DTH satellite, telecommunication and digital service providers and advertising sold on our networks and websites. Other transactions include curriculum-based products and services, affiliate and advertising sales representation services, production of content, content licenses and the licensing of our brands for consumer products. During 2015 , distribution, advertising and other revenues were 48% , 47% &#32;and 5% , respectively, of consolidated revenues. No individual customer represented more than 10% of our total consolidated revenues for 2015 , 2014 &#32;or 2013 . 

Distribution 

Distribution revenue includes fees charged for the right to view Discovery's network branded content made available to customers through a variety of distribution platforms and viewing devices. The largest component of distribution revenue is comprised of linear distribution services for rights to our networks from cable, DTH satellite and telecommunication service providers. We have contracts with distributors representing most cable and satellite service providers around the world, including the largest operators in the U.S. and major international distributors. Typically, our television networks are aired pursuant to multi-year carriage agreements that provide for the level of carriage that Discovery&#8217;s networks will receive, and, if applicable, for scheduled graduated annual rate increases. Carriage of our networks depends upon package inclusion, such as whether networks are on the more widely distributed, broader packages or lesser-distributed, specialized packages. Distribution revenues are largely dependent on the rates negotiated in the agreements, the number of subscribers that receive our networks or content, and the market demand for the content that we provide. We have provided distributors launch incentives, in the form of cash payments or free periods, to carry our networks. 

In the U.S., approximately 95% &#32;of distribution revenues come from the top 10 distributors, with whom we have agreements that expire at various times from 2016 through 2021 . Outside of the U.S., approximately 45% &#32;of distribution revenue comes from the top 10 distributors. Distribution fees are typically collected ratably throughout the year. International television markets vary in their stages of development. Some, notably the U.K., are more advanced digital multi-channel television markets, while others operate in the analog environment with varying degrees of investment from distributors in expanding channel capacity or converting to digital. 

Distribution revenue also includes fees charged for bulk content arrangements and other subscription services for episodic content. These digital distribution agreements are impacted by the quantity, as well as the quality, of the content Discovery provides. 

Advertising 

Our advertising revenue consists of consumer advertising, which is sold primarily on a national basis in the U.S. and on a pan-regional or local-language feed basis outside the U.S. Advertising contracts generally have a term of one year or less. 

In the U.S., we sell advertising time in the upfront and scatter markets. In the upfront market, advertisers buy advertising time for the upcoming season and by purchasing in advance often receive discounted rates. In the scatter market, advertisers buy advertising time close to the time when the commercials will be run and often pay a premium. The mix between the upfront and scatter markets is based upon a number of factors, such as pricing, demand for advertising time and economic conditions. Outside the U.S., advertisers typically buy advertising closer to the time when the commercials will be run. In developing pay television markets, we expect advertising revenue growth will result from subscriber growth, our localization strategy, and the shift of advertising spending from broadcast to pay television. In mature markets, such as the U.S. and Western Europe, high proportions of market penetration and distribution are unlikely to drive rapid revenue growth. Instead, growth in advertising sales comes from increasing viewership and pricing and launching new services, either in pay-TV, broadcast, or free-to-air television environments. 

Advertising revenue is dependent upon a number of factors, including the stage of development of television markets, the popularity of free-to-air television, the number of subscribers to our channels, viewership demographics, the popularity of our content and our ability to sell commercial time over a group of channels. Revenue from advertising is subject to seasonality, market-based variations and general economic conditions. Advertising revenue is typically highest in the second and fourth 

quarters. In some cases, advertising sales are subject to ratings guarantees that require us to provide additional advertising time if the guaranteed audience levels are not achieved. 

We also generate revenue from the sale of advertising on our websites on a stand-alone basis and as part of advertising packages with our television networks. 

Other 

We also generate income associated with curriculum-based products and services, the licensing of our brands for consumer products and third-party content sales, and content production from our production studios. 

COMPETITION 

Providing television content across various distribution platforms is a highly competitive business worldwide. We experience competition for the development and acquisition of content, distribution of our content, sale of commercial time on our networks and viewership. Our networks compete with other production studios, other television networks, and the internet for the acquisition of content and creative talent such as writers, producers and directors. Our ability to produce and acquire popular content is an important competitive factor for the distribution of our networks, attracting viewers and the sale of advertising. Our success in securing popular content and creative talent depends on various factors such as the number of competitors providing content that targets the same genre and audience, the distribution of our networks, viewership, and the production, marketing and advertising support we provide. 

Our networks compete with other television networks, including broadcast, cable and local, for the distribution of our content and fees charged to cable television operators, DTH satellite service providers, and other distributors that carry our network content. Our ability to secure distribution agreements is necessary to ensure the retention of our audiences. Our contractual agreements with distributors are renewed or renegotiated from time to time in the ordinary course of business. Growth in the number of networks distributed, consolidation and other market conditions in the cable and satellite distribution industry, and increased popularity of other platforms may adversely affect our ability to obtain and maintain contractual terms for the distribution of our content that are as favorable as those currently in place. The ability to secure distribution agreements is dependent upon the production, acquisition and packaging of original content, viewership, the marketing and advertising support and incentives provided to distributors, the product offering across a series of networks within a region, and the prices charged for carriage. 

Our networks and websites compete for the sale of advertising with other television networks, including broadcast, cable and local networks, online and mobile outlets, radio content and print media. Our success in selling advertising is a function of the size and demographics of our audiences, quantitative and qualitative characteristics of the audience of each network, the perceived quality of the network and of the particular content, the brand appeal of the network and ratings as determined by third-party research companies, prices charged for advertising and overall advertiser demand in the marketplace. 

Our networks and websites also compete for their target audiences with all forms of content and other media provided to viewers, including broadcast, cable and local networks, pay-per-view and VOD services, DVDs, online activities and other forms of news, information and entertainment. 

Our education business competes with other providers of curriculum-based products and services to schools. Our production studios compete with other production and media companies for talent. 

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 

Our intellectual property assets include copyrights in television content, trademarks in brands, names and logos, websites, and licenses of intellectual property rights from third parties. 

We are fundamentally a content company and the protection of our brands and content is of primary importance. To protect our intellectual property assets, we rely upon a combination of copyright, trademark, unfair competition, trade secret and Internet/domain name statutes and laws, and contract provisions. However, there can be no assurance of the degree to which these measures will be successful. Moreover, effective intellectual property protection may be either unavailable or limited in certain foreign territories. Policing unauthorized use of our products and services and related intellectual property is difficult and costly. We seek to limit unauthorized use of our intellectual property through a combination of approaches. However, the steps taken to prevent the infringement of our intellectual property by unauthorized third parties may not work. 

Third parties may challenge the validity or scope of our intellectual property from time to time, and the success of any such challenges could result in the limitation or loss of intellectual property rights. Irrespective of their validity, such claims may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources which could have an adverse effect on our operations. In addition, piracy, which 

encompasses the theft of our signal, and unauthorized use of our content, in the digital environment continues to present a threat to revenues from products and services based on our intellectual property. 

REGULATORY MATTERS 

Our businesses are subject to and affected by regulations of U.S. federal, state and local government authorities, and our international operations are subject to laws and regulations of the countries and international bodies, such as the European Union, in which we operate. Content networks, such as those owned by us, are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission (&#8220;FCC&#8221;) in certain respects if they are affiliated with a cable television operator. Other FCC regulations, although imposed on cable television operators and direct broadcast satellite ("DBS") operators, affect content networks indirectly. The rules, regulations, policies and procedures affecting our businesses are constantly subject to change. These descriptions are summary in nature and do not purport to describe all present and proposed laws and regulations affecting our businesses. 

Program Access 

The FCC&#8217;s program access rules prevent a satellite or cable content vendor in which a cable operator has an &#8220;attributable&#8221; ownership interest from discriminating against unaffiliated multichannel video programming distributors (&#8220;MVPDs&#8221;), such as cable and DBS operators, in the rates, terms and conditions for the sale or delivery of content. These rules also permit MVPDs to initiate complaints to the FCC against content networks if an MVPD claims it is unable to obtain rights to carry the content network on nondiscriminatory rates, terms or conditions. The FCC allowed a previous blanket prohibition on exclusive arrangements with cable operators to expire in October 2012, but will consider case-by-case complaints that exclusive contracts between cable operators and cable-affiliated programmers significantly hinder or prevent an unaffiliated MVPD from providing satellite or cable programming. 

&#8220;Must-Carry&#8221;/Retransmission Consent 

The Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992 (the &#8220;Act&#8221;) imposes &#8220;must-carry&#8221; regulations on cable systems, requiring them to carry the signals of most local broadcast television stations in their market. DBS systems are also subject to their own must-carry rules. The FCC&#8217;s implementation of &#8220;must-carry&#8221; obligations requires cable operators and DBS providers to give broadcasters preferential access to channel space. This reduces the amount of channel space that is available for carriage of our networks by cable and DBS operators. The Act also established retransmission consent, which refers to a broadcaster&#8217;s right to require MVPDs, such as cable and satellite operators, to obtain the broadcaster's consent before distributing the broadcaster's signal to the MVPDs' subscribers. Broadcasters have traditionally used the resulting leverage from demand for their must-have broadcast content to obtain carriage for their affiliated networks. Increasingly, broadcasters are additionally seeking substantial monetary compensation for granting carriage rights for their must-have broadcast content. Such increased financial demands on distributors reduce the content funds available for independent programmers not affiliated with broadcasters, such as us. 

Closed Captioning and Advertising Restrictions 

Certain of our networks must provide closed-captioning of content. Our content and websites intended primarily for children 12 years of age and under must comply with certain limits on advertising, and commercials embedded in our networks&#8217; content stream adhere to certain standards for ensuring that those commercials are not transmitted at louder volumes than our program material. The 21 st &#32;Century Communications and Video Accessibility Act of 2010 requires us to provide closed captioning on certain IP-delivered video content that we offer. 

Obscenity Restrictions 

Network distributors are prohibited from transmitting obscene content, and our affiliation agreements generally require us to refrain from including such content on our networks. 

Violent Programming 

In 2007, the FCC issued a report on violence in programing that recommended Congress prohibit the availability of violent programming, including cable programming, during hours when children are likely to be watching. Recent events have led to a renewed interest by some members of Congress in the alleged effects of violent programming, which could lead to a renewal of interest in limiting the availability of such programming or prohibiting it. 

Regulation of the Internet 

We operate several websites that we use to distribute information about our programs and to offer consumers the opportunity to purchase consumer products and services. Internet services are now subject to regulation in the U.S. relating to the privacy and 

security of personally identifiable user information and acquisition of personal information from children under 13, including the federal Children's Online Privacy Protection Act and the federal Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act. In addition, a majority of states have enacted laws that impose data security and security breach obligations. Additional federal and state laws and regulations may be adopted with respect to the Internet or other on-line services, covering such issues as user privacy, child safety, data security, advertising, pricing, content, copyrights and trademarks, access by persons with disabilities, distribution, taxation and characteristics and quality of products and services. In addition, to the extent we offer products and services to on-line consumers outside the U.S., the laws and regulations of foreign jurisdictions, including, without limitation, consumer protection, privacy, advertising, data retention, intellectual property, and content limitations, may impose additional compliance obligations on us. 

Foreign Laws and Regulations 

The foreign jurisdictions in which our networks are offered have, in varying degrees, laws and regulations governing our businesses. 

EMPLOYEES 

As of December 31, 2015 , we had approximately 7,000 &#32;employees, including full-time and part-time employees of our wholly owned subsidiaries and consolidated ventures.
