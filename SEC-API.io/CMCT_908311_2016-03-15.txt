Business Overview 

&#160; 

The principal business of CIM Commercial Trust Corporation and its subsidiaries (which may be referred to in this Form 10 &#8209;K as &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; &#8220;our,&#8221; &#8220;our company&#8221;, &#8220;CIM Commercial&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) is to acquire, own, and operate Class A and creative office investments in vibrant and improving urban communities throughout the United States. These communities are located in areas that include traditional downtown areas and suburban main streets, which have high barriers &#8209;to &#8209;entry, high population density, improving demographic trends and a propensity for growth. We believe that the critical mass of redevelopment in such areas creates positive externalities, which enhance the value of substantially stabilized assets in the area. We believe that these assets will provide greater returns than similar assets in other markets, as a result of the improving demographics, public commitment, and significant private investment that characterize these areas. 

&#160; 

We are managed by affiliates of CIM Group, L.P. (&#8220;CIM Group&#8221; or &#8220;CIM&#8221;). CIM Group is a vertically &#8209;integrated, full &#8209;service investment manager with multi &#8209;disciplinary expertise and in &#8209;house research, acquisition, investment, development, finance, leasing, and management capabilities. CIM Group is headquartered in Los Angeles , California and has offices in Oakland, California; Bethesda, Maryland; Dallas, Texas; and New York, New York . See &#8220;Item 1&#8212;Business&#8212;Overview and History of CIM Group&#8221;, &#8220;&#8212;CIM Urban Partnership Agreement&#8221; and &#8220;&#8212;Investment Management Agreement.&#8221; 

&#160; 

We seek attractive risk &#8209;adjusted returns by utilizing the CIM platform which has generated superior returns across multiple market cycles by focusing on improved asset and community performance, and capitalizing on market inefficiencies and distressed situations. Over time, we seek to expand our real estate holdings in communities targeted by CIM Group for investment, supported by CIM Group&#8217;s broad real estate investment capabilities, as part of our plan to prudently grow market value and earnings. 

&#160; 

We invest primarily in substantially stabiliz ed real estate and real estate &#8209; related assets located in areas that CIM has targeted for opportunistic investment. These areas include traditional downtown areas and suburban main streets, which have high barriers - to - entry, high population density, improving demographic trends and a propensity for growth. CIM believes that the critical mass of redevelopment in such areas creates positive externalities, which enhance the value of substantially stabilized assets in the area. CIM targets investments in diverse types of real estate assets, including office, retail, for &#8209;rent and for &#8209;sale multifamily residential, hotel, parking, and signage through CIM&#8217;s extensive network and its current opportunistic investment activities. 

&#160; 

On July 8, 2013, PMC Commercial Trust (&#8220;PMC Commercial&#8221;) entered into a merger agreement (the &#8220;Merger Agreement&#8221;) with CIM Urban REIT, LLC (&#8220;CIM REIT&#8221;), an affiliate of CIM Group, and subsidiaries of the respective parties. CIM REIT, a private commercial r eal estate investment t rust (&#8220; REIT &#8221;) , was the owner of CIM Urban Partners, L . P . (&#8220;CIM Urban&#8221;). The transaction (the &#8220;Merger&#8221;) was completed on March 11, 2014 (the &#8220;Acquisition Date&#8221;). 

&#160; 

The Merger Agreement provided for the business combination of CIM REIT&#8217;s wholly - owned subsidiary, CIM Urban, and PMC Commercial. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Urban Partners II, LLC (&#8220;Urban II&#8221;), an affiliate of CIM REIT, received 4,400,000 shares of newly &#8209;issued PMC Commercial common stock and approximately 65,000,000 shares of newly &#8209;issued PMC Commercial preferred stock. Following the Merger and subsequent increase in our authorized number of shares, each share of preferred stock was converted into 1.4 shares of PMC Commercial common stock, resulting in the issuance of 95,440,000 shares of PMC Commercial common stock in the aggregate in connection with the Merger, representing approximately 97.8% of PMC Commercial&#8217;s outstanding shares of common stock at the time . 

&#160; 

All shares of PMC Commercial common stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the closing of the Merger continue d to remain outstanding following the Acquisition Date. In addition, stockholders of record of PMC Commercial at the close of the business day prior to the Acquisition Date received a special cash dividend of $27.50 per share of c ommon s tock plus the pro &#8209;rata portion of PMC Commercial&#8217;s regular quarterly cash dividend accrued through the Acquisition Date, each of which was paid March 25, 2014. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Upon completion of the Merger, PMC Commercial became the parent of CIM Urban. PMC Commercial reincorporated from Texas to Maryland on April 28, 2014 and, on the same day, changed its name from &#8220;PMC Commercial Trust&#8221; to &#8220;CIM Commercial Trust Corporation.&#8221; 

&#160; 

The Merger was accounted for as a reverse acquisition under the acquisition method of accounting with CIM Urban considered to be the accounting acquirer based upon the terms of the Merger Agreement. Based on the determination that CIM Urban was the accounting acquirer in the transaction, CIM Urban allocated the purchase price to the fair value of PMC Commercial&#8217;s assets and liabilities as of the Acquisition Date. 

&#160; 

Furthermore, on April 28, 2014, we filed Articles of Amendment (the &#8220;Reverse Split Amendment&#8221;) to effectuate a one &#8209;for &#8209;five reverse stock split of our common stock (&#8220;Common Stock&#8221;), effective April 29, 2014. Pursuant to the reverse stock split, each five shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the reverse stock split were converted into one share of Common Stock. All per share and outstanding share information from before the Reverse Split Amendment included herein has been presented to reflect the reverse stock split unless otherwise noted. 

&#160; 

In order to allow CIM Commercial to increase its focus o n Class A and creative office investments, our Board of Directors approved a plan for the lending segment that, when completed, will result in the deconsolidation of the lending segment. The assets and liabilities of the lending segment have been reflected as held for sale in our consolidated December 31, 2015 and 2014 balance sheets and its operations have been reflected as discontinued operations in our consolidated income statements for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. During July 2015, to maximize value, we modified our strategy from a strategy of selling the lending segment as a whole to a strategy of soliciting buyers for components of the business. On December 17, 2015, pursuant to such modified plan, we sold substantially all of our commercial mortgage loans that are associated with the lending segment to an unrelated third party . This change in the sale methodology resulted in the need to extend the period to complete the sale of the remainder of the lending segment beyond one year. The Company is continuing its efforts and is actively soliciting the sale of the remainder of the lending segment . 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, our real estate portfolio c onsisted of 33 assets, all of which are fee - simple properties except one leasehold property. As of December 31, 2015, our 24 office properties (including two parking garages, one of which has street level retail space, and two development sites, one of which is being used as a parking lot) , totaling approximately 5.6 million rentable square feet, were 8 6.9 % occupied ; our multifamily properties, composed of 930 units, were 92.4 % occupied; and our hotels, which have a total of 1,070 rooms, had revenue per available room (&#8220;RevPAR &#8221;) of $108 . 88 for the year ended December 31, 2015. Our office portfolio contributed approximately 70.1 % of revenue from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2015, while our hotel portfolio contributed approximately 22 .9%, and our multifamily portfolio contributed approximately 7 . 0 %. 

&#160; 

Our office, multifamily and hotel assets are located in 10 U.S. markets. The breakdown by segment, market and submarket, as of December 31, 2015, is as follows:

Segments 

&#160; 

We operate in the following business segments: the acquisition, redevelopment, ownership, and management of (i) office real estate; (ii) multifamily real estate; and (iii) hotels . We also have the &#160; lending segment , which w as &#160; acquired in connection with the Merger in March 2014 and is classified as held for sale at December 31, 2015 and 2014 . Information related to our business segments for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 is set forth in Note s 7 and 19 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 15 of this report. 

&#160; 

Business Objectives and Growth Strategies 

&#160; 

Our objective is to achieve superior long &#8209;term returns relative to the risk that we are undertaking. We intend to achieve this objective by continuing to deploy the investment processes that CIM Group has developed during 22 years as an investor in urban markets and identifying opportunities to invest at prices below intrinsic values. 

&#160; 

We intend to drive portfolio growth through a combination of acquisition and asset management strategies, which are designed to increase cash flows and asset value. 

&#160; 

Our investment strategy is centered around CIM&#8217;s community qualification process. We believe this strategy provides us with a significant competitive advantage when making urban real estate investments. The qualification process generally takes between six months and five years and is a critical component of CIM&#8217;s investment evaluation. CIM examines the characteristics of a market to determine whether the district justifies the extensive efforts CIM undertakes in reviewing and making potential investments in its qualified communities (&#8220;Qualified Communities&#8221;). Qualified Communities generally fall into one of two categories: (i) transitional urban districts that have dedicated resources to become vibrant urban communities and (ii) well &#8209;established, thriving urban areas (typically major central business districts). Qualified Communities are distinct districts which have dedicated resources to become or are currently vibrant communities where people can live, work, shop and be entertained&#8212;all within walking distance or close proximity to public transportation. These areas also generally have high barriers - to - entry, high population density, improving demographic trends and a propensity for growth. CIM believes that a vast majority of the risks associated with making real asset investments are mitigated by accumulating local market knowledge of the community where the investment lies. CIM typically spends significant time and resources qualifying targeted investment communities prior to making any acquisitions. Since 1994, CIM Group has qualified 103 communities and has deployed capital in 50 of these Qualified Communities. Although we may not invest exclusively in Qualified Communities, it is expected that most of our investments will be identified through this systematic process. 

&#160; 

CIM seeks to maximize the value of its investments through active asset management. CIM has extensive in &#8209;house research, acquisition, investment, development, financing, leasing and property management capabilities, which leverage its deep understanding of urban communities to position properties for multiple uses and to maximize operating income. As a fully integrated owner and operator, CIM&#8217;s asset management capabilities are complemented by its in &#8209;house property management capabilities. Property managers prepare annual capital and operating budgets and monthly operating reports, monitor results and oversee vendor services, maintenance and capital improvement schedules. In addition, they ensure that revenue objectives are met, lease terms are followed, receivables are collected, preventative maintenance programs are implemented, vendors are evaluated and expenses are controlled. CIM&#8217;s Asset Management Committee (the &#8220;Asset Management Committee&#8221;) reviews and approves strategic plans for each investment, including financial, leasing, marketing, property positioning and strategic and disposition plans. In addition, the Asset Management Committee reviews and approves the annual business plan for each property, including its capital and operating budget. CIM&#8217;s organizational structure provides for investment and asset management continuity through multi &#8209;disciplinary teams responsible for an asset from the time of the original investment recommendation , &#160; through the implementation of the asset&#8217;s business plan, and any disposition activities. 

&#160; 

Competitive Advantages 

&#160; 

We believe that CIM Group&#8217;s experienced team and integrated and multi &#8209;disciplinary organization, coupled with its community &#8209;focused and disciplined urban real estate investment philosophy, results in a competitive advantage that benefits us. Additionally, CIM&#8217;s investment strategy is complemented by a number of other competitive advantages including its use of low leverage, underwriting approach, disciplined capital deployment, and strong network of relationships. CIM&#8217;s competitive advantages include: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Vertically &#8209;Integrated Organization and Team 

&#160; 

&#160;

CIM is managed by its senior management team, which is comprised of its three founders, Shaul Kuba, Richard Ressler and Avi Shemesh, and includes ten other principals. CIM Group is vertically &#8209;integrated and organized into seven functional groups including Investments, Development, Property Management, Financial Reporting, Compliance, Operations, and Internal Audit. 

&#160; 

To support CIM&#8217;s organic growth and related investment platforms, CIM has invested substantial time and resources in building a strong and integrated team of approximately &#160; 280 experienced professionals. Each of CIM Group&#8217;s departments is managed by seasoned professionals and CIM continues to develop the extensive team of senior management, which represents the next generation of CIM&#8217;s leaders. In addition to developing a core team of principals and senior level management, CIM has proactively managed its growth through career development and mentoring at both the mid and junior staffing levels, and has hired ahead of its needs, thus ensuring appropriate management and staffing for its investment activities. 

&#160; 

CIM leverages the deep operating and industry experience of its principals and professionals, as well as their extensive relationships, to source and execute opportunistic, stabilized, and infrastructure investments. Each investment opportunity is overseen by a dedicated team comprised of an oversight principal (Richard Ressler, Avi Shemesh, Shaul Kuba or Charles E. Garner II, our Chief Executive Officer), a team lead (vice president level and above), associate vice presidents and associates, as necessary, who are responsible for managing the investment from sourcing through underwriting, acquisition, development (if required), asset management, and disposition. As part of this process, the team draws upon CIM&#8217;s extensive in &#8209;house expertise in legal matters, finance, development, leasing, and property management. Each dedicated investment team is purposefully staffed with professionals from multiple CIM offices, regardless of the location of the asset being evaluated. As a result, all investment professionals work across a variety of Qualified Communities and CIM&#8217;s knowledge base is shared across all of its offices. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Community Qualification 

&#160; 

Since inception, CIM&#8217;s proven community qualification process has served as the foundation for its investment strategy. CIM targets high barrier s &#8209;to &#8209;entry markets and submarkets with high population density and applies rigorous research to qualify for potential investments. Since 1994, CIM has qualified 103 communities in high barrier s &#8209;to &#8209;entry markets and has deployed capital in 50 of these Qualified Communities. CIM examines the characteristics of a market to determine whether the district justifies the extensive efforts its investment professionals undertake in reviewing and making potential investments in its Qualified Communities. Qualified Communities generally fall into one of two categories: (i) transitional urban districts that have dedicated resources to become vibrant urban communities and (ii) well &#8209;established, thriving urban areas (typically major central business districts) . &#160; 

&#160; 

As more fully described in &#8220;&#8212;Principles,&#8221; once a community is qualified, CIM continues to differentiate itself by applying various business principles including: (i) product non &#8209;specific&#8212;CIM has extensive experience investing in a diverse range of property types, including retail, residential, office, parking, hotel, signage, and mixed &#8209;use, which gives CIM the ability to execute and capitalize on its urban strategy effectively; (ii) community &#8209;based tenanting&#8212;CIM&#8217;s investment strategy focuses on the entire community and the best use of assets in that community; owning a significant number of key properties in an area better enables CIM to meet the needs of national retailers and office tenants and thus optimize the value of these real estate properties; (iii) local market leadership with North American footprint&#8212;CIM maintains local market knowledge and relationships, along with a diversified North American presence, through its 103 Qualified Communities (thus, CIM has the flexibility to invest in its Qualified Communities only when the market environment meets CIM&#8217;s investment and underwriting standards); and (iv) investing across the capital stack&#8212;CIM has extensive experience investing across the capital stack including equity, preferred equity, debt and mezzanine investments, giving it the flexibility to structure transactions in efficient and creative ways. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Investment Discipline 

&#160; 

CIM&#8217;s investment strategy relies on its sound business plan and value creation execution to produce strong returns, rather than financial engineering. CIM Group&#8217;s underwriting of its investments is performed both on a leveraged and unleveraged basis. Additionally, CIM has generally not utilized recourse or cross &#8209;collateralized debt due to its conservative underwriting standards. 

&#160; 

&#160;

CIM employs multiple underwriting scenarios when evaluating potential investment opportunities. CIM Group generally underwrites investments utilizing long &#8209;term average exit capitalization rates for similar product types and long &#8209;term average interest rates. Where possible, these long &#8209;term averages cross multiple market cycles, thereby mitigating the risk of cyclical volatility. CIM&#8217;s &#8220;long &#8209;term average&#8221; underwriting is based on its belief, reinforced by its experience through multiple market cycles, that over the life of any given fund that it manages, such fund should be able to exit its investments at long &#8209;term historical averages. CIM also underwrites a &#8220;current market case&#8221; scenario, which generally utilizes current submarket specific exit assumptions and interest rates, in order to reflect anticipated investment results under current market conditions. CIM believes that utilizing multiple underwriting scenarios enables CIM to assess potential returns relative to risk within a range of potential investment outcomes. 

&#160; 

Investment Strategy 

&#160; 

Our investment strategy is to continue to invest in Class A and creative office investments in vibrant and improving urban communities throughout the U nited S tates in a manner that will allow us to increase the value of our assets and to grow our revenue and cash flow in order to enhance the dividends paid to stockholders. By employing a similar investment strategy to that which CIM has consistently utilized to target stabilized real estate assets, our objective is to utilize CIM&#8217;s extensive knowledge of Qualified Communities to identify investment opportunities at prices below intrinsic values and achieve superior returns relative to the risk which we are undertaking. 

&#160; 

We have been reviewing our strategies with respect to certain of our non-office and non-strategic real estate portfolio. As a result of such review, we sold a hotel in Oakland, California in February 2016 and an office building in Orange County, California in November 2015. As a general matter, we continuously evaluate our portfolio as well as our strategy and such review may result in additional dispositions that no longer fit our overall objectives and/or changes in our strategy. 

&#160;

Financing Strategy 

&#160; 

We currently have substantial borrowing capacity and will likely finance our future activities through one or more of the following methods: (i) offerings of shares of common stock , preferred shares, s enior unsecured securities, and/or other equity and debt securities; (ii) the use and potential expansion of our existing unsecured credit facility and term loan ; (iii) the addition of senior recourse or non &#8209;recourse debt using target acquisitions as well as existing investments as collateral; (iv) the sale of existing investments ; and/or (v) cash flows from operations . We expect to maintain leverage levels that are comparable to those of other commercial REITs engaged in business strategies similar to our own. 

&#160; 

Risk Management 

&#160; 

As part of its risk management strategy, CIM will continually evaluate our investments and actively manage the risks involved in our business strategies. CIM&#8217;s investment professionals will provide asset management oversight by closely monitoring the performance of our investments relative to market and industry benchmarks and internal underwriting assumptions using direct knowledge of local markets provided by CIM&#8217;s in &#8209;house asset management, property management, and leasing professionals. In &#8209;house property management capabilities include monthly and annual budgeting and reporting as well as vendor services management, property maintenance and capital expenditures management. Property m anagement seeks to ensure that revenue objectives are met, lease terms are followed, receivables are collected, preventative maintenance programs are implemented, vendors are evaluated and expenses are controlled. CIM&#8217;s Asset Management Committee oversees the asset management of investments and consists of CIM&#8217;s four most senior investment professionals: Shaul Kuba, Richard Ressler, Avi Shemesh and our Chief Executive Officer, Charles E. Garner II (the &#8220;Oversight Principals&#8221;), each of whom has extensive experience in investment, development, asset and property management and leasing. Every investment is directly overseen by an Oversight Principal who is ultimately responsible for the performance of the investment. The Oversight Principals work with each CIM department to ensure that every investment benefits from the full range of CIM&#8217;s real estate expertise. CIM believes that empowering its most seasoned investment professionals to bring their breadth of experience to bear directly on investments will optimize investment returns. 

&#160; 

The Oversight Principals meet informally on a frequent basis, generally weekly, to review and discuss the performance of investments, and meet formally at least annually to review and approve strategic plans for the investments, including: financial and operational analyses, operating strategies and agreements, tenant composition and marketing, asset positioning, market conditions affecting the asset, hold/sell analyses and timing considerations, and the annual business plan for each investment, including its capital and operating budget. 

&#160; 

The size, composition, and policies of the Asset Management Committee may be changed from time to time. 

&#160; 

Regulatory Matters 

&#160; 

Environmental Matters 

&#160; 

Environmental laws regulate, and impose liability for, releases of hazardous or toxic substances into the environment. Under some of these laws, an owner or operator of real estate is or may be liable for costs related to soil or groundwater contamination on, in, or migrating to or from its property. In addition, persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances may be liable for the costs of cleaning up contamination at the disposal site. Such laws often impose liability regardless of whether the person knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of the hazardous or toxic substances that caused the contamination. The presence of, or contamination resulting from, any of these substances, or the failure to properly remediate them, may adversely affect our ability to sell or rent our property or to borrow using such property as collateral. Third parties may also make claims against owners or operators of properties for personal injuries and property damage associated with releases of hazardous materials. As part of our efforts to mitigate these risks, we typically engage third parties to perform assessments of potential environmental risks when evaluating a new acquisition of property. 

&#160; 

Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 

&#160; 

Under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (the &#8220;ADA&#8221;), all public accommodations must meet federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. Although we believe that our properties substantially comply with present requirements of the ADA, we have not conducted an audit or investigation of all of our properties to determine our compliance. If one or more of our properties or future properties is not in compliance with the ADA, then we would be required to incur additional costs to bring the property into compliance. We cannot predict the ultimate 

&#160;

amount of the cost of compliance with the ADA. If we incur substantial costs to comply with the ADA, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flow or ability to satisfy our debt service obligations or to maintain our level of dividend distributions could be materially adversely affected. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

We compete with other investors engaged in the acquisition, development, and management of real estate and real estate &#8209;related investments. Our competitors include other REITs, insurance companies, pension funds, private equity funds, sovereign wealth funds, hedge funds, mortgage banks, investment banks, commercial banks, savings and loan associations, specialty finance companies, and other private and institutional investors and financial companies that pursue strategies similar to ours. Some of our competitors may be larger than us and have greater access to capital and other resources and may have other advantages over us. In addition, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or lower profitability targets than us, which could allow them to pursue new business more aggressively than us. We believe that our relationship with CIM Group gives us a competitive advantage that allows us to operate more effectively in the markets in which we conduct our business. 

&#160;

CIM Group&#8217;s successful track record is anchored by CIM&#8217;s community &#8209;oriented approach to urban investing as well as a number of other competitive advantages including its use of low leverage, underwriting approach, disciplined capital deployment, vertically &#8209;integrated capabilities and strong network of relationships.

1 AUM , or Gross AUM, represents (i)(a) for real assets, the aggregate total gross assets (&#8220;GAV&#8221;) at fair value, including the shares of such assets owned by joint venture partners and co-investments, of all of CIM&#8217;s advised accounts (each an &#8220;Account&#8221; and collectively, the &#8220;Accounts&#8221;) or (b) for operating companies, the aggregate GAV less debt, including the shares of such assets owned by joint venture partners and co-investments, of all of the Accounts (not in duplication of the assets described in clause (i)(a)), plus (ii) the aggregate unfunded commitments of the Accounts, as of September 30, 2015. The GAV is calculated on the same basis as the September 30, 2015 unaudited financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles on a fair value basis (&#8220;Book Value&#8221;), other than as described below with respect to CIM REIT. The only investment currently held by CIM REIT consists of shares in the Company; the Book Value of CIM REIT is determined by assuming the underlying assets of the Company are liquidated based upon management&#8217;s estimate of fair value. CIM does not presently view the price of the Company&#8217;s publicly-traded shares to be a meaningful indication of the fair value of CIM REIT&#8217;s interest in the Company due to the fact that the publicly-traded shares of the Company represent less than 3% of the outstanding shares and are thinly-traded.

&#160; 

EUM, or Net AUM, represents (i) the aggregate NAV of the Accounts (as described below), plus (ii) the aggregate unfunded commitments of the Accounts. The NAV of each Account is based upon the aggregate amounts that would be distributable (prior to incentive fee allocations) to such Account assuming a &#8220;hypothetical liquidation&#8221; of the Account on the date of determination, assuming that: (x) investments are sold at their Book Value (as defined above); (y) debts are paid and other assets are collected; and (z) appropriate adjustments and/or allocations between equity investors are made in accordance with applicable documents, in each case as determined in accordance with applicable accounting guidance.

Principles 

&#160; 

As described in &#8220;&#8212;Business Objectives and Growth Strategies&#8221; and &#8220;&#8212;Competitive Advantages,&#8221; the community qualification process is one of CIM Group&#8217;s core competencies, which demonstrates a disciplined investing program and strategic outlook on urban communities. Once a community is qualified, CIM Group believes it continues to differentiate itself through the following business principles: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Product Non &#8209;Specific: CIM has extensive experience investing in a diverse range of property types, including retail, residential, office, parking, hotel, signage, and mixed &#8209;use, which gives CIM the ability to execute and capitalize on its urban strategy effectively. Successful investment requires selecting the right markets coupled with providing the right product. CIM&#8217;s experience with multiple assets types does not predispose CIM Group to select certain asset types, but instead ensures that we deliver a product mix that is consistent with the market&#8217;s requirements and needs. Additionally, there is a growing trend towards developing mixed &#8209;use real estate properties in urban markets which requires a diversified investment platform to successfully execute. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Community &#8209;Based Tenanting: CIM&#8217;s investment strategy focuses on the entire community and the best use of assets in that community. Owning a significant number of key properties in an area better enables CIM to meet the needs of national retailers and office tenants and thus optimize the value of these real estate properties. CIM believes that its community perspective gives it a significant competitive advantage in attracting tenants to its retail, office and mixed &#8209;use properties and creating synergies between the different tenant types. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Local Market Leadership with North American Footprint: CIM maintains local market knowledge and relationships, along with a diversified North American presence, through its 103 Qualified Communities . Thus, CIM has the flexibility to invest in its Qualified Communities only when the market environment meets CIM&#8217;s investment and underwriting standards. CIM does not need to invest in a given community or product type at a specific time due to its broad proprietary pipeline of communities. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Investing Across the Capital Stack: CIM has extensive experience investing across the capital stack including equity, preferred equity, debt and mezzanine investments, giving it the flexibility to structure transactions in efficient and creative ways. 

&#160; 

CIM Urban Partnership Agreement 

&#160; 

Our subsidiary, CIM Urban, is governed by CIM Urban&#8217;s partnership agreement (the &#8220;CIM Urban Partnership Agreement&#8221;).

&#160;

&#160; 

The class A members of CIM REIT, upon a two &#8209;thirds vote of the interests of such members, may remove and replace CIM Urban GP as the general partner of CIM Urban if (a) certain affiliates and related parties of CIM Urban GP cease to own at least 85% of the class A membership units of CIM REIT that they have acquired or (b) any two of Shaul Kuba, Richard Ressler or Avi Shemesh cease to be actively engaged in the management of the general partner.

&#160; 

The Advisor is responsible for the payment of all costs and expenses relating to the general operation of its business, including administrative expenses, employment expenses and office expenses.

Master Services Agreement 

&#160; 

On March 11, 2014, we entered into the Master Services Agreement (the &#8220;Master Services Agreement&#8221;) with CIM Service Provider, LLC (the &#8220;Manager&#8221;), an affiliate of CIM Group, pursuant to which the Manager agrees to provide or arrange for other service providers to provide management and administration services to us (&#8220;Base Service&#8221;). Pursuant to the Master Services Agreement, we appointed an affiliate of CIM Group as the manager (&#8220;Urban GP Manager&#8221;) of CIM Urban GP. Under the Master Services Agreement, we pay a base service fee (the &#8220;Base Service Fee &#8221;) to the Manager initially set at $1,000,000 per year (subject to an annual escalation by a specified inflation factor beginning on January 1, 2015), payable quarterly in arrears. Based on the annual escalation factor, the B ase Service Fee for 2015 was $1,010,000. The Base Service Fee began to accrue on March 11, 2014 and was pro &#8209;rated based on the number of days during the first quarter in which the Master Services Agreement was in effect. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Manager earned a Base Service Fee of $ 1,01 0 ,000 and $806 ,000, respectively.

The Manager&#8217;s compensation is based on the salaries and benefits of the employees of the Manager and/or its affiliates who performed these services (allocated based on the percentage of time spent on our affairs and the affairs of our subsidiaries). For the year s ended December 31, 201 5 and 201 4 , we expensed $2,9 93 ,000 and &#160; $1,193,000 for such services , respectively . At December 31, 201 5 and 2014, $ 1,256 ,000 and $ 725,000 was due to the Manager , respectively, for such services . 

As of January 1, 2015, substantially all of our lending segment employees moved to CIM SBA Staffing, LLC (&#8220;CIM SBA&#8221;), an affiliate of CIM Group, except for two of our officers , who became jointly employed by us and CIM SBA and their employment agreements with us continue in full force and effect. In connection with this move , on January 1, 2015, we entered into a Staffing and Reimbursement Agreement with CIM SBA and our subsidiary, PMC Commercial Lending, LLC, which provides that CIM SBA will provide personnel and resources to us and that we will reimburse CIM SBA for the costs and expenses of providing such personnel and resources. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we incurred expenses related to services subject to reimbursement by us under this agreement of $4,627,000 , which are included in discontinued operations and $434 ,000 , which are included in asset management and other fees to related parties. In addition, we expensed $1,638,000 for transaction costs paid to CIM SBA for reimbursement of costs in connection with the sale of substantially all of our commercial mortgage loans to an unrelated third party . 

&#160; 

Other Services 

&#160; 

CIM Management, Inc. and certain of its affiliates (collectively, the &#8220;CIM Management Entities&#8221;), all affiliates of CIM REIT and CIM Group , provide property management, leasing, and development services to CIM Urban. The CIM Management Entities earned property management fees, which are included in rental and other property operating expenses, totaling $5, 8 1 4,000, $ 5,284,000 and $4,828,000 for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. CIM Urban also reimbursed the CIM Management Entities $ 8,31 9,000, $7,369,000 and $5,082,000 during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, for the cost of on &#8209;site personnel incurred on behalf of CIM Urban, which is included in rental and other property operating expenses.

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

Lending Segment 

&#160; 

In order to allow CIM Commercial to increase its focus o n Class A and creative office investments , our Board of Directors approved a plan for the lending segment that, when completed, will result in the deconsolidation of the lending segment . The assets and liabilities of the lending segment have been reflected as held for sale in our consolidated December 31, 2015 and 2014 balance sheets and its operations have been reflected as discontinued operations in our consolidated income statements for the years end ed December 31, 2015 and 2014. During July 2015, to maximize value, we modified our strategy from a strategy of selling the lending segment as a whole to a strategy of solicit ing buyers for components of the business. On December 17, 2015, pursuant to such &#160; modified plan, we sold substantially all of our commercial mortgage loans that are associated with the lending segment &#160; to an unrelated third party . This change in the sale methodology resulted in the need to exten d the period to complete the sale of the r emainder of the lending segment &#160; beyond one year. The Company is continuing its efforts and is actively soliciting the sale of the remainder of the lending segment . 

&#160; 

Through o ur lending business , we are a national lender that primarily originates loans to small businesses. We identify loan origination opportunities through personal contacts, internet referrals, attendance at trade shows and meetings, direct mailings, advertisements in trade publications and other marketing methods. We also generate loans through referrals from real estate and loan brokers, franchise representatives, existing borrowers, lawyers and accountants. &#160; 

&#160; 

As part of our lending business , we also originate commercial real estate loans for properties that are primarily located in CIM Group&#8217;s Qualified Communities. We target investments between $20 million and $100 million with a focus on developing a diversified pool of loans. These loans are typically short duration (five years or less, inclusive of extension options), floating rate and are expected to be: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

limited and/or non-recourse junior (mezzanine, b-note or 2 nd lien) and senior construction loan s ; or 

&#183; 

limited and/or non-recourse junior (mezzanine, b-note or 2 nd lien ) and senior acquisition, bridge or repositioning loans. 

&#160; 

We intend to participate with one or more institutional investors with respect to a substantial portion of these loans, and/or syndicate a substantial portion of these loans to, one or more institutional investors. 

&#160; 

During 2015, we funded an aggregate of $59.5 million of loans in our lending business and received principal payments (including prepayments ) of $ 44.3 million &#160; (i ncluded in the amount funded during 2015 was $20.4 million for a commercial real estate loan ) . From the Acquisition Date to December 31, 2014, we funded an aggregate of $51.0 million of loans and received principal payments (including prepayments ) of $ 49.4 million. In addition, we sold substantially all of our &#160; commercial mortgage loans with a book value of $77.1 million on December 17, 2015 to an unrelated third party , resulting in a gain of $5.2 million . &#160; 

&#160; 

SBA 7(a) Program 

&#160; 

Our SBA lending subsidiary, First Western SBLC, Inc. (&#8220;First Western&#8221;), is licensed as a small business lending company (&#8220;SBLC&#8221;) that originates loans through the Small Business Administration&#8217;s (&#8220;SBA&#8221;) 7(a) Program (&#8220;SBA 7(a) Program&#8221;) . 

The SBA maintains a Preferred Lender Program wherein it grants Preferred Lender Program (&#8220;PLP&#8221;) status to certain lenders originating SBA 7(a) Program loans based on achievement of certain standards in lending which are regularly monitored by the SBA. First Western has been granted national PLP status and originates, sells and services small business loans. As a Preferred Lender, First Western is authorized to place SBA guarantees on loans without seeking prior SBA review and approval. Being a national lender, PLP status allows First Western to expedite loans since First Western is not required to present applications to the SBA for concurrent review and approval. 

We utilize the SBA 7(a) Program to originate small business loans, primarily secured by real estate, and then sell the government guaranteed portion to investors. 

&#160; 

The SBA 7(a) Program is the SBA&#8217;s primary loan program. In general, the SBA reduces risks to lenders by guaranteeing major portions of qualified loans made to small businesses. This enables lenders to provide financing to small businesses when funding may otherwise be unavailable or not available on reasonable terms. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

Under the SBA 7(a) Program, the SBA typically guarantees 75% of qualified loans over $150,000. The eligibility requirements of the SBA 7(a) Program vary by the industry of the borrower and affiliates and other factors. In order to operate as an SBLC, a licensee is required to maintain a minimum level of regulatory capital (as defined by SBA regulations) of the greater of (1) 10% of its outstanding loans receivable and other investments or (2) $1.0 million, and is subject to certain other regulatory restrictions such as change in control provisions. First Western is periodically examined and audited by the SBA to determine compliance with SBA regulations.

In addition to our retained SBA 7(a) portfolio described above, we service $106.0 million of aggregate principal balance remaining on secondary market loan sales.

The calculation of average yield divides our interest income and other loan related fees, adjusted by the provision for loan losses, by the weighted average loans receivable outstanding on an annualized basis.
