 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

&#160; 

Overview 

&#160; 

Amyris, Inc. (or the "Company," "Amyris," "we," "us," or "our") is a leading integrated industrial biotechnology company that is applying its technology platform to engineer, manufacture and sell high performance, low cost products into a variety of consumer and industrial markets, including cosmetics, flavors &#38; fragrances (or F&#38;F), solvents and cleaners, polymers, lubricants, healthcare products and fuels, and we are seeking to apply our technology to the development of pharmaceuticals products. Our proven technology platform allows us to rapidly engineer microbes and use them as living factories to metabolize renewable, plant-sourced sugars into large volume, high-value hydrocarbon molecules. Using yeast as these living factories, our industrial fermentation process replaces existing complex and expensive chemical manufacturing processes. We believe industrial synthetic biology represents a third industrial revolution, bringing together biology and engineering to generate new, more sustainable materials to meet the growing global demand for bio-based replacements for petroleum, animal- or plant-derived chemicals. We continue to work to build demand for our current portfolio of products through a network of distributors and through direct sales, and are engaged in collaborations across a variety of markets, including personal care, performance chemicals and industrials, to drive additional product sales and partnership opportunities.

&#160; 

Background 

&#160;

Amyris was founded in 2003 in the San Francisco Bay Area by a group of scientists from the University of California, Berkeley. Our first major milestone came in 2005 when, through a grant from the Bill &#38; Melinda Gates Foundation, we developed technology capable of creating microbial strains that produce artemisinic acid - a precursor of artemisinin, an effective anti-malarial drug. In 2008, we granted royalty-free licenses to allow Sanofi-Aventis (or Sanofi) to produce artemisinic acid using our technology. Since 2013, Sanofi has been distributing millions of artemisinin-based anti-malarial treatments incorporating this artemisinic acid. Building on our success with artemisinic acid, in 2007 we began applying our technology platform to develop, manufacture and sell sustainable alternatives to a broad range of materials.

&#160;

We focused our initial development efforts primarily on the production of Biofene &#174; , our brand of renewable farnesene, a long-chain, branched hydrocarbon molecule that we manufacture through fermentation using engineered microbes. Using farnesene as a first commercial building block molecule, we have developed a wide range of renewable products for our various target markets, including cosmetics, F&#38;F, healthcare products and fuels, and we are pursuing opportunities for the application of our technology in the pharmaceuticals market. Our technology platform allows us to rapidly develop microbial strains to produce other target molecules, and, in 2014, we began manufacturing additional molecules for the F&#38;F industry.

&#160;

Since inception, we have received equity and debt financing from investors including affiliates of Total S.A. (collectively referred to as Total), the international energy company, and affiliates of Temasek Holdings (Private) Limited, the Singapore sovereign wealth fund (collectively referred to as Temasek), and various venture capital and private equity investors. Our stock is traded on The NASDAQ Stock Market (or NASDAQ) under the symbol AMRS.

&#160; 

&#160;

Our Platform 

&#160;

Amyris' proprietary microbial engineering and screening technologies have industrialized bioengineering of microbes, and most of our efforts to date have been focused on engineering yeast. Our platform provides predictable and efficient &#8220;living factories&#8221; that allow us to convert plant-sourced sugars, primarily sugarcane syrup, through fermentation, into high-value hydrocarbon molecules instead of low-value alcohol.

&#160;

We are able to use a wide variety of feedstocks for production, but have focused on accessing Brazilian sugarcane for our large-scale production because of its renewability, low cost and relative price stability. We have also successfully used other feedstocks such as sugar beets, corn dextrose, sweet sorghum and cellulosic sugars at various manufacturing facilities.

&#160;

We are currently producing four molecules at our industrial fermentation plant: artemisinic acid, farnesene and two fragrance molecules. We and our partners develop products from these molecules for several target markets, including cosmetics, F&#38;F, solvents, polymers, industrials and healthcare products, and we are pursuing arrangements with a number of drug companies for their use of our molecules to develop pharmaceutical products. We are engaged in collaborations with multiple companies that are leaders within their respective markets, including Total and worldwide leaders in specialty chemicals, consumer care, F&#38;F, food ingredients and health, and who sell our ingredients to hundreds of brands that serve millions of consumers.

&#160; 

Corporate Information 

&#160;

We were founded in 2003 and completed our initial public offering in 2010. As of January 31, 2016, we had 418 employees (including 257 in the United States and 161 in Brazil). Our corporate headquarters and pilot plant are located in Emeryville, California, and our Brazil headquarters and pilot plant are located in Campinas, Brazil. We have two operating subsidiaries, Amyris Brasil Ltda. (or Amyris Brasil) and Amyris Fuels LLC (or Amyris Fuels). Amyris Brasil oversees establishment and expansion of our production in Brazil. Amyris Fuels was originally established to help us develop fuel distribution capabilities in the United States by selling ethanol and reformulated ethanol-blended gasoline. In 2012, we transitioned out of the ethanol and ethanol-blended gasoline business to focus our efforts on production and commercialization of renewable products.

&#160; 

Strategy and Business Model 

&#160;

Our mission is to apply inspired science to deliver sustainable solutions for a growing world. We seek to become the world's leading provider of renewable, high-performance alternatives to non-renewable products. In the past, choosing a renewable product often required producers to compromise on performance or price. With our technology, leading consumer brands can develop products made from renewable sources that offer equivalent or better performance and stable supply with competitive pricing. We call this our No Compromise&#174; value proposition. We aim to improve the world one molecule at a time by providing the best alternatives to non-renewable products.

&#160;

We have developed and are operating our company under a business model that generates cash from both collaborations and from product sales. We believe this combination will enable us to realize our vision of becoming the world&#8217;s leading renewable products company.

&#160; 

&#160;

Collaborations 

&#160;

Collaborations provide us with funding to develop innovative new products that allow our partners to replace existing supply sources with products with competitive performance and economics. These collaborative technology-based partnerships typically range from three to five years and have funded a substantial portion of our direct research and development expenses since 2012. These collaborations have provided us with a robust pipeline of molecules under development from which we expect to launch production of two to three products annually at our industrial scale facility in Brazil. Our collaborations generate value in several ways, including:

&#160;

&#8226; helping us identify and develop molecules that address critical supply or performance needs for our partners, while receiving collaboration payments for technology access and research and development; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#8226; minimizing risk of product market entry and optimizing our resource prioritization; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#8226; using our integrated manufacturing capabilities to produce and sell collaboration target molecules to our partners; &#160;

&#8226; participating in additional value-sharing arrangements based on the cost/benefits to our partners of using the molecules we develop; and &#160;

&#8226; providing opportunities to develop products for markets outside the partner agreements from the research insights gained and intellectual property obtained during the development process. &#160;

We believe this collaboration-based business model creates long-term relationships with aligned incentives for success, and allows us to access a portion of the capital and resources necessary to support large-scale production and global distribution of our products.

&#160;

Product Sales 

&#160;

In addition to our collaborations, for near-term, positive-margin revenues, we have been developing, manufacturing and selling high-value farnesene derivatives such as Neossance&#174; branded emollients for the cosmetics industry. Through our distributor channels for Neossance emollients, we are able to accelerate commercialization of our products. Since its launch in 2011, we have achieved worldwide reach for our Neossance emollients, with our initial high-performance emollient (Neossance squalane) serving as a key ingredient in personal care products for a growing list of cosmetics companies. In 2014, we introduced and began selling our second emollient, Neossance hemisqualane, through our distributors. Hemisqualane is a light emollient with high spreadability and serves as a replacement to petroleum-based paraffins and silicone ingredients. In 2015, we launched our consumer beauty brand, Biossance&#174;, the first product made exclusively from Neossance squalene.

&#160;

In addition, in 2014 we established sales of F&#38;F ingredients to a collaboration partner, representing our first major product sales of a molecule other than farnesene and, in 2015, we established sales of a second F&#38;F molecule.

&#160;

&#160;

We produce and sell renewable diesel for niche markets in Brazil, and renewable jet fuel for early adoption of such jet fuel in specific routes selected by participating airlines. Though these products have not yet generated net cash contributions to our business, we have maintained such sales as part of our industrial-scale manufacturing offtake and to support our ongoing development efforts toward a commercially-viable Biofene-based renewable fuel in collaboration with Total.

&#160;

Manufacturing 

&#160;

We began industrial-scale production of our products at contract manufacturing facilities in 2011 and, in December 2012, commenced operations at our first purpose-built, large-scale production facility in southeastern Brazil. This multi-product production facility, located in Brotas, in the state of S&#227;o Paulo, Brazil, is adjacent to an existing sugar and ethanol mill operated by Tonon Bioenergia SA, formerly known as Para&#237;so Bioenergia (or Tonon). Through 2015, we produced farnesene and an ingredient for the F&#38;F industry at commercial scale. Under our manufacturing agreement, Tonon supplies sugarcane juice and certain utilities. Amyris is solely responsible for maintenance and operation of our biorefinery. Our Brotas facility has six 200,000 liter production fermenters and was designed to process sugarcane juice, or its equivalent, from up to one million tons of raw sugarcane annually. In December 2012, we began production of farnesene at this facility. Our first shipment of farnesene produced at the Brotas facility occurred in February 2013, and our first shipment of a fragrance molecule from the facility occurred in August 2014. We began manufacturing our second fragrance molecule at the Brotas facility in September 2015 and commenced shipping the product in December 2015.

&#160;

For many of our products, we perform additional distillation or chemical finishing steps to convert initial target molecules into other finished products, such as renewable squalane, F&#38;F ingredients, lubricants, performance polymers and diesel. We have an agreement with Glycotech Inc. (or Glycotech), for use of a Leland, North Carolina facility of Salisbury Partners, LLC to convert Biofene into squalane and other final products. We also have agreements with other facilities in the U.S. and Brazil to perform distillation and hydrogenation steps for other products. We may enter into additional agreements with other facilities for finishing services and to access flexible capacity and an array of services as we develop additional products.

&#160;

Technology 

&#160;

Synthetic biology uses engineering concepts to leverage the power of biology. We have developed innovative microbial engineering and screening technologies that allow us to transform the way micro-organisms process sugars. Specifically, we engineer yeast and use them as living factories to convert sugarcane syrup, through fermentation, into high-value hydrocarbon molecules instead of ethanol, which is its naturally occurring process. Along with our collaboration partners, we use these molecules as building blocks for a wide range of products in our target markets. This is our foundation for providing high-performance, cost competitive and sustainable alternatives to a wide variety of products.

&#160;

Research and Development 

&#160;

Our ongoing technology development is focused primarily on improving the performance of our production microbial strains and on developing microbial strains that produce targeted molecules. As described in more detail below, our process consists of a series of steps including:

&#160;

&#160;

&#8226; identifying new target molecules; &#160;

&#8226; creating new microbial strains capable of producing the target molecules; &#160;

&#8226; increasing product yield and productivity from microbial strains through strain modification or fermentation process improvements; and &#160;

&#8226; translating these steps from lab to commercial scale production consistently. &#160;

We devote substantial resources to our research and development efforts. As of January 31, 2016, our research and development organization included approximately 123 employees, 63 of whom held Ph.D.s. Our research and development expenditures were approximately $44.6 million, $49.7 million, and $56.1 million for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

&#160;

Strain Engineering and Scale-Up Process 

&#160;

The primary biological pathway within the microbe that we currently use to produce our target molecules is called the isoprenoid or terpenoid pathway. Isoprenoids constitute a large, diverse class of organic chemicals, with current product applications in a wide range of industries. Implementing the classical engineering cycle of &#8220;Design-Build-Test-Learn&#8221; with investments of more than $400 million to date for research and development, we have reduced strain engineering time to produce target isoprenoid molecules from years to months, opening up the possibility of quickly producing thousands of different target molecules from fermentation.

&#160;

We have developed a high-throughput strain engineering system that is currently capable of producing and screening more than 100,000 yeast strains per month, which allows us to achieve approximately a 95% lower cost per strain than we achieved in 2009. We generated more than 400,000 farnesene strains in 2015, surpassing 5.0 million unique strains created since our inception, with each strain testing for improved production of the target molecules. In addition, through our lab-scale and pilot-plant fermentation operations, and our proprietary analytical tools, we are now able to predict with high reliability, the industrial performance of candidate strains in our 200,000-liter fermenters at our Brotas plant.

&#160;

The following summarizes the key steps in our strain engineering and scale-up processes:

&#160;

1. Identifying target molecules . We start our process by identifying, usually based on input from collaborators, a commercial application for which we can deliver an attractive No Compromise&#174; solution. We identify the key molecular properties that are essential to product performance in a specific commercial application and then analyze the chemical structures that drive those key performance characteristics. Finally, we identify target molecules or derivatives of molecules that contain these key chemical structures and that may be produced by our yeast strains. &#160;

2. Developing initial strains/proof of concept . We identify the steps required for the target molecule's production in a biological pathway. We then seek to design a pathway to produce the target, either directly or by producing a molecule that can, through simple chemical steps, be synthesized, or converted, into the target. Once this pathway is identified, we undertake to engineer it into our yeast strains by employing the processes discussed below. &#160;

&#160;

3. Improving strain performance and process development. To produce the target molecules at industrial scale, a yeast strain must be improved to increase its level of efficiency of production. Initially, we focus primarily on yield , a measure of the amount of product produced by a defined amount of sugar as the means to improve strain output. As we advance in our scale-up and commercial scale process development, we also seek to improve production output through improvements in strain productivity , the rate at which our product is produced by a given yeast strain, and titer , the concentration of product in the fermentation broth. In addition, we seek to develop processes to improve production recovery efficiency, including separation efficiency, a measure of the amount of product that is captured from a fermentation run, cycle-time, which is the time needed to run a full fermentation cycle, and the evolution of batch process methods to semi-continuous and continuous production methods. &#160;

4. Moving production from lab to commercial scale. Once we have established a pathway and verified that it can produce the target molecule, the yeast strain must be improved to increase the level of efficiency of production, and tested for performance in larger-volume facilities, before it is implemented at our larger-scale manufacturing facilities. Our infrastructure to support this scale-up process includes lab-scale fermenters, operating pilot plants in our facilities in Emeryville, California and Campinas, Brazil, and two 5,000-liter fermenters in our Campinas demonstration facility. Each of these stages mimic the conditions found in larger scale fermentation so that our findings may translate predictably from lab scale to pilot and ultimately to commercial scale. &#160; 

Products 

&#160;

We are expanding our range of products across several categories divided into consumer and industrial applications. For consumer applications, we are developing and selling personal care products (which include ingredients for cosmetics and F&#38;F), healthcare products, and formulated end-user products like our Biossance&#8482; brand skincare products and our Muck Daddy&#8482; brand hand cleaner product, and we are pursuing arrangements with a number of drug companies for their use of our molecules to develop pharmaceutical products. For industrial applications, our products include performance materials (such as solvents and polymers) and, with our joint venture partners, renewable lubricants and fuels. Our initial portfolio of commercial products has been based on Biofene and Biofene derivatives. In addition, we have produced at scale and commercialized two target molecules for the F&#38;F market.

&#160;

We are focused on building our renewable-product leadership position, which we established initially with squalane, in our targeted consumer markets and with niche diesel and jet fuel opportunities. We believe that success in these markets will pave the way to accessing more markets and expanding the impact we can have in the longer term.

&#160; 

Consumer Markets 

&#160;

Cosmetics and Skincare 

&#160;

Through basic chemical finishing steps, we are able to convert our farnesene molecule into squalane, which is used today as a premium emollient in cosmetics and other personal care products. Our Neossance squalane offers performance attributes equal or superior to those of squalane derived from conventional sources. The ingredient traditionally has been manufactured from olive oil or extracted from deep-sea shark liver oil, which requires that the shark be killed in order to harvest its liver oil. The relatively high price and unstable supply of squalane in the past meant that its use was generally limited to luxury products or small quantities in mass-market product formulations. With our ability to produce a reliable supply of low-cost squalane that eliminates the need to harvest shark liver oil, we offer this ingredient at a price that we believe will drive increasing adoption by formulators. In addition to Neossance squalane, we have recently introduced a second, lower-cost emollient, Neossance hemisqualane, for the cosmetics market. We currently have Neossance emollient supply agreements with several regional distributors, including those with locations in Japan, South Korea, Europe, Brazil and North America, and, in some cases, directly with cosmetics formulators.

&#160;

&#160;

In 2015, we also launched our own consumer brand, Biossance&#8482; skin care products, featuring our Biofene-derived squalane. Under our Biossance brand, we marketing and selling our products directly to retailers and consumers, initially in the United States.

&#160;

Flavors and Fragrances 

&#160;

Our technology allows us to cost-effectively produce natural oils and aroma chemicals that are commonly used in the F&#38;F market. Many of the natural ingredients used in the F&#38;F market are expensive because there is limited supply and the synthetic alternatives require complex chemical conversions. We offer F&#38;F companies a natural route to procure these high-value ingredients without sacrificing cost or quality.

&#160;

In late 2013, we commenced commercial production of our first fragrance ingredient for a range of applications, from perfumes to laundry detergent, which is marketed by a collaboration partner which is a global F&#38;F leader. In 2014, we completed our first production campaign of this fragrance ingredient at our Brotas biorefinery and shipped it to this collaboration partner. In late 2015, we commenced production and initial sales of our second fragrance ingredient to the same collaboration partner.

&#160;

We are working with several collaboration partners to develop and commercialize a variety of F&#38;F ingredients that are either direct fermentation products or derivatives of fermentation products. Under the agreements with our partners, we receive value in a variety of ways: collaboration payments for research and development (or R&#38;D), sales of ingredients that we manufacture; and downstream sales of the ingredients.

&#160;

Hand Cleaner 

&#160;

In 2015, we launched a high-performance hand cleaner brand, Muck Daddy&#8482;, which incorporates Myralene&#8482;, a Biofene derivative that functions as a renewable solvent. We are in the process of establishing distribution channels for this product, including an online direct-to-consumer offering and arrangements with distributors and retailers.

&#160;

Healthcare and Food 

&#160;

In January 2016, we announced the signing of our first Biofene ingredient supply agreement for the global nutraceuticals and vitamins market.

&#160;

&#160;

Industrial Markets 

&#160;

Solvents 

&#160;

We have developed a best-in-class renewable solvent produced from farnesene. In addition to addressing regulatory and safety concerns over Volatile Organic Compounds (or VOCs), our solvent product, which we market under the brand Myralene&#8482;, offers strong performance and environmental attributes. In 2015, we received approval from the Environmental Protection Agency (or EPA) under the Toxic Substances Control Act (or TSCA) to market and began commercializing Myralene-based cleaning products as industrial cleaners for the auto service industry and other industrial applications.

&#160; 

Polymers 

&#160;

We are developing applications for our farnesene that include high-performance polymers used in tires and other applications. In 2011, we began collaborating with Kuraray Co., Ltd (or Kuraray) with an initial focus on using farnesene-based polymers to replace petroleum-derived additives in tires. During the collaboration, Kuraray developed farnesene-based liquid rubber (LFR) that reacts with tire rubber more easily than traditional materials and strengthens adhesion of rubber components to improve tire shape, stability and performance. In connection with our collaboration with Kuraray, multiple leading tire manufacturers have conducted and are continuing to conduct performance tests of this liquid rubber in tire formulations. Also, during this period, Kuraray produced and began customer sampling and product evaluation for a new category of elastomer, Hydrogenated Styrenic Farnesene Copolymer (HSFC), which has demonstrated performance attributes that open opportunities for vibration-dampening product applications.

&#160;

Lubricants 

&#160;

Base oils are the building blocks of lubricating oils and are currently derived from the crude oil refining process. Additives are materials added to base oils to change their properties, characteristics and/or performance (e.g., anti-foam, anti-wear, corrosion inhibitor, detergent, dispersant, pour point depressant, anti-oxidant, or friction modifier). Lubricants are manufactured by combining a base oil with additives required by lubricant product applications, including engine oils, gear oils, hydraulic oils and turbine oils. Farnesene may be chemically modified to serve as a base oil, additive and/or lubricant. We believe the high-purity synthetic base oil and additive molecules that can be made from Biofene could enable lubricant products to perform in harsh environments under extremes of temperature, moisture, dirt and/or wear.

&#160;

We are pursuing the base oils and lubricants market through Novvi LLC (or Novvi), our joint venture with Cosan Combust&#237;veis e Lubrificantes S.A. and Cosan S.A. Industria e Com&#233;rcio (such Cosan entities and their affiliates, collectively or individually referred to as Cosan). Additional detail regarding our joint venture with Cosan is provided below under &#8220;Business-Joint Ventures.&#8221;

&#160; 

Transportation Fuels 

&#160;

We have partnered with Total to develop renewable fuels designed to be optimal transportation fuels. Using farnesene, we produce renewable diesel (a farnesene derivative referred to as farnesane) and jet fuel that delivers energy density, engine performance and storage properties comparable to the best petroleum fuels today. We are currently selling renewable diesel in metropolitan areas in Brazil and, since late 2014, our renewable jet fuel with our partner Total in initial markets globally. In the future, as our development efforts with Total allow us to produce fuels at lower costs, we expect that our farnesane-based fuels business would be conducted through a joint venture we have established with Total (described in more detail below under &#8220;Business-Joint Ventures&#8221;). We have been limiting jet fuel and diesel sales in recent periods as fuel sales generally do not provide any cash contributions based on the current costs of producing farnesene and current market prices for petroleum products.

&#160;

&#160;

&#8226; Jet Fuel . Our drop-in, renewable jet fuel is compliant with Jet A/A-1 fuel specifications and outperforms conventional petroleum-derived fuel in a range of performance metrics, including fit for purpose and greenhouse gas emission reduction potential, without compromising on performance or quality. In 2014, following extensive testing, we received industry acceptance and regulatory approval for our renewable jet fuel in key U.S., European and Brazilian markets. In late 2014, we began selling our renewable jet fuel to airlines through Total, with limited demonstration and commercial flights using the fuel on an ongoing basis. &#160;

&#8226; Diesel . Our renewable diesel&#8217;s properties are superior to those of petroleum diesel, allowing it to be used as a drop-in replacement in practically any diesel engine today. In Brazil, Diesel de Cana (as our diesel is called in Brazil) has been used in public transit buses in S&#227;o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. Tests carried out by Mercedes-Benz and MAN in Brazil show a significant reduction in the emissions of particulate matter (or PM) and oxides of nitrogen (or NOx) with as little as 10% blends of Amyris Renewable Diesel in standard low sulfur diesel. The US Maritime Division and US Department of Transportation have validated our diesel as a renewable blend with maritime diesel fuel. &#160; 

Collaborations 

&#160;

We believe that our leadership in the synthetic biology sector is demonstrated by collaboration partners who come to us to access our synthetic biology platform and industrial fermentation expertise. Together we seek to reduce environmental impact, enhance performance, reduce supply and price volatility, and improve profit margins. Our partners include Total, chemical companies such as Braskem S.A. (or Braskem) and Kuraray, F&#38;F companies such as Firmenich S.A. (or Firmenich), agricultural processing companies such as China National Cereals, Oils, and Foodstuff Corporation, and pharmaceutical companies. Our work has also been funded by the U.S. government, including the Department of Energy (or DOE) and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (or DARPA), to develop technologies and processes capable of improving the ability to produce alternatives to petroleum-sourced products.

&#160;

In addition to our collaborations for co-development of specialty chemical products, we have established collaborations and joint ventures for the development and commercialization of commodity products that will require larger investment of capital and longer lead times for commercialization than our existing portfolio. Most notably, we have established a collaboration and joint venture with Total to commercialize Biofene-based diesel and jet fuels. In connection with this arrangement, Total has provided substantial funding for Biofene research and development. In addition to this arrangement with Total, we have established our Novvi joint venture with Cosan, a leading producer of lubricants in Brazil, for the worldwide development, production and commercialization of renewable base oils for the automotive, industrial and commercial lubricants markets. Additionally, Amyris's proprietary synthetic biology platform may be used to provide the pharmaceutical industry with an integrated discovery and production process for therapeutic compounds for which a natural source is scarce or unavailable, or for which chemical synthesis is not cost-effective. We expect to establish and develop collaboration relationships with pharmaceutical partners in order to generate chemical diversity relevant to therapeutic target identification.

&#160;

&#160;

Joint Ventures 

&#160;

Our business strategy is to focus our direct commercialization efforts on higher-value, lower-volume markets while establishing joint ventures to pursue our lower-margin, higher-volume commodity products, including for the commodity fuels and lubricants markets. We believe this approach will facilitate access to capital and resources necessary to support large-scale production and global distribution for our large-market commodity products as we continually improve our technology advantages and costs of production.

&#160; 

Total Amyris BioSolutions B.V. 

&#160;

We have a license, development, research and collaboration agreement with Total that sets forth the terms for the research, development, production and commercialization of chemical and/or fuels products to be agreed on by the parties. The agreement establishes a multi-phased process through which compounds are identified, screened, selected for product feasibility studies, and then ultimately selected as a lead compound for development. To commercialize any strains and compounds that are developed, Amyris and Total expect to form one or more joint ventures, the first of which is the fuels joint venture described below. Both Amyris and Total retain certain rights to make products designed for collaboration efforts independently subject to making royalty payments to the non-producing party, and if we initially decline to collaborate on a project proposed by Total, Total has certain rights to require us to work on a limited number of such projects, subject to various exclusions and at Total's expense. We have retained rights to use jointly-developed technology in the following markets: F&#38;F, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, consumer packaged goods, food additives and pesticides. The first programs we focused on with Total relate to renewable diesel and jet fuel; however, both parties retain the right to propose other product development programs under these agreements in the future.

&#160;

We have entered into a series of agreements since 2011 to establish a research and development program and form a joint venture with Total to produce and commercialize Biofene-based diesel and jet fuels, and we formed such joint venture, Total Amyris BioSolutions B.V. (or TAB), in November 2013. With an exception for our fuels business in Brazil, the collaboration and joint venture established the exclusive means for us to develop, produce and commercialize fuels from Biofene. We granted TAB exclusive licenses under certain of our intellectual property to make and sell joint venture products. We also granted TAB, in the event of a buy-out of our interest in the joint venture by Total (which Total is entitled to do under certain circumstances described below), a non-exclusive license to optimize or engineer yeast strains used by us to produce farnesene for the joint venture&#8217;s diesel and jet fuels. As a result of these licenses, Amyris generally no longer had an independent right to make or sell Biofene fuels outside of Brazil without the approval of Total.

&#160;

Our agreements with Total relating to our fuels collaboration created a convertible debt financing structure for funding the research and development program. The collaboration agreements contemplated approximately $105.0 million in financing (or R&#38;D Notes) for the collaboration, which as of January 27, 2015, had been completely funded by Total.

&#160;

In July 2015, we entered into a Letter Agreement with Total (or, as amended in February 2016, the JVCO Letter Agreement) regarding the restructuring of the ownership and rights of TAB (or the Restructuring), pursuant to which the parties agreed to enter into an Amended &#38; Restated Jet Fuel License Agreement between us and TAB (or the Jet Fuel Agreement), a License Agreement regarding Diesel Fuel in the European Union (or the EU) between us and Total (or the EU Diesel Fuel Agreement, and together with the Jet Fuel Agreement, the Commercial Agreements), and an Amended and Restated Shareholders&#8217; Agreement among us, Total and TAB (or, together with the Commercial Agreements, the Restructuring Agreements), and file a Deed of Amendment of Articles of Association of TAB, all in order to reflect certain changes to the ownership structure of TAB and license grants and related rights pertaining to TAB.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

On March 21, 2016, we, Total and TAB closed the Restructuring and entered into the Restructuring Agreements.

&#160;

Under the Jet Fuel Agreement, (a) we granted exclusive (excluding its Brazil jet fuel business), world-wide, royalty-free rights to TAB for the production and commercialization of farnesene- or farnesane-based jet fuel, (b) we granted TAB the option, until March 1, 2018, to purchase our Brazil jet fuel business at a price based on the fair value of the commercial assets and on our investment in other related assets, (c) we granted TAB the right to purchase farnesene or farnesane for its jet fuel business from us on a &#8220;most-favored&#8221; pricing basis and (d) all rights to farnesene- or farnesane-based diesel fuel previously granted to TAB by us reverted back to us.

&#160;

Upon all farnesene- or farnesane-based diesel fuel rights reverting back to us, we granted to Total, pursuant to the EU Diesel Fuel Agreement, (a) an exclusive, royalty-free license to offer for sale and sell farnesene- or farnesane-based diesel fuel in the EU, (b) the right to make farnesene or farnesane anywhere in the world, provided Total must (i) use such farnesene or farnesane to produce diesel fuel to offer for sale or sell in the EU and (ii) pay us a to-be-negotiated, commercially reasonable, &#8220;most-favored&#8221; basis royalty and (c) the right to purchase farnesene or farnesane for its EU diesel fuel business from us on a &#8220;most-favored&#8221; pricing basis.

&#160;

In addition, as part of the closing of the Restructuring and pursuant the JVCO Letter Agreement, on March 21, 2016, we sold to Total one half of our ownership stake in TAB (giving Total an aggregate ownership stake of 75% of TAB and giving us an aggregate ownership stake of 25% of TAB) in exchange for Total cancelling (i) approximately $1.3 million of R&#38;D Notes, plus all paid-in-kind and accrued interest under all outstanding R&#38;D Notes (including all such interest that was outstanding as of July 29, 2015) and (ii) a note in the principal amount of Euro 50,000, plus accrued interest, issued to Total in connection with the original TAB capitalization. To satisfy its purchase obligation above, Total surrendered to us the remaining R&#38;D Note of approximately $5 million in principal amount, and we executed and delivered to Total a new, senior convertible note, containing substantially similar terms and conditions other than it is unsecured and its payment terms are severed from TAB&#8217;s business performance, in the principal amount of $3.7 million.

&#160;

As a result of, and in order to reflect, the changes to the ownership structure of TAB described above, on March 21, 2016, (a) we, Total and TAB entered into an Amended and Restated Shareholders&#8217; Agreement and filed a Deed of Amendment of Articles of Association of TAB and (b) we and Total terminated the Amended and Restated Master Framework Agreement, dated December 2, 2013 and amended on April 1, 2015, between us and Total.

&#160;

Novvi LLC 

&#160;

In June 2011, we entered into joint venture agreements with Cosan related to the formation of a joint venture to focus on the worldwide development, production and commercialization of base oils made from Biofene for the automotive, commercial and industrial lubricants markets. In September 2011, we formed Novvi, an entity that is jointly owned by Cosan and us. In March 2013, we entered into additional agreements with Cosan to (i) expand our base oils joint venture with Cosan to also include additives and lubricants and (ii) operate the joint venture exclusively through Novvi. Under these agreements, Amyris and Cosan each own 50% of Novvi, and each share equally in any costs and any profits ultimately realized by the joint venture.

&#160;

SMA Ind&#250;stria Qu&#237;mica S.A. 

&#160; 

In April 2010, the Company established SMA Ind&#250;stria Qu&#237;mica (or SMA), a joint venture with S&#227;o Martinho S.A. (or SMSA), to build a production facility in Brazil.

&#160;

The Company completed a significant portion of the construction of the new facility in 2012. The Company suspended construction of the facility in 2013 in order to focus on completing and operating the Company's smaller production facility in Brotas, Brazil. In July 2015, the Company announced that it was in discussions with SMSA regarding the continuation of the joint venture. Specifically, the Company and SMSA agreed to continue the joint venture pending discussions through August 31, 2015 in order to evaluate the best investment options available to optimize returns and provide balanced economics for both parties. In September 2015, the Company entered into negotiations with SMSA to agree to terms for the termination of the joint venture and in December 2015, the Company and SMSA entered into a Termination Agreement and a Share Purchase and Sale Agreement relating to the termination of the joint venture. Under the Termination Agreement, the parties agreed that the joint venture would be terminated effective upon the closing of a purchase by AB of SMSA&#8217;s shares of SMA. Under the Share Purchase and Sale Agreement, AB agreed to purchase, for R$50,000 (approximately US$12,805 based on the exchange rate as of December 31, 2015), 50,000 shares of SMA (representing all the outstanding shares of SMA held by SMSA), with the closing of such purchase to occur within five days after receipt by the parties of a Brazilian antitrust regulatory approval, which purchase and sale was consummated on January 11, 2016. The Share Purchase and Sale Agreement also provides that Amyris and AB will have 12 months following the closing of the share purchase to remove assets from SMSA&#8217;s site, and enter into an extension of the lease for such 12 month period for monthly rental payments of R$9,853 (approximately US$2,523 based on the exchange rate as of December 31, 2015). The Share Purchase and Sale Agreement also clarified that the Company and AB would not be required to demolish or remove the foundation of the work site.

&#160;

&#160;

Product Distribution and Sales 

&#160;

We distribute and sell (or intend to distribute and sell) our products directly, to chemical distributors or collaborators, or through joint ventures, depending on the market. For most of our products, we sell directly to our collaboration partners, except for our consumer care products, which we sell to distributors and formulators (other than our Biossance brand, which we sell directly to retailers and consumers in the United States). Generally, our collaboration agreements do not include any specific purchase obligations, and sales are contingent upon achievement of technical and commercial milestones.

&#160;

For transportation fuels in Brazil, we sell our renewable diesel directly to fuels blenders and distributors. For transportation fuels outside of Brazil, we have typically sold our products to Total or to fuels blenders and distributors. Ultimately, we expect to commercialize commodity products, including large-scale sales of fuels and base oils, through joint venture arrangements with Total and Cosan, respectively.

&#160;

Renewable product sales to Nikko Chemicals Co. Ltd. and Firmenich and collaboration revenues from Firmenich each accounted for more than 10% of our reported revenues in 2015.

&#160;

Intellectual Property 

&#160;

Our success depends in large part upon our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our products and technologies, and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others. We seek to avoid the latter by monitoring patents and publications in our product areas and technologies to be aware of developments that may affect our business, and to the extent we identify such developments, evaluate and take appropriate courses of action. With respect to the former, our policy is to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing for patent applications on inventions that are important to the development and conduct of our business with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (or the USPTO), and its foreign counterparts.

&#160;

&#160;

As of January 31, 2016, we had 413 issued U.S. and foreign patents and 295 pending U.S. and foreign patent applications that are owned by or licensed to us. We also use other forms of protection (such as trademark, copyright, and trade secret) to protect our intellectual property, particularly where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. We aim to take advantage of all of the intellectual property rights that are available to us and believe that this comprehensive approach provides us with a strong proprietary position.

&#160;

Patents extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in various countries where patent protection is obtained. The actual protection afforded by patent, which can vary from country to country, depends on the type of patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the country. See &#8220; Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Business - Our proprietary rights may not adequately protect our technologies and product candidates .&#8221;

&#160;

We also protect our proprietary information by requiring our employees, consultants, contractors and other advisers to execute nondisclosure and assignment of invention agreements upon commencement of their respective employment or engagement. Agreements with our employees also prevent them from bringing the proprietary rights of third parties to us. In addition, we also require confidentiality or material transfer agreements from third parties that receive our confidential data or materials.

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160;

We expect that our renewable products will compete with both the traditional, largely petroleum-based specialty chemical and fuels products that are currently being used in our target markets and with the alternatives to these existing products that established enterprises and new companies are seeking to produce.

&#160;

Chemical Products 

&#160;

In the specialty chemical markets that we initially entered or are seeking to enter, and in other chemical markets that we may seek to enter in the future, we will compete primarily with the established providers of chemicals currently used in products in these markets. Producers of these incumbent products include global oil companies, large international chemical companies and companies specializing in specific products, such as squalane or essential oils. We may also compete in one or more of these markets with products that are offered as alternatives to the traditional petroleum-based or other traditional products being offered in these markets.

&#160;

&#160;

Transportation Fuel Products 

&#160;

In the transportation fuels market, we expect to compete with independent and integrated oil refiners, advanced biofuels companies and biodiesel companies. Refiners compete with us by selling traditional fuel products and some are also pursuing hydrocarbon fuel production using non-renewable feedstocks, such as natural gas and coal, as well as processes using renewable feedstocks, such as vegetable oil and biomass. We also expect to compete with companies that are developing the capacity to produce diesel and other transportation fuels from renewable resources in other ways. These include advanced biofuels companies using specific enzymes that they have developed to convert cellulosic biomass, which is non-food plant material such as wood chips, corn stalks and sugarcane bagasse, into fermentable sugars. Similar to us, some companies are seeking to use engineered microbes to convert sugars, in some cases from cellulosic biomass and in others from more refined sugar sources, into renewable diesel and other fuels. Biodiesel companies convert vegetable oils and animal oils into diesel fuel and some are seeking to produce diesel and other transportation fuels using thermochemical methods to convert biomass into renewable fuels.

&#160;

Petroleum Alternative Companies 

&#160;

With the emergence of many new companies seeking to produce chemicals and fuels from alternative sources, we may face increasing competition from alternative fuels and chemicals companies. As they emerge, some of these companies may be able to establish production capacity and commercial partnerships to compete with us.

&#160;

Competitive Factors 

&#160;

We believe the primary competitive factors in both the chemicals and fuels markets are:

&#160;

&#8226; product price; &#160;

&#8226; product performance and other measures of quality; &#160;

&#8226; infrastructure compatibility of products; &#160;

&#8226; sustainability; and &#160;

&#8226; dependability of supply. &#160;

We believe that, for our products to succeed in the market, we must demonstrate that our products are comparable or better alternatives to existing products and to any alternative products that are being developed for the same markets based on some combination of product cost, availability, performance, and consumer preference characteristics.

&#160; 

Environmental and Other Regulatory Matters 

&#160;

Our development and production processes involve the use, generation, handling, storage, transportation and disposal of hazardous chemicals and radioactive and biological materials. We are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and international laws, regulations and permit requirements governing the use, generation, manufacture, transportation, storage, handling and disposal of these materials in the United States, Brazil and other countries where we operate or may operate or sell our products in the future. These laws, regulations and permits can require expensive fees, pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit actual or potential impact of our technology on the environment and violation of these laws could result in significant fines, civil sanctions, permit revocation or costs from environmental remediation. We believe we are currently in substantial compliance with applicable environmental regulations and permitting. However, future developments including our commencement of commercial manufacturing of one or more of our products, more stringent environmental regulation, policies and enforcement, the implementation of new laws and regulations or the discovery of unknown environmental conditions may require expenditures that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. See &#8220;Risk Factors - Risks Relating to Our Business - We may incur significant costs complying with environmental laws and regulations, and failure to comply with these laws and regulations could expose us to significant liabilities.&#8221;

&#160;

&#160;

GMM Regulations 

&#160;

The use of genetically-modified microorganisms (or GMMs), such as our yeast strains, is subject to laws and regulations in many countries. In the United States, the EPA regulates the commercial use of GMMs as well as potential products produced from the GMMs. Various states within the United States could choose to regulate products made with GMMs as well. While the strain of genetically modified yeast that we use, S. cerevisiae , is eligible for exemption from EPA review because the EPA recognizes it as posing a low risk, we must satisfy certain criteria to achieve this exemption, including but not limited to, use of compliant containment structures and safety procedures. In Brazil, GMMs are regulated by the National Biosafety Technical Commission (or the CTNBio) under its Biosafety Law No. 11.105-2005. We have obtained approval from CTNBio to generally use GMMs under specific conditions in our Campinas facilities and our production plant in Brotas for research and development purposes. In addition, we have received CTNBio approval for commercial use of certain strains of yeast in our Brotas plant.

&#160;

We expect to encounter GMM regulations in most if not all of the countries in which we may seek to make our products; however, the scope and nature of these regulations will likely vary from country to country. If we cannot meet the applicable requirements in countries in which we intend to produce our products using our yeast strains, then our business will be adversely affected. See &#8220; Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Business - Our use of genetically-modified feedstocks and yeast strains to produce our products subjects us to risks of regulatory limitations and rejection of our products .&#8221;

&#160;

Chemical Regulations 

&#160;

Our renewable chemical products may be subject to government regulations in our target markets. In the United States, the EPA administers the requirements of the TSCA, which regulates the commercial registration, distribution and use of many chemicals. Before an entity can manufacture or distribute significant volumes of a chemical, it needs to determine whether that chemical is listed in the TSCA inventory. If the substance is listed, then manufacture or distribution can commence immediately. If not, then in most cases a &#8220;Chemical Abstracts Service&#8221; number registration and pre-manufacture notice must be filed with the EPA, which has 90 days to review the filing. A similar requirement exists in Europe under the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemical Substances (or REACH) regulation.

&#160;

&#160;

Fuel Regulations 

&#160;

Our diesel and jet fuel is subject to regulation by various government agencies. In the United States, this includes the EPA and the California Air Resources Board (or CARB). In Brazil, this includes Brazilian Ag&#234;ncia Nacional do Petr&#243;leo, Gas Natural e Biocombust&#237;veis (or ANP). We have completed significant steps to validate our ability to produce a market-accepted diesel product:

&#160;

&#8226; By design, our diesel is a hydrocarbon of similar size to many of the hydrocarbons in petroleum-sourced diesel fuel. Due to the similarity of its chemical composition to that of existing petroleum-sourced diesel, our product has the properties required of diesel fuel and thereby satisfies the ASTM D975 Table 1 specifications for petroleum-derived diesel fuel oils. The EPA has registered our diesel for use as a 35% blend rate with petroleum diesel in highway vehicles and non-road equipment, and we are working to obtain registration for a higher blend with petroleum diesel, which compares to a typical 3-10% blend of other bio-diesel products with petroleum diesel. &#160;

&#8226; In Europe, we obtained REACH registration for importing/manufacturing up to 1,000 metric tons of farnesane (our diesel fuel) per year and are pursuing data validation for greater volumes. REACH registration is required for the sale and use of our fuels within the applicable European jurisdictions. &#160;

&#8226; We have received required approvals with ANP for specific uses of our fuel in Brazil, have registered our diesel fuel with the CARB and are pursuing registration or approvals with other relevant regulatory bodies. &#160;

Our ability to enter the diesel market also depends upon our ability to continue to achieve the required regulatory approvals in the global markets in which we will seek to sell our diesel products. These approvals primarily involve clearance by the relevant environmental agencies in the particular jurisdiction. For instance, in 2013, the EPA registered farnesane as a new chemical substance under the TSCA, clearing the way for us to manufacture and sell farnesane without restrictions in the United States.

&#160;

For diesel market access, we must also be validated by a sufficient number of diesel engine manufacturers, vehicle manufacturers or operators of large trucking fleets so that our diesel will have an appropriately large and accessible market. These certification processes include fuel analysis modeling and the testing of engines and their components to ensure that the use of our diesel fuel does not degrade performance or reduce the lifecycle of the engine or cause it to fail to meet emissions standards. We have completed successful engine testing of our diesel fuel with numerous manufacturers, including Cummins Engine Company, or Cummins, and Mercedes-Benz Brasil at a blend of up to 10%, and our renewable diesel has received OEM engine warranties from Cummins, Volkswagen AG and Mercedes-Benz Brasil for demonstration purposes. We continue to work with other diesel engine manufacturers to qualify our product for use in their engines.

&#160;

Jet fuel (aviation turbine fuel) validation and specifications are subject to the ASTM International industry consensus process and the ANP national adoption process. Our farnesane is generally approved for use in jet fuel for commercial flights at blends of up to 10%. This jet fuel blend was approved by the ASTM International in June 2014. ASTM approval is required by U.S. and international regulators before jet fuel can be used commercially. In December 2014, the same jet fuel was approved by ANP, which is an additional step required for Brazil commercialization.

&#160;

&#160;

For us to maximize our access to the U.S. fuels market for our fuel products, we will also need to obtain EPA and CARB (and potentially other state agencies) certifications for our feedstock pathway and production facilities, including certification of a feedstock lifecycle analysis relating to greenhouse gas emissions. Any delay in obtaining these additional certifications could impair our ability to sell our renewable fuels to refiners, importers, blenders and other parties that produce transportation fuels as they comply with federal and state requirements to include certified renewable fuels in their products. See &#8220; Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Business - We may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for the sale of our renewable products .&#8221;

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160;

As of January 31, 2016, we had 418 full-time employees. Of these employees, 257 were in the United States and 161 were in Brazil. Except for labor union representation for Brazil-based employees based on labor code requirements in Brazil, none of our employees is represented by a labor union or is covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have never experienced any employment-related work stoppages and consider relations with our employees to be good.

Business Background and Available Information 

&#160;

We organized our business in July 2003 as a California corporation under the name Amyris Biotechnologies, Inc. and have maintained our headquarters and research facilities in the San Francisco Bay Area since that time. In June 2010, we reincorporated in Delaware and changed our name to Amyris, Inc. We commenced research activities in 2005, focusing on the development of an alternative source of artemisinic acid for the treatment of malaria, and launched research efforts for production of Biofene in 2006. In 2008, we began to sell third party ethanol to wholesale customers through our Amyris Fuels subsidiary, which generated revenue from the sale of ethanol and reformulated ethanol-blended gasoline to wholesale customers through a network of terminals in the eastern United States. We completed our planned transition out of the ethanol and ethanol-blended gasoline business in the third quarter of 2012, though we continue to maintain the Amyris Fuels subsidiary for activities related to renewable fuel sales. We first established a presence in Brazil in 2008 through the opening of offices and laboratories in Campinas. Our corporate headquarters are located at 5885 Hollis Street, Suite 100, Emeryville, CA 94608, and our telephone number is (510) 450-0761. Our website address is www.amyris.com.
