General 

&#160;

Escalade, Incorporated (Escalade, the Company, we, us or our) now operates in one business segment: Sporting Goods (Escalade Sports). Escalade and its predecessors have more than 80 years of manufacturing and selling experience in this industry. Previously, we operated in two businesses segments: Sporting Goods (Escalade Sports) and Information Security and Print Finishing (Martin Yale Group). On October 1, 2014, the Company completed the sale of the Information Security business. The sale of the Information Security business, coupled with the sale of our Print Finishing business on June 30, 2014, completed the Company&#8217;s exit from the Information Security and Print Finishing segment. As a result, the Information Security and Print Finishing segment has been classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented.

&#160;

Certain products produced by Escalade Sports are subject to regulation by the Consumer Product Safety Commission. The Company believes it is in material compliance with all applicable regulations.

&#160;

Marketing and Product Development 

&#160;

The Company makes a substantial investment in product development and brand marketing to differentiate its product line from its competition. We conduct market research and development efforts to design products which satisfy existing and emerging consumer needs. On a consolidated basis, the Company incurred research and development costs of approximately $1.5 million, $1.7 million, and $1.2 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The Company advertises directly to the consumer or end-user as well as through its retail partners in the form of advertising and other promotional allowances.

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

Escalade is subject to competition with various manufacturers in each product line. The Company is not aware of any other single company that is engaged in the same product lines as Escalade or that produces the same range of products as Escalade. Nonetheless, competition exists for many Escalade products. Some competitors are larger and have substantially greater resources than the Company. Escalade believes that its long-term success depends on its ability to strengthen its relationship with existing customers, attract new customers and develop new products that satisfy the quality and price requirements of sporting goods customers.

&#160;

Licenses, Trademarks and Brand Names 

&#160;

The Company has an agreement and contract with STIGA Sports AB, a 50% owned joint venture, for the exclusive right and license to distribute and produce table tennis equipment under the brand name STIGA&#174; for the United States and Canada. The Company also owns several registered trademarks and brand names including but not limited to Ping-Pong&#174;, Bear Archery&#174;, Goalrilla&#8482;, The Step&#174;, and Wood Play&#174;.

&#160;

Backlog and Seasonality 

&#160;

Sales are based primarily on standard purchase orders and in most cases orders are shipped within the same month received. Unshipped orders at the end of the fiscal year (backlog) were not material and therefore are not an indicator of future results. Due to diversity in product categories, revenues have not been seasonal and are not expected to be so in the future.

&#160;
