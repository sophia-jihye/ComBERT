History

The Company was founded in 1971 by Warren Eisenberg and Leonard Feinstein, the Co-Chairmen of the Company. Each has more than 50 years of experience in the retail industry.

&#160;

&#160;

The Company commenced operations in 1971 with the opening of two stores, which primarily sold bed linens and bath accessories. In 1985, the Company introduced its first store carrying a full line of domestics merchandise and home furnishings. The Company began using the name "Bed Bath &#38; Beyond" in order to reflect the expanded product line offered by its stores and to distinguish its stores from conventional specialty retail stores offering only domestics merchandise or home furnishings. In 2002, the Company acquired Harmon, a health and beauty care retailer, which operated 27 stores at the time located in three states. In 2003, the Company acquired CTS, a retailer of giftware and household items, which operated 23 stores at the time located in six states. In 2007, the Company acquired Baby, a retailer of infant and toddler merchandise, which operated eight stores at the time located in four states. In 2007, the Company opened its first international BBB store in Ontario, Canada. In 2008, the Company became a partner in a joint venture which operated two stores at the time in the Mexico City market under the name &#8220;Home &#38; More,&#8221; which were rebranded as Bed Bath &#38; Beyond in fiscal 2012. In June 2012, the Company acquired Linen Holdings, LLC (&#8220;Linen Holdings&#8221;), a provider of a variety of textile products, amenities and other goods to institutional customers in the hospitality, cruise line, healthcare and other industries, and Cost Plus, Inc. (&#8220;Cost Plus World Market&#8221;), a retailer selling a wide range of home decorating items, furniture, gifts, holiday and other seasonal items, and specialty food and beverages, which operated 258 stores at the time located in 30 states under the names of World Market, Cost Plus World Market or Cost Plus. In 2014, the Company opened its first international Baby store in Alberta, Canada. In 2015, the Company acquired Of a Kind, an e-commerce website that features specially commissioned, limited edition items from emerging fashion and home designers.

&#160;

The Company accounts for its operations as two operating segments: North American Retail and Institutional Sales. The Institutional Sales operating segment, which is comprised of Linen Holdings, does not meet the quantitative thresholds under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and therefore is not a reportable segment. Net sales outside of the U.S. were not material for fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013.
