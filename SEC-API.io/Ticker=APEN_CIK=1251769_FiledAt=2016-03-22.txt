 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

&#160; 

Overview 

&#160; 

We are a biotechnology company focused on the discovery and development of lipidomic-based therapeutic antibodies, an emerging field of medical science that targets bioactive signaling lipids to treat a wide range of human diseases. We have developed three drug candidates, advancing each of them into clinical trials, and built evidence to support our approach of targeting bioactive lipids to treat a wide range of diseases. In January 2016, we completed the dosing of all subjects in our Phase 1 clinical trial of Lpathomab. 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, we had cash and cash equivalents totaling $8.9 million. We have incurred significant net losses since our inception. To conserve our cash resources, we have reduced our headcount and limited our research and product development activities. As a result of these actions, we believe our current resources should be sufficient to fund our operations through the third quarter of 2016. 

&#160; 

Our Board of Directors has engaged a financial advisory firm to explore our available strategic alternatives, including possible mergers and business combinations, a sale of part or all of our assets, collaboration and licensing arrangements and/or equity and debt financings. This strategic process is both active and ongoing, and includes a range of interactions with potential transaction counterparties. We believe it is in our stockholders&#8217; best interests at this time to continue to pursue one or more of these transactions, or other strategic alternatives we may identify in the near term. Although we are actively pursuing our strategic alternatives, there is no assurance that we will be able to successfully negotiate and consummate a transaction on a timely basis, or at all. Further, our expenses may exceed our current plans and expectations, which could require us to complete a transaction or wind-down our operations sooner than anticipated. Additionally, any transaction we consummate may offer limited value for our existing drug candidates and proprietary technology and may not enhance stockholder value or provide the expected benefits. If we are unable to successfully complete a strategic transaction or otherwise secure additional capital on a timely basis and on terms that are acceptable to our stockholders, we may be required to cease our operations altogether. 

&#160; 

Lpathomab 

&#160; 

Lpathomab is a humanized monoclonal antibody (&#8220;mAb&#8221;) against lysophosphatidic acid (&#8220;LPA&#8221;), a bioactive lipid that has been characterized in scientific literature as playing a key role in nerve injury and neuropathic pain. Published research has also demonstrated that LPA is a significant promoter of cancer-cell growth and metastasis in a broad range of tumor types, and plays a key role in pulmonary fibrosis. Our preclinical studies showed strong in vivo results with Lpathomab in several different pain models, which suggest that LPA may be an attractive target across a variety of chronic pain conditions, including diabetic peripheral neuropathy, post-herpetic neuralgia, chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain and pain associated with lumbosacral radiculopathy. 

&#160; 

In January 2016, we completed the dosing of all subjects in our Phase 1a clinical trial of Lpathomab. The double-blind, placebo-controlled, single ascending dose trial was designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of Lpathomab in healthy volunteers. The trial also aimed to establish a maximum tolerated dose for future clinical studies in patients with neuropathic pain or other potential indications. The trial included a total of five cohorts at increasing doses. Lpathomab was well tolerated at all doses tested, and no serious adverse events or dose limiting toxicities were observed during the trial. The follow-up period for patients participating in this Phase 1a trial will be completed in March 2016, and we expect the final study results, including pharmacokinetic, pharmcodynamic, and safety data, to be available in the second quarter of 2016. 

&#160; 

iSONEP 

&#160; 

iSONEP&#8482; is the ocular formulation of sonepcizumab, a mAb against sphingosine-1-phosphate (&#8220;S1P&#8221;). Sphingomab&#8482; is the original mouse version of this monoclonal antibody. iSONEP is administered by intravitreal (inside the eye) injection, and has demonstrated multiple mechanisms of action in ocular models of disease, including anti-angiogenesis, anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrotic and anti-vascular permeability. This combination of mechanisms suggested that: (i) iSONEP might have a comparative advantage over currently marketed products for &#8220;wet&#8221; age-related 

&#160;

macular degeneration (&#8220;wet AMD&#8221;) and (ii) iSONEP might demonstrate clinical efficacy in a broad range of retinal diseases where there is currently a significant unmet medical need, including diabetic retinopathy (a complication of diabetes affecting the retina), dry AMD, and glaucoma-related surgery. 

&#160; 

In 2010, we entered into an agreement with Pfizer Inc., which was amended in 2012 (collectively, the &#8220;Pfizer Agreement&#8221;), that provided Pfizer with an exclusive option for a worldwide license to develop and commercialize iSONEP. From 2011 to 2015 in collaboration with Pfizer, we conducted a multicenter, Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating iSONEP in patients with wet age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD) (the &#8220;Nexus trial&#8221;). During the second quarter of 2015, we announced that our Nexus trial did not meet its primary or key secondary endpoints. Based on the failure of iSONEP to meet these endpoints, Pfizer elected to allow its option to develop and commercialize iSONEP to expire unexercised on August 9, 2015. As a result, the Pfizer Agreement terminated by its terms, and all rights that Pfizer held in the iSONEP program have reverted to Lpath. 

&#160; 

Following completion of the Nexus trial, we conducted further analyses of the clinical trial data, including additional anatomical endpoints, to better understand the results. While iSONEP did not meet the primary endpoint of the Nexus trial by showing statistically significant improvement in visual acuity at day 120 of the trial, analyses of the follow-up data from the completed trial did provide interesting signals of possible therapeutic benefit from iSONEP. Long-term follow-up data suggests that treatment of wet AMD patients with iSONEP, in combination with anti-VEGF treatments, may result in reductions in total wet AMD lesion area and may allow patients to maintain their visual acuity gains for longer periods of time than would be expected from anti-VEGF treatment alone . We believe that these signals of activity in the Nexus trial are appropriate for further clinical investigation. We are seeking a partner for future studies of iSONEP in order to obtain the funding and additional expertise required to advance this program. 

&#160; 

ASONEP 

&#160; 

ASONEP&#8482; is the systemic formulation of sonepcizumab. In the first quarter of 2010, we completed a Phase 1 clinical trial in which ASONEP was evaluated in very late-stage cancer patients. In that trial, ASONEP was well tolerated at all dose-levels ranging from 1 mg/kg to 24 mg/kg, other than minor infusion-related reactions observed at the highest dose. More than half the patients that completed the initial four-treatment evaluation period showed stable disease, and durable stable disease was observed in several patients. Based on these results, in 2013 we commenced a Phase 2a single-agent, open-label study of ASONEP trial in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC). 

&#160; 

In March 2015, we announced that our Phase 2a clinical trial of ASONEP&#8482; did not meet the primary endpoint of statistically significant progression-free survival. ASONEP&#8482; is the systemic formulation of sonepcizumab. To successfully meet the primary endpoint of progression-free survival, at least 20 out of 39 patients needed to be progression-free at four months of treatment. Fourteen out of 40 patients (over enrolled by one patient) were progression-free at four months. Eight of the fourteen patients were progression-free for at least six months, of which three patients remained progression-free for over 20 months. Overall, ASONEP was well-tolerated. The ASONEP study follow-up period concluded during the third quarter of 2015, and there are no longer any patients being treated with ASONEP. We are now exploring other indications where ASONEP may have a greater chance of success. 

&#160; 

As part of the Pfizer Agreement, Lpath granted to Pfizer a right of first refusal for ASONEP. That right of first refusal expired on August 9, 2015, concurrent with the expiration of Pfizer&#8217;s option to acquire the license to iSONEP. 

&#160; 

ImmuneY2&#8482; Technology 

&#160; 

We believe we are the only company to have developed functional therapeutic monoclonal antibodies against any bioactive lipid, of which there are estimated to be 1,000 or more. We produced these unique antibodies using our ImmuneY2&#8482; technology, a series of proprietary processes we have developed. We continue to apply the ImmuneY2 process to other bioactive lipids that are validated targets for disease treatment, thereby expanding our potential pipeline of novel monoclonal antibody-based drug candidates. 

&#160; 

We have a strong intellectual-property position in the bioactive-lipid area, with 70 issued patents, including 35 foreign patents, and 79 pending patents, including 61 foreign patent applications. Most of these patents were developed in-house based on our pioneering research on bioactive lipid signaling. Our research partners to date have included the 

&#160;

M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, the UCLA Brain Injury Research Center, Johns Hopkins University, the Harvard Medical School, the University of Florida College of Medicine, the University of California &#8212; San Diego, the French National Centre for Scientific Research, the Center for Eye Research Australia, the University of Melbourne, Australia, the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, the Walter Reed Army Institute for Research, the Medical University of South Carolina, the Virginia Commonwealth University, and the University of Kentucky. 

&#160; 

The Emergence of Lipidomics 

&#160; 

For many years the drug-development industry has been fundamentally protein-centric, and most drugs on the market (and most drug candidates in clinical trials) target proteins. The recognition among medical researchers that bioactive lipids play key roles in disease is a relatively recent development. &#8220;Although the concept of &#8216;bioactive lipids&#8217; has been decades in the making, it has only started to gain traction in the past 20 years, and promises to occupy centre-stage in cell biology research in the twenty-first century.&#8221; ( Nature Reviews , February 2008) 

&#160; 

In an article published in 2006, the British Journal of Cancer described the emergence of lipidomics in drug discovery: 

&#160; 

The focus on proteins was a natural consequence of the science community&#8217;s evolving understanding of biochemistry, which allowed researchers to identify potential protein targets involved in key metabolic and signaling pathways. Some of the first drugs developed by the rational-drug-design approach to the scientific method came after the discovery of key enzymes, receptors, and ion channels [all proteins] as they emerged in the basic science literature. One can argue that target identification now is driven by the technological developments of proteomics and genomics, both of which reflect the persistent &#8216;protein-centric&#8217; view of drug discovery. 

&#160; 

Now, the field of lipidomics (a subset of &#8216;metabolomics&#8217;) has emerged...and provides new opportunities for drug discovery. As was the case for proteomics and genomics, tools of measurement led the way. For lipidomics, the development of electrospray tandem mass spectrometry and other tools has facilitated our understanding of the cellular lipidome, and we now believe that there are over 1,000 members of the lipidome, opening up an entire array of new potential targets for therapeutic interventions. 

&#160; 

It has been recognized that alterations in lipid metabolism can lead to cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders, immune function, pain, mental disorders, and inflammation. (British Journal of Cancer, October 2006). 

&#160; 

We believe that we are the leader in developing lipidomic-based therapeutics and humanizing related mAbs. This emerging field of medical science involves two areas of expertise: 

&#160; 

1. An understanding of the role of bioactive lipids in their respective signaling systems so that potentially important targets can be identified: The study of lipidomics is complex, as bioactive lipids have a molecular weight significantly lower than proteins and, unlike proteins, are not water-soluble. As such, many of the measurement and analytical tools that exist in the protein-centric pharmaceutical industry are not effective when dealing with bioactive lipids. Because of our long-standing focus on bioactive lipids as targets for human disease, we are one of the few companies that have developed the expertise and assays to address the unique challenges of lipidomics. 

&#160; 

2. The ability to inhibit the identified bioactive-lipid targets: Bioactive lipids are difficult to inhibit for the same reasons that make them difficult to study&#8212;they are extremely small and they are not water-soluble. As such, many companies have tried to generate monoclonal antibodies that inhibit the functional activity of bioactive lipids, only to have failed. We believe we are the only company to have developed functional monoclonal antibodies against bioactive lipids such as S1P or LPA. This capability is based on our proprietary ImmuneY2 technology.

Phase 2 clinical trial of iSONEP in patients with Wet-AMD did not meet primary end point or key secondary end points. Long-term follow-up data suggests that iSONEP, when used in combination with anti-VEGF treatments, may result in reductions in total wet AMD lesion area and may allow patients to maintain their visual acuity gains for longer periods of time than anti-VEGF treatments alone. We are pursuing licensing, partnering and other strategic alternatives to help fund further clinical investigation.

&#160; 

Phase 2a single-agent, open-lable study of ASONEP did not meet the primary end-point of statistically significant progression-free survival in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC). We are exploring other indications where ASONEP may have a greater chance of success. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Lpathomab 

&#160; 

Our drug discovery team, using our proprietary ImmuneY2 technology, was the first, we believe, to generate functional mAbs against lysophosphatidic acid (&#8220;LPA&#8221;). LPA is a key bioactive lipid and has long been recognized in the literature as a significant promoter of cancer-cell growth and metastasis in a broad range of tumor types. Published research has demonstrated that LPA is also a significant contributor to neuropathic pain and traumatic brain injury, and plays a key role in pulmonary fibrosis. Because of its potentially significant role in a number of diseases, including pain, fibrosis, and cancer, other companies have tried, unsuccessfully, to create an antibody against LPA. 

&#160; 

In July 2015, we announced that the FDA had authorized us to initiate our Phase 1a clinical trial. We commenced the Phase 1a clinica l trial in September 2015, and completed the dosing phase of the clinical trial in January 2016. The double-blind, placebo-controlled, single ascending dose trial was designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of Lpathomab in healthy volunteers. The trial also aimed to establish a maximum tolerated dose for future clinical studies in patients with neuropathic pain or other potential indications. The trial included a total of five cohorts at increasing doses. Lpathomab was well tolerated at all doses tested, and no serious adverse events or dose limiting toxicities were observed during the trial. The follow-up period for patients in this Phase 1a trial will be completed in March 2016, and we expect the final study results, including pharmacokinetic, pharmcodynamic, and safety data, to be available in the second quarter of 2016. 

&#160; 

iSONEP 

&#160; 

iSONEP is the ocular formulation of sonepcizumab, a mA b against S1P, a bioactive lipid implicated in the progression of many diseases including various angiogenic-related diseases and inflammatory-oriented indications, multiple sclerosis, and many types of cancer, iSONEP&#8212;and ASONEP as well (see below)&#8212;acts as a molecular sponge to selectively absorb S1P from blood and from certain tissues. 

&#160; 

Pre-Clinical and Phase 1 Clinical Trial Results 

&#160; 

iSONEP demonstrated promising anti-angiogenic results in various eye models of wet AMD, as performed by Dr. Maria Grant (University of Florida) and Dr. Peter Campochiaro (Johns Hopkins University). Moreover, Dr. Campochiaro&#8217;s studies also demonstrated that iSONEP has strong anti-vascular permeability effects in the eye, as well as promising anti-inflammatory properties. Studies that we performed in-house suggest iSONEP also may have anti-fibrotic effects. 

&#160; 

In 2009, we completed a Phase 1 clinical trial in which iSONEP was evaluated in patients with wet AMD. In that trial, iSONEP met its primary endpoint of being well tolerated in all 15 patients at dose levels ranging from 0.2 mg to 1.8 mg per intravitreal injection. No drug-related serious adverse events were reported in any of the patients. Positive biological effects were also observed in some patients in this clinical study, the most common being regression in Choroidal neovascularization (CNV), which is the underlying cause of the disease that eventually leads to degeneration of the macula. Most of these positive effects appear to be largely independent of the effects seen when patients undergo treatment with the drugs that are the current market leaders for the treatment of wet AMD. 

&#160; 

iSONEP&#8217;s non-overlapping effects relative to anti-VEGF therapeutics was predicted. As Campochiaro et al. state in Journal of Cellular Physiology, &#8220;Since S1P may have both independent and overlapping effects with VEGF, it is a particularly appealing target. There may be advantages to combined blockade of VEGF [Lucentis] and blockade of S1P [iSONEP].&#8221; 

&#160; 

The most significant benefit observed in the Phase 1 trial was a regression in choroidal neovascularization (CNV), which is the underlying cause of the disease that eventually leads to degeneration of the macula, the area of the retina responsible for central vision. Of the seven patients that had a baseline lesion that was considered by experienced ophthalmologists to be &#8220;large,&#8221; four experienced a reduction exceeding 5 mm2 and three experienced a reduction of greater than 75%&#8212;all with a single dose of iSONEP. This type of clinical benefit is not typical with other treatments, as the published data (Heier JS et al. Ophthalmology.2006; 113:642e1-642.e4) suggest that, even with repeated Lucentis&#174; dosing, the total physical size of CNV lesion does not show much reduction. 

&#160;

&#160; 

Due to the small sample size, all biological effects described above can only be characterized as possibly correlative; no causal relationship has yet been established, statistically or otherwise. 

&#160; 

The fact that these biological effects appear to be non-overlapping vis-&#224;-vis those of the predominant market leaders, Lucentis &#174; , Avastin &#174; , and Eylea &#174; may be important . Wet AMD is characterized by the pathologic disruption of the retina, which is caused collectively by (i) new-blood-vessel growth in the choroid layer under the retina, (ii) sub-retinal fibrosis, (iii) general inflammation in the retinal area, and (iv) edema caused by new blood vessels that do not form perfectly and are thereby permeable (or leaky). 

&#160; 

Lucentis , Avastin , Eylea target the protein VEGF, a validated promoter of permeable and leaky blood vessels, and appear to exert most of their beneficial effect via an anti-permeability action that results in resolution of intra and sub-retinal edema. However, the actual CNV lesion does not typically regress. 

&#160; 

In contrast, iSONEP has been shown in various animal models of disease not only to reduce blood-vessel growth and leakiness, but to significantly mitigate ocular fibrosis (Grant et al, Experimental Eye Research , August 2008) and to substantially reduce inflammation in the eye (Campochiaro et al., Journal of Cellular Physiology , October 2008). As such, iSONEP has the potential to be an effective wet AMD treatment since it may act synergistically with anti-VEGF approaches as a combination therapy to address the complex processes and multiple steps that ultimately lead to vision loss for wet AMD patients. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

The promising results of the Phase 1 clinical trial together with the preclinical studies suggest the following: 

&#160; 

(i) 

iSONEP may have comparative advantages over currently available treatments like Lucentis , &#160; Avastin or Eylea. The loss of visual acuity associated with AMD is caused by a combination of all the factors mentioned above, yet Lucentis, Avastin, and Eylea apparently fail to address inflammation and sub-retinal fibrosis. Thus, iSONEP may improve vision on a more-consistent basis across the patient population and may treat the multiple mechanisms that cause exudative-AMD-related vision loss. Such an agent might act as an adjunct therapy to an anti-VEGF agent. 

&#160; 

(ii) 

iSONEP may be able to inhibit the vascular and extravascular components of ischemic retinopathies such as diabetic retinopathy and the dry form of AMD, both of which represent significant unmet medical needs. 

&#160; 

(iii) 

iSONEP might be efficacious in treating fibrotic-related disorders of the eye, including proliferative retinopathy, post glaucoma filtration surgery (trabeculectomy or valve implantation), and various anterior-segment diseases. 

&#160; 

Pfizer Agreement and Phase 2 Clinical Trial 

In 2010, we entered into an agreement with Pfizer Inc., which was amended in 2012 (collectively, the &#8220;Pfizer Agreement&#8221;), that provided Pfizer with an exclusive option for a worldwide license to develop and commercialize iSONEP. From 2011 to 2015 in collaboration with Pfizer, we conducted a multicenter, Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating iSONEP in patients with wet AMD (the &#8220;Nexus trial&#8221;). During the second quarter of 2015, we announced that our Nexus trial did not meet its primary or key secondary endpoints. The wet AMD patients in the Nexus trial did not show statistically significant improvement in visual acuity at day 120 of the trial, the primary endpoint, when treated with iSONEP as an adjunctive or monotherapy. As we have previously disclosed, based on the failure of iSONEP to meet these primary endpoints of the Nexus trial, Pfizer elected to allow its option to develop and commercialize iSONEP to expire unexercised on August 9, 2015. As a result, the Pfizer Agreement terminated by its terms, and all rights that Pfizer held in the iSONEP program have reverted to Lpath. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Following completion of the Nexus clinical trial, we conducted further analyses of the clinical trial data, including additional anatomical endpoints, to better understand the results. While iSONEP did not meet the primary endpoint of the Nexus trial by showing statistically significant improvement in visual acuity at day 120 of the trial, analyses of the follow-up data from the completed trial did provide interesting signals of possible therapeutic benefit from iSONEP. Long-term follow-up data through the conclusion of the trial after nine months suggests that treatment of wet AMD patients with iSONEP, in combination with anti-VEGF treatments, may result in reductions in total wet AMD lesion area and may allow patients to maintain their visual acuity gains for longer periods of time &#160; than would be expected from anti-VEGF treatment alone . We believe that these signals of activity in the Nexus trial are appropriate for further clinical investigation. We are seeking a partner for future studies of iSONEP in order to obtain the funding and additional expertise required to advance this program. 

&#160; 

ASONEP 

&#160; 

ASONEP is the systemic formulation of sonepcizumab; as such, it is also a mAb against the bioactive lipid S1P which has been implicated in the progression of various types of cancer and other angiogenic-related and inflammatory-oriented indications. It is well documented in scientific literature that S1P is a key protector of cancer cells when tumors are stressed by radiation or chemotherapy. Many studies have been conducted that demonstrate a strong link between S1P and several prevalent tumor types, including renal cell carcinoma (kidney cancer), leukemia, prostate cancer, neuroblastoma, (a brain tumor), lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, and melanoma (skin cancer). 

&#160; 

Preclinical and Phase 1 Clinical Trial Results 

&#160; 

ASONEP has demonstrated efficacy in preclinical models of several types of human cancers. In addition, the safety profile of ASONEP was extremely favorable throughout a Phase 1 clinical trial as well as in a wide variety of preclinical studies at multiples of anticipated human exposure. 

&#160; 

We believe ASONEP may be effective in reducing the four major processes of cancer progression: tumor proliferation, tumor metastasis, tumor-associated angiogenesis, and protection from cell death. The other mAbs on the market or in clinical trials of which we are aware generally inhibit only one or two tumor- promoting effects in a broad range of cancers. As such, we believe that ASONEP may have a comparative advantage over other therapeutic antibody approaches for cancer. 

&#160; 

Other potential advantages of ASONEP, which are generally related to our unique approach of targeting bioactive lipids (whereas most therapeutic mAbs on the market and in clinical trials are directed against protein targets), include the following: 

&#160; 

a) 

ASONEP&#8217;s preclinical data may translate into humans more predictably than typical protein-targeted drug candidates. Unlike protein targets, S1P has a single molecular structure that is conserved among species (i.e., S1P in a mouse is the same as in monkeys and humans), which is not the case for protein targets. This possibly provides for a greater translation (i.e., higher predictive value) between animal efficacy studies and possible human clinical significance. 

&#160; 

b) 

Cancer cells (and other pathogenic cell types) may not as easily &#8220;escape therapy&#8221; by mutating around the therapy. When the target is a protein, cancerous cells can &#8220;escape therapy&#8221; by mutating around the therapy; they do this either (i) through a form of natural selection, by &#8220;selecting&#8221; the isoform of the protein that the drug has least efficacy against, or (ii) by making a new version of the protein that the drug is less effective against (and cancer cells have already proven to be highly likely to mutate). S1P, on the other hand, has no isoforms (or splice variants) so the natural selection process described above cannot occur. In addition, the second approach described above is highly unlikely to occur because cells are programmed to produce proteins and not lipids. 

&#160; 

&#160;

c) 

Antibodies that bind to lipids may be able to attain certain efficiencies and potencies that protein-targeted antibodies cannot attain. A typical antibody usually binds and inhibits one (in some cases, two) protein targets. Lipids are so small, by contrast, that each antibody can bind and inhibit two or more such lipid molecules, providing certain efficacies and potencies that typical antibodies cannot attain. 

&#160; 

d) 

ASONEP has greater binding affinity than other antibodies. The affinity of ASONEP (i.e., the &#8220;strength&#8221; of binding to its target, S1P) is higher than antibody therapeutics that are currently used in the clinic as molecular sponges. 

&#160; 

ASONEP has demonstrated favorable results in disease models for clinical indications other than cancer. In a preclinical study conducted at Harvard Medical School using ASONEP in an Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis (EAE) model of Multiple Sclerosis, ASONEP performed favorably compared against FTY720, a Novartis compound that was recently approved by the FDA as a treatment for Multiple Sclerosis. 

&#160; 

In the first quarter of 2010, we completed a Phase 1 clinical trial in which ASONEP was tested in patients having cancer. The trial met its primary endpoint of identifying safe dose levels for investigation in the Phase 2 setting. ASONEP was well tolerated at all dose-levels, ranging from 1 mg/kg to 24 mg/kg. In the dose-escalation phase of the study, three evaluable patients were treated per dose level, with each one receiving four intravenous treatments during the initial evaluation period. Patients could continue ASONEP treatment after this initial evaluation period as long as the patient&#8217;s disease did not progress. The study also included an extension phase, where six additional patients were dosed at the highest dose (24 mg/kg) using the same dosing guidelines described above. 

&#160; 

More than half the patients that completed the initial four-treatment evaluation period showed stable disease. Durable stable disease was observed in several patients. The test results offer considerable flexibility with dose level in future studies because ASONEP was equally well tolerated across all doses that were tested, other than minor infusion-related reactions observed at the highest dose of 24 mg/kg. 

&#160; 

Phase 2 Clinical Trial 

&#160; 

In March 2015, we announced that our Phase 2a single-agent, open-label study of ASONEP&#8482; did not meet the primary endpoint of statistically significant progression-free survival in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC). To successfully meet the primary endpoint of progression-free survival, at least 20 out of 39 patients needed to be progression-free at four months of treatment. Fourteen out of 40 patients (over enrolled by one patient) were progression-free at four months. Eight of the fourteen patients were progression-free for at least six months, of which three patients remained progression-free for over 20 months. Overall, ASONEP was well-tolerated. The ASONEP study follow-up period concluded during the third quarter of 2015, and there are no longer any patients being treated with ASONEP. We are now exploring other indications where ASONEP may have a greater chance of success. 

&#160; 

As part of the Pfizer Agreement, Lpath granted to Pfizer (or a third party who may acquire Pfizer&#8217;s rights) a right of first refusal for ASONEP. That right of first refusal expired on August 9, 2015, concurrent with the expiration of Pfizer&#8217;s option to acquire the license to iSONEP. 

&#160; 

Business Strategy 

&#160; 

With our long-standing focus on bioactive lipids as targets for human disease, we have developed an expertise involving various tools and technologies that positions us as a leader in the emerging category of lipidomic-based therapeutics. We have an opportunity to leverage this expertise by using our proprietary ImmuneY2 drug-discovery engine to add novel bioactive-lipid-oriented product candidates to our therapeutic pipeline. In addition, we can continue to explore opportunities to licensing in technologies and compounds that further leverage our unique expertise and related intellectual property.

Manufacturing, Development, and Commercialization Strategy 

&#160; 

We have outsourced current Good Laboratory Practices (&#8220;cGLP&#8221;) preclinical development activities (e.g., toxicology) and cGMP manufacturing and clinical development activities to contract research organizations (&#8220;CROs&#8221;) and contract manufacturing organizations (&#8220;CMOs&#8221;). CROs and CMOs are third-parties that specialize in executing processes relating to project-oriented research activities on behalf of their clients and are commonly engaged in the industry. We outsource manufacturing to organizations with approved facilities and manufacturing practices. Marketing, sales, and distribution will likely be through strategic partners that license the right to market, sell, and distribute our compounds in exchange for some combination of up-front payments, royalty payments, and milestone payments. Our research and development expenses were $8. 6 million and $1 8.1 million in fiscal years 201 5 and 201 4 , respectively. 

&#160; 

In 2013, we entered into a Development and Manufacturing Services agreement with Gallus to conduct the manufacturing process development and scale-up activities followed by the cGMP manufacture of Lpathomab. Pursuant to the terms of that agreement, Gallus performed the upstream and downstream process development, and cGMP manufacture for the Lpathomab clinical material used in our recent Phase 1 clinical trial. In addition, to ensure that we had adequate supplies of clinical material to complete the Phase 2 clinical trials of iSONEP and ASONEP, we contracted with Gallus for the production of cGMP material for both of those clinical trials. Production of that material was completed in the fourth quarter of 2014. In 2014, DPx Holdings B.V. acquired Gallus and merged it into Patheon, Inc. (&#8220;Patheon&#8221;).We believe we have a good relationship with Patheon (formerly Gallus) and that, if we need to manufacture additional clinical material in the future, we will be able to do so pursuant to the terms of the 2013 Development and Manufacturing Services agreement, which does not expire until 2018. Patheon is currently our single manufacturer for ASONEP, iSONEP, and Lpathomab and may not be replaced without significant effort and delay in production. Further, we believe we have adequate supplies of cGMP clinical material to begin the Phase 1b/2a clinical trial for Lpathomab. However, we may need to manufacture additional clinical material to complete that clinical trial, depending on various factors, including the stability of the drug product and the length of time that patients remain on the clinical trials. A supply interruption or an increase in demand beyond our current manufacturer&#8217;s capabilities could harm our ability to manufacture such products until new manufacturers are identified and qualified, which would have a significant adverse effect on our business and results. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

The pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are very competitive, fast moving and intense, and expected to be increasingly so in the future. Other larger and better funded companies have developed and are developing drugs that, if not similar in type to our drugs, are designed to address the same signaling pathways, or patient or subject population. For example, there are a number of approved drugs that are currently being used in the treatment of wet AMD as well as a number of companies currently developing drugs to treat wet AMD, which is the target market for iSONEP. The current market leaders for the treatment of wet AMD are the VEGF inhibitors, including Lucentis&#174; (a product of Genentech, a member of the Roche Group), Eylea&#174; (a product of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals) and (off-label) Avastin&#174; (a product of Genentech, a member of the Roche Group). Therefore, our lead products, other products we may develop, or any other products we may acquire or in-license may not be, or may not be perceived to be, the most efficacious (at all or for a majority of patients), the safest, the first to market, or the most economical to make or use. If a competitor&#8217;s product is, or is perceived to be, more advantageous than ours, for whatever reason, then we could make less money from sales, if we are able to generate sales at all. 

&#160; 

In-licensed Technology 

&#160; 

Medical Research Council Technology 

&#160; 

In August 2005, Lpath entered into a collaboration agreement (the &#8220;AERES Agreement&#8221;) with AERES Biomedical Limited (&#8220;AERES&#8221;) to &#8220;humanize&#8221; the company&#8217;s Sphingomab monoclonal antibody. Humanization under this agreement with AERES involves utilizing proprietary processes owned by AERES for the purpose of modifying Sphingomab antibodies originally contained in mice for potential human acceptance in a clinical trial. The humanized version of Sphingomab that was produced from the collaboration with AERES is called Sonepcizumab. In 2014, 

&#160;

AERES&#8217; rights and obligations pursuant to the AERES Agreement with Lpath were transferred to Medical Research Council Technology (&#8220;MRCT&#8221;) by means of a Deed of Novation, which obligates MRCT to perform and be bound by the terms of the AERES Agreement. No amounts were paid to AERES or MRCT during 201 5 and 201 4 . Lpath could owe MRCT certain additional contingent amounts when drug candidates based on Sonepcizumab pass through the levels of the FDA drug review and approval process. MRCT will be entitled to a royalty, not to exceed 4%, on any revenues generated by the ultimate commercialization of any drug candidate based on Sonepcizumab. 

&#160; 

Patents and Proprietary Rights 

&#160; 

Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to obtain patent protection for our products in the United States and other countries. We have created a broad intellectual-property position in the bioactive lipid arena. Our patent portfolio now includes 70 issued patents, including 35 foreign patents, and 79 pending patents, including 61 foreign patent applications. These patents primarily concern the use of reagents and methods designed to interfere with the actions of bioactive lipids involved in human disease. Our intellectual-property portfolio includes compositions of matter that specifically bind to sphingolipids and sphingolipid metabolites. These agents, including antibodies, could be used in the diagnosis and treatment of various diseases and disorders, including cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease, cancer, inflammation, autoimmune disorders, ocular disease, and angiogenesis. We have also obtained issued claims on sphingolipid targets (e.g., receptors and signaling sphingolipids) and methods for using such targets in drug-discovery screening efforts. We believe that our patent portfolio provides broad, commercially significant coverage of antibodies, receptors, enzymes, or other moieties that bind to a lysolipid (or a sphingolipid metabolite) for diagnostic, therapeutic, or screening purposes. Our issued patents begin to expire in 2017. We do not believe that the expiration of any single patent is likely to significantly affect our intellectual property position. 

&#160; 

Government Regulation 

&#160; 

The FDA and comparable regulatory agencies in foreign countries, as well as drug regulators in state and local jurisdictions, impose substantial requirements upon the clinical development, manufacturing, and marketing of pharmaceutical products. These agencies and other federal, state and local entities also regulate research and development activities and the human testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising, and promotion of our product candidates (and any other products we may develop, acquire, or in-license). 

&#160; 

The process required by the FDA under the drug provisions of the United States Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act before our initial products may be marketed in the U.S. generally involves the following: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Preclinical laboratory and animal tests; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Submission of an Investigational New Drug Application (&#8220;IND&#8221;), which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for its intended use; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Submission to the FDA of an New Drug Application (&#8220;NDA&#8221;); and 

&#160; 

&#183; 

FDA review and approval, or otherwise, of an NDA. 

&#160; 

The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort, and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approval will be granted on an expeditious basis, if at all. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of the product candidate, its chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and efficacy of the product candidate. Certain preclinical tests must be conducted in compliance with cGLP regulations. Violations of these regulations can, in some cases, lead to invalidation of the studies, requiring such studies to be replicated. In some cases, long-term preclinical studies are conducted while clinical studies are ongoing. 

&#160; 

&#160;

We are required to submit the results of our preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, to the FDA as part of an IND, which must become effective before we may begin human clinical trials. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the trials as outlined in the IND and imposes a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can begin. Our submission of an IND may not result in FDA authorization to commence clinical trials. All clinical trials must be conducted under the supervision of a qualified investigator in accordance with good clinical practice regulations. Among other things, these regulations include the requirement that all subjects provide informed consent. Further, an independent Institutional Review Board (&#8220;IRB&#8221;) at each medical center proposing to conduct the clinical trials must review and approve any clinical study. Each IRB also continues to monitor the study and must be kept aware of the study&#8217;s progress, particularly as to adverse events and changes in the research. Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if adverse events occur. 

&#160; 

Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Phase 1: The drug is initially introduced into human subjects or patients and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (&#8220;ADME&#8221;). 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Phase 2: The drug is studied in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to determine the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Phase 3: When Phase 2 evaluations demonstrate that a dosage range of the drug is effective and has an acceptable safety profile, Phase 3 trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage and clinical efficacy and to further test for safety in an expanded patient population, often at geographically dispersed clinical study sites. 

&#160; 

We cannot be certain that we will successfully initiate or complete Phase 1, Phase 2, or Phase 3 testing of our product candidates within any specific time period, if at all. Furthermore, the FDA or an IRB may suspend clinical trials at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. 

Concurrent with clinical trials and pre-clinical studies, we also must develop information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product, and we must develop methods for testing the quality, purity, and potency of the final products. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and chemistry stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf-life. 

&#160; 

The results of product development, pre-clinical studies, and clinical studies are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA for approval of the marketing and commercial shipment of the product. The FDA reviews each NDA submitted and may request additional information, rather than accepting the NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the FDA accepts the NDA for filing, the agency begins an in-depth review of the NDA. The FDA has substantial discretion in the approval process and may disagree with our interpretation of the data submitted in the NDA. 

&#160; 

The review process may be significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification regarding information already provided. Also, as part of this review, the FDA may refer the application to an appropriate advisory committee, typically a panel of clinicians, for review, evaluation and a recommendation. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee. Manufacturing establishments often also are subject to inspections prior to NDA approval to assure compliance with cGMPs and with manufacturing commitments made in the relevant marketing application. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (&#8220;PDUFA&#8221;), submission of an NDA with clinical data requires payment of a fee to the F DA, which is adjusted annually. In return, the FDA assigns a goal of ten months for standard NDA reviews from acceptance of the application to the time the agency issues its &#8220;complete response,&#8221; in which the FDA may approve the NDA, deny the NDA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, or require additional clinical data. Even if the requested data is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. If the FDA approves the NDA, the product becomes available for physicians to prescribe. Even if the FDA approves the NDA, the agency may decide later to withdraw product approval if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if safety problems occur after the product reaches the market. The FDA may also require post-marketing studies, sometimes known as Phase 4 studies, as a condition of approval to develop additional information regarding the safety of a product. In addition, the FDA requires surveillance programs to monitor approved products that have been commercialized, and the agency has the power to establish and require changes in labeling and to prevent further marketing of a product based on the results of these post-marketing programs. 

&#160; 

Satisfaction of the above FDA requirements or requirements of state, local and foreign regulatory agencies typically takes several years, and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the pharmaceutical product or medical device. Government regulation may delay or prevent marketing of potential products for a considerable period of time and impose costly procedures upon our activities. We cannot be certain that the FDA or any other regulatory agency will grant approval for our lead products (or any other products we may develop, acquire, or in-license) on a timely basis, if at all. Success in preclinical or early-stage clinical trials does not assure success in later-stage clinical trials. Data obtained from preclinical and clinical activities are not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations that could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. Even if a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific indications or uses. Further, even after regulatory approval is obtained, later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market. Delays in obtaining, or failures to obtain regulatory approvals would have a material adverse effect on our business. 

&#160; 

Any products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to the FDA clearances or approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the drug, submitting other periodic reports, drug sampling and distribution requirements, notifying the FDA and gaining its approval of certain manufacturing or labeling changes, complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements, and complying with the FDA promotion and advertising requirements. Drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their facilities with the FDA and state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and state agencies for compliance with good manufacturing practices, which impose procedural and documentation requirements upon our third-party manufacturers. Failure to comply with these regulations could result, among other things, in suspension of regulatory approval, recalls, suspension of production or injunctions, seizures, or civil or criminal sanctions. We cannot be certain that our present or future subcontractors will be able to comply with these regulations and other FDA regulatory requirements. 

&#160; 

The FDA regulates drug labeling and promotion activities. The FDA has actively enforced regulations prohibiting the marketing of products for unapproved uses. Under the FDA Modernization Act of 1997, the FDA will permit the promotion of a drug for an unapproved use in certain circumstances, but subject to very stringent requirements. 

&#160; 

Our product candidates are also subject to a variety of state laws and regulations in those states or localities where our lead products (and any other products we may develop, acquire, or in-license) are manufactured or marketed. Any applicable state or local regulations may hinder our ability to market our lead products (and any other products we may develop, acquire, or in-license) in those states or localities. In addition, whether or not FDA approval has been obtained, approval of a pharmaceutical product by comparable governmental regulatory authorities in foreign countries must be obtained prior to the commencement of clinical trials and subsequent sales and marketing efforts in those countries. The approval procedure varies in complexity from country to country, and the time required may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. 

&#160; 

The FDA&#8217;s policies may change, and additional government regulations may be enacted which could prevent or delay regulatory approval of our potential products. Moreover, increased attention to the containment of health care costs 

&#160;

in the U.S. and in foreign markets could result in new government regulations that could have a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of adverse governmental regulation that might arise from future legislative or administrative action, either in the U.S. or abroad. 

&#160; 

Other Regulatory Requirements 

&#160; 

The U.S. Federal Trade Commission and the Office of the Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (&#8220;HHS&#8221;) also regulate certain pharmaceutical marketing practices. Also, reimbursement practices and HHS coverage of medicine or medical services are important to the success of procurement and utilization of our product candidates, if they are ever approved for commercial marketing. 

&#160; 

We are also subject to numerous federal, state and local laws relating to such matters as safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, relationships with treating physicians, data protection, the export of products to certain countries, environmental protection, fire hazard control, and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances. We may incur significant costs to comply with these laws and regulations now or in the future. We cannot assure you that any portion of the regulatory framework under which we currently operate will not change and that such change will not have a material adverse effect on our current and anticipated operations. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

As of February 1, 201 6 , we employed 14 individuals, of whom 7 held advanced degrees. A significant number of our management and professional employees have had prior experience with pharmaceutical, biotechnology, or medical product companies. Collective bargaining agreements do not cover any of our employees, and we consider relations with our employees to be good.
