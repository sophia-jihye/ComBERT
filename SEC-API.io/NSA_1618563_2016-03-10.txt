 Item 1. Business 

General 

National Storage Affiliates Trust is a fully integrated, self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust organized in the state of Maryland on May 16, 2013. We intend to elect to be taxed as a real estate investment trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes ("REIT") commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2015. We serve as the sole general partner of our operating partnership subsidiary, NSA OP, LP (our "operating partnership"), a Delaware limited partnership formed on February 13, 2013 to conduct our business, which is focused on the ownership, operation, and acquisition of self storage properties located within the top 100 metropolitan statistical areas ("MSAs") throughout the United States. As of December 31, 2015 , we owned a geographically diversified portfolio of 277 &#32;self storage properties, located in 16 &#32;states, comprising approximately 15.8 million &#32;rentable square feet, configured in approximately 123,000 &#32;storage units. According to the 2016 Self-Storage Almanac, we are the sixth largest owner and operator of self storage properties in the United States based on number of properties, self storage units, and rentable square footage. 

We completed our initial public offering in the second quarter 2015, in which we sold 23,000,000 shares of the Company's common shares of beneficial interest, $0.01 par value per share ("common shares"), at a price of $13.00 per share, which includes 3,000,000 common shares sold upon the exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase additional shares. These transactions resulted in net proceeds to us of approximately $278.1 million, after deducting the underwriting discount and before additional expenses associated with the offering. We primarily used the net proceeds from our initial public offering to repay outstanding indebtedness and to complete our formation transactions through the acquisition of self storage properties and for general corporate purposes. Our common shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "NSA." 

Our chairman and chief executive officer, Arlen D. Nordhagen, co-founded SecurCare Self Storage, Inc. in 1988 to invest in and manage self storage properties. While growing SecurCare to over 150 self storage properties, Mr. Nordhagen recognized a market opportunity for a differentiated public self storage REIT that would leverage the benefits of national scale by integrating multiple experienced regional self storage operators with local operational focus and expertise. We believe that his vision, which is the foundation of the Company, aligns the interests of our participating regional operators ("PROs"), with those of our public shareholders by allowing our PROs to participate alongside our shareholders in our financial performance and the performance of our PROs' contributed portfolios. A key component of this strategy is to capitalize on the local market expertise and knowledge of regional self storage operators by maintaining the continuity of their roles as property managers. 

We believe that our structure creates the right financial incentives to accomplish these objectives. We require our PROs to exchange the self storage properties they contribute to the Company for a combination of common equity interests ("OP units") and subordinated performance units ("subordinated performance units") in our operating partnership or subsidiaries of our operating partnership that issue units intended to be economically equivalent to the OP units and subordinated performance units issued by our operating partnership ("DownREIT partnerships"). OP units, which are economically equivalent to our common shares, create alignment with the performance of the Company as a whole. Subordinated performance units, which are linked to the performance of specific contributed portfolios, incentivize our PROs to drive operating performance and support the sustainability of the operating cash flow generated by the contributed self storage properties that they continue to manage on our behalf. Because subordinated performance 

unit holders receive distributions only after portfolio-specific minimum performance thresholds are satisfied, subordinated performance units play a key role in aligning the interests of our PROs with us and our shareholders. Our structure thus offers PROs a unique opportunity to serve as regional property managers for their contributed properties and directly participate in the potential upside of those properties while simultaneously diversifying their investment to include a broader portfolio of self storage properties. We believe our structure provides us with a competitive growth advantage over self storage companies that do not offer property owners the ability to participate in the performance and potential future growth of their contributed portfolios. 

We believe that our national platform has significant potential for continued external and internal growth. We seek to further expand our platform by continuing to recruit additional established self storage operators, while integrating our operations through the implementation of centralized initiatives, including management information systems, revenue enhancement, and cost optimization programs. We are currently engaged in preliminary discussions with additional self storage operators and believe that we could add one to three additional PROs annually over the next three to five years. These additional operators will enhance our existing geographic footprint and allow us to enter regional markets in which we currently have limited or no market share. 

Our PROs 

The Company had six &#32;PROs as of December 31, 2015 : SecurCare Self Storage, Inc. and its controlled affiliates ("SecurCare"), Kevin Howard Real Estate Inc., d/b/a Northwest Self Storage and its controlled affiliates ("Northwest"), Optivest Properties LLC and its controlled affiliates ("Optivest"), Guardian Storage Centers LLC and its controlled affiliates ("Guardian"), Move It Self Storage and its controlled affiliates ("Move It"), and Arizona Mini Storage Management Company d/b/a Storage Solutions and its controlled affiliates ("Storage Solutions"). In February 2016, we entered into definitive agreements with entities related to Hide-Away Storage Services, Inc. ("Hide-Away") to add Hide-Away as our seventh PRO. The transaction is expected to close early in the second quarter of 2016, following the satisfaction of customary closing conditions. To capitalize on their recognized and established local brands, our PROs continue to function as property managers for their contributed properties under their existing brands (which include various brands in addition to those discussed below). Over the long-run, we may seek to brand or co-brand each location as part of NSA. 

&#8226; 

SecurCare, which is headquartered in Lone Tree, Colorado, has been operating since 1988 and is one of our PROs responsible for covering the mountain and southeast regions. SecurCare provided property management services to 134 of our properties located in California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Texas as of December 31, 2015. In January and February 2016, we acquired 10 additional properties in Colorado, Oklahoma, and Indiana that SecurCare will manage. SecurCare is currently managed by David Cramer, who has worked in the self storage industry for more than 17 years. Mr. Cramer is our mountain and southeast regional president and also leads our Technology and Best Practices Group. 

&#8226; 

Northwest, which is headquartered in Portland, Oregon, is our PRO responsible for covering the northwest region. Northwest provided property management services to 65 of our properties located in Oregon and Washington as of December 31, 2015. Northwest is run by Kevin Howard, who founded the company over 30 years ago. Mr. Howard is our northwest regional president and is recognized in the industry for his successful track record as a self storage specialist in the areas of design and development, operation and property management, consultation, and brokerage. 

&#8226; 

Optivest, which is based in Dana Point, California, is one of our PROs responsible for covering the southwest region. Optivest managed 29 of our properties located in Arizona, California, Nevada, New Hampshire and Texas as of December 31, 2015. In February 2016, we acquired five additional properties in New Hampshire that Optivest will manage. Optivest is run by its co-founder, Warren Allan, who has more than 25 years of financial and operational management experience in the self storage industry. Mr. Allan is our southwest regional president and is recognized as a self storage acquisition and development specialist. 

&#8226; 

Guardian, which is based in Irvine, California, is one of our PROs responsible for covering portions of the southern California region and the Arizona market. Guardian managed 34 of our properties located in California and Arizona as of December 31, 2015. This operator is led by John Minar, who has over 30 years of self storage acquisition and operational management experience. Mr. Minar is our southern California regional president and brings close to 40 years of real estate acquisition, rehabilitation, ownership, and development experience to the Company. 

&#8226; 

Move It, which is based in Dallas, Texas, is one of our PROs responsible for covering certain portions of the Texas market. Move It managed 12 of our properties in Texas as of December 31, 2015. In January 2016, we acquired one additional property in Texas that Move It will manage. This operator is led by its founder, Tracy Taylor, who has more than 40 years of experience in self storage development, acquisition and management. Mr. Taylor is our Texas market executive vice president and is currently on the board of directors for the Large Owners Council of the Self Storage Association. 

&#8226; 

Storage Solutions, based in Chandler, Arizona, is our PRO responsible for covering most of the Arizona market. Storage Solutions managed three of our properties in Arizona as of December 31, 2015. This operator is led by its founder, Bill Bohannan, who is one of the largest operators in Phoenix and has more than 34 years of self storage acquisition, development and management experience. Mr. Bohannan is our Arizona market executive vice president and is recognized in the industry as a self storage acquisition, development and management specialist. 

&#8226; 

Hide-Away is expected to become our PRO responsible for covering the western Florida market upon the closing of our transaction with Hide-Away and its related entities, which is expected to occur early in the second quarter of 2016. Based in Sarasota, Florida, Hide-Away is expected to manage 14 of our properties in western Florida. This operator is led by its founder, Stephen A. Wilson, one of the early developers of the self storage business, who has served for more than 35 years as the President of Hide-Away and its related entities, and is a former Chairman of the national Self-Storage Association. 

Each PRO representative who serves as regional president or executive vice president of the Company receives no compensation from us for serving in these roles. We benefit from the local market knowledge and active presence of our PROs, allowing us to build and foster important customer and industry relationships. These local relationships provide attractive off-market acquisition opportunities that we believe will continue to fuel additional external growth. Newly acquired properties are integrated into our national platform and managed by our PROs. 

Our PROs have collectively contributed the majority of their properties to the Company. We believe our structure allows our PROs to optimize their established property management platforms while addressing financial and operational hurdles. Before joining us, our PROs faced challenges in securing low cost capital and had to manage multiple investors and lending relationships, making it difficult to compete with larger competitors, including public REITs, for acquisition and investment opportunities. Our PROs were also limited in their ability to raise growth capital through the sale of assets, a portfolio refinancing, or capital contributions from new equity partners. Serving as our on-the-ground acquisition teams, our PROs now have access to our broader financing sources and lower cost of capital, while our national platform allows them to benefit from our economies of scale to drive operating efficiencies in a rapidly evolving, technology-driven industry. 

Acquisition and Disposition Activity 

We acquired 58 &#32;self storage properties during the year ended December 31, 2015 , and 83 &#32;self storage properties during the year ended December 31, 2014. We seek to own properties that are well located in high quality sub-markets with highly accessible street access and attractive supply and demand characteristics, providing our properties with strong and stable cash flows that are less sensitive to the fluctuations of the general economy. A complete listing of, and additional information about, our self storage properties is included in Item 2 of this Report.

(1) Self storage properties in other states acquired during the year ended December 31, 2015 include Kentucky, Oregon, New Hampshire, and Washington. 

(2) Self storage properties in other states acquired during the year ended December 31, 2014 include Georgia, New Hampshire, and Nevada. 

In May 2014, we sold to an unrelated party one of the self storage properties contributed by the combined subsidiaries of SecurCare Self Storage, Inc. ("our predecessor"). The gross selling price for the property sold was approximately $3.0 million and net proceeds from this sale were invested in the acquisition of another self storage property in a tax-deferred exchange. 

Our Competitive Strengths 

We believe our unique PRO structure allows us to differentiate ourselves from other self storage operators, and the following competitive strengths enable us to effectively compete against our industry peers: 

High Quality Properties in Key Growth Markets. We owned a geographically diversified portfolio of 277 &#32;self storage properties, located in 16 &#32;states, comprising approximately 15.8 million &#32;rentable square feet, configured in approximately 123,000 &#32;storage units, as of December 31, 2015 . Over 70% of our portfolio is located in the top 100 MSAs, based on our 2015 net operating income ("NOI"). We believe that these properties are primarily located in high quality growth markets that have attractive supply and demand characteristics and are less sensitive to the fluctuations of the general economy. Many of these markets have multiple barriers to entry against increased supply, including zoning restrictions against new construction and new construction costs that we believe are higher than our properties' fair market value. Furthermore, we believe that our significant size and the overall geographic diversification of our portfolio reduces risks associated with specific local or regional economic downturns or natural disasters. 

Differentiated, Growth-Oriented Strategy Focused on Established Operators. We are a self storage REIT with a unique structure that supports our differentiated external growth strategy. Our structure appeals to operators who are looking for access to growth capital while maintaining an economic stake in the self storage properties that each has contributed to the Company and continues to manage on our behalf. These attributes entice operators to join the Company 

rather than sell their properties for cash consideration. Our strategy is to attract operators who are confident in the future performance of their properties and desire to participate in the growth of the Company. We are focused on recruiting established institutional operators across the United States with a history of efficient property management and a track record of successful acquisitions. Our structure and differentiated strategy have enabled us to build a substantial captive pipeline from existing operators as well as potentially create external growth from the recruitment of additional PROs. 

Integrated Platform Utilizing Advanced Technology for Enhanced Operational Performance and Best Practices. Our national platform allows us to capture cost savings through integration and centralization, thereby eliminating redundancies and utilizing economies of scale across the property management platforms of our PROs. As compared to a stand-alone operator, our national platform has greater access to lower-cost capital, reduced Internet marketing costs per customer lead, discounted property insurance expense, and reduced overhead costs. In addition, the Company has sufficient scale for national and bulk purchasing and has centralized various functions, including financial reporting, call center operations, a national credit card processing program, marketing, information technology, legal support, and capital market functions, to achieve substantial cost savings over smaller, individual operators. 

Our national platform utilizes advanced technology for our data warehouse program, Internet marketing (including through GoStorageUnits.com, which is owned by the Company), our centralized call center, financial and property analytic dashboards, revenue optimization analytics and expense management tools to enhance operational performance. These centralized programs, which are run through our Technology and Best Practices Group, are positively impacting our business performance, and we believe that they will be a driver of organic growth going forward. We will utilize our Technology and Best Practices Group to help us benefit from the collective sharing of key operating strategies among our PROs in areas like human resource management, local marketing and operating procedures and building tenant insurance-related arrangements. 

Aligned Incentive Structure with Shareholder Downside Protection. Our structure promotes operator accountability as subordinated performance units issued to our PROs in exchange for the contribution of their properties are entitled to distributions only after those properties satisfy minimum performance thresholds. In the event of a material reduction in operating cash flow, distributions on our subordinated performance units will be reduced disproportionately to distributions on our common shares held by our common shareholders. In addition, we expect our PROs will generally co-invest subordinated equity in the form of subordinated performance units in each acquisition that they source, and the value of these subordinated performance units will fluctuate with the performance of their contributed properties. Therefore, our PROs are incentivized to select acquisitions that are expected to exceed minimum performance thresholds, thereby increasing the value of their subordinated equity stake. We expect that our shareholders will benefit from the higher levels of property performance that our PROs are incentivized to deliver. 

Our Business and Growth Strategies 

By capitalizing on our competitive strengths, we seek to increase scale, achieve optimal revenue-producing occupancy and rent levels, and increase long-term shareholder value by achieving sustainable long-term growth. Our business and growth strategies to achieve these objectives are as follows: 

Increase Occupancy. Other public self storage REITs operate at a weighted average occupancy level which we believe is at or near optimal revenue-producing occupancy as of December 31, 2015 . Our portfolio occupancy was 88.5% &#32;as of December 31, 2015 , reflecting a gap compared to the average occupancy of the other public self storage REITs. Through utilization of our centralized call center, integrated Internet marketing strategies and best practices protocols, we expect our PROs will be able to increase rental conversion rates resulting in increasing occupancy levels. 

Maximize Property Level Cash Flow. We strive to maximize the cash flows at our properties by leveraging the economies of scale provided by our national platform, including through the implementation of new ideas derived from our Technology and Best Practices Group. We believe that our unique PRO structure, centralized infrastructure and efficient national platform will enable us to achieve optimal market rents and occupancy, reduce operating expenses and increase the sale by our PROs of ancillary products and services, including tenant insurance, of which we receive a portion of the proceeds, truck rentals and packing supplies. 

Acquire Built-in Captive Pipeline of Target Properties from Existing PROs. We have an attractive, high quality potential acquisition pipeline (our "captive pipeline") of over 100 self storage properties valued at over $700 million that we anticipate will drive our future growth. We consider a property to be in our captive pipeline if it (i) is under a management service agreement with one of our PROS, (ii) meets our property quality criteria, and (iii) is either required to be offered to us under the applicable facilities portfolio management agreement or a PRO has a reasonable basis to believe that the controlling owner of the property intends to sell the property in the next seven years. 

Our PROs have management service agreements with all of the properties in our captive pipeline and hold controlling and non-controlling ownership interests in some of these properties. With respect to each property in our captive pipeline in which a PRO holds a controlling ownership interest, such PRO has agreed that it will not transfer (or permit the transfer of, to the extent possible) any interest in such self storage property without first offering or causing to be offered (if permissible) such interest to us. In addition, upon maturity of the outstanding mortgage indebtedness encumbering such property or if no such indebtedness is in place, so long as occupancy is consistent with or exceeds average local market levels, which we determine in our sole discretion, such PRO has agreed to offer or cause to be offered (if permissible) such interest to us. With respect to captive pipeline properties in which our PROs have a non-controlling ownership interest or no ownership interest, each PRO has agreed to use commercially reasonable good faith efforts to facilitate our purchase of such property. We preserve the discretion to accept or reject any of the properties that our PROs are required to, or elect to, offer (or cause to be offered) to us. 

There can be no assurance as to whether we will acquire any of these properties or the actual timing of any such acquisitions. Each captive pipeline property is subject to additional due diligence and the determination by us to pursue the acquisition of the property. In addition, with respect to the captive pipeline properties in which our PROs have a non-controlling ownership interest or no ownership interest, the current owner of each property is not required to offer such property to us and there can be no assurance that we will acquire these properties. 

Access Additional Off-Market Acquisition Opportunities. Our PROs and their "on-the-ground" personnel have established an extensive network of industry relationships and contacts in their respective markets. Through these local connections, our PROs are able to access acquisition opportunities that are not publicly marketed or sold through auctions. Our structure incentivizes our PROs to source acquisitions in their markets and consolidate these properties into the Company. Other public self storage companies generally have acquisition teams located at their central offices, which in many instances are far removed from regional and local markets. We believe our operators' networks and close familiarity with the other operators in their markets provide us clear competitive advantages in identifying and selecting attractive acquisition opportunities. Our PROs have already sourced 63 acquisitions as of December 31, 2015, comprising approximately 4.4 million rentable square feet within our portfolio. 

Recruit Additional New PROs in Target Markets. We intend to continue to execute on our external growth strategy through additional acquisitions and contributions from future PROs in key markets. We believe there is significant opportunity for growth through consolidation of the highly fragmented composition of the market. We believe that future operators will be attracted to our unique structure, providing them with lower cost of capital, better economies of scale, and greater operational and overhead efficiencies while preserving their existing property management platforms. We intend to add additional PROs to complement our existing geographic footprint and to achieve our goal of creating a highly diversified nationwide portfolio of properties focused in the top 100 MSAs. When considering a PRO candidate, we consider various factors, including the size of the potential PRO's portfolio, the quality and location of its properties, its market exposure, its operating expertise, its ability to grow its business, and its reputation with industry participants. 

Our Financing Strategy 

We expect to maintain a flexible approach in financing new property acquisitions. Future property acquisitions may entail the issuance of OP units, subordinated performance units or other equity securities. In general, we expect to fund our property acquisitions through a combination of borrowings under bank credit facilities (including term loans and revolving facilities), property-level debt and public and private equity and debt issuances. As of December 31, 2015, our unsecured credit facility (the "credit facility") provides for total borrowings of $550.0 million , consisting of a $200.0 million &#32;senior term loan (the "term loan") and a $350.0 million &#32;senior revolving credit facility (the "revolving line of credit"). As of December 31, 2015 , we had the entire term loan amount drawn and we had $188.0 million &#32;of outstanding borrowings under the revolving line of credit, and the capacity to borrow an additional $162.0 million , subject to the borrowing base calculation. Furthermore, we are currently engaged in discussions with lenders to expand our credit facility during 2016 to provide for a total borrowing capacity of $600 million, including an additional expansion option, which, if exercised, would provide for a total borrowing capacity of $1.0 billion. This expansion is also expected to extend the maturity dates of our current credit facility and include customary market terms and covenants. There can be no assurance as to whether we will close the expansion of our credit facility or the actual timing of any such expansion. 

We expect to employ leverage in our capital structure in amounts determined from time to time by our board of trustees. Although our board of trustees has not adopted a policy which limits the total amount of indebtedness that we may incur, it will consider a number of factors in evaluating our level of indebtedness from time to time, as well as the 

amount of such indebtedness that will be either fixed and variable-rate, and in making financial decisions, including, among others, the following: 

&#8226; 

the interest rate of the proposed financing; 

&#8226; 

the extent to which the financing impacts our flexibility in managing our properties; 

&#8226; 

prepayment penalties and restrictions on refinancing; 

&#8226; 

the purchase price of properties we acquire with debt financing; 

&#8226; 

our long-term objectives with respect to the financing; 

&#8226; 

our target investment returns; 

&#8226; 

the ability of particular properties, and the Company as a whole, to generate cash flow sufficient to cover expected debt service payments; 

&#8226; 

overall level of consolidated indebtedness; 

&#8226; 

timing of debt maturities; 

&#8226; 

provisions that require recourse and cross-collateralization; 

&#8226; 

corporate credit ratios including debt service coverage, debt to total market capitalization and debt to undepreciated assets; and 

&#8226; 

the overall ratio of fixed- and variable-rate debt. 

Our indebtedness may be recourse, non-recourse or cross-collateralized. If the indebtedness is non-recourse, the collateral will be limited to the particular properties to which the indebtedness relates. In addition, we may invest in properties subject to existing loans secured by mortgages or similar liens on our properties, or may refinance properties acquired on a leveraged basis. We may use the proceeds from any borrowings to refinance existing indebtedness, to refinance investments, including the redevelopment of existing properties, for general working capital or for other purposes when we believe it is advisable. 

Corporate Governance Profile 

We have structured our corporate governance in a manner we believe closely aligns our interests with those of our shareholders. Notable features of our corporate governance structure include the following: 

&#8226; 

our board of trustees is not staggered, with each of our trustees subject to re-election annually; 

&#8226; 

our board or trustees has determined that five of the eight persons who serve on our board of trustees are independent for purposes of the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") corporate governance listing standards and Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act; 

&#8226; 

to avoid actual and perceived conflicts of interests between us and our PROs, certain decisions of our board of trustees must also be approved by a majority of our independent trustees; 

&#8226; 

at least one of our trustees qualifies as an "audit committee financial expert" as defined by the SEC; 

&#8226; 

we have opted out of the control share acquisition statute in the Maryland General Corporation Law (the "MGCL") and have exempted from the business combinations statute in the MGCL transactions between us and (1) any other person, provided that the business combination is first approved by our board of trustees (including a majority of trustees who are not affiliates or associates of such person), (2) Arlen D. Nordhagen and any of his affiliates and associates and (3) any person acting in concert with the foregoing; 

&#8226; 

we do not have a shareholder rights plan and our board of trustees has adopted a policy that our board may not adopt any shareholder rights plan unless the adoption of the plan has been approved by shareholders representing a majority of the votes cast on the matter by shareholders entitled to vote on the matter, except that our board of trustees may adopt a shareholder rights plan without the prior approval of our shareholders if our board, in the exercise of its duties, determines that seeking prior shareholder approval would not be in our best interests under the circumstances then existing. The policy further provides that if a shareholder rights plan is adopted by our board without the prior approval of our shareholders, the shareholder rights plan will 

expire on the date of the first annual meeting of shareholders held after the first anniversary of the adoption of the plan, unless an extension of the plan is approved by our common shareholders. 

&#8226; 

we have opted out of the unsolicited takeover (Title 3, Subtitle 8) provisions of the MGCL (which we may not opt into without the approval of our shareholders). 

In order to foster the highest standards of ethics and conduct in all business relationships, we have adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics policy. This policy, which covers a wide range of business practices and procedures, applies to our officers, trustees, and employees. Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics is available in the Corporate Governance section of our website at http://www.nationalstorageaffiliates.com/. 

Dividend Reinvestment Plan 

In the future, we may adopt a dividend reinvestment plan that will permit shareholders who elect to participate in the plan to have their cash dividends reinvested in additional common shares. 

Regulation 

General 

Generally, self storage properties are subject to various laws, ordinances and regulations, including those relating to lien sale rights and procedures, public accommodations, insurance, and the environment. Changes in any of these laws, ordinances or regulations could increase the potential liability existing or created by tenants or others on our properties. Laws, ordinances, or regulations affecting development, construction, operation, upkeep, safety and taxation requirements may result in significant unanticipated expenditures, loss of self storage sites or other impairments to operations, which would adversely affect our cash flows from operating activities. 

Under the the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 ("the ADA"), all places of public accommodation are required to meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. These requirements became effective in 1992. A number of additional U.S. federal, state and local laws also exist that may require modifications to properties, or restrict certain further renovations thereof, with respect to access thereto by disabled persons. Noncompliance with the ADA could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants and also could result in an order to correct any non-complying feature, and in substantial capital expenditures. To the extent our properties are not in compliance, we are likely to incur additional costs to comply with the ADA. 

Insurance activities are subject to state insurance laws and regulations as determined by the particular insurance commissioner for each state in accordance with the McCarran-Ferguson Act, as well as subject to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and the privacy regulations promulgated by the Federal Trade Commission pursuant thereto. 

Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended (the "CERCLA"), and comparable state laws, we may be required to investigate and remediate regulated hazardous materials at one or more of our properties. CERCLA and comparable state laws typically impose strict joint and several liabilities without regard to whether a company knew of or caused the release of hazardous substances. The liability for the entire cost of clean-up could be imposed upon any responsible party. For additional information on environmental matters and regulation, see "Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8212;Risks Related to Our Business&#8212;Environmental compliance costs and liabilities associated with operating our properties may affect our results of operations." 

Property management activities are often subject to state real estate brokerage laws and regulations as determined by the particular real estate commission for each state. 

Changes in any of the laws governing our conduct could have an adverse impact on our ability to conduct our business or could materially affect our financial position, operating income, expense or cash flow. 

REIT Qualification 

We intend to elect to qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, (the "Code"), commencing with our taxable year ended on December 31, 2015. We generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on our net taxable income to the extent that we distribute annually all of our net taxable income to our shareholders and maintain our intended qualification as a REIT. We believe that we have been organized and have operated in conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Code, and we expect that our intended manner of operation will enable us to continue to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT. To qualify, and maintain our qualification, as a REIT, we must meet on a continuing basis, through our organization and actual investment and operating results, various requirements under the Code relating to, among other 

things, the sources of our gross income, the composition and values of our assets, our distribution levels and the diversity of ownership of our shares. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year and do not qualify for certain statutory relief provisions, we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at regular corporate rates and may be precluded from qualifying as a REIT for the subsequent four taxable years following the year during which we failed to qualify as a REIT. Even if we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we still may be subject to some U.S. federal, state and local taxes on our income or property. In addition, subject to maintaining our qualification as a REIT, a portion of our business is conducted through, and a portion of our income is earned by, one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries ("TRSs"), which are subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax at regular rates. Distributions paid by us generally will not be eligible for taxation at the preferential U.S. federal income tax rates that currently apply to certain distributions received by individuals from taxable corporations, unless such distributions are attributable to dividends received by us from a TRS. 

Recent U.S. Federal Income Tax Legislation 

On December 18, 2015, President Obama signed into law the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016, an omnibus spending bill, with a division referred to as the Protecting Americans From Tax Hikes Act of 2015 (the "PATH Act"). The PATH Act changes certain of the rules affecting REIT qualification and taxation of REITs and REIT shareholders, which are briefly summarized below. 

&#8226; 

For taxable years beginning after 2017, the percentage of a REIT's total assets that may be represented by securities of one or more TRSs is reduced from 25% to 20%. 

&#8226; 

"Publicly offered REITs" (which generally include any REIT required to file annual and periodic reports with the SEC, including us) are no longer subject to the preferential dividend rules for taxable years beginning after 2014. 

&#8226; 

For taxable years beginning after 2015, debt instruments issued by publicly offered REITs are qualifying assets for purposes of the 75% REIT asset test. However, no more than 25% of the value of a REIT's assets may consist of debt instruments that are issued by publicly offered REITs that are not otherwise treated as real estate assets, and interest on debt of a publicly offered REIT will not be qualifying income under the 75% REIT gross income test unless the debt is secured by real property. 

&#8226; 

For taxable years beginning after 2015, to the extent rent attributable to personal property is treated as rents from real property (because rent attributable to the personal property for the taxable year does not exceed 15% of the total rent for the taxable year for such real and personal property), the personal property will be treated as a real estate asset for purposes of the 75% REIT asset test. Similarly, debt obligation secured by a mortgage on both real and personal property will be treated as a real estate asset for purposes of the 75% asset test, and interest thereon will be treated as interest on an obligation secured by real property, if the fair market value of the personal property does not exceed 15% of the fair market value of all property securing the debt. 

&#8226; 

For taxable years beginning after 2014, the period during which dispositions of properties with net built-in gains from C corporations in carry-over basis transactions will trigger the built-in gains tax is reduced from ten years to five years. 

&#8226; 

For taxable years beginning after 2015, a 100% excise tax will apply to "redetermined services income," i.e., non-arm's-length income of a REIT's TRS attributable to services provided to, or on behalf of, the REIT (other than services provided to REIT tenants, which are potentially taxed as redetermined rents). 

&#8226; 

The rate of withholding tax applicable under FIRPTA to certain sales and other dispositions of U.S. real property interests ("USRPIs") by non-U.S. persons, and certain distributions from corporations whose stock may constitute a USRPI, is increased from 10% to 15% for dispositions and distributions occurring after February 16, 2016. 

&#8226; 

For dispositions and distributions on or after December 18, 2015, the stock ownership thresholds for exemption from FIRPTA taxation on sale of stock of a publicly traded REIT and for recharacterizing capital gain dividends received from a publicly traded REIT as ordinary dividends is increased from not more than 5% to not more than 10%. 

&#8226; 

Effective December 18, 2015, certain look-through, presumption, and other rules will apply for purposes of determining if we qualify as domestically controlled. 

&#8226; 

For dispositions and distributions after December 18, 2015, certain "qualified foreign pension funds" satisfying certain requirements, as well as entities that are wholly owned by a qualified foreign pension fund, are exempt from income and withholding taxes applicable under FIRPTA. In addition, new FIRPTA rules apply to ownership of REIT shares by "qualified shareholders," which generally include publicly traded non-U.S. stockholders meeting certain requirements. 

Competition 

We compete with many other entities engaged in real estate investment activities for customers and acquisitions of self storage properties and other assets, including national, regional, and local owners, operators, and developers of self storage properties. We compete based on a number of factors including location, rental rates, security, suitability of the property's design to prospective tenants' needs, and the manner in which the property is operated and marketed. We believe that the primary competition for potential customers comes from other self storage properties within a three to five mile radius. We have positioned our properties within their respective markets as high-quality operations that emphasize tenant convenience, security, and professionalism. 

We also may compete with numerous other potential buyers when pursuing a possible property for acquisition, which can increase the potential cost of a project. These competing bidders also may possess greater resources than us and therefore be in a better position to acquire a property. However, our use of OP units and subordinated performance units as transactional currency allows us to structure our acquisitions in tax-deferred transactions. As a result, potential targets who are tax-sensitive might favor us as a suitor. 

Our primary national competitors in many of our markets for both tenants and acquisition opportunities include local and regional operators, institutional investors, private equity funds, as well as the other public self storage REITS, including Public Storage, Cubesmart, Extra Space Storage Inc. and Sovran Self Storage, Inc. These entities also seek financing through similar channels to the Company. Therefore, we will continue to compete for institutional investors in a market where funds for real estate investment may decrease. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015 , the Company had 18 employees, which does not include persons employed by our PROs. As of December 31, 2015 , our PROs, collectively, had over 600 full-time and part-time employees involved in management, operations, and reporting with respect to our self storage property portfolio.
