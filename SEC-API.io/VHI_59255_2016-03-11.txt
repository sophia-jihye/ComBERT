CHEMICALS SEGMENT &#8212; KRONOS WORLDWIDE, INC. 

Business Overview 

Through our majority-controlled subsidiary, Kronos, we are a leading global producer and marketer of value-added titanium dioxide pigments, or TiO 2 , a base industrial product used in a wide range of applications. We, along with our distributors and agents, sell and provide technical services for our products to approximately 4,000 customers in 100 countries with the majority of sales in Europe and North America. We believe we have developed considerable expertise and efficiency in the manufacture, sale, shipment and service of our products in domestic and international markets. 

TiO 2 is a white inorganic pigment used in a wide range of products for its exceptional durability and its ability to impart whiteness, brightness and opacity. TiO 2 is a critical component of everyday applications, such as coatings, plastics and paper, as well as many specialty products such as inks, food and cosmetics. TiO 2 is widely considered to be superior to alternative white pigments in large part due to its hiding power (or opacity), which is the ability to cover or mask other materials effectively and efficiently. TiO 2 is designed, marketed and sold based on specific end-use applications. 

&#160;

- 4 -

&#160;

TiO 2 is the largest commercially used whitening pigment because it has a high refractive rating, giving it more hiding power than any other commercially produced white pigment. In addition, TiO 2 has excellent resistance to interaction with other chemicals, good thermal stability and resistance to ultraviolet degradation. Although there are other white pigments on the market, we believe there are no effective substitutes for TiO 2 because no other white pigment has the physical properties for achieving comparable opacity and brightness or can be incorporated in as cost-effective a manner. Pigment extenders such as kaolin clays, calcium carbonate and polymeric opacifiers are used together with TiO 2 in a number of end-use markets. However, these products are not able to duplicate the opacity performance characteristics of TiO 2 and we believe these products are unlikely to have a significant impact on the use of TiO 2 . 

TiO 2 is considered a &#8220;quality-of-life&#8221; product. Demand for TiO 2 has generally been driven by worldwide gross domestic product and has generally increased with rising standards of living in various regions of the world. According to industry estimates, TiO 2 consumption has grown at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 3.0% since 1990. Per capita consumption of TiO 2 in Western Europe and the United States far exceeds that in other areas of the world, and these regions are expected to continue to be the largest consumers of TiO 2 on a per capita basis. We believe that Western Europe and North America currently account for approximately 20% and 18% of global TiO 2 consumption, respectively. Markets for TiO 2 are generally increasing in South America, Eastern Europe, the Asia Pacific region and China and we believe these are significant markets where we expect continued growth as economies in these regions continue to develop and quality-of-life products, including TiO 2 , experience greater demand. 

Products and End-use Markets 

Including our predecessors, we have produced and marketed TiO 2 in North America and Europe, our primary markets, for almost 100 years. We believe that we are the largest producer of TiO 2 in Europe with approximately one-half of our sales volumes attributable to markets in Europe. The table below shows our market share for our significant markets, Europe and North America, for the last three years.

Some of the principal applications for our products include the following. 

TiO 2 for coatings - Our TiO 2 is used to provide opacity, durability, tinting strength and brightness in industrial coatings, as well as coatings for commercial and residential interiors and exteriors, automobiles, aircraft, machines, appliances, traffic paint and other special purpose coatings. The amount of TiO 2 used in coatings varies widely depending on the opacity, color and quality desired. In general, the higher the opacity requirement of the coating, the greater the TiO 2 content. 

&#160;

- 5 -

&#160;

TiO 2 for plastics - We produce TiO 2 pigments that improve the optical and physical properties in plastics, including whiteness and opacity. TiO 2 is used to provide opacity in items such as containers and packaging materials, and vinyl products such as windows, door profiles and siding. TiO 2 also generally provides hiding power, neutral undertone, brightness and surface durability for housewares, appliances, toys, computer cases and food packages. TiO 2 &#8217;s high brightness along with its opacity, is used in some engineering plastics to help mask their undesirable natural color. TiO 2 is also used in masterbatch, which is a concentrate of TiO 2 and other additives and is one of the largest uses for TiO 2 in the plastics end-use market. In masterbatch, the TiO 2 is dispersed at high concentrations into a plastic resin and is then used by manufacturers of plastic containers, bottles, packaging and agricultural films. 

TiO 2 for paper - Our TiO 2 is used in the production of several types of paper, including laminate (decorative) paper, filled paper and coated paper to provide whiteness, brightness, opacity and color stability. Although we sell our TiO 2 to all segments of the paper end-use market, our primary focus is on the TiO 2 grades used in paper laminates, where several layers of paper are laminated together using melamine resin under high temperature and pressure. The top layer of paper contains TiO 2 and plastic resin and is the layer that is printed with decorative patterns. Paper laminates are used to replace materials such as wood and tile for such applications as counter tops, furniture and wallboard. TiO 2 is beneficial in these applications because it assists in preventing the material from fading or changing color after prolonged exposure to sunlight and other weathering agents. 

TiO 2 for other applications - We produce TiO 2 to improve the opacity and hiding power of printing inks. TiO 2 allows inks to achieve very high print quality while not interfering with the technical requirements of printing machinery, including low abrasion, high printing speed and high temperatures. Our TiO 2 is also used in textile applications where TiO 2 functions as an opacifying and delustering agent. In man-made fibers such as rayon and polyester, TiO 2 corrects an otherwise undesirable glossy and translucent appearance. Without the presence of TiO 2 , these materials would be unsuitable for use in many textile applications. 

We produce high purity sulfate process anatase TiO 2 used to provide opacity, whiteness and brightness in a variety of cosmetic and personal care products, such as skin cream, lipstick, eye shadow and toothpaste. Our TiO 2 is also found in food products, such as candy and confectionaries, and in pet foods where it is used to obtain uniformity of color and appearance. In pharmaceuticals, our TiO 2 is used commonly as a colorant in pill and capsule coatings as well as in liquid medicines to provide uniformity of color and appearance. Kronos &#174; purified anatase grades meet the applicable requirements of the CTFA (Cosmetics, Toiletries and Fragrances Association), USP and BP (United States Pharmacopoeia and British Pharmacopoeia) and the FDA (United States Food and Drug Administration). 

Our TiO 2 business is enhanced by the following three complementary businesses, which comprised approximately 10% of our net sales in 2015: 

&#160;

&#9679; 

We own and operate two ilmenite mines in Norway pursuant to a governmental concession with an unlimited term. Ilmenite is a raw material used directly as a feedstock by some sulfate-process TiO 2 plants. We believe that we have a significant competitive advantage because our mines supply our feedstock requirements for all of our European sulfate-process plants. We also sell ilmenite ore to third parties, some of whom are our competitors, and we sell an ilmenite-based specialty product to the oil and gas industry. The mines have estimated ilmenite reserves that are expected to last at least 50 years. 

&#160;

&#9679; 

We manufacture and sell iron-based chemicals, which are co-products and processed co-products of the sulfate and chloride process TiO 2 pigment production. These co-product chemicals are marketed through our Ecochem division and are primarily used as treatment and conditioning agents for industrial effluents and municipal wastewater as well as in the manufacture of iron pigments, cement and agricultural products. 

&#160;

&#9679; 

We manufacture and sell titanium oxychloride and titanyl sulfate, which are side-stream specialty products from the production of TiO 2 . Titanium oxychloride is used in specialty applications in the formulation of pearlescent pigments, production of electroceramic capacitors for cell phones and other electronic devices. Titanyl sulfate productions are used in pearlescent pigments, natural gas pipe and other specialty applications. 

&#160;

- 6 -

&#160;

Manufacturing, operations and properties 

We produce TiO 2 in two crystalline forms: rutile and anatase. Rutile TiO 2 is manufactured using both a chloride production process and a sulfate production process, whereas anatase TiO 2 is only produced using a sulfate production process. Manufacturers of many end-use applications can use either form, especially during periods of tight supply for TiO 2 . The chloride process is the preferred form for use in coatings and plastics, the two largest end-use markets. Due to environmental factors and customer considerations, the proportion of TiO 2 industry sales represented by chloride process pigments has increased relative to sulfate process pigments, and in 2015, chloride process production facilities represented approximately 49% of industry capacity. The sulfate process is preferred for use in selected paper products, ceramics, rubber tires, man-made fibers, food products and cosmetics. Once an intermediate TiO 2 pigment has been produced by either the chloride or sulfate process, it is &#8220;finished&#8221; into products with specific performance characteristics for particular end-use applications through proprietary processes involving various chemical surface treatments and intensive micronizing (milling). 

&#160;

&#9679; 

Chloride process - The chloride process is a continuous process in which chlorine is used to extract rutile TiO 2 . The chloride process produces less waste than the sulfate process because much of the chlorine is recycled and feedstock bearing higher titanium content is used. The chloride process also has lower energy requirements and is less labor-intensive than the sulfate process, although the chloride process requires a higher-skilled labor force. The chloride process produces an intermediate base pigment with a wide range of properties. 

&#160;

&#9679; 

Sulfate process - The sulfate process is a batch process in which sulfuric acid is used to extract the TiO 2 from ilmenite or titanium slag. After separation from the impurities in the ore (mainly iron), the TiO 2 is precipitated and calcined to form an intermediate base pigment ready for sale or can be upgraded through finishing treatments.

We produced 528,000 metric tons of TiO 2 in 2015, up from the 511,000 metric tons we produced in 2014. Our production amounts include our share of the output produced by our TiO 2 manufacturing joint venture discussed below in &#8220;TiO 2 Manufacturing Joint Venture.&#8221; Our average production capacity utilization rates were approximately 86%, 92% and 95% of capacity in 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively. Our production utilization rates in 2013 were impacted by the previously-reported lockout at our Canadian production facility that began in June 2013. We operated our Canadian plant at approximately 15% of the plant&#8217;s capacity with non-union management employees during the lockout. Our production rates in 2014 were also impacted by such lockout, as restart of production at the facility did not begin until February 2014. Our production rates in 2014 and in the first quarter of 2015 were also impacted by the implementation of certain productivity-enhancing improvement projects at other facilities, as well as necessary improvements to ensure continued compliance with our permit regulations, which resulted in longer-than-normal maintenance shutdowns in some instances.

We operate four TiO 2 plants in Europe (one in each of Leverkusen, Germany; Nordenham, Germany; Langerbrugge, Belgium; and Fredrikstad, Norway). In North America, we have a TiO 2 plant in Varennes, Quebec, Canada and, through the manufacturing joint venture described below in &#8220;TiO 2 Manufacturing Joint Venture,&#8221; a 50% interest in a TiO 2 plant in Lake Charles, Louisiana. 

Our production capacity in 2015 was 555,000 metric tons, approximately three-fourths of which was from the chloride production process.

The Leverkusen facility is located within an extensive manufacturing complex owned by Bayer AG. We own the Leverkusen facility, which represents about one-third of our current TiO 2 production capacity, but we lease the land under the facility from Bayer under a long-term agreement which expires in 2050. Lease payments are periodically negotiated with Bayer for periods of at least two years at a time. A majority-owned subsidiary of Bayer provides some raw materials including chlorine, auxiliary and operating materials, utilities and services necessary to operate the Leverkusen facility under separate supplies and services agreements. &#160;

(2) 

The Fredrikstad plant is located on public land and is leased until 2063. 

(3) 

We operate the Lake Charles facility in a joint venture with Tioxide Americas LLC (Tioxide), a subsidiary of Huntsman Corporation and the amount indicated in the table above represents the share of TiO 2 produced by the joint venture to which we are entitled. See Note 7 to our Consolidated Financial Statements and &#8220;TiO 2 Manufacturing Joint Venture.&#8221; 

We own the land underlying all of our principle production facilities unless otherwise indicated in the table above. 

Our production capacity has increased by approximately 12% over the past ten years due to debottlenecking programs, with only moderate capital expenditures. We believe that our annual attainable production capacity for 2016 is approximately 555,000 metric tons, and we currently expect our production capacity rate will be at near-capacity levels in 2016.

We also operate two ilmenite mines in Norway pursuant to a governmental concession with an unlimited term. In addition, we operate a rutile slurry manufacturing plant in Lake Charles, Louisiana, which converts dry pigment manufactured for us at the Lake Charles TiO 2 facility into a slurry form that is then shipped to customers. 

We have various corporate and administrative offices located in the U.S., Germany, Norway, Canada and Belgium and various sales offices located in the U.S., Canada, Belgium, France, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. 

TiO 2 Manufacturing Joint Venture 

Kronos Louisiana, Inc., one of our subsidiaries, and Tioxide each own a 50% interest in a manufacturing joint venture, Louisiana Pigment Company, L.P., or LPC. LPC owns and operates a chloride-process TiO 2 plant located in Lake Charles, Louisiana. We and Huntsman share production from the plant equally pursuant to separate offtake agreements, unless we and Huntsman otherwise agree (such as in 2015, when we purchased approximately 52% of the production from the plant). 

A supervisory committee directs the business and affairs of the joint venture, including production and output decisions. This committee is composed of four members, two of whom we appoint and two of whom Huntsman appoints. Two general managers manage the operations of the joint venture acting under the direction of the supervisory committee. We appoint one general manager and Huntsman appoints the other. 

The joint venture is not consolidated in our financial statements, because we do not control it. We account for our interest in the joint venture by the equity method. The joint venture operates on a break-even basis and therefore we do not have any equity in earnings of the joint venture. We are required to purchase one half of the TiO 2 produced by the joint venture. All costs and capital expenditures are shared equally with Huntsman with the exception of feedstock (purchased natural rutile ore or slag) and packaging costs for the pigment grades produced. Our share of net costs is reported as cost of sales as the TiO 2 is sold. See Note 7 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Raw materials 

The primary raw materials used in chloride process TiO 2 are titanium-containing feedstock (purchased natural rutile ore or slag), chlorine and coke. Chlorine is available from a number of suppliers, while petroleum coke is available from a limited number of suppliers. Titanium-containing feedstock suitable for use in the chloride process is available from a limited but increasing number of suppliers principally in Australia, South Africa, Canada, India and the United States. We purchase chloride process grade slag from Rio Tinto Iron and Titanium Limited under a long-term supply contract that expires at the end of 2018, subject to two-year renewal periods if both parties agree. We also purchase upgraded slag from Rio Tinto Iron and Titanium Limited under a long-term supply contract that expires at the end of 2019. We purchase natural rutile ore under contracts primarily from Iluka Resources, Limited and Sierra Rutile Limited, all of which expire in 2016. In the past we have been, and we expect that we will continue to be, successful in obtaining short-term and long-term extensions to these and other existing supply contracts prior to their expiration. We expect the raw materials purchased under these contracts, and contracts that we may enter into, will meet our chloride process feedstock requirements over the next several years. 

&#160;

- 8 -

&#160;

The primary raw materials used in sulfate process TiO 2 are titanium-containing feedstock, primarily ilmenite or purchased sulfate grade slag and sulfuric acid. Sulfuric acid is available from a number of suppliers. Titanium-containing feedstock suitable for use in the sulfate process is available from a limited number of suppliers principally in Norway, Canada, Australia, India and South Africa. As one of the few vertically-integrated producers of sulfate process TiO 2 , we operate two rock ilmenite mines in Norway, which provided all of the feedstock for our European sulfate process TiO 2 plants in 2015. We expect ilmenite production from our mines to meet our European sulfate process feedstock requirements for the foreseeable future. For our Canadian sulfate process plant, we purchase sulfate grade slag primarily from Rio Tinto Fer et Titane Inc. under a supply contract that renews annually, subject to termination upon twelve months written notice. We expect the raw materials purchased under these contracts, and contracts that we may enter into, to meet our sulfate process feedstock requirements over the next several years. 

Many of our raw material contracts contain fixed quantities we are required to purchase, or specify a range of quantities within which we are required to purchase. The pricing under these agreements is generally negotiated quarterly. 

The following table summarizes our raw materials purchased or mined in 2015.

Sales and Marketing 

Our marketing strategy is aimed at developing and maintaining strong customer relationships with new and existing accounts. Because TiO 2 represents a significant raw material cost for our customers, the purchasing decisions are often made by our customers&#8217; senior management. We work to maintain close relationships with the key decision makers, through in-depth and frequent in-person meetings. We endeavor to extend these commercial and technical relationships to multiple levels within our customers&#8217; organization using our direct sales force and technical service group to accomplish this objective. We believe this has helped build customer loyalty to Kronos and strengthened our competitive position. Close cooperation and strong customer relationships enable us to stay closely attuned to trends in our customers&#8217; businesses. Where appropriate, we work in conjunction with our customers to solve formulation or application problems by modifying specific product properties or developing new pigment grades. We also focus our sales and marketing efforts on those geographic and end-use market segments where we believe we can realize higher selling prices. This focus includes continuously reviewing and optimizing our customer and product portfolios. 

Our marketing strategy is also aimed at working directly with customers to monitor the success of our products in their end-use applications, evaluate the need for improvements in product and process technology and identify opportunities to develop new product solutions for our customers. Our marketing staff closely coordinates with our sales force and technical specialists to ensure that the needs of our customers are met, and to help develop and commercialize new grades where appropriate. 

We sell a majority of our products through our direct sales force operating from six sales offices in Europe and one sales office in North America. We also utilize sales agents and distributors who are authorized to sell our products in specific geographic areas. In Europe, our sales efforts are conducted primarily through our direct sales force and our sales agents. Our agents do not sell any TiO 2 products other than Kronos &#174; brand products. In North America, our sales are made primarily through our direct sales force and supported by a network of distributors. In addition to our direct sales force and sales agents, many of our sales agents also act as distributors to service our smaller customers in all regions. We offer customer and technical service to the customers who purchase our products through distributors as well as to our larger customers serviced by our direct sales force. 

We sell to a diverse customer base with only one customer representing 10% or more of our sales in 2015 (Behr Process Corporation &#8211; 10%). Our largest ten customers accounted for approximately 34% of sales in 2015. 

Neither our business as a whole nor any of our principal product groups is seasonal to any significant extent. However, TiO 2 sales are generally higher in the second and third quarters of the year, due in part to the increase in paint production in the spring to meet demand during the spring and summer painting seasons. With certain exceptions, we have historically operated our production facilities at near full capacity rates throughout the entire year, which among other things helps to minimize our per-unit production costs. As a result, we normally will build inventories during the first and fourth quarters of each year, in order to maximize our product availability during the higher demand periods normally experienced in the second and third quarters.

Competition 

The TiO 2 industry is highly competitive. We compete primarily on the basis of price, product quality, technical service and the availability of high performance pigment grades. Since TiO 2 is not a traded commodity, its pricing is largely a product of negotiation between suppliers and their respective customers. Although certain TiO 2 grades are considered specialty pigments, the majority of our grades and substantially all of our production are considered commodity pigments with price and availability being the most significant competitive factors along with quality and customer service. During 2015, we had an estimated 9% share of worldwide TiO 2 sales volume, and based on sales volumes, we believe we are the leading seller of TiO 2 in several countries, including Germany. 

Our principal competitors are The Chemours Company, or Chemours (which was spun-off from E.I. du Pont de Nemours &#38; Co. into a separate publicly-traded company in 2015); Millennium Inorganic Chemicals, Inc. (a subsidiary of National Titanium Dioxide Company Ltd.), or Cristal; Huntsman Corporation; and Tronox Incorporated. The top five TiO 2 producers (i.e. we and our four principal competitors) account for approximately 56% of the world&#8217;s production capacity. Huntsman completed its purchase of the TiO 2 business of Sachtleben Chemie GmbH in 2014, and has also announced its intent to exit the TiO 2 business by December 31, 2016. In February 2015, Huntsman announced a plan to reduce its TiO 2 capacity by approximately 100,000 metric tons at one of its European sulfate process facilities. In August 2015, Chemours announced plans to close its plant in Delaware and shut down a production line at its facility in Tennessee, reducing its overall capacity by approximately 150,000 metric tons. 

The following chart shows our estimate of worldwide production capacity in 2015:

Chemours has over one-half of total North American TiO 2 production capacity and is our principal North American competitor. 

Over the past ten years, we and our competitors increased industry capacity through debottlenecking projects, which in part compensated for the shut-down of various TiO 2 plants in France, the United States, the United Kingdom and China. Chemours has announced the scheduled production start-up of a 200,000 metric ton line at its plant in Mexico in mid-2016. Although overall industry demand is expected to be generally higher in 2016 as compared to 2015 as a result of improving worldwide economic conditions, we do not expect any other significant efforts will be undertaken by us or our principal competitors to further increase capacity for the foreseeable future, other than through debottlenecking projects. If actual developments differ from our expectations, the TiO 2 industry&#8217;s performance and that of our own could be unfavorably affected. 

The TiO 2 industry is characterized by high barriers to entry consisting of high capital costs, proprietary technology and significant lead times (typically three to five years in our experience) required to construct new facilities or to expand existing capacity. We believe it is unlikely any new TiO 2 plants will be constructed in Europe or North America in the foreseeable future. 

Research and development 

We employ scientists, chemists, process engineers and technicians who are engaged in research and development, process technology and quality assurance activities in Leverkusen, Germany. These individuals have the responsibility for improving our chloride and sulfate production processes, improving product quality and strengthening our competitive position by developing new applications. Our expenditures for these activities were approximately $18 million in 2013, $19 million in 2014 and $16 million in 2015. We expect to spend approximately $14 million on research and development in 2016. 

We continually seek to improve the quality of our grades and have been successful at developing new grades for existing and new applications to meet the needs of our customers and increase product life cycles. Since 2010, we have added seven new grades for pigments and other applications.

Patents, trademarks, trade secrets and other intellectual property rights 

We have a comprehensive intellectual property protection strategy that includes obtaining, maintaining and enforcing our patents, primarily in the United States, Canada and Europe. We also protect our trademark and trade secret rights and have entered into license agreements with third parties concerning various intellectual property matters. We have also from time to time been involved in disputes over intellectual property. 

Patents - We have obtained patents and have numerous patent applications pending that cover our products and the technology used in the manufacture of our products. Our patent strategy is important to us and our continuing business activities. In addition to maintaining our patent portfolio, we seek patent protection for our technical developments, principally in the United States, Canada and Europe. U.S. Patents are generally in effect for 20 years from the date of filing. Our U.S. patent portfolio includes patents having remaining terms ranging from one year to 19 years. 

Trademarks and trade secrets - Our trademarks, including Kronos &#174; , are covered by issued and/or pending registrations, including in Canada and the United States. We protect the trademarks that we use in connection with the products we manufacture and sell and have developed goodwill in connection with our long-term use of our trademarks. We conduct research activities in secret and we protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets through reasonable measures, including confidentiality agreements and security procedures, including data security. We rely upon unpatented proprietary knowledge and continuing technological innovation and other trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position. Our proprietary chloride production process is an important part of our technology and our business could be harmed if we fail to maintain confidentiality of our trade secrets used in this technology.

Certain employees at each of our production facilities are organized by labor unions. In Europe, our union employees are covered by master collective bargaining agreements for the chemical industry that are generally renewed annually. In Canada, our union employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement that expires in June 2018. At December 31, 2015, approximately 87% of our worldwide workforce is organized under collective bargaining agreements. It is possible that there could be future work stoppages or other labor disruptions that could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial position or liquidity. 

Regulatory and environmental matters 

Our operations and properties are governed by various environmental laws and regulations, which are complex, change frequently and have tended to become stricter over time. These environmental laws govern, among other things, the generation, storage, handling, use and transportation of hazardous materials; the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the ground, air or water; and the health and safety of our employees. Certain of our operations are, or have been, engaged in the generation, storage, handling, manufacture or use of substances or compounds that may be considered toxic or hazardous within the meaning of applicable environmental laws and regulations. As with other companies engaged in similar businesses, certain of our past and current operations and products have the potential to cause environmental or other damage. We have implemented and continue to implement various policies and programs in an effort to minimize these risks. Our policy is to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations at all our facilities and to strive to improve our environmental performance. It is possible that future developments, such as stricter requirements in environmental laws and enforcement policies, could adversely affect our operations, including production, handling, use, storage, transportation, sale or disposal of hazardous or toxic substances or require us to make capital and other expenditures to comply, and could adversely affect our consolidated financial position and results of operations or liquidity. 

Our U.S. manufacturing operations are governed by federal, state and local environmental and worker health and safety laws and regulations. These include the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, or RCRA, the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (&#8220;CERCLA&#8221;), as amended by the Superfund Amendments and 

&#160;

- 11 -

&#160;

Reauthorization Act, or CERCLA, as well as the state counterparts of these statutes. Some of these laws hold current or previous owners or operators of real property liable for the costs of cleaning up contamination, even if these owners or operators did not know of, and were not responsible for, such contamination. These laws also assess liability on any person who arranges for the disposal or treatment of hazardous substances, regardless of whether the affected site is owned or operated by such person. Although we have not incurred and do not currently anticipate any material liabilities in connection with such environmental laws, we may be required to make expenditures for environmental remediation in the future. 

While the laws regulating operations of industrial facilities in Europe vary from country to country, a common regulatory framework is provided by the European Union, or the EU. Germany and Belgium are members of the EU and follow its initiatives. Norway is not a member but generally patterns its environmental regulatory actions after the EU. 

At our sulfate plant facilities in Germany, we recycle spent sulfuric acid either through contracts with third parties or at our own facilities. In addition, at our German locations we have a contract with a third-party to treat certain sulfate-process effluents. At our Norwegian plant, we ship spent acid to a third party location where it is used as a neutralization agent. These contracts may be terminated by either party after giving three or four years advance notice, depending on the contract. 

From time to time, our facilities may be subject to environmental regulatory enforcement under U.S. and non-U.S. statutes. Typically we establish compliance programs to resolve these matters. Occasionally, we may pay penalties. To date such penalties have not involved amounts having a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity. We believe that all of our facilities are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws. 

Our capital expenditures related to ongoing environmental compliance, protection and improvement programs, including capital expenditures which are primarily focused on increased operating efficiency but also result in improved environmental protection such as lower emissions from our manufacturing facilities, were $6.9 million in 2015 and are currently expected to be approximately $9 million in 2016.

Raw Materials 

CompX&#8217;s primary raw materials are: 

&#160;

&#183; 

zinc and brass (used in the security products reporting unit for the manufacture of locking mechanisms); and 

&#160;

&#183; 

stainless steel (used primarily in the marine components reporting unit for the manufacture of exhaust headers and pipes), aluminum (used for the manufacture of throttles and trim tabs), and other components). 

These raw materials are purchased from several suppliers, are readily available from numerous sources and accounted for approximately 10% of CompX&#8217;s total cost of sales for 2015. Total material costs, including purchased components, represented approximately 48% of CompX&#8217;s cost of sales in 2015.

We occasionally enter into short-term commodity-related raw material supply arrangements to mitigate the impact of future increases in commodity-related raw material costs. These arrangements generally provide for stated unit prices based upon specified purchase volumes, which help us to stabilize our commodity-related raw material costs to a certain extent. We periodically enter into such arrangements for zinc and brass. Following a general softening of commodity metal markets during 2015, we expect commodity-related raw material prices to remain relatively stable during 2016; however, these raw materials purchased on the spot market are sometimes subject to unanticipated and sudden price increases. We generally seek to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in these raw material costs on our margins through improvements in production efficiencies or other operating cost reductions. In the event we are unable to offset raw material cost increases with other cost reductions, it may be difficult to recover those cost increases through increased product selling prices or raw material surcharges due to the competitive nature of the markets served by our products. Consequently, overall operating margins can be affected by commodity-related raw material cost pressures. Commodity market prices are cyclical, reflecting overall economic trends, specific developments in consuming industries and speculative investor activities.

Patents and Trademarks 

We hold a number of patents relating to our component products, certain of which we believe to be important to us and our continuing business activity. Patents generally have a term of 20 years, and our patents have remaining terms ranging from less than 1 year to 17 years at December 31, 2015. Our major trademarks and brand names in addition to CompX &#174; include:

Sales, Marketing and Distribution . 

A majority of our component sales are direct to large OEM customers through our factory-based sales and marketing professionals supported by engineers working in concert with field salespeople and independent manufacturer&#8217;s representatives. We select manufacturer&#8217;s representatives based on special skills in certain markets or relationships with current or potential customers. 

In addition to sales to large OEM customers, a substantial portion of our security products reporting unit&#8217;s sales are made through distributors. We have a significant North American market share of cabinet lock security product sales as a result of the locksmith distribution channel. We support our locksmith distributor sales with a line of standardized products used by the largest segments of the marketplace. These products are packaged and merchandised for easy availability and handling by distributors and end users. 

In 2015, our ten largest customers, all customers of our security products reporting unit, accounted for approximately 48% of our total sales. United States Postal Service and Harley Davidson accounted for approximately 13% and 12%, respectively, of total sales for the year ended December 31, 2015. Overall, our customer base is diverse and the loss of any single customer would not in itself have a material adverse effect on our operations. 

Competition 

The markets in which we participate are highly competitive. We compete primarily on the basis of product design, including space utilization and aesthetic factors, product quality and durability, price, on-time delivery, service and technical support. We focus our efforts on the middle and high-end segments of the market, where product design, quality, durability and service are valued by the customer. Our security products reporting unit competes against a number of domestic and foreign manufacturers. Our marine components reporting unit competes with small domestic manufacturers and is minimally affected by foreign competitors. 

Regulatory and Environmental Matters 

Our operations are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the use, storage, handling, generation, transportation, treatment, emission, discharge, disposal, remediation of and exposure to hazardous and non-hazardous substances, materials and wastes (&#8220;Environmental Laws&#8221;). Our operations also are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to worker health and safety. We believe we are in substantial compliance with all such laws and regulations. To date, the costs of maintaining compliance with such laws and regulations have not significantly impacted our results. We currently do not anticipate any significant costs or expenses relating to such matters; however, it is possible future laws and regulations may require us to incur significant additional expenditures. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015, we employed 512 people, all in the United States. We believe our labor relations are good at all of our facilities.

WASTE MANAGEMENT SEGMENT &#8212; WASTE CONTROL SPECIALISTS LLC 

On November 18, 2015, we entered into an agreement with Rockwell Holdco, Inc. ("Rockwell"), for the sale of WCS to Rockwell for $270 million in cash, $20 million face amount in Series A Preferred Stock of Rockwell plus the assumption of all of WCS&#8217; third-party indebtedness incurred prior to the date of the agreement. Additionally, Rockwell and its affiliates will assume all financial assurance obligations related to the WCS business. We have agreed to covenants relating to our Waste Management Segment&#8217;s conduct of its business until the closing of the sale. Rockwell is the parent company of Energy Solutions , Inc. Completion of the sale is subject to certain customary closing conditions, including the receipt of U.S. anti-trust approval, and is expected to close in the first half of 2016, assuming all closing conditions are satisfied. There can be no assurance that any such sale of WCS would be completed. See Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

&#160;

&#160;

Business Overview 

Our Waste Management Segment was formed in 1995, and in early 1997 we completed construction of the initial phase of our waste management facility in West Texas. The original facility was initially designed for the processing, treatment, storage and disposal of certain hazardous and toxic wastes. We received the first wastes for disposal in 1997. Subsequently, we expanded our authorizations to include the processing, treatment and storage of LLRW and mixed LLRW and the disposal of certain types of exempt LLRW. In May 2008, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (&#8220;TCEQ&#8221;) issued a byproduct materials disposal license to us. In January 2009, TCEQ issued a near-surface LLRW disposal license to us. This license was signed in September 2009. 

We began construction of the byproduct facility infrastructure at our site in Andrews County, Texas in the third quarter of 2008, and this facility began disposal operations in October 2009. Construction of the Compact and Federal LLRW sites began in January 2011. The Compact LLRW site was fully certified and operational in April 2012. The Federal LLRW site was fully certified and operational in September 2012 and received its first waste for disposal in 2013. 

Facility, Operations and Services 

Our Waste Management Segment operates one waste management facility located on a 1,338-acre site in West Texas. The facility is permitted for 3.8 million cubic yards of airspace landfill capacity for the disposal of RCRA, Toxic Substance Control Act (&#8220;TSCA&#8221;), Byproduct and LLRW and mixed LLRW wastes. We also own approximately 13,000 acres of additional land surrounding the permitted site, a small portion of which is located in New Mexico, which is available for future expansion. We believe our facility has superior geological characteristics which make it an environmentally-desirable location for this type of waste disposal. The facility is located in a relatively remote and arid section of West Texas. The possibility of leakage into any underground water table is considered highly remote because the ground is composed of Triassic red bed clay, and we do not believe there are any underground aquifers or other usable sources of water below the site based in part on extensive drilling by the oil and gas industry and our own test wells. Pursuant to the requirements of WCS&#8217; LLRW disposal license, the State of Texas, acting by and through the TCEQ, owns the real property for WCS&#8217; licensed &#8220;compact waste disposal facility&#8221; and leases it back to WCS; and WCS owns the real property for its licensed &#8220;federal waste disposal facility&#8221;. The remainder of WCS&#8217; permitted site, and the Texas portion of the surrounding land described above, is subject to the sale-leaseback transaction WCS entered into with the County of Andrews, Texas, as discussed in Note 9 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 

The waste management facility operates under various licenses and permits, including in the following categories: 

&#160;

&#183; 

LLRW Disposal . The LLRW disposal license allows WCS to dispose of Class A, B and C LLRW in the Compact LLRW disposal facility and the Federal LLRW disposal facility. The Federal LLRW disposal facility is for LLRW that is the responsibility of the U.S. government under applicable law, and is also permitted for disposal of mixed LLRW. The Compact LLRW disposal facility is licensed to accept LLRW that was either generated in Texas or Vermont, or has been approved for importation to Texas by the Texas Low-Level Radioactive Waste Disposal Compact Commission. Construction of the Compact and Federal LLRW disposal facilities began in January 2011. Both facilities were fully certified and operational in 2012. We accepted our first Compact waste disposal shipments in April 2012, but routine Compact disposal receipts did not occur until July 2012. We received a national disposal contract for our Federal LLRW disposal facility from the Department of Energy (&#8220;DOE&#8221;) in April 2013, and we have regularly received waste for disposal in the Federal LLRW disposal facility since the end of the second quarter of 2013. 

&#160;

&#183; 

LLRW Treatment/Storage . In November 1997, the Texas Department of State Health Services (&#8220;TDSHS&#8221;) issued a license to us for the treatment and storage, but not disposal, of LLRW and mixed LLRW. In June 2007, the TDSHS regulatory authority for this license was transferred to TCEQ. The current provisions of this license generally enable us to accept such wastes for treatment and storage from U.S. commercial and federal generators, including the DOE and other governmental agencies. We accepted the first shipments of such wastes in 1998. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

RCRA/Exempt. Our Waste Management Segment has permits from the TCEQ to accept hazardous wastes governed by RCRA, for treatment, storage and/or disposal. In March 2015, we submitted our renewal application for our RCRA permit for a new ten-year period. The application is still pending, but we are permitted to continue to accept hazardous waste governed by RCRA while under review. We have obtained additional authority to dispose of certain categories of LLRW, including naturally-occurring radioactive material (&#8220;NORM&#8221;) and waste that is exempt from radioactive waste disposal regulations (radioactive materials that do not exceed certain specified radioactive concentrations and are exempt from licensing). Waste disposed of under these permits and authorizations are disposed of in what we call the &#8220;RCRA landfill.&#8221; &#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

TSCA. Our Waste Management Segment has permits from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (&#8220;EPA&#8221;) to accept toxic wastes governed by TSCA for treatment, storage and/or disposal. In May 2015, we submitted our application for renewal of our five-year TSCA authorization for a new five-year period beginning in 2015 (which application is still pending, but we are permitted to continue to accept toxic waste pending receipt of the new five-year authorization), and in 2012 our TSCA authorization was amended to include our Federal LLRW disposal facility. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Byproduct Disposal . In May 2008, TCEQ issued us a license for the disposal of byproduct material. Byproduct material includes uranium or thorium mill tailings as well as equipment, pipe and other materials used to handle and process the mill tailings. We completed construction of the byproduct facility infrastructure at our site in Andrews County, Texas in the third quarter of 2009, and this facility began disposal operations in October 2009. Byproduct materials are disposed of in what we call the &#8220;Byproduct landfill.&#8221; 

Our LLRW Treatment/Storage facility also serves as a staging and processing location for material that requires other forms of treatment prior to final disposal as mandated by the EPA or other regulatory bodies. Our 20,000 square foot treatment facility provides for waste treatment/stabilization, warehouse storage and treatment facilities for hazardous, toxic and mixed LLRW, drum to bulk, and bulk to drum materials handling and repackaging capabilities. Treatment operations involve processing wastes through one or more chemical or other treatment methods, depending upon the particular waste being disposed and regulatory and customer requirements. Chemical treatment uses chemical oxidation and reduction, chemical precipitation of heavy metals, hydrolysis and neutralization of acid and alkaline wastes, and results in the transformation of waste into inert materials through one or more of these chemical processes. Certain treatment processes involve technology which we may acquire, license or subcontract from third parties. Once treated and stabilized, waste currently is either: (i) placed in our landfills, (ii) stored onsite in drums or other specialized containers or (iii) shipped to third-party facilities for final disposition. Only waste that meets certain specified regulatory requirements can be disposed of in our landfills. 

In February 2015, we sent a notification to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (&#8220;NRC&#8221;) expressing our intent to apply for a license for the interim storage of used nuclear fuel at our facility. Currently used nuclear fuel is stored at 63 locations in 33 states. If approved and constructed, we would become the nation&#8217;s first centralized storage facility for such high level waste. We currently expect to submit a final license application by April 2016, and currently expect the licensing, regulatory requirements and construction process to be completed by December 2020. If approved and completed, we believe the storage facility will further enhance our one-stop shop for radioactive waste to provide a comprehensive disposal and storage solution for the entire range of waste produced in the nuclear fuel cycle for our customers. There can be no assurance that we would be successful in obtaining any license for such interim storage of used nuclear fuel.

&#160;

Sales 

Our Waste Management Segment&#8217;s target customers are industrial companies, including nuclear utilities, chemical, aerospace and electronics businesses and governmental agencies, including the DOE, which generate low-level radioactive, hazardous, mixed low-level radioactive and other wastes. We employ our own salespeople to market our services to potential customers. During 2015, we had sales to five customers that exceed 10% of our net sales: Exelon Generation (19%), U.S. Department of Energy (16%), Nuclear Waste Partnership (12%), Arizona Public Service (12%), and Zion Solutions (11%). We have long-term agreements with many of our customers.

Competition 

The hazardous waste industry (other than LLRW and mixed LLRW) currently has excess industry capacity caused by a number of factors, including a relative decline in the number of environmental remediation projects generating hazardous waste and efforts on the part of waste generators to reduce the volume of waste and/or manage waste onsite at their facilities. These factors have led to reduced demand and increased price pressure for non-radioactive hazardous waste management services. 

&#160;

- 16 -

&#160;

Competition within the hazardous waste industry is diverse and based primarily on facility location/proximity to customers, pricing and customer service. We expect price competition to continue to be intense for RCRA- and TSCA-related wastes. 

This price competition resulted in minimal use of our RCRA landfill in the past. Beginning in 2014, we gained the ability to accept a broader range of waste for disposal in the RCRA landfill. This has increased the use of our RCRA landfill because it has allowed us to be more competitive for &#8220;exempt waste,&#8221; which is hazardous waste that possesses very low levels of radioactivity and has been exempted by law from management and disposal requirements applicable to LLRW. We believe our broad range of permits for the treatment, storage and disposal of exempt waste, LLRW and mixed LLRW streams may position us better than our competitors and are a key element of our long-term strategy to provide &#8220;one-stop shopping&#8221; for exempt waste, LLRW and mixed LLRW.

The LLRW industry is very competitive. Our principal competitors with respect to LLRW are Energy Solutions , Inc., US Ecology Inc., and Perma-Fix Environmental Services, Inc. These competitors are well established, and some may have significantly greater resources than we do, which could be important factors to our potential customers. We believe we may be better positioned than our competitors due to our environmentally-desirable location, a broad level of local community support, a rail transportation network leading to our facility, our capability for future site expansion and the fact that the State of Texas takes title to the LLRW in our Compact disposal facility. 

LLRW, mixed LLRW and exempt waste can be and currently is stored in numerous sites around the country and, alternatively, generators can dispose of LLRW, mixed LLRW and exempt waste in facilities operated by us and our competitors. Many of our customers store these waste streams onsite, which serves as an alternative to our and our competitors&#8217; disposal services. 

Facilities that dispose of LLRW, mixed LLRW and exempt waste, such as our facility in Texas, are generally subject to the following requirements: (i) commercial LLRW disposal facilities can only be licensed by the NRC or states that have an agreement with NRC to assume portions of its regulatory authority (&#8220;Agreement States&#8221;); (ii) the facilities must be designed, constructed and operated to meet strict safety standards and (iii) the operator of a facility must extensively characterize the site on which the facility is located and analyze how the facility will perform for thousands of years into the future. Further, certain LLRW disposal sites are restricted from accepting Class B or C LLRW from generators located in states which do not have a formal agreement with the state in which the disposal facility is located (the &#8220;Compact&#8221;). Our facility may accept Class B or C LLRW from generators that are not located in a Compact.

Other commercial options are, and may in the future become, available for the disposal of Class B and C LLRW. One such option offered by one of our competitors is the &#8220;downblending&#8221; of Class B and C LLRW in order to permit the reclassification and disposal of this waste as Class A LLRW. WCS does not offer a downblending option to its customers, and WCS does not support downblending because we believe that direct disposal of Class B and C LLRW results in a more environmentally safe solution that is less complex and less likely to be subject to regulatory changes. In addition, the State of Texas does not permit LLRW to be reclassified as a result of downblending.

Regulatory and Environmental Matters 

While the waste management industry has benefited from increased governmental regulation, it has also become subject to extensive and evolving regulation by federal, state and local authorities. The regulatory process requires waste management businesses to obtain and retain numerous operating permits covering various aspects of their operations, any of which could be subject to revocation, modification or denial. Regulations also allow public participation in the permitting process. Individuals as well as companies may oppose the granting of permits. In addition, governmental policies and the exercise of broad discretion by regulators are subject to change. It is possible our ability to modify, obtain or retain permits on a timely basis could be impaired in the future. The loss of an individual permit or the failure to modify or obtain a permit could have a significant impact on our Waste Management Segment&#8217;s future operating plans, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, especially because we only operate one disposal site. For example, adverse decisions by governmental authorities on our permit applications could cause us to abandon projects, prematurely close our facility or restrict operations. See &#8220;Facility, Operations and Services&#8221; above for a discussion of some of our Waste Management Segment&#8217;s permits. Our RCRA permit for the RCRA landfill renewal was filed in March 2015 and is under review. The TSCA authorization for the RCRA landfill and Federal LLRW disposal facility was filed in May 2015 and is under review. We believe our permits will be renewed in the ordinary course of business. Our byproduct material disposal license expires in 2018 and our LLRW disposal license expires in 2024. Our RCRA permit for the Federal LLRW disposal facility expires in 2018. Our LLRW treatment/storage license was combined into one license with our LLRW disposal license and now expires in 2024. Such permits, licenses and authorizations can be renewed subject to compliance with the requirements of the application process and approval by the TCEQ or the EPA, as applicable. 

&#160;

&#160;

The Texas Low-Level Radioactive Waste Disposal Compact Commission (&#8220;Texas Compact Commission&#8221;) is responsible for managing the disposal capacity of the Compact LLRW disposal facility. They do this by approving or denying export petitions from Texas Compact generators that wish to ship their waste to a different disposal site or approving or denying import petitions from out-of-compact generators that wish to ship their waste to the Compact LLRW disposal facility. The Texas Compact Commission has approved rules for the export and import of LLRW and began approving import agreements in 2012. 

From time to time federal, state and local authorities have proposed or adopted other types of laws and regulations for the waste management industry, including laws and regulations restricting or banning the interstate or intrastate shipment of certain waste, changing the regulatory agency issuing a license, imposing higher taxes on out-of-state waste shipments compared to in-state shipments, reclassifying certain categories of hazardous waste as non-hazardous and regulating disposal facilities as public utilities. Certain states have issued regulations that attempt to prevent waste generated within a particular Compact from being sent to disposal sites outside that Compact. The U.S. Congress has also considered legislation that would enable or facilitate such bans, restrictions, taxes and regulations. Due to the complex nature of industry regulation, implementation of existing or future laws and regulations by different levels of government could be inconsistent and difficult to foresee. While we attempt to monitor and anticipate regulatory, political and legal developments that affect the industry, we cannot assure you we will be able to comply with such developments. Nor can we predict the extent to which legislation or regulations that may be enacted, or any failure of legislation or regulations to be enacted, may affect our operations in the future. 

The demand for certain hazardous and radioactive waste services we intend to provide is dependent in large part upon the existence and enforcement of federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations governing the discharge of those wastes into the environment. We and the industry as a whole could be adversely affected to the extent such laws or regulations are amended or repealed or their enforcement is lessened. 

Because of the high degree of public awareness of environmental issues, companies in the waste management business may be, in the normal course of their business, subject to judicial and administrative proceedings. Governmental agencies may seek to impose fines or revoke, deny renewal of, or modify any applicable operating permits or licenses. In addition, private parties and special interest groups could bring actions against us alleging, among other things, a violation of operating permits or opposition or challenges to current or new license authorizations.

REAL ESTATE MANAGEMENT AND DEVELOPMENT SEGMENT &#8212; BASIC MANAGEMENT, INC. AND THE LANDWELL COMPANY 

Business Overview 

We acquired a controlling interest in our Real Estate Management and Development Segment in December 2013. Prior to December 2013, we owned a 32% interest in BMI, which among other things provides utility services to an industrial park located in Henderson, Nevada, and is responsible for the delivery of water to the city of Henderson and various other users through a water distribution system owned by BMI. We also had a 12% interest in LandWell, which is actively engaged in efforts to develop certain real estate in Henderson, Nevada including approximately 2,100 acres zoned for residential/planned community purposes and approximately 400 acres zoned for commercial and light industrial use. BMI owns an additional 50% interest in LandWell. In December 2013 we completed the acquisition of an additional 31% ownership interest in BMI and 15% ownership interest in LandWell. We completed this acquisition to obtain control of BMI and LandWell (with the consent of BMI and LandWell and their other owners), which increased our direct ownership interest of BMI to 63% and our direct ownership of LandWell to 27%, which also resulted in our control of 77% of LandWell including the 50% ownership interest held by BMI. See Notes 3 and 7 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 

&#160;

&#160;

Operations and Services 

Over the years, LandWell and BMI have focused on developing and selling the land transferred to LandWell as part of its formation in the early 1950&#8217;s as well as additional land holdings acquired by LandWell in the surrounding area subsequent to LandWell&#8217;s formation (although BMI and LandWell have not had significant real property acquisitions since 2004). Since LandWell&#8217;s formation, LandWell and BMI have a history of successfully developing and selling over 1,200 acres of retail, light industrial, commercial and residential projects in the Henderson, Nevada area. However, a substantial portion of such projects, had been completed prior to the 2008 economic downturn which was particularly acute in the Las Vegas area real estate market which includes Henderson. Following such economic downturn, LandWell&#8217;s land sales were substantially reduced as compared to prior years, and LandWell did not recognize any material amount of land sales in the 2008 to 2013 time period. During this time period, LandWell focused primarily on the development of a large tract of land in Henderson zoned for residential/planned community purposes (approximately 2,100 acres). Planning and zoning work on such project began in 2007, but LandWell delayed significant development efforts until economic conditions had improved. As general economic conditions improved in 2011 and 2012, LandWell began intensive development efforts of the residential/planned community in 2013 (with LandWell acting as the master developer for all such development efforts). We market and sell our residential/planned community to established home builders in tracts of land that are pre-zoned for a maximum number of home lots. We support the builders efforts to market and sell specific residential homes within our residential/planned community through joint marketing campaign and community wide education efforts. 

In addition, BMI delivers utility services to an industrial park located in Henderson, Nevada and also delivers water to the city of Henderson and various other users through a water delivery system owned by BMI. 

Sales 

Through December 31, 2015, LandWell has closed or entered into escrow on approximately 410 acres of the residential/planned community and certain other acreage. Contracts for land sales are negotiated on an individual basis and sales terms and prices will vary based on such factors as location (including location within a planned community), expected development work and individual buyer needs. Although land may be under contract, we do not recognize revenue until we have satisfied the criteria for revenue recognition set forth in Accounting Standards Codification (&#8220;ASC&#8221;) Topic 976. In some instances, we will receive cash proceeds at the time the contract closes and record deferred revenue for some or all of the cash amount received, with such deferred revenue being recognized in subsequent periods. Because land held for development was initially recognized at estimated fair value at the acquisition date as required by ASC Topic 805, we do not expect to recognize significant operating income on land sales for the land currently under contract. We expect the development work to continue for 10 to 15 years on the rest of the land held for development, consisting primarily of the residential/planned community. 

Our Real Estate Management and Development Segment&#8217;s sales consist principally of land sales and water and electric delivery fees. During 2015 we had sales to four customers that each exceeded 10% of our net sales: Richmond Homes of Nevada (27%), LV East Gibson, LLC (17%) and Prologis, L.P. (11%) all relate to land sales; the City of Henderson (15%) relates to our water delivery services. 

Competition 

There are multiple new construction residential communities in the greater Las Vegas, Nevada area. We compete with these communities on the basis of location; planned community amenities and features; proximity to major retail and recreational activities; and the perception of quality of life within the new community. We believe our residential/planned community is unique within the greater Las Vegas area due to its location and planned amenities which include: 490 acres of major and neighborhood parks and open space interconnected with major regional trails and parks; and features that no other new construction residential community currently offers including builder floorplans designed exclusively for our community. We are marketing our residential/planned community to builders who target a range of home buyers to maximize sales. 

Regulatory and Environmental Matters 

We and the subcontractors we use must comply with many federal, state and local laws and regulations, including zoning, density and development requirements, building, environmental, advertising, labor and real estate sales rules and regulations. These regulations and requirements affect substantially all aspects of our land development. Our operations are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the use, storage, handling, generation, transportation, treatment, emission, discharge, disposal, remediation of and exposure to hazardous and non-hazardous substances, materials and wastes. Our operations also are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to worker health and safety. We believe we are in substantial compliance with all such laws and regulations. To date, the costs of maintaining compliance with such laws and regulations have not significantly impacted our results. We currently do not anticipate any significant costs or expenses relating to such matters; however, it is possible future laws and regulations may require us to incur significant additional expenditures.

OTHER 

NL Industries, Inc .&#8212; At December 31, 2015, NL owned 87% of CompX and 30% of Kronos. NL also owns 100% of EWI RE, Inc., an insurance brokerage and risk management services company and also holds certain marketable securities and other investments. See Note 16 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 

Tremont LLC &#8212; Tremont is primarily a holding company through which we hold our 63% ownership interest in BMI and our 77% ownership interest in LandWell. Such 77% ownership interest in LandWell includes 27% we hold through our ownership of Tremont and 50% held by a subsidiary of BMI. Tremont also owns 100% of Tall Pines Insurance Company, an insurance company that also holds certain marketable securities and other investments. See Note 16 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 

In addition, we also own real property related to certain of our former business units. 

Business Strategy &#8212;We routinely compare our liquidity requirements and alternative uses of capital against the estimated future cash flows to be received from our subsidiaries and unconsolidated affiliates, and the estimated sales value of those businesses. As a result, we have in the past, and may in the future, seek to raise additional capital, refinance or restructure indebtedness, repurchase indebtedness in the market or otherwise, modify our dividend policy, consider the sale of an interest in our subsidiaries, business units, marketable securities or other assets, or take a combination of these or other steps, to increase liquidity, reduce indebtedness and fund future activities, which have in the past and may in the future involve related companies. From time to time, we and our related entities consider restructuring ownership interests among our subsidiaries and related companies. We expect to continue this activity in the future. 

We and other entities that may be deemed to be controlled by or affiliated with Ms. Simmons and Ms. Connelly routinely evaluate acquisitions of interests in, or combinations with, companies, including related companies, we perceive to be undervalued in the marketplace. These companies may or may not be engaged in businesses related to our current businesses. In some instances we actively manage the businesses we acquire with a focus on maximizing return-on-investment through cost reductions, capital expenditures, improved operating efficiencies, selective marketing to address market niches, disposition of marginal operations, use of leverage and redeployment of capital to more productive assets. In other instances, we have disposed of our interest in a company prior to gaining control. We intend to consider such activities in the future and may, in connection with such activities, consider issuing additional equity securities and increasing our indebtedness. 

Website and Available Information &#8212;Our fiscal year ends December 31. We furnish our stockholders with annual reports containing audited financial statements. In addition, we file annual, quarterly and current reports, proxy and information statements and other information with the SEC.
