Reportable Segments 

We classify our businesses into the following three reportable segments: 

Mortgage Services : Provides services that span the mortgage and real estate lifecycle and are typically outsourced by loan servicers, loan originators, home investors and other sellers and buyers of single family homes. We provide most of these services primarily for loan portfolios serviced by Ocwen Financial Corporation and its subsidiaries (&#8220;Ocwen&#8221;). We also have longstanding relationships with commercial banks, insurance companies, mortgage bankers and other companies involved in the mortgage industry. Within the Mortgage Services segment, we provide the following services:

Through our recent acquisition of GoldenGator, LLC (doing business as RentRange), REIsmart, LLC (doing business as Investability) and Onit Solutions, LLC, a support company for RentRange and Investability (collectively, the &#8220;Acquired RentRange and Investability Businesses&#8221;), we provide rental home data and information to the financial services and real estate industries and an online residential real estate investor search and acquisition platform.

Corporate Items and Eliminations : Includes interest expense and costs related to corporate support functions including executive, finance, law, compliance, human resources, vendor management, risk and sales and marketing costs not allocated to the business units, and also includes eliminations of transactions between the reportable segments. Corporate Items and Eliminations also include the cost of certain facilities. 

We classify revenue in three categories: service revenue, revenue from reimbursable expenses and non-controlling interests. In evaluating our performance, we focus on service revenue. Service revenue consists of amounts attributable to our fee-based services. Reimbursable expenses and non-controlling interests are pass-through items for which we earn no margin. Reimbursable expenses consist of amounts we incur on behalf of our customers in performing our fee-based services, but we pass such costs directly on to our customers without any additional markup. Non-controlling interests represent the earnings of Lenders One, Wholesale One and Residential Investor One, consolidated entities not owned by Altisource, and are included in revenue and reduced from net income to arrive at net income attributable to Altisource. 

Customers 

Our customers include one of the largest servicers in the United States, a government-sponsored enterprise (&#8220;GSE&#8221;), utility companies, commercial banks, servicers, investors, non-bank originators and correspondent lenders, mortgage bankers and financial services companies. During 2015, we were selected by two top 10 banks to provide services for their portfolios in addition to several other key customer additions across our businesses as well in 2015. Our largest customer, Ocwen, accounted for 60% &#32;of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 . 

Revenue from Ocwen primarily consists of revenue earned directly from Ocwen and revenue earned from the loans serviced by Ocwen when Ocwen designates us as the service provider. Revenue from Ocwen as a percentage of segment and consolidated revenue was as follows for the years ended December 31:

For the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , we generated revenue from Ocwen of $631.6 million , $650.7 million &#32;and $499.3 million , respectively. Services provided to Ocwen during such periods and reported in the Mortgage Services segment included real estate asset management and sales, residential property valuation, trustee management services, property inspection, property preservation and insurance services. Services provided to Ocwen and reported in the Financial Services segment included mortgage charge-off collections. Services provided to Ocwen and reported in the Technology Services segment included IT infrastructure management and software applications including our software platforms. As of December 31, 2015 , accounts receivable from Ocwen totaled $38.2 million , $20.4 million &#32;of which was billed and $17.8 million &#32;of which was unbilled. 

We record revenue we earn from Ocwen under service agreements at rates we believe to be comparable market rates as we believe they are consistent with the fees we charge to other customers and/or fees charged by our competitors for comparable services. 

We earn additional revenue related to the portfolios serviced by Ocwen when a party other than Ocwen selects Altisource as the service provider. For the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , we recognized revenue of $216.9 million , $256.0 million &#32;and $161.9 million , respectively, related to the portfolios serviced by Ocwen when a party other than Ocwen selected Altisource as the service provider. These amounts are not included in deriving revenue from Ocwen as a percentage of revenue in the table above. 

Our services are provided to customers primarily located in the United States. Financial information for our segments can be found in Note 25 to our consolidated financial statements. 

Sales and Marketing 

We have experienced sales and marketing personnel and relationship managers with subject matter expertise. These individuals maintain relationships throughout the industry sectors we serve and play an important role in generating new client business as well as identifying opportunities to expand our services with existing clients. Additional opportunities are also generated through requests for proposal processes. 

Our primary sales and marketing focus is developing new relationships and expanding existing relationships and services provided to financial institutions, residential home investors and loan originators, correspondents and brokers including members of Lenders One and Wholesale One. We are also focused on attracting customers to Owners.com and Investability.com. Given the highly diverse nature of the industries we serve, the time and effort we spend in expanding relationships or winning new relationships is significant. 

Intellectual Property 

We rely on a combination of contractual restrictions, internal security practices, patents, trademarks and copyrights to establish and protect our trade secrets, intellectual property, software, technology and expertise. We also own or, as necessary and appropriate, have obtained licenses from third parties to intellectual property relating to our services, processes and businesses. These intellectual property rights are important factors in the success of our businesses. 

As of December 31, 2015 , we have been awarded one patent that expires in 2023, four patents that expire in 2024, seven patents that expire in 2025, two patents that expire in 2026, one patent that expires in 2029 and one patent that expires in 2030. In addition, we have registered trademarks, or recently filed applications for the registration of trademarks, in a number of jurisdictions including the United States, the European Union (&#8220;EU&#8221;), India and nine other jurisdictions. These trademarks generally can be renewed indefinitely, provided they are being used in commerce. 

We actively protect our rights and intend to continue our policy of taking all measures we deem reasonable and necessary to develop and protect our patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and other intellectual property rights. 

Industry and Competition 

The industry verticals in which we engage are highly competitive and generally consist of a few national companies as well as a large number of regional, local and in-house providers resulting in a fragmented market with disparate service offerings. Our Mortgage Services segment competes with national and regional third party service providers and in-house servicing operations of large mortgage lenders and servicers. We also compete with companies providing online real estate auction services and real estate brokerage firms. Our Financial Services segment competes with other large receivables management and customer care companies as well as a fragmented group of smaller companies and law firms focused on collections and customer care. Our Technology Services segment competes with data processing and software development companies and in-house technology and software operations of other loan servicers. 

Given the diverse nature of services we and our competitors offer, we cannot determine our position in the market with certainty, but we believe we represent only a small portion of very large markets. Given our size, some of our competitors may offer more diversified services, operate in broader geographic markets or have greater financial resources than we do. In addition, some of our larger customers retain multiple providers and continuously evaluate our performance against our competitors. 

Competitive factors in our Mortgage Services business include the compliance, quality and timeliness of our services, the size and competence of our network of vendors and the breadth of the services we offer. Competitive factors in our Financial Services business include the ability to achieve a collection rate comparable to our competitors; the compliance, quality, timeliness and personal nature of the service; the consistency and professionalism of the service; and the recruitment, training and retention of our workforce. Competitive factors in our Technology Services business include the quality of the technology-based applications or services; compliance; application features and functions; ease of delivery and integration; our ability to maintain, enhance and support the applications or services; our ability to recruit and retain software and other technical employees; and the cost of obtaining, maintaining and enforcing our patents.

We have not experienced any work stoppages and we consider our relations with employees to be good. We believe our future success will depend, in part, on our continuing ability to attract, hire and retain skilled and experienced personnel. 

Seasonality 

Certain of our revenues are seasonal. More specifically, Mortgage Services&#8217; revenue is impacted by REO sales and lawn maintenance, which tend to be at their lowest levels during fall and winter months and highest during spring and summer months. Financial Services&#8217; asset recovery management revenue tends to be higher in the first quarter, as borrowers may utilize tax refunds and bonuses to pay debts, and generally declines throughout the rest of the year. 

Government Regulation 

Our business and the business of our customers are subject to extensive scrutiny and regulation by federal, state and local governmental authorities including the Federal Trade Commission (&#8220;FTC&#8221;), the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (&#8220;CFPB&#8221;), the Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220;SEC&#8221;), the Department of Housing and Urban Development (&#8220;HUD&#8221;) and the state and local agencies that license or oversee certain of our auction, real estate brokerage, mortgage and debt collection services, trustee services and insurance services. We also must comply with a number of federal, state and local consumer protection laws including, among others, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (&#8220;GLBA&#8221;), the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (&#8220;FDCPA&#8221;), Unfair, Deceptive or Abusive Acts and Practices statutes (&#8220;UDAAP&#8221;), the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (&#8220;RESPA&#8221;), the Truth in Lending Act (&#8220;TILA&#8221;), the Fair Credit Reporting Act (&#8220;FCRA&#8221;), the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (&#8220;TCPA&#8221;), the Homeowners Protection Act (&#8220;HPA&#8221;), the California Homeowner Bill of Rights (&#8220;CHBR&#8221;), the Fair Housing Act and the Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing (&#8220;SAFE&#8221;) Act. We are also subject to the requirements of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (&#8220;FCPA&#8221;) and comparable foreign laws, due to our activities in foreign jurisdictions. 

Requirements can and do change as statutes and regulations are enacted, promulgated or amended. One such enacted regulation is the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (&#8220;Dodd-Frank Act&#8221;). The Dodd-Frank Act is extensive and includes reform of the regulation and supervision of financial institutions, as well as the regulation of derivatives, capital market activities and consumer financial services. The Dodd-Frank Act, among other things, created the CFPB, a federal entity responsible for regulating consumer financial services and products. Title XIV of the Dodd-Frank Act contains the Mortgage Reform and Anti-Predatory Lending Act (&#8220;Mortgage Act&#8221;). The Mortgage Act imposes a number of additional requirements on lenders and servicers of residential mortgage loans by amending and expanding certain existing regulations. Our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject the Company to significant penalties, fines, settlements, costs and consent orders affecting us or our customers that may curtail or restrict the business as it is currently conducted and could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. 

We are subject to licensing and regulation as a provider of certain services including, among others, services as a mortgage origination underwriter, valuation provider, appraisal management company, asset manager, property manager, title insurance agent, insurance broker and underwriter, real estate broker, auctioneer, foreclosure trustee and debt collector in a number of states. Our employees and subsidiaries may be required to be licensed by various state commissions for the particular type of service sold and to participate in regular continuing education programs. Periodically, we are subject to audits and examinations by federal, state and local governmental authorities and receive subpoenas, civil investigative demands or other requests for information from such governmental authorities in connection with their regulatory or investigative authority. We are currently responding to such inquiries from governmental authorities relating to certain aspects of our business. We believe it is premature to predict the potential outcome or to estimate any potential financial impact in connection with these inquiries.
