Company Background 

Intuitive designs, manufactures and markets da Vinci &#32;Surgical Systems and related instruments and accessories, which taken together, are advanced surgical systems that we consider an advanced generation of surgery. This advanced generation of surgery, which we call da Vinci &#32;surgery, combines the benefits of minimally invasive surgery (&#8220;MIS&#8221;) for patients with the ease of use, precision and dexterity of open surgery. A da Vinci &#32;Surgical System consists of a surgeon&#8217;s console, a patient-side cart, and a high performance vision system. The da Vinci &#32;Surgical System translates a surgeon&#8217;s natural hand movements, which are performed on instrument controls at a console, into corresponding micro-movements of instruments positioned inside the patient through small incisions, or ports. The da Vinci &#32;Surgical System is designed to provide its operating surgeons with intuitive control, range of motion, fine tissue manipulation capability and Three Dimensional (&#8220;3-D&#8221;), High-Definition (&#8220;HD&#8221;) vision while simultaneously allowing surgeons to work through the small ports enabled by MIS procedures. 

da Vinci &#32; Surgery 

da Vinci &#32;Surgery utilizes computational, robotic and imaging technologies to enable improved patient outcomes compared to other surgical and non-surgical therapies. da Vinci &#32;Surgery is aimed towards advancing the critical surgical ideals of entering the body less invasively, seeing anatomy more clearly, interacting with tissue more precisely and building surgical skills. The da Vinci &#32;Surgical System enables surgeons to avail or improve the benefits of MIS to many patients who would otherwise undergo a more invasive surgery. Surgeons using the da Vinci &#32;system operate while seated comfortably at a console viewing a 3-D, HD image of the surgical field. This immersive visualization connects surgeons to the surgical field and their instruments. While seated at the console, the surgeon manipulates instrument controls in a natural manner, similar to the more intuitive open surgery technique. Our technology is designed to provide surgeons with a range of motion in the surgical field analogous to the motions of a human 

wrist, while filtering out the tremor inherent in a surgeon&#8217;s hand. In designing our products, we focus on making our technology easy to use. 

Our systems provide the following features and benefits to surgeons: 

Immersive 3-D Visualization. Our vision system includes a 3-D endoscope with two independent vision channels linked to two separate color monitors through sophisticated image processing electronics. The da Vinci &#32;Surgical System provides visualization of target anatomy with natural depth-of-field, enhanced contrast and magnification that is intended to facilitate accurate tissue identification and tissue layer differentiation. With our Firefly &#32;Fluorescence Imaging technology, surgeons can use specialized imaging hardware in combination with an injectable fluorescent dye to visualize vasculature, tissue perfusion, or biliary ducts beneath tissue surfaces in real-time. 

Precise and Tremor-Free Endoscope Control. Our imaging system also incorporates our proprietary Navigator &#32;camera control technology that allows the surgeon to easily change, move, zoom and rotate his or her field of vision. Surgeons can reposition the surgical camera quickly with foot controls or zoom in, out, up, down, left and right by moving their hands while maintaining a stable image. 

Intuitive Instrument Movements. &#32;&#32;Our technology is designed to transform the surgeon&#8217;s natural hand movements outside the body into corresponding micro-movements inside the patient&#8217;s body. For example, with the da Vinci &#32;Surgical System, a hand movement to the right outside the body causes the instrument inside the patient to be moved to the right. In contrast, conventional MIS instruments are long rigid levers that rotate around a fulcrum, or pivot point, located at the port created in the body wall. In conventional MIS, the instrument tip moves in the opposite direction from the surgeon&#8217;s hand and surgeons must adjust their hand-eye coordination to translate their hand movements in this &#8220;backward&#8221; environment. 

EndoWrist Instruments. &#32;&#32;Our technology is designed to provide surgeons with a range of motion in the surgical field analogous to the motions of a human hand and wrist. Most of our proprietary instruments, which we call EndoWrist &#32;instruments, incorporate &#8220;wrist&#8221; joints that enable surgeons to reach behind tissues and suture with precision, just as they can in open surgery. 

Scaled, Tremor Filtered Instrument Movement. &#32;&#32;With our technology, the surgeon can also use &#8220;motion scaling,&#8221; a feature that translates, for example, a three-millimeter hand movement outside the patient&#8217;s body into a one-millimeter instrument movement in the surgical field inside the patient&#8217;s body. Motion scaling is designed to allow precision and control for delicate tasks. In addition, our technology filters the tremor inherent in a surgeon&#8217;s hands. 

Improved Surgeon Ergonomics. The da Vinci &#32;Surgical System is designed to allow surgeons to operate while seated, which may be clinically advantageous because of reduced surgeon fatigue. The da Vinci &#32;Surgical System&#8217;s design provides natural hand-eye alignment at the surgeon&#8217;s console. Because the da Vinci &#32;Surgical System&#8217;s robotic arms hold the camera and instruments steady, there is less surgeon and assistant fatigue. 

Multi-Specialty Surgical Platform. &#32;&#32;The da Vinci &#32;Surgical System is designed to enable surgeons to perform a wide range of surgical procedures, within our targeted gynecologic, urologic, general surgery, cardiothoracic and head and neck specialties. To date, surgeons have used the da Vinci &#32;Surgical System to perform dozens of different types of surgical procedures. While we do not expect all of these different types of procedures to become widely adopted, they demonstrate the flexibility of the da Vinci &#32;Surgical System in approaching anatomy. 

Advanced Training Tools. Surgeons can efficiently train and improve their da Vinci &#32;Surgery skills with a group of tools unique to robotic surgery, including our da Vinci &#32;Skills Simulator for software based skills practice and assessment, our da Vinci &#32;dual console for inter-operative collaboration, and our da Vinci Connect networking technology &#32; for on-line proctoring. 

Products: 

da Vinci Surgical System 

We have commercialized four generations of the da Vinci &#32;Surgical System&#8212; the da Vinci Xi &#32;Surgical System, the da Vinci Si &#32;Surgical System, the da Vinci S &#32;Surgical System and the standard da Vinci &#32;Surgical System. da Vinci &#32;Surgical Systems are comprised of the following components: 

Surgeon&#8217;s Console . The da Vinci &#32;Surgical System allows surgeons to operate while comfortably seated at an ergonomic console viewing a 3-D image of the surgical field. The surgeon&#8217;s fingers grasp instrument controls below the display with the surgeon&#8217;s hands naturally positioned relative to his or her eyes. Using electronic hardware, software, algorithms and mechanics, our technology translates the surgeon&#8217;s hand movements into precise and corresponding real-time micro movements of the EndoWrist &#32;instruments positioned inside the patient. On our most current systems, da Vinci Xi and &#32;da Vinci Si , a second surgeon&#8217;s console may be used in two possible ways: to provide assistance to the primary surgeon during surgery or to act as an active aid during surgeon-proctor training sessions. With the da Vinci Xi and &#32;da Vinci Si , a surgeon sitting at a second console can view the same surgery as the primary surgeon and can be passed control of some or all of 

the da Vinci &#32;instruments during the surgery. In addition, surgeons can control 3-D virtual pointers to augment the dual surgeon experience. 

Patient-Side Cart . The patient-side cart holds electromechanical arms that manipulate the instruments inside the patient. Up to four arms attached to the cart can be positioned as appropriate, and then locked into place. At least two arms hold our EndoWrist &#32;instruments, one representing the surgeon&#8217;s left hand and one representing the surgeon&#8217;s right hand. A third arm positions the endoscope, allowing the surgeon to easily move, zoom and rotate his or her field of vision. An optional fourth instrument arm extends surgical capabilities by enabling the surgeon to add a third EndoWrist &#32;instrument to perform additional tasks. The fourth instrument arm is a standard integrated feature on the da Vinci Xi, Si, and &#32;S &#32;Surgical Systems and is available as an upgrade on three-arm da Vinci S &#32;Surgical Systems and da Vinci Si-e &#32;Surgical Systems. 

3-D Vision System. &#32;&#32;Our vision system includes our InSite &#32;3-D endoscope with two separate vision channels linked to two separate color monitors through high performance video cameras and specialized image processing hardware. The resulting 3-D image has high resolution, high contrast, low flicker, and low cross fading. A digital zoom feature in the 3-D, HD vision system allows surgeons to magnify the surgical field of view without adjusting the endoscope position and thereby reduces interference between the endoscope and instruments. The 3-D, HD vision is a standard integrated feature on da Vinci Xi, Si, &#32;and S &#32;Surgical Systems. 

da Vinci Skills Simulator . The Skills Simulator is a practice tool that gives a user the opportunity to practice his or her facility with the surgeon console controls. The Skills Simulator incorporates 3-D, physics-based computer simulation technology to immerse the user within a virtual environment. The user navigates through the environment and completes exercises by controlling virtual instruments from the surgeon console. Upon completion of a skills exercise, the Skills Simulator provides a quantitative assessment of user performance based on a variety of task-specific metrics. The Skills Simulator is intended to augment, not replace, existing training programs for the da Vinci Xi and Si &#32;Surgical Systems. Most da Vinci &#32;Skills Simulators have been sold in connection with our da Vinci Xi and &#32;Si &#32;Surgical Systems. 

Firefly Fluorescence Imaging . Firefly &#32;is a standard feature of the da Vinci Xi Surgical System and available on our da Vinci Si &#32;Surgical System. This imaging capability combines a fluorescent dye with a specialized da Vinci &#32;camera head, endoscope and laser-based illuminator to allow surgeons to identify vasculature, tissue perfusion, or biliary ducts in three dimensions beneath tissue surfaces to visualize critical anatomy. Adoption of Firefly &#32;is progressing with use across the categories of urology, gynecology and general surgery. 

In September 2013, we received 510(k) clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the &#8220;FDA&#8221;) to market our Firefly &#32;fluorescence imaging product for real-time imaging of bile ducts (cystic duct, common bile duct, and common hepatic duct). We believe that the use of Firefly during cholecystectomy procedures will enhance the ability of surgeons to identify key anatomical structures during the surgery. 

Standard da Vinci System. During 2014, we phased out the sale of all instrument, accessory and service contract offerings for the standard da Vinci Surgical &#32; System. 

Instruments and Accessories 

EndoWrist Instruments . We manufacture a variety of instruments, most of which incorporate wrist joints for natural dexterity, with tips customized for various surgical procedures. EndoWrist &#32;instruments are offered in a variety of sizes, of which 5mm and 8mm diameter sizes are the most commonly sold. At their tips, the various EndoWrist &#32;instruments include forceps, scissors, electrocautery, scalpels, and other surgical tools that are familiar to the surgeon from open surgery and conventional MIS. A variety of EndoWrist &#32;instruments are selected and used interchangeably during a surgery. Our EndoWrist &#32;instruments are sterilizable and most are reusable for a defined number of procedures. A programmed memory chip inside each instrument performs several functions that help determine how the da Vinci &#32;system and instruments work together. In addition, the chip will not allow the instrument to be used for more than the prescribed number of procedures to help ensure that its performance meets specifications during each procedure. We typically develop new types of EndoWrist &#32;instruments to support additional types of surgical procedures. 

da Vinci Single-Site. da Vinci Single-Site &#32;is a set of non-wristed instruments (except for wristed needle driver discussed below) and accessories that allow Surgical Systems to work through a single incision, typically in the umbilicus, rather than multiple incisions. Single incision surgery is intended to minimize trauma to patients by reducing the number of ports required to enter the body and is typically utilized for less complex surgery than multi-port surgery. Non-robotic single incision surgery today is typically performed with modified laparoscopic instruments. Early clinical adoption of this manual technique has been mostly positive; however, physicians have reported that manual single incision surgery is technically and ergonomically challenging. da Vinci Single-Site &#32;instruments and accessories were designed to address these issues. 

In September 2014, we received FDA clearance to market the wristed version of our Single-Site &#32;needle driver product for use on benign hysterectomy, cholecystectomy, and salpingo-oophorectomy procedures. We believe this instrument may have particular utility in benign hysterectomy procedures. However, as these are our initial products targeted towards 

procedures already highly penetrated by manual MIS techniques, we are not able to predict the extent or pace that da Vinci &#32; Single-Site may be adopted. 

EndoWrist One Vessel Sealer . The EndoWrist One &#32;Vessel Sealer is a wristed, single-use instrument intended for bipolar coagulation and mechanical transection of vessels up to 7 mm in diameter and tissue bundles that fit in the jaws of the instrument. This instrument enables surgeons to fully control vessel sealing, while providing the benefits of da Vinci &#32;surgery. This instrument is designed to enhance surgical efficiency and autonomy in a variety of general surgery and gynecologic procedures. 

EndoWrist Stapler 45 Instrument . The EndoWrist Stapler 45 is a wristed, stapling instrument intended for resection, transection and/or creation of anastomoses in general, gynecologic and urologic surgery. This instrument enables operators to precisely position and fire the stapler. Its initial surgical use has been directed towards colorectal and thoracic procedures. 

Accessory Products . We sell various accessory products which are used in conjunction with the da Vinci &#32;Surgical System as surgical procedures are performed. Accessory products include sterile drapes used to ensure a sterile field during surgery, vision products such as replacement 3-D stereo endoscopes, camera heads, light guides, and other items that facilitate use of the system. 

Business Strategy 

Our objective is to bring the benefits of MIS to as many patients as possible through the use of computer aided robotic technologies. Our priorities to accomplish this are as follows: 

1. 

Patient Value. &#32;&#32;We believe that the value of a surgical procedure to a patient can be defined as: Patient Value = Procedure Efficacy/Invasiveness . We define procedure efficacy &#32;as a measure of the success of the surgery in resolving the underlying disease and invasiveness &#32;as how disruptive and painful the treatment is itself. When the patient value of a da Vinci &#32;procedure is deemed higher than alternate treatment options, patients may seek out surgeons and hospitals that offer that specific da Vinci &#32;procedure, potentially resulting in a local market share shift for the specific treatment. da Vinci &#32;procedure adoption occurs procedure by procedure, and is driven by the relative patient value and total treatment costs of da Vinci &#32;procedures compared to alternative treatment options for the same disease state. We believe most patients will place higher value on procedures that are not only more efficacious, but also less invasive than alternative treatments. Our goal is to provide products to surgeons who in turn provide patients with procedure options that are both highly effective and less invasive than other surgical options. 

2. 

Surgeon Value. &#32;&#32;We train surgeons on the use of our da Vinci &#32;Surgical System and assist them in building their practices by their delivery of high patient value. We provide an ergonomic platform for surgeons to perform their procedures. We seek to provide surgeons with reliable and easy to use products. 

3. 

Hospital Value. &#32;&#32;We assist hospitals in building value by offering patient value using da Vinci products, &#32; thereby increasing surgical revenue and reducing costs through lower complication rates and reduced length of patient stay. We believe da Vinci Surgery is a cost effective approach to many surgeries as compared to alternative treatment options, as recognized in many published studies. 

Given the priorities above, our strategy is to improve our target surgical procedures in one or more of the following ways: 

1. 

Convert Target Open Procedures to da Vinci &#32;S urgery. &#32;&#32;We believe that our technology has the potential to convert a significant percentage of our targeted open procedures to da Vinci &#32;Surgery. 

2. 

Facilitate Difficult MIS Operations. &#32;&#32;We believe that several surgical procedures that are seldom performed today using conventional MIS techniques can be performed more routinely using da Vinci Surgery. Some procedures have been adopted using MIS techniques but are extremely difficult and are currently performed by a limited number of highly skilled surgeons. We believe our da Vinci &#32;Surgical System will enable more surgeons at more institutions to perform such procedures. 

3. 

Offer a Less Invasive Single Port Surgical Option. &#160; We believe that our da Vinci &#32; Single Site &#32;technology has the potential to convert target procedures typically performed via multiport laparoscopic technique to single port da Vinci &#32;Surgery, offering patients less invasive, improved cosmetic outcomes. 

Clinical Applications 

We are the beneficiaries of productive collaborations with leading surgeons in exploring and developing new techniques and applications for da Vinci &#32;Surgery&#8212;an important part of our creative process. We primarily focus our development efforts on those procedures in which we believe our products bring the highest patient value, surgeon value, and hospital value. We currently focus on five surgical specialties: gynecologic surgery, urologic surgery, general surgery, cardiothoracic surgery, and head and neck surgery. Key procedures which we are focused on include da Vinci &#32;Prostatectomy (&#8220;dVP&#8221;), da Vinci &#32;Hysterectomy (&#8220;dVH&#8221;), hernia repair, da Vinci &#32;Cholecystectomy, da Vinci &#32;Colon and Rectal procedures, da Vinci &#32;Partial Nephrectomy, da Vinci &#32;Sacrocolpopexy, da Vinci &#32;Mitral Valve Repair, da Vinci &#32;Lobectomy, and da Vinci &#32;Transoral Robotic Surgery. In 2015 , total U.S. procedure volume 

was approximately 499,000 , of which 20% was in urology, 48% was in gynecology, and 28% was in general surgery. Procedure volume from our market outside of the U.S. was approximately 153,000 &#32;in 2015 , of which most procedures were in urology. Representative surgical applications are described below. 

Gynecologic Surgery 

Hysterectomy. &#32;&#32;Removal of the uterus is one of the most commonly performed surgeries in gynecology and is performed for a variety of underlying benign and malignant conditions. Hysterectomies can be performed using open surgery (laparotomy), or MIS techniques, which include vaginal, laparoscopic, and robotic approaches. Prior to the clearance of da Vinci &#32;surgery for gynecology in 2005, the majority of hysterectomies performed were open surgeries. We believe that da Vinci &#32;Surgery provides a large number of women the opportunity to receive a minimally invasive treatment as an alternative to an open hysterectomy, as we estimate that nearly 80% of hysterectomies are performed with a MIS technique. During the first quarter of 2013, Single-Site &#32;instruments received FDA approval in the U.S. for use in benign hysterectomies and salpingo oophorectomies. In September 2014, we received FDA clearance to market the wristed version of our Single-Site &#32;needle driver product for use on benign hysterectomy, cholecystectomy, and salpingo-oophorectomy procedures. Single-Site &#32;instruments enable surgeons to perform surgery through a single port via the patient&#8217;s belly button, allowing for virtually scarless results. 

Sacrocolpopexy. &#32;&#32;The abdominal (open) sacrocolpopexy is one of the most successful operations for vaginal vault prolapse. Sacrocolpopexy involves suturing a synthetic mesh that connects and supports the vagina to the sacrum (tailbone). A sacrocolpopexy can be performed using conventional laparoscopic technique; however, it is generally described as difficult and cumbersome to perform. Surgeons have reported that the da Vinci &#32;Surgical System&#8217;s capabilities may enable a large number of these procedures to be performed through a minimally invasive technique, conferring the benefits of MIS to a broader range of sacrocolpopexy patients. 

Urologic Surgery 

Prostatectomy. &#32;&#32;Radical prostatectomy is the removal of the prostate gland in patients diagnosed with clinically localized prostate cancer. The standard approach to removal of the prostate has been via an open surgical procedure. The conventional laparoscopic approach is an option, but is difficult and poses challenges to even the most skilled urologist. The da Vinci &#32;Surgical System has enabled a large number of surgeons to convert from using an open surgical technique to a minimally invasive technique. 

Partial Nephrectomy. &#32;&#32;Partial nephrectomy is the removal of a small portion of a kidney (typically, an area of the kidney containing a tumor). Partial nephrectomies are most commonly performed in patients diagnosed with clinically localized renal cancer. Excluding da Vinci surgery, there are three common surgical approaches to performing partial nephrectomies: open surgical technique, laparoscopy, and hand assisted laparoscopy, which is a hybrid of open and laparoscopic technique. Surgeons have reported that the da Vinci &#32;Surgical System&#8217;s capabilities may enable a large number of these procedures to be performed through a minimally invasive technique, conferring the benefits of MIS to a broader range of partial nephrectomy patients. Treatment guidelines for patients with localized renal cancer recommend partial nephrectomy due to the benefits nephron-sparing surgery has in long-term patient outcomes. Published clinical literature has shown that the presence of a da Vinci Surgical System is associated with a higher-proportion of patients receiving guideline-recommended partial nephrectomy. 

General Surgery 

Colorectal Surgery. &#32;&#32;These procedures typically involve benign or cancerous conditions of the lower digestive system, in particular the rectum or colon. Common procedures in this area include hemicolectomy, sigmoidectomy, low anterior resection, and abdominoperineal resection. Conventional laparoscopy is not widely employed to treat these types of diseases, due to their high degree of difficulty. Surgeons have reported that the use of the da Vinci &#32;Surgery System and our recently launched technologies, such as the da Vinci Xi Surgical System, EndoWrist Stapler , and EndoWrist Vessel Sealer, have enabled them to offer MIS approaches to a broader range of colorectal surgery patients. 

Hernia Repair. &#32;&#32;A hernia occurs when an organ or fatty tissue squeezes through a weak spot in a surrounding muscle or connective fascia tissue. During a hernia repair surgery, the weakened abdominal wall tissue is secured and defects are repaired. Common types of hernia are ventral and inguinal. Ventral, or abdominal hernia, may occur through a scar after surgery in the abdomen. Inguinal hernia is a bulge in the groin and is more common in men. Hernia repair can be performed using traditional open surgery or MIS. There is a wide-range of complexity in hernia repair surgeries and the benefits of minimally invasive and robotic surgery varies by patient. 

Cholecystectomy. &#32;&#32;Cholecystectomy, or the surgical removal of the gall bladder, is a commonly performed general surgery procedure. Cholecystectomy is the primary method for the treatment of gallstones and other gall bladder diseases. Most cholecystectomies are performed using multi-port MIS techniques, although some surgeons choose to perform cholecystectomy using manual single-port instrumentation. Using da Vinci &#32; Single-Site &#32;instruments, many of the technical challenges of manual single-port MIS are reduced as surgeons benefit from additional precision, control, and improved ergonomics. Multi-port da Vinci &#32;techniques are also being used for certain cases, and Firefly technology can be used to visualize biliary anatomy in three dimensions beneath tissue surfaces during Single-Site &#32;and multi-port da Vinci &#32;cholecystectomies. 

Bariatric Surgery . A body of literature has emerged pointing to the benefit of surgery to treat patients for morbid obesity and its secondary effects, such as diabetes. Sleeve gastrectomy and roux-en-Y gastric bypass (&#8220;RYGB&#8221;) are the most commonly performed surgical procedures for morbid obesity in the U.S. The body habitus of morbidly obese patients can make laparoscopic surgery physically challenging for the surgeon, and certain surgeons have found value in using the da Vinci &#32;Surgical System to improve upon the ergonomics when performing minimally-invasive surgery in morbidly obese patients. In addition, RYGB can be a technically challenging procedure because of the suturing, stapling, and tissue (bowel) manipulation that is required. Surgeons using the da Vinci &#32;Surgical System have reported a reduction in a critical complication (anastomotic leaks) relative to laparoscopic RYGB. 

Cardiothoracic Surgery 

Mitral Valve Repair. &#32;&#32;When patients are diagnosed with mitral valve disease, there are typically two surgical treatment options from which they can choose: mitral valve replacement or mitral valve repair. Mitral valve repairs are generally preferred over mitral valve replacement for a number of reasons, which include longevity and durability of the repaired valve over a replacement valve and the elimination or reduction of the patient&#8217;s post-surgical pharmaceutical regimen. Because mitral valve repairs are considered to be more technically challenging than mitral valve replacements, they are only performed approximately 50% of the time. Several of our surgeon customers have reported an improvement in their mitral valve repair rates over mitral valve replacements when using the da Vinci Surgical System. 

Thoracic Surgery. &#32;&#32;Conventional approaches to surgical procedures in the thorax include both open and video-assisted thoracoscopic approaches. Procedures performed via these methods include pulmonary wedge resection, pulmonary lobectomy, thymectomy, mediastinal mass excision, and esophagectomy. Many thoracic procedures remain open procedures. Surgeons have reported that the use of the da Vinci &#32;Surgery System in thoracic surgery has enabled them to offer MIS approaches to a broader range of thoracic surgery patients and improved clinical outcomes compared to open and video-assisted thoracic surgery in published single-center, multi-center and national database clinical studies. 

Head and Neck Surgery 

Transoral Surgery. &#32;&#32;Head and neck cancers are typically treated by either surgical resection or chemo-radiation, or a combination of both. Surgical resection performed by an open approach may require a &#8220;jaw-splitting&#8221; mandibulotomy. This procedure, while effective in treating cancer, is potentially traumatic and disfiguring to the patient. MIS approaches via the mouth (transoral surgery) are challenged by line-of-sight limitations dictated by conventional endoscopic tools. Chemo-radiation as a primary therapy does allow patients to avoid traumatic surgical incisions; however, literature suggests that this modality diminishes patients&#8217; ability to speak and swallow normally. Surgeons have reported that da Vinci &#32;Transoral Surgery allows them to treat cancers occurring in the oropharynx (e.g., tonsil and base of tongue) and larynx via the mouth and to overcome some of the line-of-sight limitations of conventional transoral surgery. 

Procedure Mix 

Our procedure business is broadly split into two categories: (1) cancer and other highly complex procedures and (2) less complex benign procedures. Our strategy is to provide hospitals with attractive clinical and economic solutions in each of these categories. More fully featured products targeted towards the more complex procedure segment include 4-arm, dual console, Firefly &#32;enabled systems and advanced instruments including the EndoWrist One &#32;Vessel Sealer and the EndoWrist &#32;stapler. Lower priced products targeted towards the less complex segment of procedures include the three-arm da Vinci Si-e &#32;System and lower priced Single-Site &#32;instruments. 

Clinical Summary 

We believe there are numerous additional applications that can be addressed with the da Vinci &#32;Surgical System and we work closely with our surgeon customers to refine and explore new techniques in which da Vinci &#32;may bring value. As of December 31, 2015 , we had an installed base of 3,597 &#32; da Vinci &#32;Surgical Systems, including 2,399 &#32;in the U.S., 608 &#32;in Europe, 423 &#32;in Asia, and 167 &#32;in the rest of the world. We estimate that surgeons using our technology completed approximately 652,000 &#32;surgical procedures of various types in hospitals throughout the world during the year ended December 31, 2015 . Of those da Vinci &#32;procedures performed in 2015 , we estimate that approximately 211,000 &#32;were dVH procedures and approximately 145,000 &#32;were dVP procedures. 

Sales and Customer Support 

Sales Model 

We provide our products through a direct sales organization in the U.S.; most of Western Europe excluding Spain, Portugal, Italy and Greece; and Japan and South Korea. In the remainder of our world markets, we provide our products through distributors. No one customer accounted for more than 10% of revenue during the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 . During the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 , domestic revenue accounted for 71% , 70% , and 72% , respectively, of total revenue, while revenue outside of the U.S. (&#8220;OUS&#8221;) accounted for 29% , 30% , and 28% , respectively. As of December 31, 2015 , and 2014 , 88% &#32;and 93% &#32;of all long-lived assets were in the United States. 

Our direct sales organization is composed of a capital sales team, responsible for selling da Vinci &#32;Surgical Systems, and a clinical sales team, responsible for supporting da Vinci &#32;Surgical System use in surgical procedures performed at our hospital accounts. Our hospital accounts include both individual hospitals and health care facilities and hospitals and health care facilities that are part of an integrated delivery network (&#8220;IDN groups&#8221;). The initial da Vinci &#32;Surgical System sale into an account as a major capital equipment purchase by our customers that typically has a lengthy sales cycle that can be affected by macroeconomic factors, capital spending prioritization, and the timing of budgeting cycles. Capital sales activities include educating surgeons and hospital staff across multiple surgical specialties on the benefits of da Vinci &#32;Surgery, total treatment costs, and the clinical applications that our technology enables. We also train our sales organization to educate hospital management on the potential benefits of adopting our technology, including clinical benefits of da Vinci &#32;Surgery, reductions in complications and length of stay, and the resulting potential for increased patient satisfaction, surgeon recruitment, and volume. 

Our clinical sales team works on site at the hospitals, interacting with surgeons, operating room staff, and hospital administrators to develop and sustain successful robotics surgery programs. They assist the hospital in identifying surgeons who have an interest in robotic surgery delivering da Vinci&#8217;s benefits. Our clinical sales team provides the current clinical information on robotic surgery practices and new product applications to the hospital teams and has grown with the expanded installed base of da Vinci Surgical &#32; Systems and the total number of procedures performed. We expect this organization to continue to grow as our business expands. 

Our customers place orders to replenish their supplies of instruments and accessories on a regular basis. Orders received are typically shipped within one business day. Direct customers who purchase a new da Vinci &#32;Surgical System typically place an initial stocking order of instruments and accessories within one month of receiving their system. 

Our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations. Historically, our sales of da Vinci &#32;Surgical Systems have tended to be heaviest during the third month of each fiscal quarter, lighter in the first and third fiscal quarters and heavier in the fourth fiscal quarter. In addition, we have historically experienced lower procedure volume in the first and third fiscal quarters and higher procedure volume in the second and fourth fiscal quarter. Procedures treating benign conditions are typically higher in the fourth quarter and lower in the first quarter. Timing of procedures and changes in procedure volume impact the timing of instrument and accessory and capital purchases. 

Customer Support and Training Programs 

We have a network of field service engineers across the U.S., Europe, and Asia and maintain relationships with various distributors around the globe. This infrastructure of service and support specialists offers a full complement of services, including 24/7 support, installation, repair, and maintenance for our customers. We generate service revenue by providing these services to our customers through comprehensive service contracts and time and material programs. 

We provide basic system training that teaches the fundamental operating principles of the da Vinci Surgical System to surgeons, surgical assistants, and operating room nurses. We have established training centers where initial system training and ongoing surgical procedural training are provided, the latter led by expert surgeons. Surgeons may also practice their robotic surgery technique using our da Vinci Skills Simulator. In addition, we help facilitate the proctoring of surgeons who are new to da Vinci Surgery by experienced da Vinci Surgical System users. Proctors provide training to other surgeons on how to perform certain surgical procedures with da Vinci Surgical Systems. 

Research and Development 

We focus our research and development efforts on providing our customers with new products and product improvements that enable them to perform MIS procedures with less difficulty. We employ research and development and engineering staff responsible for product design and engineering. We invested $197.4 million , $178.0 million , and $167.7 million &#32;of research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 , respectively. 

We establish strategic alliances with other medical device and technology based companies to complement our research and development effort. To date, these alliances have taken several forms, including cooperation in the areas of product development, training, procedure development, and marketing activities. We have formed alliances with several companies, including, but not limited to, Erbe Elektromedizin GmbH, Johnson &#38; Johnson, Olympus Corporation, Novadaq Technologies, Inc., Mimic Technologies, Inc., Schoelly Fiberoptic GmbH, and Trumph Medical (a division of Hill-Rom Holdings, Inc.). 

Manufacturing 

We manufacture our da Vinci &#32;Surgical Systems at our facility in Sunnyvale, California. We manufacture our instruments at our Sunnyvale facility and our Mexicali, Mexico facility. 

We purchase both custom and off-the-shelf components from a large number of suppliers and subject them to stringent quality specifications and processes. Some of the components necessary for the assembly of our products are currently provided to us by sole-sourced suppliers (the only recognized supply source available to us) or single-sourced suppliers (the only approved supply source for us among other sources). We purchase the majority of our components and major assemblies through purchase orders rather than long-term supply agreements and generally do not maintain large volumes of finished goods. 

Competition 

We consider our primary competition to be existing open surgery, conventional MIS, drug therapies, radiation treatment, and emerging interventional surgical approaches. Our success depends on continued clinical and technical innovation, quality and reliability as well as educating hospitals, surgeons and patients on the demonstrated results associated with da Vinci &#32;Surgery and its value relative to other techniques. We also face competition from several companies that are developing new approaches and products for the MIS market. We believe that many companies are focused on adding capability to manual MIS systems. Because many of these developments are aimed at MIS, we believe that our da Vinci &#32;Surgical System may prove complementary to some of these new technologies. 

Moreover, as we add new robotically controlled products (e.g. Single-Site , EndoWrist &#32;stapler, and Vessel Sealer) that compete with product offerings traditionally within the domains of open surgery and/or conventional MIS, we face greater competition from larger and well established companies such as Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc. 

Furthermore, as da Vinci use increases, a number of companies may be compelled to enter the field of robotic surgery. The following companies introduced products in the field of robotic surgery or have made explicit statements about their efforts to enter the field: Auris Surgical Robotics, Inc., Cambridge Medical Robotics Ltd, IMRIS Inc., Johnson &#38; Johnson and Google Inc. and their joint venture, Verb Surgical Inc., MedRobotics Corp., meerecompany Inc., Medtronic PLC, Olympus Corp., Samsung Corporation, TransEnterix Inc., and Titan Medical Inc. Companies with substantial experience in industrial robotics could potentially expand into the field of surgical robotics and become a competitor. In addition, research efforts utilizing computers and robotics in surgery are underway at various companies and research institutions. Our revenues may be adversely impacted as our competitors announce their intent to enter our markets and as our customers anticipate the availability of competing products. 

Intellectual Property 

We place considerable importance on obtaining and maintaining patent, copyright and trade secret protection for significant new technologies, products, and processes. 

We generally rely upon a combination of intellectual property laws, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions, to protect our proprietary technology. For example, we have trademarks, both registered and unregistered, that provide distinctive identification of our products in the marketplace. We also have exclusive and non-exclusive patent licenses with various third parties to supplement our own large and robust patent portfolio. 

As of December 31, 2015 , we held ownership or exclusive field-of-use licenses for more than 2,100 U.S. and foreign patents and more than 1,500 U.S. and foreign patent applications. We intend to continue filing new patent applications in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions to seek protection for our technology. 

Patents are granted for finite terms and eventually expire. Upon expiration, the inventions claimed in a patent enter the public domain. While our patents are an important element of our success, our business as a whole is not significantly dependent on any one patent. 

Government Regulation 

Our products and operations are subject to regulation by the FDA, the State of California and countries or regions in which we market our products. In addition, our products must meet the requirements of a large and growing body of international standards which govern the design, manufacture, materials content and sourcing, testing, certification, packaging, installation, use and disposal of our products. We must continually keep abreast of these standards and requirements and integrate compliance to these with the development and regulatory documentation for our products. Failure to meet these standards could limit the ability to market our products in those regions which require compliance to such standards. Examples of groups of such standards are electrical safety standards such as those of the International Electrotechnical Commission (e.g. IEC 60601-ss series of standards) and composition standards such as the Reduction of Hazardous Substances (&#8220;RoHS&#8221;) and Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (&#8220;WEEE&#8221;) Directives. 

United States 

The FDA regulates the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, promotion, marketing, distribution, and service of medical devices in the U.S. to ensure that medical products distributed domestically are safe and effective for their intended uses. In addition, the FDA regulates the export of medical devices manufactured in the U.S. to markets outside of the U.S. and the importation of medical devices manufactured abroad. 

Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (&#8220;FFDCA&#8221;), medical devices are classified into one of three classes&#8212;Class I, Class II or Class III&#8212;depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of control needed to ensure safety and effectiveness. Our current products are Class II medical devices. 

Class II devices are those which are subject to general controls and most require premarket demonstration of adherence to certain performance standards or other special controls, as specified by the FDA, and clearance by the FDA. Premarket review and clearance by the FDA for these devices is accomplished through the 510(k) premarket notification process. Unless a Class II device is exempt from premarket review, the manufacturer must submit to the FDA a premarket notification submission demonstrating that the device is &#8220;substantially equivalent&#8221; in intended use and technology to a &#8220;predicate device&#8221; that is either: 

1. 

a device that has grandfather marketing status because it was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976, the date upon which the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 were enacted, or 

2. 

a device that has previously been cleared through the 510(k) process. 

If the FDA agrees that the device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device, it will grant clearance to commercially market the device in the U.S. The FDA has a statutory 90-day period to respond to a 510(k) submission, or a guidance-based 30-day period for &#8220;special&#8221; 510(k) submissions which have a more restrictive scope and generally involve more specific or very limited changes to a legally marketed device. As a practical matter, clearance often takes longer. The FDA may require further information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence. If the FDA determines that the device, or its intended use, is not &#8220;substantially equivalent,&#8221; the FDA may deny the request for clearance. Although unlikely for the types of products marketed by us, the FDA may classify the device, or the particular use of the device, into Class III, and the device sponsor must then fulfill more rigorous pre-market approval (&#8220;PMA&#8221;) requirements. A PMA application, which is intended to demonstrate that a device is safe and effective, must be supported by extensive data, including data from preclinical studies and human clinical trials. The FDA, by statute and regulation, has 180 days to review a PMA application, though the review more often occurs over a significantly longer period of time, and can take up to several years. In approving a PMA application or clearing a 510(k) submission, the FDA may also require some form of post-market surveillance when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device. In such cases, the manufacturer might be required to follow certain patient groups for a number of years and makes periodic reports to the FDA on the clinical status of those patients. 

After a device receives FDA 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, requires a new 510(k) clearance or could require a PMA application approval. The FDA requires each manufacturer to make the determination of whether a modification requires a new 510(k) notification or PMA application in the first instance, but the FDA can review any such decision. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer&#8217;s decision not to seek a new 510(k) clearance or PMA approval for a particular change, the FDA may retroactively require the manufacturer to seek 510(k) clearance or PMA approval. The FDA also can require the manufacturer to cease U.S. marketing and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or PMA approval is obtained. 

In addition, after a device is placed on the market, numerous FDA and other regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include establishment registration and device listing with the FDA; compliance with medical device reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur; and compliance with corrections and removal reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FFDCA that may present a risk to health. The FDA and the Federal Trade Commission (&#8220;FTC&#8221;) also regulate the advertising and promotion of our products to ensure that the claims we make are consistent with our regulatory clearances, that there is scientific data to substantiate the claims and that our advertising is neither false nor misleading. In general, we may not promote or advertise our products for uses not within the scope of our intended use statement in our clearances or make unsupported safety and effectiveness claims. Many regulatory jurisdictions outside of the U.S. have similar regulations to which we are subject. 

Our manufacturing processes are required to comply with the FDA&#8217;s Good Manufacturing Practice (&#8220;GMP&#8221;) requirements contained in its Quality System Regulation (&#8220;QSR&#8221;) and associated regulations and guidance. The QSR covers, among other things, the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the design, manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage, installation, and servicing of all medical devices intended for human use. The QSR also requires maintenance of extensive records which demonstrate compliance with FDA regulation, the manufacturer&#8217;s own procedures, specifications and testing as well as distribution and post-market experience. Compliance with the QSR is necessary to receive FDA clearance or approval to market 

new products and is necessary for a manufacturer to be able to continue to market cleared or approved product offerings in the U.S. A company&#8217;s facilities, records, and manufacturing processes are subject to periodic scheduled or unscheduled inspections by the FDA, which may issue reports known as Forms FDA 483 or Notices of Inspectional Observations which list instances where the FDA inspector believes the manufacturer has failed to comply with applicable regulations and/or procedures. If the observations are sufficiently serious or the manufacturer fails to respond appropriately, the FDA may issue Warning Letters, or Untitled Letters, which are notices of potential enforcement actions against the manufacturer. If a Warning Letter or Untitled Letter is not addressed to the satisfaction of the FDA, or if the FDA becomes aware of any other serious issue with a manufacturer&#8217;s products or facilities, it could result in fines, injunctions, civil penalties, delays, suspension or withdrawal of clearances, seizures or recalls of products, operating restrictions, total shutdown of production facilities, prohibition on export or import and criminal prosecution. Such actions may have further indirect consequences for the manufacturer outside of the U.S., and may adversely affect the reputation of the manufacturer and the product. In the U.S., routine FDA inspections usually occur every two years, and may occur more often for cause. 

To a greater or lesser extent, most other countries require some form of quality system and regulatory compliance, which may include periodic inspections, inspections by third party auditors, and specialized documentation. Failure to meet all the requirements of these countries could jeopardize our ability to import, market, support and receive reimbursement for the use of our products in these countries. 

In addition to the above, we may seek to conduct clinical research on products that have not yet been cleared or approved for particular indications in clinical studies or trials in the U.S. or other countries. Additional regulations govern the approval, initiation, conduct, documentation and reporting of clinical studies to regulatory agencies in the countries or regions in which they are conducted. Such investigational use is generally also regulated by local and institutional requirements and policies which usually include review by an ethics committee or institutional review board (&#8220;IRB&#8221;). Failure to comply with all regulations governing such studies could subject the company to significant enforcement actions and sanctions, including halting of the study, seizure of investigational devices or data, sanctions against investigators, civil or criminal penalties, and other actions. Without the data from one or more clinical studies, it may not be possible for us to secure the data necessary to support certain regulatory submissions, to secure reimbursement or demonstrate other requirements. We cannot assure that access to clinical investigators, sites and subjects, documentation and data will be available on the terms and timeframes necessary. 

Products manufactured outside the U.S. by or for us are subject to U.S. Customs and FDA inspection upon entry into the U.S. We must demonstrate compliance of such products to U.S. regulations and carefully document the eventual distribution or re-exportation of such products. Failure to comply with all applicable regulations could prevent us from having access to products or components critical to the manufacture of finished products and lead to shortages and delays. 

&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;California Regulation 

The State of California requires that we obtain a license to manufacture medical devices and until 2012 conducted periodic inspections of medical device manufacturers. Our facilities and manufacturing processes were last inspected in July 2011 and were found to be in compliance. In accordance with the State of California regulations, the license to manufacture is renewed annually with any updated manufacturing information. Although the State of California has announced suspension of routine periodic inspections, there can be no assurance the State of California will not resume such inspections or conduct such inspections under specific circumstances which are not yet known. 

Foreign Regulation 

In order for us to market our products in other countries, we must obtain regulatory approvals and comply with extensive product and quality system regulations in other countries. These regulations, including the requirements for approvals or clearance and the time required for regulatory review, vary from country to country. Some countries have regulatory review processes which are substantially longer than U.S. processes. Failure to obtain regulatory approval in a timely manner and to meet all local requirements including language and specific safety standards in any foreign country in which we plan to market our products could prevent us from marketing products in such countries or subject us to sanctions and fines. 

To be sold in Japan, most medical devices must undergo thorough safety examinations and demonstrate medical efficacy before they receive regulatory (&#8220;Shonin&#8221;) approval. We obtained from the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare (&#8220;MHLW&#8221;) approval for our da Vinci Si &#32;Surgical Systems in October 2012 and approval for our da Vinci Xi &#32;Surgical Systems in March 2015. Effective April 2012, we obtained national reimbursement for dVP procedures in Japan, our only reimbursed procedure to date. We are currently seeking reimbursement for additional procedures through the MHLW&#8217;s Senshin Iryo processes as well as alternative reimbursement processes. Our Senshin Iryo approvals require in-country clinical data and are considered for reimbursed status in April of even numbered years. 

Commercialization of medical devices in Europe is regulated by the European Union (&#8220;EU&#8221;). The EU presently requires that all medical products bear the Conformit&#233; Europ&#233;enne (&#8220;CE&#8221;) mark, for compliance with the Medical Device Directive (93/42/EEC) as amended. The CE mark is an international symbol of adherence to certain essential principles of safety and performance 

mandated in applicable European medical device directives, which once affixed, enables a product to be sold in member countries of the EU and those affiliated countries which accept the CE mark. The CE mark is also recognized in many countries outside of the EU, such as Australia, and can assist in the clearance process. In order to affix the CE mark on products, a recognized European Notified Body must certify a manufacturer&#8217;s quality system and design dossier for compliance with international and European requirements. We have received authorization from DGM Denmark A/S, a recognized European Notified Body and part of Nemko Presafe A/S, to affix the CE mark to our da Vinci &#32;Surgical System and EndoWrist &#32;instruments and accessories. To maintain authorization to apply the CE mark, we are subject to annual surveillance audits and periodic re-certification audits. In September 2013, the European Commission adopted a recommendation indicating that all Notified Bodies, including DGM, should carry out unannounced audits, at least once every third year, of the manufacturers whose medical devices they have certified. These unannounced audits can also extend to the manufacturer&#8217;s critical suppliers or sub-contractors (those that supply a critical input or perform a critical function for the manufacturer). 

If we modify our existing products or develop new products in the future, we may need to apply for authorization to affix the CE mark to such products. We do not know whether we will be able to obtain authorization to affix the CE mark for new or modified products or whether we will continue to meet the safety and performance standards required to maintain the authorizations we have already received. If we are unable to maintain authorizations to affix the CE mark to our products, we will no longer be able to sell our products in member countries of the EU or those whose marketing authorizations are based on the CE Mark. 

Regulations in other countries, including the requirements for approvals or clearance and the time required for regulatory review, vary from country to country. Certain countries have their own regulatory agencies, such as China and South Korea. These countries typically require regulatory approvals and compliance with extensive safety and quality system regulations. Failure to obtain regulatory approval in any foreign country in which we plan to market our products, or failure to comply with any regulation in any foreign country in which we market our products, may negatively impact our ability to generate revenue and harm our business. Our system sales into China are also dependent on obtaining importation authorizations and hospitals completing the central purchasing tender under the authorization, the most recent of which expired at the end of 2015. In addition, local regulations may apply which govern the use of our products and which could have an adverse effect on our product utilization if they are unfavorable. All such regulations are revised from time to time and in general are increasing in complexity, and in the scope and degree of documentation and testing required. There can be no assurance the outcomes from such documentation and testing will be acceptable to any particular regulatory agency or will continue to be acceptable over time. There are further regulations governing the importation, marketing, sale, distribution, use and service as well as the removal and disposal of medical devices. Failure to comply with any of these regulations could result in sanctions, fines and prevent us from marketing our products in these regions. 

Other Healthcare Laws 

We are also subject to federal and state healthcare laws and regulations pertaining to fraud and abuse, physician payment transparency and privacy and security laws and regulations. These laws include: 

&#8226; 

the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act; 

&#8226; 

federal false claims laws which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid or other federal third-party payors that are false or fraudulent; 

&#8226; 

the federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law, which prohibits, among other things, offering or transferring remuneration to a federal healthcare beneficiary that a person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary&#8217;s decision to order or receive items or services reimbursable by the government from a particular provider or supplier; 

&#8226; 

federal criminal laws that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any federal healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters; 

&#8226; 

the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, which governs the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protects the security and privacy of protected health information; 

&#8226; 

the federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, which requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children&#8217;s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually to CMS information related to payments or other &#8220;transfers of value&#8221; made to 

physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, and requires applicable manufacturers and group purchasing organizations to report annually to CMS ownership and investment interests held by the physicians described above and their immediate family members and payments or other &#8220;transfers of value&#8221; to such physician owners. Manufacturers are required to submit reports to CMS by the 90th day of each calendar year; and 

&#8226; 

analogous state and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers; state laws that require device companies to comply with the industry&#8217;s voluntary compliance guidelines and the applicable compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state laws that require device manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. 

If our operations are found to violate any of the laws described above or any other laws and regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, the exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to market our products and materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management&#8217;s attention from the operation of our business. 

Third-Party Coverage and Reimbursement 

In the U.S. and most markets outside of the U.S. (&#8220;OUS&#8221;) where we sell our products, the government and health insurance companies together are responsible for hospital and surgeon reimbursement for virtually all covered surgical procedures. Governments and insurance companies generally reimburse hospitals and physicians for surgery when the procedure is considered medically necessary. In the U.S., the Centers for Medicare &#38; Medicaid Services (&#8220;CMS&#8221;) administer the Medicare and Medicaid programs (the latter, along with applicable State governments). Many other third-party payors model their reimbursement methodologies after the Medicare program. As the single largest payor, this program has a significant impact on other payors&#8217; payment systems. 

Generally, reimbursement for professional services performed at a facility by physicians is reported under billing codes issued by the American Medical Association (&#8220;AMA&#8221;), known as Current Procedural Terminology (&#8220;CPT&#8221;) codes. Physician reimbursement under Medicare generally is based on a fee schedule and determined by the relative values of the professional service rendered. In addition, CMS and the National Center for Health Statistics (&#8220;NCHS&#8221;) are jointly responsible for overseeing changes and modifications to billing codes used by hospitals to report inpatient procedures, known as ICD-9-CM procedural codes prior to October 1, 2015, and ICD-10-PCS codes on and after October 1, 2015. For Medicare, CMS generally reimburses hospitals for services provided during an inpatient stay based on a prospective payment system that is determined by a classification system known as Medicare-Severity Diagnostic Related Groupings (&#8220;MS-DRGs&#8221;). MS-DRGs are assigned using a number of factors including the principal diagnosis, major procedures, discharged status, patient age and complicating secondary diagnoses among other things. Hospital outpatient services, reported by CPT codes, are assigned to clinically relevant Ambulatory Payment Classifications (&#8220;APCs&#8221;) used to determine the payment amount for services provided. 

On October 1, 2008, CMS and NCHS issued a new family of ICD-9-CM procedure codes for &#8220;Robotically Assisted Procedures.&#8221; Prior to October 1, 2015, for laparoscopic procedures completed with the da Vinci &#32;Surgical System, U.S. hospitals were expected to report the primary surgical procedure code, along with ICD-9-CM 17.42, to describe a laparoscopic robotic assisted procedure. The purpose of the ICD-9-CM family of procedure codes, 17.4X, was to gather data on robotic assisted surgical procedures. On and after October 1, 2015, a new family of ICD-10-PCS codes may be used-in conjunction with other applicable procedure codes-to describe various robotic assisted procedures. An inpatient surgical procedure, completed with or without robotic assistance, continues to be assigned to the clinically relevant MS-DRG. 

Governments and insurance companies carefully review and increasingly challenge the prices charged for medical products and surgical services. Reimbursement rates from private companies vary depending on the procedure performed, the third-party payor, contract terms, and other factors. Because both hospitals and physicians may receive the same reimbursement for their respective services, with or without robotics, regardless of actual costs incurred by the hospital or physician in furnishing the care, including for the specific products used in that procedure, hospitals and physicians may decide not to use our products if reimbursement amounts are insufficient to cover any additional costs incurred when purchasing our products. 

Domestic institutions typically bill for the primary surgical procedure that includes our products to various third-party payors, such as Medicare, Medicaid and other government programs and private insurance plans. Because our da Vinci &#32;Surgical System has been cleared for commercial distribution in the U.S. by the FDA, coverage and reimbursement by payors are generally 

determined by the medical necessity of the primary surgical procedure. We believe that the additional procedures we intend to pursue are established surgical procedures that are generally already reimbursable by government agencies and insurance companies for appropriately selected patients. If hospitals do not obtain sufficient reimbursement from third-party payors for procedures performed with our products, or if governmental and private payors&#8217; policies do not cover surgical procedures performed using our products, we may not be able to generate the revenues necessary to support our business. 

In countries outside the U.S., reimbursement is obtained from various sources, including governmental authorities, private health insurance plans, and labor unions. In most foreign countries, private insurance systems may also offer payments for some therapies. In addition, health maintenance organizations are emerging in certain European countries. To effectively conduct our business, we may need to seek OUS reimbursement approvals, and we do not know if these required approvals will be obtained in a timely manner or at all. In some countries, patients may be permitted to pay directly for surgical services; however, such &#8220;co-pay&#8221; practices are not common in most countries. 

In March 2010, the U.S. President signed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively, &#8220;the PPACA&#8221;), which makes changes that significantly impact healthcare providers, insurers, pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers. One of the principal aims of the PPACA is to expand health insurance coverage to Americans who are currently uninsured. The full consequences of the coverage expansions on the sales of our products are still unknown. The PPACA contains a number of provisions designed to generate the revenues necessary to fund this coverage expansion, including, but not limited to fees or taxes on certain health-related industries, including medical device manufacturers. For sales on or after January 1, 2013, medical device manufacturers were required to pay an excise tax (or sales tax) of 2.3% on certain U.S. medical device revenues. Under this provision, the Company has incurred an excise tax of approximately $17.0 million in 2015. The tax was included as a cost of revenue and a reduction of product gross profit margin. In December, 2015, President Obama signed into law the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 (the &#8220; Appropriations Act&#8221;). The Appropriations Act includes a two-year moratorium on the medical device excise tax such that medical device revenues in 2016 and 2017 will be exempt from the excise tax. Unless there is further legislative action during that two-year period, the tax will be automatically reinstated for sales of medical devices on or after January 1, 2018. 

The PPACA also has provisions to study the comparative effectiveness of health care treatments and strategies. It remains unclear how this research will influence future Medicare coverage and reimbursement decisions, as well as influence other third-party payor coverage and reimbursement policies. As Congress and state governments determine how to implement the PPACA, the full impact of the PPACA on the medical device industry and the sale of our products is currently unknown. The PPACA, as well as other federal or state health care reform measures that may be adopted in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our business. The taxes imposed by PPACA and the expansion in the government&#8217;s role in the U.S. healthcare industry may result in decreased profits, lower reimbursement from payors for procedures that use our products and/or reduced procedural volumes, all of which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the PPACA was enacted. On August 2, 2011, the U.S. President signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among other things, creates the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend proposals in spending reductions to Congress. The Joint Select Committee did not achieve a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, triggering the legislation&#8217;s automatic reduction to several government programs. This included aggregate reduction to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2025 unless additional Congressional action is taken. On January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers. The Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015, enacted on April 16, 2015 (&#8220;MACRA&#8221;), repealed the formula by which Medicare made annual payment adjustments to physicians and replaced the former formula with fixed annual updates and a new system of incentive payments scheduled to begin in 2019 that are based on various performance measures and physicians&#8217; participation in alternative payment models such as accountable care organizations.
