 Item 1. Business. 

Overview

We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of unique RNA-targeted therapeutics for the treatment of rare, infectious and other diseases. Applying our proprietary, highly-differentiated and innovative platform technologies, we are able to target a broad range of diseases and disorders through distinct RNA-targeted mechanisms of action. We are primarily focused on rapidly advancing the development of our potentially disease-modifying DMD drug candidates, including our lead DMD product candidate, eteplirsen, designed to skip exon 51. On August 25, 2015, we announced the FDA filing of our NDA for eteplirsen for the treatment of DMD amenable to exon 51 skipping. The FDA postponed the Advisory Committee meeting for the review of the eteplirsen NDA previously scheduled for January 22, 2016 due to severe weather. On February 8, 2016, we announced that the FDA notified us that the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (&#8220;PDUFA&#8221;) action date for eteplirsen has been extended to May 26, 2016 due to our submission of four-year clinical effectiveness data on January 8, 2016 to the FDA, which the FDA designated as a major amendments to the eteplirsen NDA. We are also developing therapeutics using our technology for the treatment of drug resistant bacteria and infectious, rare and other human diseases.

Objectives and Business Strategy

We believe that our highly-differentiated and proprietary RNA-targeted technology platforms can be used to develop novel pharmaceutical products to treat a broad range of diseases and address key unmet medical needs. We intend to leverage our RNA-targeted technology platforms, organizational capabilities and resources to become a leading developer and marketer of RNA-targeted therapeutics, including for the treatment of rare, infectious and other diseases, with a diversified portfolio of product candidates. In pursuit of this objective, we intend to engage in the following activities:

&#160;

&#183; 

advancing the development of eteplirsen and our other drug candidates for the treatment of DMD to realize the product opportunities of such candidates and potentially provide significant clinical benefits; 

&#160;

&#183; 

further explore funding, collaboration and other opportunities to support continued development of our rare, infectious and other research and development programs; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

leveraging our RNA-targeted technology platforms to identify product candidates in additional therapeutic areas and explore various strategic opportunities, including potential partnering, licensing or collaboration arrangements with industry partners. 

Development Programs

DMD. Our lead program, with a pipeline of ten product candidates, focuses on the development of disease-modifying therapeutic candidates for DMD, a rare genetic muscle-wasting disease caused by the absence of dystrophin, a protein necessary for muscle function. Currently, there are no approved disease-modifying therapies for DMD in the U.S. If we are successful in our development efforts, eteplirsen, our lead DMD product candidate, and our follow-on exon-skipping DMD candidates would address an unmet medical need. We are in the process of conducting several studies with eteplirsen and our follow-on DMD candidates including: 

Eteplirsen

&#160;

&#183; 

Study 4658-US-202 (&#8220;Study 202&#8221;) &#8211; an ongoing U.S. open label extension of our initial Phase IIb clinical trial which was completed in 2012, with over four and a half years of data collected as of February 2016 (inclusive of the primary study); 

&#160;

&#183; 

Study 4658-301/PROMOVI (&#8220;Study 301&#8221;) &#8211; a confirmatory U.S. study, started in 2014, with a treated arm evaluating the safety and efficacy of eteplirsen in ambulatory DMD patients amenable to exon-51-skipping and an untreated concurrent control arm with patients that are not amenable to exon-51-skipping; 

&#160;

&#183; 

Study 4658-204 (&#8220;Study 204&#8221;) &#8211; a U.S. study, started in 2014, evaluating the safety and tolerability of eteplirsen in patients with advanced stage DMD; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

Study 4658-203 (&#8220;Study 203&#8221;) &#8211; a U.S. study, started in 2015, evaluating the safety and tolerability of eteplirsen in patients with early stage DMD. 

Follow-on Exons

&#160;

&#183; 

Study 4053-101 (&#8220;SKIP-NMD&#8221;) &#8211; a European Union (&#8220;E.U.&#8221;) study we are conducting in collaboration with a consortium of scientific, clinical and industrial partners in the E.U. Part I of the study, started in 2014, is a dose titration, 

&#160;

placebo-controlled study, evaluating the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of SRP-4053. Part II of the study, started in 2015, evaluates the safety and efficacy of SRP-4053 in patients with DMD amenable to exon 53 skipping; 

&#160;

&#183; 

Study 4045-101 &#8211; a randomized, double&#8209;blind, placebo&#8209;controlled, dose&#8209;titration study in the U.S., started in 2015, evaluating the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of SRP&#8209;4045 in advanced&#8209;stage patients with DMD amenable to exon 45 skipping, followed by an open&#8209;label safety and efficacy evaluation. 

In addition, we are currently working towards starting a second confirmatory study to support eteplirsen approval in 2016, which will evaluate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates designed to skip exons 45 and 53. We have satisfactorily responded to the FDA&#8217;s inquiries on preclinical data for this study relating our exon-53 product candidate.

Infectious Diseases . 

Anti-virals. The antisense technology platform has been applied to the development of potential therapeutics for Ebola and Marburg hemorrhagic fever and pandemic H1N1 influenza viral infections. Though our original discovery and development contracts from the Department of Defense (&#8220;DoD&#8221;) are no longer active, we remain active partners with the National Institutes of Health (&#8220;NIH&#8221;) and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (&#8220;NIAID&#8221;) for continued development of our influenza product candidate. Following encouraging preclinical results, in February 2012, we announced Phase I results for the Ebola, Marburg and influenza product candidates which appeared to be well tolerated and showed no drug-associated safety findings in the human study subjects. All three product candidates use our PMOplus &#174; technology. We are open to partnership possibilities and other avenues to support further development of these Ebola, Marburg and influenza product candidates; however, if we do not succeed in these efforts, we will likely curtail their further development. 

Discovery and Research Programs

Our discovery and research programs include collaborations with various parties and focus on developing therapeutics in rare, genetic, anti-bacterial, neuromuscular and central nervous system diseases. We are exploring the application of our proprietary PMO platform technology in various diseases.

Proprietary Manufacturing Techniques

We believe we have developed proprietary state-of-the-art manufacturing and scale-up techniques that allow synthesis and purification of our product candidates to support clinical development as well as potential commercialization. We have entered into certain manufacturing and supply arrangements with third parties which will in part utilize these techniques to support production of certain of our product candidates and their components. We currently do not have any of our own internal mid-to-large scale manufacturing capabilities to support a clinical or commercial supply of our product candidates.

Lead Development Program: Pipeline of Exon-Skipping PMO Product Candidates for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy

DMD Background

DMD is one of the most common fatal genetic disorders affecting children (primarily boys) around the world. DMD is a devastating and incurable muscle-wasting disease associated with specific mutations in the gene that codes for dystrophin, a protein that plays a key structural role in muscle fiber function. The absence of dystrophin in muscle cells leads to significant cell damage and ultimately causes muscle cell death and fibrotic replacement. Females are rarely affected by the disorder. In the absence of dystrophin protein, affected individuals generally experience:

&#160;

&#183; 

muscle damage characterized by inflammation, fibrosis and loss of myofibers beginning at an early age; 

&#160;

&#183; 

muscle weakness and progressive loss of muscle function beginning in the first few years of life; 

&#160;

&#183; 

decline of ambulation and respiratory function after the age of seven; 

&#160;

&#183; 

total loss of ambulation in the pre-teenage or early teenage years; 

&#160;

&#183; 

progressive loss of upper extremity function during mid- to late-teens; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

respiratory and/or cardiac failure in their 20s to which they typically succumb. 

There is currently no approved disease modifying treatment or cure for DMD in the U.S. The yearly cost of care for individuals with DMD is high and increases with disease progression. Although DMD is a rare disease, we believe it represents a substantial product opportunity due to the severity and inexorable progression of the symptoms.

Eteplirsen . Eteplirsen, our lead DMD product candidate, is an antisense PMO therapeutic in Phase III clinical development for the treatment of individuals with DMD who have an error in the gene coding for dystrophin that is amenable to skipping exon 51. Eteplirsen targets the most frequent series of mutations that cause DMD. Eteplirsen has been granted orphan drug designation in the U.S. and E.U. In 2007, the FDA granted eteplirsen fast track status and we are continuing to discuss with the FDA the possibility of expedited regulatory programs for eteplirsen. 

For approximately four years, we have been collecting data on the safety and efficacy of eteplirsen through a Phase llb open label extension study, Study 202. In this study, biopsies were taken from patients at 48 weeks and, using different physicochemical methods on the tissue samples collected, we measured increases in novel dystrophin production. In July 2014, we announced that at 144 weeks (i) patients evaluable (n=10) on the 6-minute walk test (&#8220;6MWT&#8221;) showed a decline in walking ability at a rate slower than would be expected based on available DMD natural history data and (ii) a continued stabilization of respiratory muscle function was observed, as assessed by pulmonary function tests. In January 2015, we announced that at 168 weeks (i) continued ambulation across all patients evaluable on the 6MWT was observed, however, all patients showed a decline in distance walked on this measure since the week 144 time point, (ii) stability of respiratory muscle function was observed, as assessed by pulmonary function tests and (iii) good tolerability and no clinically significant treatment-related adverse events or serious adverse events were reported. In October 2015, we announced additional clinical efficacy and safety data that demonstrated that (i) eteplirsen provided a statistically significant advantage of 151 meters in the ability of study participants to walk at three years versus an external DMD control, (ii) eteplirsen-treated patients (n=12) experienced a slower rate of decline through week 192 than external DMD controls and (iii) the eteplirsen safety profile remained consistent with prior results. After approximately four years of treatment with eteplirsen, results of the 6MWT at 216 weeks showed continued ambulation of the 10 evaluable patients. In January 2016, we announced more than four years of data for 11 of the 13 external control patients that demonstrated 10 of the 11 patients lost ambulation, a statistically significant difference. Please read Item 7, Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8212; Summary and Timeline of Eteplirsen Data Disclosure included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information. 

On August 25, 2015, we announced the FDA&#8217;s filing of our NDA for eteplirsen for the treatment of DMD amenable to exon 51 skipping. Eteplirsen is under priority review with a current PDUFA action date of May 26, 2016. Please read Overview and Government Regulation for additional information.

&#160;

Additional DMD Product Candidates . In addition to our lead product candidate, eteplirsen, we are pursuing development of additional exon-skipping drugs, to support our broad-based development program for the treatment of DMD. Our additional nine product candidates target skipping of exons 8, 35, 43, 44, 45, 50, 52, 53 and 55 and are at various stages of development. 

Exon 53 . To support certain clinical proof of concept studies and investigational new drug (&#8220;IND&#8221;) -enabling activities for an exon 53-skipping therapeutic, we announced in November 2012 that we are collaborating in the SKIP-NMD Consortium with University College London&#8217;s scientist, Professor Francesco Muntoni, M.D., the Dubowitz Neuromuscular Centre, the Institute of Child Health and other scientists from the E.U. and the U.S. In connection with this collaboration, the Consortium received an E.U. Health Innovation-1 2012 collaborative research grant (grant agreement No. 305370) to support development of an exon 53-skipping therapeutic, based on our PMO chemistry. Targeting exon 53 with this technology will potentially address one of the most prevalent 

sets of mutations in DMD that are amenable to exon-skipping (eg. deletions of exons such as 42-52, 45-52, 47-52, 48-52, 49-52, 50-52, 52 or 54-58). We completed Part I and are currently conducting Part II of a Phase I/IIa clinical trial for an exon 53-skipping product candidate in the E.U. 

Exon 45 . In collaboration with Children&#8217;s National Medical Center (&#8220;CNMC&#8221;) in Washington, D.C. and the Carolinas Medical Center (&#8220;CMC&#8221;) in Charlotte, N.C., we have developed an exon 45-skipping product candidate. This collaboration is funded primarily through two grants, one from DoD&#8217;s Congressionally Directed Medical Research Program to CNMC and the other from the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke to the CMC. This funding is intended to pursue the most promising treatments for DMD. The collaboration has supported a series of Good Laboratory Practice (&#8220;GLP&#8221;) toxicology studies for an exon 45-skipping drug candidate based on our PMO chemistry. We have initiated and completed enrollment of a dose-ranging study for our exon 45-skipping product candidate in the U.S. (Study 4045-101). 

Additionally, we are also planning to initiate a placebo-controlled confirmatory study with product candidates designed to skip exons 45 and 53 (Study 4045-301).

Exons 8, 35, 43, 44, 50, 52 and 55 . Selection of lead sequences for product candidates designed to skip each of these exons are underway. Although we were previously collaborating with the NIH for the development of an exon 50 product candidate, we mutually agreed to terminate our Collaborative Research and Development Agreement in February 2013 and we are now developing an exon 50 skipping candidate utilizing our own research and development capabilities. 

Our DMD program is part of our larger pan-exon strategy for the development of drug candidates to address the most prevalent exon deletions in the DMD population. Because the majority of DMD patients have exon deletions that cluster together, a small number of exon-skipping therapies will potentially be disease-modifying for a relatively large percentage of DMD patients. Approximately 75-80% of the total DMD population is potentially treatable with exon-skipping therapeutics.

&#160;

Development Programs: Infectious Diseases

Our infectious diseases therapeutic programs continue to evolve, and remain based on our translation inhibition through steric hindrance technology. The applications to date have included our proprietary PMOplus&#174; chemistry for post-exposure and therapeutic medical countermeasures to hemorrhagic fever virus infections (including Ebola and Marburg viruses), and for pandemic and seasonal influenza A infection. The contracts funding the hemorrhagic fever virus programs have ended, and while we are no longer actively developing those products, we may consider a collaborative relationship in the future. We have an active partnership with the NIAID, an institute within the NIH, for ongoing clinical development of our influenza therapeutic candidate. 

&#160;

As previously reported, the Phase I human safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics single ascending dose trials of the drug candidates for Ebola, Marburg and pandemic influenza A, and the multiple ascending dose trial of the Marburg drug candidate have been completed. The Phase I single ascending and multiple ascending dose clinical trial of the pandemic influenza drug candidate has now also been completed, and data are being analyzed. 

&#160;

These programs were vital to informing us in all aspects of the clinical applications, chemistry and materials development of the proprietary PMOs. The funding received to support the research and development of these antiviral candidates from the U.S. government represented substantially all of our revenues during those funding periods. As of December 31, 2014, we had completed all development activities of our contracts with the U.S. government. In 2015, key animal efficacy and human safety and pharmacokinetic data were published in the New England Journal of Medicine , Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, mBio , Antiviral Research and by the American Society of Microbiology Journals, as well as presented at a number of national and international scientific and industry conferences. 

Discovery and Research Programs

Rare Diseases . We are researching the application of our proprietary peptide-conjugated PMO (&#8220;PPMO&#8221;) technology to regulate progerin protein in progeria patients and in other diseases. 

Anti-Bacterials . The rapid emergence of broad antibiotic resistance has underscored the urgent need for new paradigms in antimicrobial development. Our anti-bacterial program is focused on drug-resistant bacteria identified by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (&#8220;CDC&#8221;) as urgent or serious threats to the U.S. healthcare system. Early research findings demonstrate that targeted PPMOs can successfully inhibit translation of essential structural genes such as acyl carrier protein (&#8220;acpP&#8221;), resistance proteins such as the NDM-1 metallo-b-lactamase, or those responsible for biofilm formation, which is critical for Burkholderia cepacia complex to evade host immune responses or systemic antibiotics such as cysteine protease cepI., which is responsible for biofilm expression. Additionally, though acpP alone can be bactericidal at clinically achievable concentration, data demonstrates that 

co-administration of the PPMOs targeting NDM-1 can restore antibiotic activity of drugs like meropenem or imipenem to clinically achievable levels in high-level multidrug resistant Acinetobacter, E. coli, Klebsiella, and Burkholderia spp in both bench top and mouse models. Finally, we have also seen that PPMOs targeting structural genes such as acpP or quorum sensing genes such as cepI (responsible for biofilm expression) can penetrate and disrupt established biofilm; furthermore, the PPMOs targeting acpP can successfully kill the established bacterial colonies in Burkholderia cepacia models. We believe the results of this early research could have b road commercial applicability. We are exploring IND enabling studies now, and are open to partnership opportunities in the development of our anti-bacterial program. 

Proprietary Platform Technology

PMO . The original PMO structure and variations of this structure that are so-called PMO-based are central to our proprietary chemistry platform. PMO and PMO-based therapeutics have been safely dosed in over 400 patients. PMO and PMO-based compounds are synthetic compounds that bind to complementary sequences of RNA by standard Watson-Crick nucleobase pairing. When targeted to mRNA, PMO and PMO-based compounds downregulate protein translation by steric blockade. The two key structural differences between PMO/PMO-based compounds and naturally occurring RNA are that the PMO nucleobases are bound to synthetic morpholino rings instead of ribose rings, and the morpholino rings are linked by phosphorodiamidate groups instead of phosphodiester groups. Replacement of the negatively charged phosphodiester in RNA with the uncharged phosphorodiamidate group in PMO eliminates linkage ionization at physiological pH. Because of these modifications, PMO and PMO-based compounds are resistant to degradation by plasma and intracellular enzymes. Unlike the RNA-targeted technologies of siRNAs and DNA gapmers, PMO and PMO-based compounds operate by steric blockade rather than by cellular enzymatic degradation to achieve their biological effects. PMOs thus use a fundamentally different mechanism from these other RNA-targeted technologies. 

PMO technologies can be used to selectively up-regulate or down-regulate the production of a target protein through pre-mRNA splice alteration. This mechanism can be used to correct disease-causing genetic errors by inducing the targeted expression of novel proteins. Thus PMO and PMO-based compounds can be designed to create more, less, or none of certain proteins, or produce analogues of endogenous proteins. 

The safety of therapeutic agents is paramount. We believe that our PMO and PMO-based compounds significantly reduce potential for off-target effects specifically because of their demonstrated inactivity with key molecular mechanisms that are known to be toxicologically active when stimulated. Additionally, consistent with our research and development to date, we believe that PMO and PMO-based compounds do not exhibit coagulation and immune stimulatory effects, do not stimulate toll-like receptors (&#8220;TLRs&#8221;) or receptors of the RIG-I-like receptor family, and do not sequester metal ions away from the catalytic centers of polymerases.

In addition to our original PMO technology, we have also developed three new PMO-based chemistry platforms. We believe that the novel characteristics intrinsic to these new platforms will allow for the development of drug candidates with excellent safety and efficacy.

PPMO . The first of these novel chemistries is based on cell-penetrating PPMOs. Cellular uptake, potency, efficacy, and specificity of tissue targeting may be significantly enhanced. 

PMOplus &#174; . The second of these chemistries, PMO plus &#174; , features the selective introduction positive charges to the phosphorodiamidate backbone. We believe that PMO plus &#174; has potentially broad therapeutic applications, especially for anti-viral therapeutics. 

PMO-X &#174; . The third of these chemistries, PMO-X &#174; , incorporates novel and proprietary chemical modifications to the PMO internucleoside linkages. We believe PMO-X &#174; may provide enhanced in vivo potency and efficacy, as well as greater flexibility in the modulation of selective tissue targeting and cellular delivery. 

We believe that our PMO and PMO-based technology platforms can be used to develop novel pharmaceutical products to treat a broad range of diseases and address key unmet medical needs. We intend to leverage our PMO and PMO-based technology platforms, organizational capabilities, and resources to become a leading developer and marketer of a diversified portfolio of PMO and PMO-based therapeutics, especially for the treatment of rare and infectious diseases.

Material Agreements

We believe that our RNA-targeted technology could be broadly applicable for the potential development of pharmaceutical products in many therapeutic areas. To further exploit our core technologies, we have and may continue to enter into research, development or commercialization alliances with universities, hospitals, independent research centers, non-profit organizations, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and other entities for specific molecular targets or selected disease indications. We may 

also selectively pursue opportunities to access certain intellectual property rights that complement our internal portfolio through license agreements or other arrangements. 

University of Western Australia

In November 2008, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with the University of Western Australia (&#8220;UWA&#8221;), for certain patents and technical information relating to the use of certain antisense sequences for the treatment of DMD and in April 2013, we entered into an agreement with UWA under which this license agreement was amended and restated (&#8220;the Amended and Restated UWA License Agreement&#8221;). The Amended and Restated UWA License Agreement grants us specific rights to the treatment of DMD by inducing the skipping of certain exons. Our lead clinical candidate, eteplirsen, falls under the scope of the license granted under the Amended and Restated UWA License Agreement. Any future drug candidates developed for the treatment of DMD by exon skipping may or may not fall under the scope of the Amended and Restated UWA License Agreement.

Under the Amended and Restated UWA License Agreement, we are required to meet certain performance diligence obligations related to development and commercialization of products developed under the license. We believe we are currently in compliance with these obligations. In 2013, we made an initial up-front payment to UWA of $1.1 million upon execution of the Amended and Restated UWA License Agreement. We may be required to make additional payments to UWA of up to $6.0 million in aggregate based on successful achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones relating to eteplirsen and up to five additional product candidates and may also be required to pay a low-single-digit percentage royalty on net sales of products covered by issued patents licensed from UWA during the term of the Amended and Restated UWA License Agreement. As of December 31, 2015, we were not under any current obligation to make royalty payments to UWA until achievement of the first commercial sale. 

Additionally, the agreement offers us the option of purchasing royalties upfront. Under this option, we may be required to make to UWA an up-front payment of $30.0 million as well as $20.0 million in aggregate contingency payments upon the successful achievement of certain commercial milestones.

The terms of the Amended and Restated UWA License Agreement will expire on a country-by-country basis on the expiration date of the last to expire valid claim or patent within the patents licensed to us under this agreement or upon the earliest to occur of the following:

&#160;

&#183; 

failure by us or UWA to cure a breach or default of any material obligation we each have under the agreement after notice from the non-breaching party within the specified time periods; 

&#160;

&#183; 

a mutual agreement to terminate the agreement; 

&#160;

&#183; 

by UWA in the event a party passes a resolution to wind-up or if a receiver, administrator, trustee or person performing similar functions is appointed by a court or liquidator over any of our assets; or 

&#160;

&#183; 

upon our notice to UWA that we no longer desire to commercialize products covered under the agreement. 

Currently, the latest date on which an issued patent covered by our agreement with UWA expires is November 2030 (not accounting for any patent term extension, supplemental protection certificate or pediatric extensions that may be available), however, patents granting from pending patent applications could result in a later expiration date.

Strategic Alliances

Charley&#8217;s Fund Agreement

In October 2007, Charley&#8217;s Fund, Inc. (&#8220;Charley&#8217;s Fund&#8221;), a nonprofit organization that funds drug development and discovery initiatives specific to DMD, awarded us a research grant of approximately $2.5 million and, in May 2009, the grant authorization was increased to a total of $5.0 million. Pursuant to the related sponsored research agreement, the grant was provided to support the development of product candidates related to exon 50 skipping using our proprietary exon-skipping technologies. As of December 31, 2015, Charley&#8217;s Fund had made payments of approximately $3.4 million to us. Revenue associated with this research and development arrangement is recognized based on the proportional performance method. To date, we have recognized approximately $0.1 million as revenue. We have deferred $3.3 million of previous receipts which are anticipated to be recognized as revenue upon resolution of outstanding performance obligations.

Under the terms of the sponsored research agreement, as amended, if we and any of our strategic partners elect to discontinue the development and commercialization of any product containing any molecular candidate arising or derived from the research sponsored by Charley&#8217;s Fund for reasons other than safety or efficacy, we must grant to Charley&#8217;s Fund an exclusive, royalty-bearing, fully-paid, worldwide license, with right of sublicense, to any such product. Depending on whether and when Charley&#8217;s Fund obtains 

a license to any such product, percentage royalty payments on net sales required to be made by Charley&#8217;s Fund t o us under the terms of the sponsored research agreement, as amended, would be in the mid-single-digits. Under the terms of the sponsored research agreement, as amended, if we are able to successfully commercialize any molecular candidate arising or derive d from the research sponsored by Charley&#8217;s Fund either through sales of products or through licensing or partnership arrangements with a third party that include rights for such third party to sell, distribute, promote or market such products or the underl ying intellectual property, we are obligated to repay the research funds paid to us by Charley&#8217;s Fund, up to an amount equal to the total amount of funds provided by Charley&#8217;s Fund to us. In connection with this repayment obligation, we agreed that we woul d pay a mid-single-digit percentage royalty on net sales of products containing any molecular candidate arising or derived from the research sponsored by Charley&#8217;s Fund and a mid-teens amount of any up-front cash and/or milestone payments received from a l icensing or partnership arrangement with a third party with respect to such products (in each case, up to an amount equal to the total amount of funds provided by Charley&#8217;s Fund to us). This agreement will be terminated by its own terms at the completion o f the research being sponsored by Charley&#8217;s Fund. Our technology upon which the agreement is based is covered by certain patents, the last of which expires following the termination of the agreement. 

Previously, we noted unexpected toxicology findings in the kidney as part of our series of preclinical studies for AVI-5038, our PMO-based candidate designed for the treatment of individuals with DMD who have an error in the gene coding for dystrophin that can be treated by skipping exon 50. We have conducted additional preclinical studies and have not alleviated the toxicity problem. Pursuant to the terms of our agreement with Charley&#8217;s Fund, the receipt of additional funds is tied to the satisfaction of certain clinical milestones. Because of the toxicity issues with AVI-5038, satisfaction of the additional milestones under the agreement is unlikely and we do not expect to receive any additional funds from Charley&#8217;s Fund.

Manufacturing

We believe we have developed proprietary state-of-the-art manufacturing and scale-up techniques that allow synthesis and purification of our product candidates to support clinical development as well as potential commercialization. We have entered into certain manufacturing and supply arrangements with third-party suppliers which will in part utilize these techniques to support production of certain of our product candidates and their components. We currently do not have any of our own internal mid-to-large scale manufacturing capabilities to support our product candidates.

For our current development programs we have entered into supply agreements with certain large pharmaceutical manufacturing firms for the production of the custom raw materials required for PMO production and the APIs, for our product candidates.

For our DMD program, we are working with our existing manufacturers to increase our active pharmaceutical ingredient (&#8220;API&#8221;) production capacity from mid-scale to large-scale. During 2016, we will also evaluate whether to increase our API production capacity to a commercial scale. This decision will depend in significant part on our discussions with the FDA in 2016 as well as our expectations regarding clinical trial needs and the potential feasibility and timing of the commercialization of eteplirsen.

There are a limited number of companies that can produce raw materials and APIs in the quantities and with the quality and purity that we require for our DMD development efforts. Due to their technical expertise, experience in manufacturing our product candidates and sophistication of their manufacturing facilities and quality systems, we are considering our existing manufacturers, as well as other manufacturers with relevant expertise, for the further scale-up of the production of raw materials and APIs for our DMD program. Establishing a relationship with alternative suppliers can be a lengthy process and might cause delays in our development efforts. If we are required to seek alternative supply arrangements, the resulting delays and potential inability to find a suitable replacement could materially and adversely impact our business.

Manufacturers and suppliers of product candidates are subject to the FDA&#8217;s current Good Manufacturing Practices (&#8220;cGMP&#8221;), requirements, and other rules and regulations prescribed by foreign regulatory authorities. We depend on our third-party suppliers and manufacturers for continued compliance with cGMP requirements and applicable foreign standards.

Sales and Marketing Strategy

We have not obtained regulatory approval for any of our product candidates. Due to the rare nature of DMD and the lack of disease-modifying treatments, patients suffering from DMD, together with their physicians, often have a high degree of organization and are well informed, which may simplify the identification of a target population for eteplirsen, our lead product candidate, if it is approved. We believe that, if approved for commercial sale, it will be possible to commercialize eteplirsen with a relatively small specialty sales force that calls on the physicians, foundations and other patient-advocacy groups focused on DMD. Our current expectation is to commercialize eteplirsen ourselves in the U.S. and we continue to take steps to establish the necessary commercial infrastructure we believe is needed for a potential marketing approval of eteplirsen. We will continue to evaluate whether to market our DMD product candidates outside of the U.S. ourselves or enter into arrangements with other pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies for the marketing and sale of our products outside the U.S. either globally or on a country-by-country basis.

Patents and Proprietary Rights 

Our success depends in part upon our ability to protect our core technologies and intellectual property. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including patents, trade secrets, copyrights and trademarks, as well as regulatory exclusivity and contractual protections.

Our patents and patent applications are directed to our product candidates as well as to our PMO and PMO-based technology platforms. We seek patent protection for certain of our product candidates and proprietary technologies by filing patent applications in the U.S. and other countries. As of February 9, 2016, we owned or controlled approximately 380 U.S. and corresponding foreign patents and 349 U.S. and corresponding foreign patent applications. We intend to protect our proprietary technology with additional filings as appropriate.

Our product candidates and our technology are primarily protected by composition of matter and use patents and patent applications. Currently, our clinical product candidates include eteplirsen for DMD. We have exclusively licensed patents from the UWA that provide primary patent protection for eteplirsen as follows:

In addition to the foregoing patents that protect eteplirsen, we either solely own or exclusively license from UWA patents and patent applications in the U.S. and in major foreign markets that provide additional protection for eteplirsen as well as our DMD follow-on exon-skipping candidates (e.g., SRP-4045 and SRP-4053), which cover the composition of matter, preparation and/or uses of these drug candidates. These patents, and patent applications, if granted, expire between 2025 and 2034, such expiration dates not accounting for any patent term extension, supplemental protection certificate or pediatric extensions that may be available. 

We separately own patents and patent applications in the U.S. and in major foreign markets that cover our proprietary PMO and PMO-based technologies (e.g., PPMO, PMOplus&#174;, PMO-X&#174;). These patents, and patent applications, if granted, expire between 2024 and 2032, such expiration dates not accounting for any patent term extension, supplemental protection certificate or pediatric extensions that may be available. We are the owner of multiple federal trademark registrations in the United States including, but not limited to, Sarepta &#174; , Sarepta Therapeutics &#174; , PMO plus &#174; , PMO-X &#174; and the Sarepta Therapeutics logo. In addition, we have multiple pending trademark applications in the United States.

Our commercial success will depend in part on obtaining and maintaining patent protection and trade secret protection for our product candidates, and successfully defending these patents against third-party challenges. Our ability to protect our product candidates from unauthorized making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing by third parties is dependent on the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable patents that cover these activities.

We do not have patents or patent applications in every jurisdiction where there is a potential commercial market for our product candidates. For each of our programs, our decision to seek patent protection in specific foreign markets, in addition to the U.S. is based on many factors, including:

&#160;

&#183; 

our available resources; 

&#160;

&#183; 

the number and types of patents already filed or pending; 

&#160;

&#183; 

the likelihood of success of the product candidate; 

&#160;

&#183; 

the size of the commercial market; 

&#160;

&#183; 

the presence of a potential competitor in the market; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

whether the legal authorities in the market effectively enforce patent rights. 

We continually evaluate our patent portfolio and patent strategy and believe our owne d and licensed patents and patent applications provide us with a competitive advantage; however, if markets where we do not have patents or patent applications become commercially important, our business may be adversely affected. 

The patent positions of pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other life sciences companies can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions for which important legal principles remain unresolved. No consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed in biotechnology patents has emerged to date in the U.S. and tests used for determining the patentability of patent claims in all technologies are in flux. In addition, there is no assurance as to the degree and range of protections any of our patents, if issued, may afford us or whether patents will be issued. Patents which may be issued to us may be subjected to further governmental review that may ultimately result in the reduction of their scope of protection, and pending patent applications may have their requested breadth of protection significantly limited before being issued, if issued at all. For example, we are aware of certain claims that our competitor BioMarin has rights to in the United States that, if granted, may provide the basis for BioMarin or other parties that have rights to these claims to assert that our drug candidates, eteplirsen and/or SRP-4053, infringe on such claims. In 2014, the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (&#8220;PTAB&#8221;) of the USPTO declared various patent interferences between certain patents held by Sarepta under a license from the UWA and patent applications held by BioMarin under license from Academisch Ziekenhuis Leiden (&#8220;AZL&#8221;) related to exon 51 and exon 53 skipping therapies designed to treat DMD. Patents held or licensed to Sarepta and included in these interference proceedings are presumed valid by statute for the duration of these proceedings and any appeals. These interferences have not changed our plans to submit an NDA for eteplirsen, continue with our clinical development plans for eteplirsen and SRP-4053 or our ability to launch eteplirsen commercially if it is approved by the FDA under an accelerated approval pathway, however, if final resolution of these interferences and related appeals, if any, are not in our favor, our current business, development and commercialization plans for eteplirsen and SRP-4053 may be negatively impacted. For details on and risks related to the interferences that PTAB has declared involving our patents, please read Risk Factors&#8212; Risks Relating to Our Business&#8212;Our success, competitive position and future revenue, if any, depend in part on our ability and the abilities of our licensors to obtain and maintain patent protection for our product candidates, to preserve our trade secrets, to prevent third parties from infringing on our proprietary rights and to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of third parties. 

The pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other life sciences patent situation outside the U.S. can be even more uncertain. For example, BioMarin has rights to European Patent No. EP 1619249. We opposed this patent in the Opposition Division of the European Patent Office (&#8220;Opposition Division&#8221;), and in November 2011, we announced that, although we succeeded in invalidating some of the patent&#8217;s claims, the Opposition Division maintained in amended form certain claims of this patent relating to the treatment of DMD by skipping dystrophin exons 51 and 46. We and BioMarin both appealed this decision in June 2013; however, pending final resolution of this matter, the patent at issue may provide the basis for BioMarin or other parties that have rights to such patent in the relevant European country to assert that our drug candidate, eteplirsen, infringes on such patent upon launching eteplirsen in such relevant European country. The outcome of the appeal cannot be predicted or determined as of the date of this report. If as part of any appeal before the European Patent Office we are unsuccessful in invalidating BioMarin&#8217;s claims that were maintained by the Opposition Division or if claims previously invalidated by the Opposition Division are restored on appeal, our ability to commercialize both eteplirsen and other therapeutic candidates, such as SRP-4045 and SRP-4053 could be materially impaired. Moreover, our ability to commercialize eteplirsen in a European country where BioMarin has a patent related to EP 1619249 while the appeal process remains ongoing before the European Patent Office Board of Appeals could be materially impaired. In addition, we are aware of various divisional applications relating to EP 1619249 that are being pursued by BioMarin, which are pending and in some cases are proceeding to grant. Should any patents grant from these applications, our ability to commercialize eteplirsen or our other therapeutic candidates, such as SRP-4045 and SRP-4053, could be materially impaired. 

In addition to government, court and regulatory patent decisions, changes in either the patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the U.S. and other countries may diminish the value of our intellectual property. Accordingly, we cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced in the patents that we own or have licensed or in third-party patents. Further, since publication of discoveries in scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries, there is no assurance that we were the first creator of inventions covered by our pending patent applications, or that we were the first to file patent applications for these inventions.

Government Regulation

The testing, manufacturing, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, exportation and marketing of our products are subject to extensive regulation by governmental authorities in the U.S. and in other countries. In the U.S., the FDA, under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and its implementing regulations, regulates pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject us to administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending NDAs, withdrawal of approval of approved products, warning letters, untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, civil penalties and/or criminal prosecution.

Drug Approval Process 

To obtain FDA approval of a product candidate, we must, first and foremost, submit clinical data providing substantial evidence of safety and efficacy of the product for its intended use, as well as detailed information on product composition, its manufacture and controls and proposed labeling. The testing and collection of data and the preparation of necessary applications are expensive and time-consuming. The FDA may not act quickly or favorably in reviewing these applications, and we may encounter significant difficulties or costs in our efforts to obtain FDA approvals that could delay or preclude us from marketing our products.

The steps required before a drug may be approved for marketing in the U.S. generally include the following:

&#160;

&#183; 

preclinical laboratory tests and animal toxicity testing; 

&#160;

&#183; 

submission of an IND application for conducting human clinical testing to the FDA, which must become effective before human clinical trials commence; 

&#160;

&#183; 

adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug product for each indication, including placebo-controlled studies or comparison of treated group from clinical trials to data from natural history data or studies; 

&#160;

&#183; 

satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the commercial manufacturing facilities at which the drug substance and drug product are made to assess compliance with cGMP; 

&#160;

&#183; 

satisfactory FDA audit of the clinical trial site(s) that generated the pivotal safety and efficacy data included in the NDA and also potentially the nonclinical manufacturing site(s) in the form of pre-approval inspections; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

FDA review and approval of the NDA. 

Preclinical studies may include laboratory evaluations of the product chemistry, pharmacology, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the pharmacokinetics, metabolism, bio-distribution, elimination and toxicity of the product candidate. The conduct of the preclinical tests and formulation of the compounds for testing must comply with federal regulations and requirements. The results of the preclinical studies, manufacturing information, analytical data and a proposed first in human clinical trial protocol are submitted to the FDA as part of the IND, which must become effective before clinical trials may be initiated. The IND will become effective approximately 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions about the supportive data, or the design, particularly regarding potential safety issues of conducting the clinical trial as described in the protocol. In this situation, the trials are placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor must resolve any outstanding FDA concerns before clinical trials can proceed.

Clinical trials involve the administration of the product candidate to healthy volunteers or patient participants under the supervision of a qualified principal investigator. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing the objectives of the study, the administration of the investigational product, study procedures, parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as a submission to the IND. Clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with the FDA&#8217;s Good Clinical Practice (&#8220;GCP&#8221;) requirements and federal and state laws and regulations protecting study subjects. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board (&#8220;IRB&#8221;) at or servicing each institution in which the clinical trial will be conducted. The IRB will consider, among other things, rationale for conducting the trial, clinical trial design, participant informed consent, ethical factors, the safety and rights of human subjects and the possible liability of the institution. The FDA can temporarily or permanently halt a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial subjects. The IRB may also require the clinical trial at a particular site be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with GCP or the IRB&#8217;s requirements, or may impose other conditions.

Clinical trials typically are conducted in three sequential drug development phases (Phases I, II and III) prior to approval, a portion of these phases may overlap. A fourth post-approval phase (Phase IV) may include additional clinical studies. A general description of clinical trials conducted in each phase of development is provided below. However, the number of study subjects involved in each phase of drug development for rare diseases can be significantly less than typically expected for more common diseases with larger patient populations:

&#160;

&#183; 

Phase I. Phase I clinical trials involve the initial introduction of the drug into human subjects. These studies are usually designed to determine the safety of single and multiple doses of the compound and determine any dose limiting toxicities or intolerance, as well as the metabolism and pharmacokinetics of the drug in humans. Phase I studies usually involve less than 100 subjects and are conducted in healthy adult volunteers unless the drug is toxic ( e.g., cytotoxics) in which case they are tested in patients. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Phase II. Phase II clinical trials are usually conducted in a limited patient population to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the drug for a specific indication to determine optimal dosage and to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks. 

&#160;

Phase II studies usually involve patients with the disease under investigation and may vary in size from several dozen to several hundred. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Phase III. If an investigational drug is found to be potentially effective and to have an acceptable safety profile in early phase studies, larger Phase III clinical trials are conducted to confirm clinical efficacy, dosage and safety in the intended patient population, which may involve geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. Generally, two adequate and well-controlled Phase III clinical trials which establish the safety and efficacy of the drug for a specific indication are required for approval of an NDA. Phase III studies usually include several hundred to several thousand patients for larger, non-orphan drug indications/diseases. However, for orphan drug indications due to their lower prevalence, clinical trials for rare or orphan diseases generally have fewer patients. For these orphan diseases, a company may also try to demonstrate efficacy and safety by comparing treated patients in clinical trials to untreated populations in placebo-controlled clinical trials or to data from natural history studies. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Phase IV. Phase IV trials are clinical studies conducted after the FDA has approved a product for marketing. Typically there are two forms of Phase IV trials: those that are conducted to fulfill mandatory conditions of product approval and those that are voluntarily conducted to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. The mandatory studies are used to confirm clinical benefit in the case of drugs approved under the accelerated approval regulations or to provide additional clinical safety or efficacy data for &#8220;full&#8221; approvals. Failure to promptly conduct and complete mandatory Phase IV clinical trials could result in withdrawal of approval for products approved under accelerated approval regulations. 

A company seeking marketing approval for a new drug in the U.S. must submit to the FDA the results of the preclinical and clinical trials, together with, among other things, detailed information on the manufacture and composition of the product candidate and proposed labeling, in the form of an NDA, including payment of a user fee unless the submission is for an Orphan Indication. The FDA assesses all NDAs submitted for completeness before it accepts them for filing and review. FDA may request additional information before accepting an NDA for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA. Under the current NDA review goals mandated under the PDUFA, the FDA has ten months in which to complete its initial review of a standard NDA and respond to the applicant, and six months for a priority NDA. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard or priority NDAs. The review process and the PDUFA goal date may be extended by three months if the FDA requests or the NDA sponsor otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission within the last three months before the PDUFA goal date. If the FDA&#8217;s evaluations of the NDA and the clinical and manufacturing procedures and facilities are favorable, the FDA may issue an approval letter. If the FDA finds deficiencies in the NDA, it may issue a complete response letter, which defines the conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA&#8217;s satisfaction, the FDA will issue an approval letter, authorizing commercial marketing of the drug. Sponsors that receive a complete response letter may submit to the FDA information that represents a complete response to the issues identified by the FDA. Resubmissions by the NDA sponsor in response to a complete response letter trigger new review periods of varying length (typically two to six months) based on the content of the resubmission. If the FDA&#8217;s evaluation of the NDA and the commercial manufacturing procedures and facilities is not favorable, the FDA may refuse to approve the NDA. The FDA may also refer an application to an advisory committee, typically comprised of a panel of expert clinicians and researchers, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved for the proposed indication. The FDA is not bound by, but typically follows, the recommendations of the advisory committee.

A sponsor may also seek designation of its drug candidates under programs designed to accelerate the FDA&#8217;s review and potential approval of NDAs. For instance, a sponsor may seek FDA designation of a drug candidate as a &#8220;fast track product.&#8221; Fast track products are those products intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and which demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or condition. If fast track designation is obtained, the FDA may initiate early and frequent communication and begin reviewing sections of an NDA before the application is complete. This &#8220;rolling review&#8221; is available if the applicant provides, and the FDA approves, a schedule for the remaining information. Eteplirsen was granted fast track status in 2007 and both AVI-7288 and AVI-7537 were granted fast track status in September 2012.

The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (&#8220;FDASIA&#8221;) enacted and signed into law in 2012 amended the criteria for the fast track and accelerated approval pathways and, as a result, the pathways now share many common eligibility criteria. FDASIA provides both the sponsor companies and the FDA with greater flexibility and expedited regulatory mechanisms. The statute clarifies that a fast track product may be approved pursuant to an accelerated approval (Subpart &#8211; H) or under the traditional approval process. In addition, FDASIA codified the accelerated approval pathway as separate and apart from the fast track pathway, meaning that for drugs to be eligible for accelerated approval, they do not need to be designated under the fast track pathway. FDASIA reinforces the FDA&#8217;s authority to grant accelerated approval of a drug that treats a serious condition and generally provides a meaningful advantage over available therapies and demonstrates an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality (&#8220;IMM&#8221;) that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on IMM or other clinical benefit (i.e., an intermediate clinical endpoint). Approvals of this kind typically include requirements for appropriate post-approval Phase IV clinical trials to confirm clinical benefit. FDASIA retains this 

requirement and further requires those studies to verify and desc ribe the predicted effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit. 

Additionally, FDASIA established a new, expedited regulatory mechanism referred to as breakthrough therapy designation. Breakthrough therapy designation, fast track, and accelerated approval are not mutually exclusive and are meant to serve different purposes. The breakthrough therapy designation is focused on expediting the development and review process and by itself does not create an alternate ground for product approval. A sponsor may seek FDA designation of a drug candidate as a breakthrough therapy if the drug is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The FDA issued guidance entitled &#8220;Expedited Programs for Serious Conditions&#8211;&#8211;Drugs and Biologics&#8221; in May 2014. 

Finally, if a drug candidate demonstrates a significant benefit over existing therapy, it may be eligible for priority review, which means it will be reviewed within a six-month timeframe from the date a complete NDA is accepted for filing.

While FDASIA provides certain authorities and direction to the FDA, it is unclear how the FDA will interpret and implement FDASIA provisions, in particular, in considering what the appropriate regulatory approval pathway is for eteplirsen. We cannot be sure that any of our drug candidates will qualify for any of these expedited development, review and approval programs, or that, if a drug does qualify, that the product candidates will be approved, will be accepted as part of any such program or that the review time will be shorter than a standard review. 

We had multiple meetings with the FDA during 2013 and 2014 to discuss the most appropriate regulatory pathway for early registration/approval of eteplirsen based on the Phase IIb data. In addition, we also had discussions with the FDA to finalize the confirmatory study designs for a potential accelerated approval for eteplirsen. Based on the data requirements and accelerated approval pathways defined by FDA, the eteplirsen NDA was prepared and submitted in June 2015. The eteplirsen NDA was filed by the FDA and granted priority review status in August 2015. Currently, review of the eteplirsen NDA is ongoing. The FDA postponed a meeting of the Peripheral and Central Nervous System Drugs Advisory Committee to discuss the NDA for eteplirsen previously scheduled for January 22, 2016 and notified us of the a new PDUFA date of May 26, 2016. 

Holders of an approved NDA are required to:

&#160;

&#183; 

report serious adverse drug reactions to the FDA; 

&#160;

&#183; 

submit annual and periodic reports summarizing product information and safety data; 

&#160;

&#183; 

comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

continue to have quality control and manufacturing procedures conform to cGMP after approval. 

The FDA periodically inspects the sponsor&#8217;s records related to safety reporting and/or manufacturing; this latter effort includes assessment of compliance with cGMP. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved NDA, including withdrawal of the product from the market.

Many other countries and jurisdictions have similar drug development and regulatory review processes. We have conducted clinical trials in the United Kingdom and intend to submit for marketing approval in countries other than the U.S. Therefore, we will have to comply with the legal and regulatory requirements in the countries where we conduct trials and submit for marketing approval. We will continue to evaluate, with input from the FDA and other regulatory authorities, which expedited programs are appropriate to incorporate in our regulatory approach for eteplirsen and our other DMD product candidates.

Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity

In the U.S., the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., or more than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the U.S. a drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the U.S. for that drug. In the U.S., orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an application for marketing approval. An orphan drug designation does not shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. The approval of an orphan designation request does not alter the regulatory requirements and process for obtaining marketing approval. Safety and efficacy of a compound must be established through adequate and well-controlled studies. If a product which has an orphan drug designation subsequently receives FDA approval for the indication for which it has such designation, the product is generally entitled to an orphan drug exclusivity period, which means the FDA may not grant approval to any other application to market the same chemical entity for 

the same indication for a period of seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as where an alternative product demonstrates clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity. In addition, holders of exclusivity for orphan drugs are expected to assure the availability of sufficient quantities of their orphan drugs to meet the needs of patients. Failure to do so could result in the withdrawal of orphan exclusivity fo r the drug. 

Distinct from orphan drug exclusivity, the FDA may provide six months of pediatric exclusivity to a sponsor of an NDA, if the sponsor conducted a pediatric study or studies of such product. This process is applied to products developed for adult use and is initiated by the FDA as a written request for pediatric studies that applies to a sponsor&#8217;s product. If the sponsor conducts qualifying studies and the studies are accepted by the FDA, then an additional six months of pediatric exclusivity will be added to previously granted exclusivity, such as orphan drug exclusivity and new chemical entity exclusivity. Competitors may receive approval of different drugs or biologics for the indications for which a prior approved orphan drug has exclusivity. We have been granted orphan drug designation for eteplirsen, AVI-7288, AVI-7537 and AVI-5038 in the U.S.

In Europe, Orphan Medicinal Product designation is considered by the European Medicines Agency (&#8220;EMA&#8221;) for drugs intended to diagnose, prevent or treat a life-threatening or very serious condition afflicting five or fewer out of 10,000 people in the E.U., including compounds for serious and chronic conditions that would likely not be marketed without incentives due to low market return on the sponsor&#8217;s development investment. The medicinal product considered should be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition as compared to previously approved products for the same indication. Benefits of being granted orphan designation are significant, including up to ten years of market exclusivity. During this ten-year period, the EMA may not accept a new marketing application for a similar drug for the same therapeutic indication as the orphan drug. Distinct from orphan drug exclusivity, the EMA may provide a sponsor having an approved Pediatric Investigation Plan (&#8220;PIP&#8221;) or pediatric exclusivity waiver, which may lead to a two-year extension of market exclusivity beyond the original ten-year period of orphan drug exclusivity. We have been granted orphan drug designation for eteplirsen and AVI-5038 in the E.U.

Ex-U.S. Regulatory Requirements

In addition to regulation by the FDA and certain state regulatory agencies, we are also subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and the marketing of other medicinal products. Outside of the U.S., our ability to market a product depends upon receiving a marketing authorization from the appropriate regulatory authorities. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, applications for marketing authorization, pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. In any country, however, we will only be permitted to commercialize our products if the appropriate regulatory authority is satisfied that we have presented adequate evidence of safety, quality and efficacy. Whether or not FDA approval has been obtained, approval of a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries must be obtained prior to the commencement of marketing of the product in those countries. The time needed to secure approval may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. The regulatory approval and oversight process in other countries includes all of the risks associated with regulation by the FDA and certain state regulatory agencies as described above.

Other Regulatory Requirements

In addition to regulations enforced by the FDA and foreign authorities relating to the clinical development and marketing of products, we are or may become subject to regulation under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and other present and potential future foreign, federal, state and local laws and regulations. Although we believe that we are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws that apply to us, we cannot predict whether new regulatory restrictions will be imposed by state or federal regulators and agencies or whether existing laws and regulations will adversely affect us in the future.

Pharmaceutical Pricing and Reimbursement

In both U.S. and foreign markets, our ability to commercialize our products successfully and to attract commercialization partners for our products, depends in significant part on the availability of adequate financial coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers, including, in the U.S., governmental payers such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs, managed care organizations and private health insurers. Third-party payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medicines and examining their cost effectiveness, in addition to their safety and efficacy. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the cost effectiveness of our products. Even with the availability of such studies, our products may be considered less safe, less effective or less cost-effective than alternative products, and third-party payers may not provide coverage and reimbursement for our product candidates, in whole or in part.

Political, economic and regulatory influences are subjecting the healthcare industry in the U.S. to fundamental changes. There have been, and we expect there will continue to be, legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could significantly affect our business, including the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010. We anticipate that the U.S. 

Congress, state legislatures and the private sector will continue to consider and may adopt healthcare policies intended to cur b rising healthcare costs. These cost containment measures include: 

&#160;

&#183; 

controls on government funded reimbursement for drugs; 

&#160;

&#183; 

mandatory discounts under certain government sponsored programs; 

&#160;

&#183; 

controls on healthcare providers; 

&#160;

&#183; 

challenges to the pricing of drugs or limits or prohibitions on reimbursement for specific products through other means; 

&#160;

&#183; 

reform of drug importation laws; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

expansion of use of managed care systems in which healthcare providers contract to provide comprehensive healthcare for a fixed cost per person. 

We are unable to predict what additional legislation, regulations or policies, if any, relating to the healthcare industry or third party coverage and reimbursement may be enacted in the future or what effect such legislation, regulations or policies would have on our business. Any cost containment measures, including those listed above, or other healthcare system reforms that are adopted could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects.

Competition

The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are intensely competitive, and any product candidate developed by us would likely compete with existing drugs and therapies. There are many pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, public and private universities, government agencies and research organizations that compete with us in developing various approaches to the treatment of rare and infectious diseases. Many of these organizations have substantially greater financial, technical, manufacturing and marketing resources than we have. Several of them have developed or are developing therapies that could be used for treatment of the same diseases that we are targeting. In addition, many of these competitors have significantly greater commercial infrastructures than we have. Our ability to compete successfully will depend largely on:

&#160;

&#183; 

our ability to complete clinical development and obtain regulatory approvals for our product candidates; 

&#160;

&#183; 

the efficacy, safety and reliability of our product candidates; 

&#160;

&#183; 

the timing and scope of regulatory approvals; 

&#160;

&#183; 

product acceptance by physicians and other health-care providers; 

&#160;

&#183; 

protection of our proprietary rights and the level of generic competition; 

&#160;

&#183; 

the speed at which we develop product candidates; 

&#160;

&#183; 

our ability to supply commercial quantities of a product to the market; 

&#160;

&#183; 

obtaining reimbursement for product use in approved indications; 

&#160;

&#183; 

our ability to recruit and retain skilled employees; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

the availability of substantial capital resources to fund development and commercialization activities, including the availability of funding from the U.S. government. 

DMD Program Competition . Currently, no disease-modifying product has been granted full approval for the treatment of DMD and no product is commercially available outside the European Economic Area (&#8220;EEA&#8221;). Companies including, but not limited to, BioMarin Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (&#8220;BioMarin&#8221;) and PTC Therapeutics, Inc., (&#8220;PTC&#8221;), have product candidates in development for the treatment of DMD. Nippon Shinyaku has reported early clinical development data for an exon 53 skipping candidate, and it is unknown if further clinical development of this or other exon-skipping compounds is planned. 

PTC has a small molecule candidate, ataluren, which targets nonsense mutations in development. The European Commission granted conditional marketing authorization for ataluren for the treatment of a subset of DMD patients in August 2014. In January 2016, PTC announced the completion of its rolling submission of an NDA for ataluren to the FDA and submission of its Phase III Ataluren Confirmatory Trial (&#8220;ACT&#8221;) DMD clinical trial result to the EMA. Ataluren uses a distinct scientific approach that addresses a different genotype of DMD patients compared to eteplirsen. Therefore, we do not believe ataluren is appropriate for the treatment of DMD patients that are amenable to exon-skipping therapy. Additionally companies such as Santhera, Summit, Pfizer and Tivorsan have unique product candidates in different stages of development or approval in DMD which we believe could be seen as complementary to exon skipping and not a direct replacement of our clinical candidates at this time.

BioMarin has an exon 51-skipping product candidate, drisapersen. An NDA for drisapersen was filed by the FDA and a marketing authorization appl ication was submitted to the EMA in June 2015. In January 2016, the FDA issued a complete response letter and declined the approval for drisapersen for the treatment of DMD. Drisapersen was previously owned by Prosensa. The Prosensa program commenced treat ment in December 2010 in a Phase III clinical study in ambulant individuals with DMD who have a dystrophin gene mutation amenable to treatment by skipping exon 51. This randomized, placebo-controlled study was fully enrolled, with approximately 180 partici pants who were being dosed for 48 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint for Prosensa&#8217;s study was a measure of muscle function using the 6MWT. In September 2013, GSK and Prosensa announced that the Phase III clinical study of drisapersen did not meet the pri mary endpoint of a statistical significant improvement in the 6MWT compared to placebo. In September 2010, the Prosensa / GSK program commenced a Phase II double-blind, placebo-controlled study. This study is designed to assess the efficacy of two differen t dosing regimens of GSK2402968 administered over 24 weeks in DMD patients, and then to continue observing the patients over a second 24-week interval for a total study time frame of 48 weeks. This study completed enrollment with 54 DMD patients in October 2011 and has since concluded. Another study using GSK2402968 in non-ambulatory DMD patients has been initiated using a 6 mg/kg dose and is anticipated to enroll 20 patients. Like BioMarin, other companies continue to pursue approval of products for the tr eatment of DMD and their products may or may not prove to be safer and/or more efficacious than, or obtain marketing approval before, eteplirsen. 

Additionally, several companies have recently entered into collaborations or other agreements for the development of product candidates, including mRNA, gene (CRISPR, AAV, etc.) or small molecule therapies that are potential competitors for therapies being developed in the muscular dystrophy, neuromuscular and rare disease space, including but not limited to Biogen Inc., Ionis, Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Sanofi, Eli Lilly, Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Moderna Therapeutics, Inc., Summit plc, Akashi, Catabasis and Oxford University.

Hemorrhagic Fever Virus Program Competition . No specific treatment has been proven effective, and no approved vaccine currently exists for treatment or prophylaxis of either Ebola virus or Marburg virus. These agents must be tested extensively in animals and meet strict government regulations. Investigational compounds can only be tested for efficacy in humans during outbreak situations such as the recent Ebola outbreak in West Africa that began in early 2014. The exigency and scale of the 2014 Ebola virus outbreak in West Africa has accelerated the development of both treatments and vaccines for Ebola. Several vaccine candidates have reached the clinical development stage and are actively being tested for population safety and potentially efficacious immunoprotective effect as a prophylactic agent. These include vaccine candidates sponsored by the biotechnology industry and also candidates in development by U.S. government agencies ( e.g. , the NIAID and the DoD). The U.S. government is also supporting early stage research on therapeutics against hemorrhagic fever viruses, including broad-spectrum therapeutics. Among the most advanced therapeutic candidates that might have utility in combating Ebola virus, are candidates being developed by the Tekmira Pharmaceutical Corp., Toyama Chemical Co. LTD, BioCryst Pharmaceuticals Inc., and Mapp Biopharmaceutical Inc. with the support of the U.S. government. Additionally, investigation of the use of convalescent plasma containing Ebola virus antibodies as a treatment modality, as well as for the potentially efficacious repurposing of drugs not intended to treat Ebola virus, remain an ongoing pursuit by the biopharmaceutical industry and several national government agencies. 

Influenza Program Competition . Currently, there are three therapeutic products for influenza that have received market approval from the FDA and are recommended for use in the U.S. These are: (1) oseltamivir (Tamiflu), a Roche Holding and Gilead product; (2) zanamivir (Relenza), a GSK product; and (3) peramivir (Rapivab), a BioCryst Pharmaceuticals Inc. product. In addition to these products, Biota Pharmaceuticals and Daiichi Sankyo&#8217;s laninamivir was launched in 2010 in Japan. Currently, funding from the United States Department of Health and Human Services (&#8220;DHHS&#8221;) Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority is helping support clinical trials of, Romark Laboratories&#8217; nitazoxanide. In addition, other companies have influenza therapeutic compounds against viral and host targets in various stages of development, including Vertex Pharmaceutical and Janssen Pharmaceutical&#8217;s VX-787, Biota Pharmaceutical&#8217;s laninamivir, Autoimmune Technologies flufirvitide-3, Ansun BioPharma&#8217;s fludase, and Toyama Chemical&#8217;s favipiravir which is in a Phase II clinical trial in the United States, under a DoD contract with MediVector, Inc., and has completed a Phase III trial in Japan. Several additional companies, including Crucell Inc., Celltrion Inc., Visterra Inc. and Genentech Inc. are also currently developing monoclonal antibodies for use against various influenza strains to confer passive or active immunotherapeutic response. DHHS is currently seeking additional antiviral therapeutics for the treatment of influenza infections. 

In addition to therapeutic products, other companies are focusing development efforts on universal influenza vaccines, including BiondVax Pharmaceuticals Ltd. and Immune Targeting Systems which are in Phase II and Dynavax in Phase I clinical trials. Successful development of a universal influenza vaccine could lead to a reduction in the number of influenza cases and, therefore, the market size.

Platform Technology Competition . We believe that other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies share a focus on RNA-targeted drug discovery and development. Competitors with respect to our RNA-targeted technologies include, but are not limited to, Alnylam, Tekmira Pharmaceuticals Corp., Ionis, BioMarin, Sanofi, Synthena AG and Santaris Pharma A/S. 

&#160;

Employees
