 ITEM 1. BUSINESS. 

&#160;

All references to &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; &#8220;our,&#8221; &#8220;Rocky Brands,&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221; in this Annual Report on Form 10-K mean Rocky Brands, Inc. and our subsidiaries.

&#160;

We are a leading designer, manufacturer and marketer of premium quality footwear and apparel marketed under a portfolio of well recognized brand names including Rocky, Georgia Boot, Durango, Lehigh, Creative Recreation and the licensed brand Michelin. Our brands have a long history of representing high quality, comfortable, functional and durable footwear and our products are organized around six target markets: outdoor, work, duty, commercial military, western and lifestyle. Our footwear products incorporate varying features and are positioned across a range of suggested retail price points from $49.99 for our value priced products to $359.99 for our premium products. In addition, as part of our strategy of outfitting consumers from head-to-toe, we market complementary branded apparel and accessories that we believe leverage the strength and positioning of each of our brands.

&#160;

Our products are distributed through three distinct business segments: wholesale, retail and military. In our wholesale business, we distribute our products through a wide range of distribution channels representing over 10,000 retail store locations in the U.S. and Canada as well as in several international markets. Our wholesale channels vary by product line and include sporting goods stores, outdoor retailers, independent shoe retailers, hardware stores, catalogs, mass merchants, uniform stores, farm store chains, specialty safety stores and other specialty retailers. Our retail business includes direct sales of our products to consumers through our e-commerce websites and our Rocky outlet store. We operate four mobile trucks to service the New York Transit Authority&#8217;s employees. We also sell footwear under the Rocky label to the U.S. military.

&#160; 

Competitive Strengths 

&#160; 

Our competitive strengths include:

&#160;

&#8226; Strong portfolio of brands. We believe the Rocky, Georgia Boot, Durango, Lehigh, Creative Recreation and Michelin brands are well recognized and established names that have a reputation for performance, quality and comfort in the markets they serve: outdoor, work, duty, commercial military, western and lifestyle. We plan to continue strengthening these brands through product innovation in existing footwear markets, by extending certain of these brands into our other target markets and by introducing complementary apparel and accessories under our owned brands. &#160;

&#8226; Commitment to product innovation. We believe a critical component of our success in the marketplace has been a result of our continued commitment to product innovation. Our consumers demand high quality, durable products that incorporate the highest level of comfort and the most advanced technical features and designs. We have a dedicated group of product design and development professionals, including well recognized experts in the footwear and apparel industries, who continually interact with consumers to better understand their needs and are committed to ensuring our products reflect the most advanced designs, features and materials available in the marketplace. &#160;

&#8226; Long-term retailer relationships. We believe that our long history of designing, manufacturing and marketing premium quality, branded footwear has enabled us to develop strong relationships with our retailers in each of our distribution channels. We reinforce these relationships by continuing to offer innovative footwear products, by continuing to meet the individual needs of each of our retailers and by working with our retailers to improve the visual merchandising of our products in their stores. We believe that strengthening our relationships with retailers will allow us to increase our presence through additional store locations and expanded shelf space, improve our market position in a consolidating retail environment and enable us to better understand and meet the evolving needs of both our retailers and consumers. &#160;

&#160; 3 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#8226; Diverse product sourcing and manufacturing capabilities. We believe our strategy of utilizing both company operated and third-party facilities for the sourcing of our products, offers several advantages. Operating our own facilities significantly improves our knowledge of the entire production process, which allows us to more efficiently source product from third parties that is of the highest quality and at the lowest cost available. We intend to continue to source a higher proportion of our products from third-party manufacturers, which we believe will enable us to obtain high quality products at lower costs per unit. &#160;

Growth Strategy 

&#160; 

We intend to increase our sales through the following strategies:

&#160;

&#8226; Expand into new target markets under existing brands. We believe there is significant opportunity to extend certain of our brands into our other target markets. We intend to continue to introduce products across varying feature sets and price points in order to meet the needs of our retailers. &#160;

&#8226; Cross-sell our brands to our retailers. We believe that many retailers of our existing and acquired brands target consumers with similar characteristics and, as a result, we believe there is significant opportunity to offer each of our retailers a broader assortment of footwear and apparel that target multiple markets and span a range of feature sets and price points. &#160;

&#8226; Expand business internationally . We intend to extend certain of our brands into international markets. We believe this is a significant opportunity because of the long history and authentic heritage of these brands. We intend on growing our business internationally through a network of distributors. &#160;

&#8226; Increase apparel offerings. We believe the long history and authentic heritage of our owned brands provide significant opportunity to extend each of these brands into complementary apparel. We intend to continue to increase our Rocky apparel offerings and believe that similar opportunities exist for our Georgia Boot and Durango brands in their respective markets. &#160;

&#8226; Acquire or develop new brands. We intend to continue to acquire or develop new brands that are complementary to our portfolio and could leverage our operational infrastructure and distribution network. &#160;

Product Lines 

&#160;

Our product lines consist of high quality products that target the following markets:

&#160;

&#8226; Outdoor. Our outdoor product lines consist of footwear, apparel and accessory items marketed to outdoor enthusiasts who spend time actively engaged in activities such as hunting, fishing, camping or hiking. Our consumers demand high quality, durable products that incorporate the highest level of comfort and the most advanced technical features, and we are committed to ensuring our products reflect the most advanced designs, features and materials available in the marketplace. Our outdoor product lines consist of all-season sport/hunting footwear, apparel and accessories that are typically waterproof and insulated and are designed to keep outdoorsmen comfortable on rugged terrain or in extreme weather conditions. &#160;

&#8226; Work. Our work product lines consist of footwear and apparel marketed to industrial and construction workers, as well as workers in the hospitality industry, such as restaurants or hotels. All of our work products are specially designed to be comfortable, incorporate safety features for specific work environments or tasks and meet applicable federal and other standards for safety. This category includes products such as safety toe footwear for steel workers and non-slip footwear for kitchen workers. &#160;

&#8226; Duty. Our duty product line consists of footwear products marketed to law enforcement, security personnel and postal employees who are required to spend a majority of time at work on their feet. All of our duty footwear styles are designed to be comfortable, flexible, lightweight, slip resistant and durable. Duty footwear is generally designed to fit as part of a uniform and typically incorporates stylistic features, such as black leather uppers in addition to the comfort features that are incorporated in all of our footwear products. &#160;

&#8226; Commercial Military. Our commercial military product line consists of footwear products marketed to military personnel as a substitute for the government issued military boots. Our commercial military boots are designed to be comfortable, lightweight, and durable and are marketed under the Rocky brand name. &#160;

&#160; 4 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#8226; Western. Our western product line currently consists of authentic footwear products marketed to farmers and ranchers who generally live in rural communities in North America. We also selectively market our western footwear to consumers enamored with the western lifestyle. &#160;

&#8226; Lifestyle. Our lifestyle product line currently consists of footwear products marketed to more fashion minded urban consumers. &#160;

Our products are marketed under five well-recognized, proprietary brands, Rocky, Georgia Boot, Durango, Creative Recreation and Lehigh, in addition to the licensed brand Michelin.

&#160;

Rocky 

&#160; 

Rocky, established in 1979, is our premium priced line of branded footwear, apparel and accessories. We currently design Rocky products for each of our five target markets and offer our products at a range of suggested retail price points: $69.99 to $339.99 for our footwear products, $18.99 to $174.99 for tops and bottoms in our apparel lines and $8.99 to $599.99 for our basic and technical outerwear.

&#160;

The Rocky brand originally targeted outdoor enthusiasts, particularly hunters, and has since become the market leader in the hunting boot category. In 2002, we also extended into hunting apparel, including jackets, pants, gloves and caps. Our Rocky products for hunters and other outdoor enthusiasts are designed for specific weather conditions and the diverse terrains of North America. These products incorporate a range of technical features and designs such as Gore-Tex waterproof breathable fabric, 3M Thinsulate insulation, nylon Cordura fabric and camouflaged uppers featuring either Mossy Oak or Realtree patterns. Rugged outsoles made by industry leaders like Vibram are sometimes used in conjunction with our proprietary design features like the &#8220;Rocky Ride Comfort System&#8221; to make the products durable and easy to wear.

&#160;

We also produce Rocky duty and commercial military footwear targeting law enforcement professionals, military, security workers and postal service employees, and we believe we have established a leading market share position in this category.

&#160;

In 2002, we introduced Rocky work footwear designed for varying weather conditions or difficult terrain, particularly for people who make their living outdoors such as those in lumber or forestry occupations. These products typically include many of the proprietary features and technologies that we incorporate in our hunting and outdoor products. Similar to our strategy for the outdoor market, we introduced rugged work apparel in 2004, such as ranch jackets and carpenter jeans.

&#160;

We have also introduced western influenced work boots for farmers and ranchers. Most of these products are waterproof, insulated and utilize our proprietary comfort systems. We also recently introduced some men&#8217;s and women&#8217;s casual western footwear for consumers enamored with western influenced fashion.

&#160;

Georgia Boot 

&#160; 

Georgia Boot was launched in 1937 and is our moderately priced, high quality line of work footwear. Georgia Boot footwear is sold at suggested retail price points ranging from $54.99 to $359.99. This line of products primarily targets construction workers and those who work in industrial plants where special safety features are required for hazardous work environments. Many of our boots incorporate steel toes or metatarsal guards to protect wearers&#8217; feet from heavy objects and non-slip outsoles to prevent slip related injuries in the work place. All of our boots are designed to help prevent injury and subsequent work loss and are designed according to standards determined by the Occupational Safety &#38; Health Administration or other standards required by employers.

&#160;

In addition, we market a line of Georgia Boot footwear to brand loyal consumers for hunting and other outdoor activities. These products are primarily all leather boots distributed in the western and southwestern states where hunters do not require camouflaged boots or other technical features incorporated in our Rocky footwear.

&#160;

We believe the Georgia Boot brand can be extended into moderately priced duty footwear as well as outdoor and work apparel.

&#160;

&#160; 5 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Durango 

&#160; 

Durango is our moderately priced, high quality line of western footwear and leather jackets. Launched in 1965, the brand has developed broad appeal and earned a reputation for authenticity and quality in the western footwear and apparel market. Our current line of products is offered at suggested retail price points ranging from $49.99 to $359.99, and we market products designed for both work and casual wear. Our Durango line of products primarily targets farm and ranch workers who live in the heartland where western influenced footwear and apparel is worn for work and casual wear and, to a lesser extent, this line appeals to urban consumers enamored with western influenced fashion. Many of our western boots marketed to farm and ranch workers are designed to be durable, including special &#8220;barn yard acid resistant&#8221; leathers to maintain integrity of the uppers, and incorporate our proprietary &#8220;Comfort Core&#8221; system to increase ease of wear and reduce foot fatigue. Other products in the Durango line that target casual and fashion oriented consumers have colorful leather uppers and shafts with ornate stitch patterns and are offered for men, women and children.

&#160; 

Creative Recreation 

&#160;

In December 2013, we completed the acquisition of certain assets of Kommonwealth, Inc. including the Creative Recreation brand and trademark. Headquartered in Los Angeles, California, since 2002, Creative Recreation was first to create and market versatile footwear that could easily transition between casual and more formal environments. Creative Recreation&#8217;s collections of upscale sneakers quickly gained strong acceptance and support from a wide array of key influencers across multiple categories including music, sports, and acting. Creative Recreation&#8217;s ability to successfully fuse style and versatility across a diversified assortment of products has created a wide target demographic and a strong distribution network that spans multiple channels and price points including Barneys New York, Nordstrom and Journeys. The current line of products is offered at suggested retail price points ranging from $30.00 to $200.00.

&#160;

Lehigh 

&#160; 

The Lehigh brand was launched in 1922 and is our moderately priced, high quality line of safety shoes sold at suggested retail price points ranging from $79.99 to $234.99. Our current line of products is designed to meet occupational safety footwear needs. Most of this footwear incorporates steel toes to protect workers and often incorporates other safety features such as metatarsal guards or non-slip outsoles. Additionally, certain models incorporate durability features to combat abrasive surfaces or caustic substances often found in some work places.

&#160;

With the shift in manufacturing jobs to service jobs in the U.S., Lehigh began marketing products for the hospitality industry. These products have non-slip outsoles designed to reduce slips, trips and falls in kitchen environments where floors are often tiled and greasy. Price points for this kind of footwear range from $49.99 to $89.99.

&#160;

Michelin 

&#160;

Michelin is a premier price point line of work footwear targeting specific industrial professions, primarily indoor professions. The license to design, develop and manufacture footwear under the Michelin name was secured in 2006. Suggested retail prices for the Michelin brand are from $35.00 to $249.99. The license agreement for the Michelin brand expired on December 31, 2015. At this time we are in negotiations with Michelin to extend the license agreement to December 31, 2017.

&#160; 

Sales and Distribution 

&#160; 

Our products are distributed through three distinct business segments: wholesale, retail and military. You can find more information regarding our three business segments in Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements.

&#160;

Wholesale 

&#160; 

In the U.S., we distribute Rocky, Georgia Boot, Durango, Creative Recreation and Michelin products through a wide range of wholesale distribution channels. As of December 31, 2015, our products were offered for sale at over 10,000 retail locations in the U.S. and Canada.

&#160;

&#160; 6 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

We sell our products to wholesale accounts in the U.S. primarily through a dedicated in-house sales team who carry our branded products exclusively, as well as independent sales representatives who carry our branded products and other non-competing products. Our sales force for Rocky is organized around major accounts, including Bass Pro Shops, Cabela&#8217;s, Dick&#8217;s Sporting Goods, Tractor Supply Company and Gander Mountain, and around our target markets: outdoor, work, duty, commercial military and western. For our Georgia Boot and Durango brands, our sales employees are organized around each brand and target a broad range of distribution channels. All of our sales people actively call on their retail customer base to educate them on the quality, comfort, technical features and breadth of our product lines and to ensure that our products are displayed effectively at retail locations.

&#160;

Our wholesale distribution channels vary by market:

&#160;

&#8226; Our outdoor products are sold primarily through sporting goods stores, outdoor specialty stores, catalogs and mass merchants. &#160;

&#8226; Our work-related products are sold primarily through retail uniform stores, catalogs, farm store chains, specialty safety stores, independent shoe stores and hardware stores. &#160;

&#8226; Our duty products are sold primarily through uniform stores and catalog specialists. &#160;

&#8226; Our commercial military products are sold primarily through base exchanges such as AAFES and consumer e-commerce websites. &#160;

&#8226; Our western products are sold through western stores, work specialty stores, specialty farm and ranch stores and more recently, fashion oriented footwear retailers. &#160;

&#8226; Our lifestyle products are sold primarily through fashion oriented footwear retailers. &#160;

Retail 

&#160; 

We market products directly to consumers through three retail strategies under the Lehigh retail brand: Lehigh business-to-business including direct sales and through our Custom Fit websites, consumer e-commerce websites, and our stores, which include our outlet store, mobile and retail stores.

&#160; 

Websites 

&#160; 

We sell our product lines on our websites at www.rockyboots.com , www.georgiaboot.com , www.durangoboot.com, www.lehighoutfitters.com , www.lehighsafetyshoes.com , www.slipgrips.com, www.rockymilitary.com, www.rockys2v.com, 4eursole.com and cr8rec.com . We believe that our internet presence allows us to showcase the breadth and depth of our product lines in each of our target markets and enables us to educate our consumers about the unique technical features of our products. We also sell directly to our business customers directly through our Custom Fit websites that are tailored to the specific needs of our customers. Our customers&#8217; employees order directly through their employers&#8217; established Custom Fit website and the footwear is delivered directly to the consumer via a common freight carrier. Our customers include large, national companies such as Carnival Cruise Lines, Pepsi, Schneider, Hagemeyer, Saint Gobain, Holland America Cruise Lines, and Waste Management.

&#160; 

Outlet Store 

&#160; 

We operate the Rocky outlet store in Nelsonville, Ohio. Our outlet store primarily sells first quality or discontinued products in addition to a limited amount of factory damaged goods. Related products from other manufacturers are also sold in the store. Our outlet store allows us to showcase the breadth of our product lines as well as to cost-effectively sell slow-moving inventory. Our outlet store also provides an opportunity to interact with consumers to better understand their needs.

&#160;

Mobile and Retail Stores 

&#160; 

Lehigh&#8217;s successful continued focus on converting our customers from delivery via our mobile and retail stores to purchasing via our Custom Fit sites and delivery direct has led to the continued reduction of the mobile and retail stores in the past several years. In 2016 we will continue to service the New York City Transit Authority with mobile stores.

&#160; 

&#160; 7 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Military 

&#160;

While we are focused on continuing to build our wholesale and retail business, we also actively bid on footwear contracts with the U.S. military, which requires products to be made in the U.S. Our manufacturing facilities in Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory, allow us to competitively bid for such contracts. We have received an order to fulfill a contract to the U.S. Military to produce &#8220;Hot Weather&#8221; combat boots. We began shipping boots in the first quarter of 2013. The contract included a minimum purchase amount of $3.0 million and a maximum of $15.0 million for the first year and included an option for four additional years with the same terms. During 2014 and 2015, we shipped boots under this same agreement.

&#160;

In early 2016, we announced we had received an order to fulfill a contract to the U.S. Military to produce &#8220;Temperate Weather&#8221; combat boots. The contract includes a minimum purchase amount of $13.0 million with the entire order projected to ship between March and October 2016. Along with the existing contract, we now have approximately $31 million in military orders scheduled for delivery in 2016, a 78% increase over 2015 levels.

&#160;

All of our footwear for the U.S. military is currently branded Rocky. We believe that many U.S. service men and women are active outdoor enthusiasts and may be employed in many of the work and duty markets that we target with our brands. As a result, we believe our sales to the U.S. military serve as an opportunity to reach our target demographic with high quality branded products.

&#160;

Marketing and Advertising 

&#160;

We believe that our brands have a reputation for high quality, comfort, functionality and durability built through their long history in the markets they serve. To further increase the strength and awareness of our brands, we have developed comprehensive marketing and advertising programs to gain national exposure and expand brand awareness for each of our brands in their target markets.

&#160;

We have focused the majority of our advertising efforts on consumers in support of our retail partners. A key component of this strategy includes in-store point of purchase materials that add a dramatic focus to our brands and the products our retail partners carry. We also advertise through targeted national and local cable programs and print publications aimed at audiences that share the demographic profile of our typical customers. In addition, we promote our products on national radio broadcasts and through event sponsorships. These sponsorship&#8217;s provide significant national exposure for all of our brands as well as a direct connection to our target consumer. Our print advertisements and radio and television commercials emphasize the technical features of our products as well as their high quality, comfort, functionality and durability. 

&#160;

We also support independent dealers by listing their locations in our national print advertisements. In addition to our national advertising campaigns, we have developed attractive merchandising displays and store-in-store concept fixturing that are available to our retailers who purchase the breadth of our product lines. We also attend numerous tradeshows which allow us to showcase our entire product line to retail buyers and have historically been an important source of new accounts.

&#160;

Product Design and Development 

&#160; 

We believe that product innovation is a key competitive advantage for us in each of our markets. Our goal in product design and development is to continue to create and introduce new and innovative footwear and apparel products that combine our standards of quality, functionality and comfort and that meet the changing needs of our retailers and consumers. Our product design and development process is highly collaborative and is typically initiated both internally by our development staff and externally by our retailers and suppliers, whose employees are generally active users of our products and understand the needs of our consumers. Our product design and development personnel, marketing personnel and sales representatives work closely together to identify opportunities for new styles, camouflage patterns, design improvements and newer, more advanced materials. We have a dedicated group of product design and development professionals, some of whom are well recognized experts in the footwear and apparel industries, who continually interact with consumers to better understand their needs and are committed to ensuring our products reflect the most advanced designs, features and materials available in the marketplace.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Manufacturing and Sourcing 

&#160;

We manufacture footwear in facilities that we operate in the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico, and source footwear, apparel and accessories from third-party facilities, primarily in China. We do not have long-term contracts with any of our third-party manufacturers. The products purchased from GuangDong Dongguan YongDu Shoes Company, one of our third-party manufacturers in China with whom we have had a long-term relationship, represented approximately 10% of our net sales in 2015. The products purchased from General Shoes US Corporation and its subsidiaries, another one of our third-party manufacturers in China with whom we have had a relationship for over 20 years and which has historically accounted for a significant portion of our manufacturing, represented approximately 6% of our net sales in 2015. We believe that operating our own facilities significantly improves our knowledge of the entire raw material sourcing and manufacturing process enabling us to more efficiently source finished goods from third parties that are of the highest quality and at the lowest cost available. In addition, our Puerto Rican facilities allow us to produce footwear for the U.S. military and other commercial businesses that require production by a U.S. manufacturer. Sourcing products from offshore third-party facilities generally enables us to lower our costs per unit while maintaining high product quality and it limits the capital investment required to establish and maintain company operated manufacturing facilities. Because quality is an important part of our value proposition to our retailers and consumers, we source products from manufacturers who have demonstrated the intent and ability to maintain the high quality that has become associated with our brands.

&#160;

Quality control is stressed at every stage of the manufacturing process and is monitored by trained quality assurance personnel at each of our manufacturing facilities, including our third-party factories. In addition, we utilize a team of procurement, quality control and logistics employees in our China office to visit factories to conduct quality control reviews of raw materials, work in process inventory and finished goods. We also utilize quality control personnel at our finished goods distribution facilities to conduct quality control testing on incoming sourced finished goods and raw materials and inspect random samples from our finished goods inventory from each of our manufacturing facilities to ensure that all items meet our high quality standards.

&#160;

Foreign Operations and Sales Outside of the United States 

&#160;

Our products are primarily distributed in the United States, Canada, South America, Europe and Asia. We ship our products from our finished goods distribution facility located in Logan, Ohio and third-party logistics operations in Sumner, Washington and Ontario, Canada. Certain of our retailers receive shipments directly from our manufacturing sources, including all of our U.S. military sales, which are shipped directly from our manufacturing facilities in Puerto Rico. Net sales to foreign countries, primarily Canada, represented approximately 4.8% of net sales in 2015, 6.3% of net sales in 2014, and 2.9% of net sales in 2013.

&#160;

As previously mentioned, we maintain manufacturing facilities that we operate in the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico. In addition, we utilize a third party distribution facility in Canada and an office in China to support our contract manufacturers.

&#160;

The net book value of fixed assets located outside of the U.S. totaled $4.1 million at December 31, 2015, $4.7 million at December 31, 2014, and $4.9 million at December 31, 2013.

&#160;

Suppliers 

&#160; 

We purchase raw materials from sources worldwide. We do not have any long-term supply contracts for the purchase of our raw materials, except for limited blanket purchase orders on leather to protect wholesale selling prices for an extended period of time. The principal raw materials used in the production of our products, in terms of dollar value, are leather, Gore-Tex waterproof breathable fabric, Cordura nylon fabric and soling materials. We believe these materials will continue to be available from our current suppliers. However, in the event these materials are not available from our current suppliers, we believe these products, or similar products, would be available from alternative sources.

&#160; 

Seasonality and Weather 

&#160; 

Historically, we have experienced significant seasonal fluctuations in our business because we derive a significant portion of our revenues from sales of our outdoor products. Many of our outdoor products are used by consumers in cold or wet weather. As a result, a majority of orders for these products are placed by our retailers in January through April for delivery in July through October. In order to meet demand, we must manufacture and source outdoor footwear year round to be in a position to ship advance orders for these products during the last two quarters of each year. Accordingly, average inventory levels have been highest during the second and third quarters of each year and sales have been highest in the last two quarters of each year. In addition, mild or dry weather conditions historically have had a material adverse effect on sales of our outdoor products, particularly if they occurred in broad geographical areas during late fall or early winter.

&#160;

&#160; 9 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Since 2005, we have experienced and we expect that we will continue to experience less seasonality and that our business will be subject to reduced weather risk because we now derive a higher proportion of our sales from work-related footwear products. Generally, work, duty and western footwear is sold year round and is not subject to the same level of seasonality or variation in weather as our outdoor product lines. However, because of seasonal fluctuations and variations in weather conditions from year to year, there is no assurance that the results for any particular interim period will be indicative of results for the full year or for future interim periods. With the acquisition of the Creative Recreation brand and the move toward more lifestyle geared products that are less dependent on weather conditions, we hope to reduce the seasonality and dependence on the variations in the weather.

&#160; 

Backlog 

&#160; 

At December 31, 2015, our backlog was $43.0 million compared to $21.6 million at December 31, 2014. The increase at December 31, 2015 is related to the US Military contract for 2016. The backlog related to this contract is $27.7 million at December 31, 2015, compared to $4.4 million at December 31, 2014. Because a substantial portion of our orders are placed by our retailers in January through April for delivery in July through October, our backlog is lowest during the October through December period and peaks during the April through June period. Factors other than seasonality could have a significant impact on our backlog and, therefore, our backlog at any one point in time may not be indicative of future results. Generally, orders may be canceled by retailers prior to shipment without penalty.

&#160; 

Patents, Trademarks and Trade Names 

&#160; 

We own numerous design and utility patents for footwear, footwear components (such as insoles and outsoles) and outdoor apparel in the U.S. and in foreign countries including Canada, Mexico, China and Taiwan. We own U.S. and certain foreign registrations for the trademarks used in our business, including our trademarks Rocky, Georgia Boot, Durango, Lehigh and Creative Recreation. In addition, we license trademarks, including Gore-Tex and Michelin, in order to market our products.

&#160;

Our license with W. L. Gore &#38; Associates, Inc. permits us to use the Gore-Tex and related marks on products and styles that have been approved in advance by Gore. The license agreement has a one year term that automatically renews each year, unless either party elects to terminate by giving advance written notice to the other party by October 1 for termination effective December 31 of that same year.

&#160;

Our license with Michelin Lifestyle Limited permits us to use the Michelin and related marks on our products. Our license agreement with Michelin Lifestyle Limited to use the Michelin name terminated on December 31, 2015. At this time, we are in negotiations with Michelin to extend the license agreement to December 31, 2017.

&#160;

In the U.S., our patents are generally in effect for up to 20 years from the date of the filing of the patent application. Our trademarks are generally valid as long as they are in use and their registrations are properly maintained and have not been found to become generic. Trademarks registered outside of the U.S. generally have a duration of 10 years depending on the jurisdiction and are also generally subject to an indefinite number of renewals for a like period upon appropriate application.

&#160;

While we have an active program to protect our intellectual property by filing for patents and trademarks, we do not believe that our overall business is materially dependent on any individual patent or trademark. We are not aware of any infringement of our intellectual property rights or that we are infringing any intellectual property rights owned by third parties. Moreover, we are not aware of any material conflicts concerning our trademarks or our use of trademarks owned by others.

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160;

We operate in a very competitive environment. Product function, design, comfort, quality, technological and material improvements, brand awareness, timeliness of product delivery and pricing are all important elements of competition in the markets for our products. We believe that the strength of our brands, the quality of our products and our long-term relationships with a broad range of retailers allows us to compete effectively in the footwear and apparel markets that we serve. However, we compete with footwear and apparel companies that have greater financial, marketing, distribution and manufacturing resources than we do. In addition, many of these competitors have strong brand name recognition in the markets they serve.

&#160;

The footwear and apparel industry is also subject to rapid changes in consumer preferences. Some of our product lines are susceptible to changes in both technical innovation and fashion trends. Therefore, the success of these products and styles are more dependent on our ability to anticipate and respond to changing product, material and design innovations as well as fashion trends and consumer demands in a timely manner. Our inability or failure to do so could adversely affect consumer acceptance of these product lines and styles and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
