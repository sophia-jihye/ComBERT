 Item 1. Business. 

Summary 

&#160; 

Leggett &#38; Platt, Incorporated was founded as a partnership in Carthage, Missouri in 1883 and was incorporated in 1901. The Company, a pioneer of the steel coil bedspring, has become an international diversified manufacturer that conceives, designs and produces a wide range of engineered components and products found in many homes, offices, automobiles and commercial aircraft. As discussed below, our continuing operations are organized into 17 business units, which are divided into 10 groups under our four segments: Residential Furnishings; Commercial Products; Industrial Materials; and Specialized Products. 

Overview of Our Segments 

&#160; 

Residential Furnishings Segment 

Our Residential Furnishings segment began in 1883 with the manufacture of steel coiled bedsprings. Today, we supply a variety of components used by bedding and upholstered furniture manufacturers in the assembly of their finished products. Our range of products offers our customers a single source for many of their component needs. 

&#160; 

&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;Innovative proprietary products and low cost have made us the largest U.S. manufacturer in many of these businesses. We strive to understand what drives consumer purchases in our markets and focus our product development activities on meeting those end-consumer needs. We attain a cost advantage from efficient manufacturing methods, internal production of key raw materials, purchasing leverage, and large-scale production. Sourcing components from us allows our customers to focus on designing, merchandising, and marketing their products.

Industrial Materials Segment 

The quality of our products and service, together with our low cost, have made Leggett &#38; Platt the leading U.S. supplier of high carbon drawn steel wire. Our Wire group operates a steel rod mill with an annual output of approximately 500,000 tons, of which a substantial majority is used by our own wire mills. We have three wire mills that supply virtually all the wire consumed by our other domestic businesses. We also supply steel wire to external customers that operate in a broad range of markets. 

&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;We sold our Steel Tubing business in the fourth quarter of 2015. This unit supplied steel tubing to many external customers, including automotive seat frame producers, and also supplied a portion of our internal needs.

PART I 

Strategic Direction 

&#160; 

Key Financial Metric 

&#160; 

Total Shareholder Return (TSR), relative to peer companies, is the key financial measure that we use to assess long-term performance. TSR = (Change in Stock Price + Dividends)/Beginning Stock Price. Our goal is to achieve TSR in the top third of the S&#38;P 500 companies over rolling three-year periods through a balanced approach that employs four TSR sources: revenue growth, margin expansion, dividends, and share repurchases. For the three-year measurement period that ended December 31, 2015, we met our goal of producing TSR in the top third of the S&#38;P 500. We generated compounded annual TSR of 20% per year, on average, over the last three years, significantly better than the S&#38;P 500's 15% annual TSR over the same time period. 

&#160; 

Our incentive programs reward return generation and profitable growth. Senior executives participate in a TSR-based incentive program (based on our performance compared to a group of approximately 320 peers). Business unit bonuses emphasize the achievement of higher returns on the assets under the unit&#8217;s direct control. 

Returning Cash to Shareholders 

&#160; 

During the past three years, we generated approximately $1.2 billion of operating cash, and we returned much of this cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Dividends and share repurchases are expected to remain significant contributors to long-term TSR. 

&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;We currently pay a quarterly dividend of $.32 per share. Our target for dividend payout is 50-60% of earnings, however actual payout has been higher in recent years (88% in 2013 and 179% in 2014, impacted by goodwill impairment in both years and litigation accruals in 2014). As a result, dividend growth has been modest, at about 3% per year. With significant earnings improvement in 2015, dividend payout for the year was 55%, within the target range. This allows us flexibility to consider future dividend growth that more closely aligns with EPS growth. We have consistently (for over 25 years) generated operating cash in excess of our annual requirement for capital expenditures and dividends. 

&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;Our top priorities for use of cash are organic growth (capital expenditures), dividends, and strategic acquisitions. After funding those priorities, if there is still cash available, we generally intend to repurchase stock rather than repay debt early or stockpile cash. During the last three years, we repurchased a total of 15.6 million shares of our stock and issued 9.1 million shares (through employee benefit plans and stock option exercises), reducing outstanding shares by 5%. In 2015, we repurchased 4.3 million shares (at an average of $45.72) and issued 2.1 million shares (at an average of $23.61). 

Portfolio Management 

&#160; 

We utilize a rigorous strategic planning process to help guide decisions regarding business unit roles, capital allocation priorities, and new areas in which to grow. We review the portfolio classification of each unit on an annual basis to determine its appropriate role (Grow, Core, Fix, or Divest). This review includes criteria such as competitive position, market attractiveness, business unit size, and fit within our overall objectives, as well as financial indicators such as growth of EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) and EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization), operating cash flows, and return on assets. Business units in the Grow category should provide avenues for profitable growth from competitively advantaged positions in attractive markets. Core business units are expected to enhance productivity, improve market share, and generate cash flow from operations while using minimal capital. To remain in the portfolio, business units are expected to consistently generate after-tax returns in excess of our cost of capital. Business units that fail to consistently attain minimum return goals will be moved to the Fix or Divest categories. 

PART I 

Disciplined Growth 

&#160; 

Long-term, we aim to achieve consistent, profitable growth of 4-5% annually. To attain this goal, we will need to supplement the approximate 2-3% growth that our markets typically produce (in normal economic times) with two additional areas of opportunity. First, we must develop and commercialize innovative new products within markets in which we already enjoy strong competitive positions. Second, we need to uncover new growth platforms: opportunities in markets new to us containing margins and growth higher than the Company's average, and in which we would possess a competitive advantage. 

&#160; 

Our long-term 4-5% annual growth objective envisions periodic acquisitions. We primarily seek acquisitions within our Grow businesses, and look for opportunities to enter new, higher growth markets (carefully screened for sustainable competitive advantage). We expect all acquisitions to (a) have a clear strategic rationale, a sustainable competitive advantage, a strong fit with the Company, and be in an attractive and growing market; (b) create value by enhancing TSR; (c) for stand-alone businesses: generally possess revenue in excess of $50 million, strong management and future growth opportunity with a strong market position in a market growing faster than GDP; and (d) for add-on businesses: generally possess revenue in excess of $15 million, significant synergies, and a strategic fit with an existing business unit. 

Acquisitions 

&#160; 

&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32; 2015 

We acquired a 70% interest in a European private-label manufacturer of high-end upholstered furniture for office, commercial and other settings for a purchase price of $23 million. This business is complementary to our North American private-label operation and allows us to support our Work Furniture customers as they expand globally. We will acquire the remaining 30% over the next five years, under the terms of the agreement, and have recorded a long-term liability of approximately $10 million for the future payments. Future payments are based upon a calculation that incorporates future EBITDA. The recorded liability is based upon estimates and may fluctuate significantly until the 2018 and 2020 payment dates. Fluctuations in this liability will be reflected in interest income or expense on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. 

We acquired Tempur Sealy's three U.S. innerspring component production facilities for a purchase price of $45 million. This additional volume enhanced our economies of scale, benefited from our vertical integration in steel rod and wire, and allowed manufacturing optimization across a broad asset base. These factors contributed to the recognition of $18 million in goodwill from this acquisition. 

We also acquired a German designer and distributor of high-end, European-styled motion components for a purchase price of $17 million. This business allows us to meet varying design preferences and broadens the range of our furniture component products, which contributed to the recognition of $4 million in goodwill from this acquisition. 

We expanded our Aerospace Products business unit with the acquisition of two companies. 

The first was a UK-based business that extended our capability in aerospace tube fabrication. This business was acquired for a purchase price of $12 million, and $6 million of goodwill was recorded related to this acquisition. Factors that contributed to a purchase price resulting in the recognition of goodwill included its international presence and complimentary fit with our Aerospace Products business unit. 

PART I 

The second was a French company that added small-diameter, high-pressure seamless tubing to our product portfolio for a cash purchase price of $15 million. This business was acquired at a price less than fair value of the net identifiable assets, and we recorded a $9 million non-taxable bargain purchase gain. The bargain purchase gain is reported in the "Other (income) expense, net" line of our Consolidated Statements of Operations. 

For more information regarding our acquisitions and factors that contributed to the bargain purchase price referenced above, please refer to Note R on page 109 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

&#160; 

Divestitures 

&#160; 

We sold our final two Store Fixtures operations for $8 million and recorded an after-tax gain of $3 million. These divestitures were reported in discontinued operations. 

&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;We sold our Steel Tubing business unit for total consideration of $25 million. This operation reached held for sale status in the first quarter of 2015, but did not meet the requirements for discontinued operations. The results for this operation (including a pre-tax loss on sale of $3 million) was included in the Industrial Materials segment. 

Finally, we divested a small operation within our CVP business for $3 million, which resulted in a pre-tax gain of $1 million. The business was reported in our Specialized Products segment and did not meet the requirements for discontinued operations. 

We divested the majority of the Store Fixtures group for total consideration of $64 million and recorded an after-tax loss of $5 million. The Store Fixtures group was previously part of the Commercial Products segment and was reported in discontinued operations. 

There were no significant divestitures in 2013. 

For further information about divestitures and discontinued operations, see Note B on page 76 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Change in Segment Reporting 

Our reportable segments are the same as our operating segments, which also correspond with our management organizational structure. Because of the divestiture of the majority of the Store Fixtures business in late 2014, along with the retirement of the Senior Operating Vice President of the Industrial Materials segment, our management organizational structure and all related internal reporting changed in 2015. 

The Adjustable Bed and Fashion Bed businesses were moved from Residential Furnishings to Commercial Products. The Aerospace business was moved from Industrial Materials to Specialized Products. The Spuhl machinery operation (which produces wire forming equipment primarily for our internal use) was moved from Specialized Products to Residential Furnishings. Additionally, our logistics operations, which primarily include intercompany transportation activity, were moved from Residential Furnishings to Industrial Materials. These segment changes were retrospectively applied to all prior periods presented.

&#160; 

Our international operations face the risks associated with any operation in a foreign country. These risks include: 

&#8226; 

Foreign currency fluctuation 

&#8226; 

Foreign legal systems that make it difficult to protect intellectual property and enforce contract rights 

&#8226; 

Credit risks 

&#8226; 

Increased costs due to tariffs, customs and shipping rates 

&#8226; 

Potential problems obtaining raw materials, and disruptions related to the availability of electricity and transportation during times of crisis or war 

&#8226; 

Inconsistent interpretation and enforcement, at times, of foreign tax laws 

&#8226; 

Political instability in certain countries 

Our Specialized Products segment, which derives roughly 65% of its trade sales from foreign operations, is particularly subject to the above risks. These and other foreign-related risks could result in cost increases, reduced profits, the inability to carry on our foreign operations and other adverse effects on our business.

Distribution of Products 

&#160; 

In each of our segments, we sell and distribute our products primarily through our own personnel. However, many of our businesses have relationships and agreements with outside sales representatives and distributors. We do not believe any of these agreements or relationships would, if terminated, have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition, operating cash flows or results of operations of the Company. 

Raw Materials 

&#160; 

The products we manufacture require a variety of raw materials. We believe that worldwide supply sources are readily available for all the raw materials we use. Among the most important are: 

&#8226; 

Various types of steel, including scrap, rod, wire, sheet, stainless and angle iron 

&#8226; 

Foam scrap 

&#8226; 

Woven and non-woven fabrics 

&#8226; 

Titanium and nickel-based alloys and other high strength metals 

We supply our own raw materials for many of the products we make. For example, we produce steel rod that we make into steel wire, which we then use to manufacture: 

&#8226; 

Innersprings and foundations for mattresses 

&#8226; 

Springs and seat suspensions for chairs and sofas 

&#8226; 

Automotive seating suspension systems 

We supply a substantial majority of our domestic steel rod requirements through our own rod mill. Our wire drawing mills supply nearly all of our U.S. requirements for steel wire. 

Customer Concentration 

&#160; 

We serve thousands of customers worldwide, sustaining many long-term business relationships. In 2015, our largest customer accounted for approximately 8% of our consolidated revenues. Our top 10 customers accounted for approximately 29% of these consolidated revenues. The loss of one or more of these customers could have a 

PART I 

material adverse effect on the Company, as a whole, or on the respective segment in which the customer&#8217;s sales are reported, including our Residential Furnishings, Commercial Products and Specialized Products segments. 

Patents and Trademarks 

&#160; 

The chart below shows the approximate number of patents issued, patents in process, trademarks registered and trademarks in process held by our continuing operations as of December 31, 2015. No single patent or group of patents, or trademark or group of trademarks, is material to our operations, as a whole. Most of our patents relate to products sold in the Specialized Products segment, while a substantial majority of our trademarks relate to products sold in the Residential Furnishings and Specialized Products segments.

Product Development 

&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;One of our strongest performing product categories across the company is ComfortCore &#174; , our fabric-encased spring coils used in hybrid and other mattresses. Many mattress producers have moved to higher valued innersprings like ComfortCore &#174; &#32;in more of their product lines, typically replacing foam cores or traditional innersprings. Our ComfortCore &#174; &#32;volume has continued to grow, and represented 30% of our total U.S. innerspring units in 2015. 

PART I 

Research and Development 

&#160; 

We maintain research, development and testing centers in many locations around the world. We are unable to calculate precisely the cost of research and development because the personnel involved in product and machinery development also spend portions of their time in other areas. However, we estimate the cost of research and development was approximately $25 million in each of the last three years. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

At December 31, 2015, we had approximately 20,000 employees, of which roughly 15,000 were engaged in production. Of the 20,000, approximately 11,000 were international employees (5,600 in China). Roughly 15% of our employees are represented by labor unions that collectively bargain for work conditions, wages or other issues. We did not experience any material work stoppage related to contract negotiations with labor unions during 2015. Management is not aware of any circumstances likely to result in a material work stoppage related to contract negotiations with labor unions during 2016. The chart below shows the approximate number of employees by segment. 

At December 31, 2014, we had approximately 19,000 employees. 

Competition 

&#160; 

Many companies offer products that compete with those we manufacture and sell. The number of competing companies varies by product line, but many of the markets for our products are highly competitive. We tend to attract and retain customers through product quality, innovation, competitive pricing and customer service. Many of our competitors try to win business primarily on price but, depending upon the particular product, we experience competition based on quality and performance as well. In general, our competitors tend to be smaller, private companies. 

We believe we are the largest U.S. manufacturer, in terms of revenue, of the following: 

&#8226; 

Components for residential furniture and bedding 

&#8226; 

Carpet cushion 

&#8226; 

Adjustable bed bases 

&#8226; 

Components for office furniture 

&#8226; 

High carbon drawn steel wire 

PART I 

&#8226; 

Automotive seat support and lumbar systems 

&#8226; 

Bedding industry machinery 

&#8226; 

Thin-walled, titanium, nickel and other specialty tubing for the aerospace industry 

We continue to face pressure from foreign competitors as some of our customers source a portion of their components and finished products offshore. In addition to lower labor rates, foreign competitors benefit (at times) from lower raw material costs. They may also benefit from currency factors and more lenient regulatory climates. We typically remain price competitive, even versus many foreign manufacturers, as a result of our efficient operations, low labor content, vertical integration in steel and wire, logistics and distribution efficiencies, and large scale purchasing of raw materials and commodities. However, we have also reacted to foreign competition in certain cases by selectively adjusting prices, and by developing new proprietary products that help our customers reduce total costs. 

&#160; 

Since 2009, there have been antidumping duty orders on innerspring imports from China, South Africa and Vietnam, ranging from 116% to 234%. &#160; In March 2014, the Department of Commerce (DOC) and the International Trade Commission (ITC) determined that the duties should be continued. In April 2014, the DOC published its final order continuing the duties through February 2019 (for China) and December 2018 (for South Africa and Vietnam). Also, a case brought in January 2014 by major U.S. steel wire rod producers resulted in a ruling in December 2014, and the implementation of antidumping duties of 106% to 110% and countervailing duties of 178% to 193% on imports of Chinese steel wire rod through December 2019. 

Because of the documented evasion of antidumping orders by certain importers, typically shipping goods through third countries and falsely identifying the countries of origin, Leggett, along with several U.S. manufacturers have formed a coalition and are working with members of Congress, the DOC, and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to seek stronger enforcement of existing antidumping and/or countervailing duty orders. As a result of these efforts, the U.S. Congress has passed the Enforcing Orders and Reducing Customs Evasion (ENFORCE) Act. The ENFORCE Act requires CBP to implement a transparent, time-limited process to investigate allegations of duty evasion and to assess duties where appropriate. 

Seasonality 

&#160; 

As a diversified manufacturer, we generally have not experienced significant seasonality. However, unusual economic factors in any given year, along with acquisitions and dispositions, can create sales variability and obscure the underlying seasonality of our businesses. Historically, for the Company as a whole, the second and third quarters typically have slightly higher sales, while the first and fourth quarters have generally been lower. Segment level seasonality has also been relatively limited, however the Residential Furnishings segment usually has lower sales in the fourth quarter and the Specialized Products segment typically experiences lower sales in the third quarter. 

Backlog 

&#160; 

Our customer relationships and our manufacturing and inventory practices do not create a material amount of backlog orders for any of our segments. Production and inventory levels are geared primarily to the level of incoming orders and projected demand based on customer relationships. 

Working Capital Items 

&#160; 

For information regarding working capital items, see the discussion of &#8220;Cash from Operations&#8221; in Item 7, Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations on page 40. 

PART I 

Government Contracts 

&#160; 

The Company does not have a material amount of sales derived from government contracts subject to renegotiation of profits or termination at the election of any government. 

Environmental Regulation 

&#160; 

Our operations are subject to federal, state, and local laws and regulations related to the protection of the environment. We have policies intended to ensure that our operations are conducted in compliance with applicable laws. While we cannot predict policy changes by various regulatory agencies, management expects that compliance with these laws and regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, capital expenditures, financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.
