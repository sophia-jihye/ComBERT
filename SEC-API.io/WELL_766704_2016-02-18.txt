General 

&#160; 

Welltower Inc. (NYSE:HCN), an S&#38;P 500 company headquartered in Toledo, Ohio, is driving the transformation of health care infrastructure. The Company invests with leading seniors housing operators, post-acute providers and health systems to fund real estate and infrastructure needed to scale innovative care delivery models and improve people&#8217;s wellness and overall health care experience. Welltower TM , a real estate investment trust (&#8220;REIT&#8221;), owns properties in major, high-growth markets in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom, consisting of seniors housing and post-acute communities and outpatient medical properties. Our capital programs, when combined with comprehensive planning, development and property management services, make us a single-source solution for acquiring, planning, developing, managing, repositioning and monetizing real estate assets. More information is available on the Internet at www.welltower.com. The information on our website is not incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and our web address is included as an inactive textual reference only. 

&#160; 

Our primary objectives are to protect stockholder capital and enhance stockholder value. We seek to pay consistent cash dividends to stockholders and create opportunities to increase dividend payments to stockholders as a result of annual increases in net operating income and portfolio growth. To meet these objectives, we invest across the full spectrum of seniors housing and health care real estate and diversify our investment portfolio by property type, relationship and geographic location. 

&#160; 

Depending upon the availability and cost of external capital, we believe our liquidity is sufficient to fund operations, meet debt service obligations (both principal and interest), make dividend distributions and complete construction projects in process. We also continuously evaluate opportunities to finance future investments. New investments are generally funded from temporary borrowings under our primary unsecured credit facility, internally generated cash and the proceeds from investment dispositions. Our investments generate cash from net operating income and principal payments on loans receivable. Permanent financing for future investments, which replaces funds drawn under our primary unsecured credit facility, has historically been provided through a combination of the issuance of public debt and equity securities and the incurrence or assumption of secured debt.

Portfolio of Properties 

&#160; 

Please see &#8220;Item 7 &#8211; Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation &#8211; Executive Summary &#8211; Company Overview&#8221; for a table that summarizes our portfolio as of December 31, 2015. 

&#160; 

Property Types 

&#160; 

We invest in seniors housing and health care real estate and evaluate our business on three reportable segments: triple-net, seniors housing operating and outpatient medical. For additional information regarding our segments, please see Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements. The following is a summary of our various property types. 

&#160; 

Triple-Net 

&#160; 

Our triple-net properties include independent living facilities and independent supportive living facilities (Canada), continuing care retirement communities, assisted living facilities, care homes with and without nursing (United Kingdom), Alzheimer&#8217;s/dementia care facilities, long-term/post-acute care facilities and hospitals. We invest primarily through acquisitions, development and joint venture partnerships. Our properties are primarily leased to operators under long-term, triple-net master leases. We are not involved in property management. Our properties include stand-alone facilities that provide one level of service, combination facilities that provide multiple levels of service, and communities or campuses that provide a wide range of services. 

&#160; 

Independent Living Facilities and Independent Supportive Living Facilities (Canada). Independent living facilities and independent supportive living facilities are age-restricted, multifamily properties with central dining facilities that provide residents access to meals and other services such as housekeeping, linen service, transportation and social and recreational activities. 

&#160; 

Continuing Care Retirement Communities. Continuing care retirement communities typically include a combination of detached homes, an independent living facility, an assisted living facility and/or a long-term/post-acute care facility on one campus. These communities appeal to residents because there is no need to relocate when health and medical needs change. Resident payment plans 

&#160; 

vary, but can include entrance fees, condominium fees and rental fees. Many of these communities also charge monthly maintenance fees in exchange for a living unit, meals and some health services. 

&#160; 

Assisted Living Facilities . Assisted living facilities are state regulated rental properties that provide the same services as independent living facilities, but also provide supportive care from trained employees to residents who require assistance with activities of daily living, including, but not limited to, management of medications, bathing, dressing, toileting, ambulating and eating. 

&#160; 

Care Homes with Nursing (United Kingdom) . Care homes with nursing, regulated by the Care Quality Commission are licensed daily rate or rental properties where the majority of individuals require 24-hour nursing and/or medical care. Generally, these properties are licensed for various national and local reimbursement programs. Unlike the U.S., care homes with nursing in the U.K. generally do not provide post-acute care. 

&#160; 

Care Homes (United Kingdom) . Care homes, regulated by the Care Quality Commission, are rental properties that provide essentially the same services as U.S. assisted living facilities. 

&#160; 

Alzheimer&#8217;s/Dementia Care Facilities. Certain assisted living facilities may include state-licensed settings that specialize in caring for those afflicted with Alzheimer&#8217;s disease and/or other types of dementia. 

&#160; 

Long-Term/Post-Acute Care Facilities . Our long-term/post-acute care facilities generally include skilled nursing/post-acute care facilities, inpatient rehabilitation facilities and long-term acute care facilities. Skilled nursing/post-acute care facilities are licensed daily rate or rental properties where the majority of individuals require 24-hour nursing and/or medical care. Generally, these properties are licensed for Medicaid and/or Medicare reimbursement in the U.S. or provincial reimbursement in Canada. All facilities offer some level of rehabilitation services. Some facilities focus on higher acuity patients and offer rehabilitation units specializing in cardiac, orthopedic, dialysis, neurological or pulmonary rehabilitation. Inpatient rehabilitation facilities provide inpatient services for patients with intensive rehabilitation needs. Long-term acute care facilities provide inpatient services for patients with complex medical conditions that require more intensive care, monitoring or emergency support than is available in most skilled nursing/post-acute care facilities. 

&#160; 

Hospitals . Hospitals are acute care facilities that provide a wide range of inpatient and/or outpatient services, including, but not limited to, surgery, rehabilitation, therapy and clinical laboratories. 

&#160; 

&#160; Our triple-net segment accounted for 31%, 31% and 31% of total revenues (including discontinued operations) for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. We lease 187 facilities to Genesis Healthcare, LLC, an operator of long-term/post-acute care facilities, pursuant to a long-term, triple-net master lease. In addition to rent, the master lease requires Genesis to pay all operating costs, utilities, real estate taxes, insurance, building repairs, maintenance costs and all obligations under certain ground leases. All obligations under the master lease have been guaranteed by FC-GEN Operations Investment, LLC, a subsidiary of Genesis Healthcare, LLC. For the year ended December 31, 2015, our lease with Genesis accounted for approximately 31% of our triple-net segment revenues and 10% of our total revenues. 

&#160; 

Seniors Housing Operating 

&#160; 

Our seniors housing operating properties include several of the facility types described in &#8220;Item 1 &#8211; Business &#8211; Property Types &#8211; Triple-Net&#8221;, including independent living facilities and independent supportive living facilities, assisted living facilities, care homes and Alzheimer&#8217;s/dementia care facilities. 

&#160; 

Properties are primarily held in consolidated joint venture entities with operating partners. We utilize the structure proposed in the REIT Investment Diversification and Empowerment Act of 2007, which is commonly referred to as a &#8220;RIDEA&#8221; structure (the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code authorizing the RIDEA structure were enacted as part of the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008). See Note 18 to our consolidated financial statements for more information. 

&#160; 

&#160; Our seniors housing operating segment accounted for 56%, 57% and 59% of total revenues (including discontinued operations) for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. We have relationships with 14 operators to own and operate 388 facilities (plus 54 unconsolidated facilities). In each instance, our partner provides management services to the properties pursuant to an incentive-based management contract. We rely on our partners to effectively and efficiently manage these properties. For the year ended December 31, 2015, our relationship with Sunrise Senior Living accounted for approximately 44% of our seniors housing operating segment revenues and 25% of our total revenues. 

&#160; 

Outpatient Medical 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Our outpatient medical properties include outpatient medical buildings and, prior to June 30, 2015, life science facilities. We typically lease our outpatient medical buildings to multiple tenants and provide varying levels of property management. Our life science investment represented an investment in an unconsolidated joint venture entity. Our outpatient medical segment accounted for 13%, 12% and 13% of total revenues (including discontinued operations) for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. No single tenant exceeds 20% of segment revenues. 

&#160; 

Outpatient Medical Buildings . The outpatient medical building portfolio consists of health care related buildings that generally include physician offices, ambulatory surgery centers, diagnostic facilities, outpatient services and/or labs. Our portfolio has a strong affiliation with health systems. Approximately 95% of our outpatient medical building portfolio is affiliated with health systems (with buildings on hospital campuses or serving as satellite locations for the health system and its physicians). 

&#160; 

Life Science Facilities . The life science portfolio consisted of laboratory and office facilities specifically designed and constructed for use by biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. These facilities were located adjacent to The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which is a well-established market known for pharmaceutical and biotechnology research. They are similar to commercial office buildings with advanced HVAC (heating, ventilation and air conditioning), electrical and mechanical systems. On June 30, 2015, we disposed of our life science investments. 

&#160; 

Investments 

&#160; 

Depending upon market conditions, we believe that new investments will be available in the future with spreads over our cost of capital that will generate appropriate returns to our stockholders. We invest in seniors housing and health care real estate primarily through acquisitions, developments and joint venture partnerships. For additional information regarding acquisition and development activity, please see Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements. We diversify our investment portfolio by property type, relationship and geographic location. In determining whether to invest in a property, we focus on the following: (1) the experience of the obligor&#8217;s/partner&#8217;s management team; (2) the historical and projected financial and operational performance of the property; (3) the credit of the obligor/partner; (4) the security for any lease or loan; (5) the real estate attributes of the building and its location; (6) the capital committed to the property by the obligor/partner; and (7) the operating fundamentals of the applicable industry. We conduct market research and analysis for all potential investments. In addition, we review the value of all properties, the interest rates and covenant requirements of any facility-level debt to be assumed at the time of the acquisition and the anticipated sources of repayment of any existing debt that is not to be assumed at the time of the acquisition. 

&#160; 

We monitor our investments through a variety of methods determined by the type of property. Our proactive and comprehensive asset management process for seniors housing properties generally includes review of monthly financial statements and other operating data for each property, review of obligor/partner creditworthiness, property inspections, and review of covenant compliance relating to licensure, real estate taxes, letters of credit and other collateral. Our internal property management division actively manages and monitors the outpatient medical portfolio with a comprehensive process including review of, among other things, tenant relations, lease expirations, the mix of health service providers, hospital/health system relationships, property performance, capital improvement needs, and market conditions. In monitoring our portfolio, our personnel use a proprietary database to collect and analyze property-specific data. Additionally, we conduct extensive research to ascertain industry trends. 

&#160; 

We evaluate the operating environment in each property&#8217;s market to determine the likely trend in operating performance of the facility. When we identify unacceptable trends, we seek to mitigate, eliminate or transfer the risk. Through these efforts, we are generally able to intervene at an early stage to address any negative trends, and in so doing, support both the collectability of revenue and the value of our investment. 

&#160; 

Investment Types 

&#160; 

Real Property. Our properties are primarily comprised of land, buildings, improvements and related rights. Our triple-net properties are generally leased to operators under long-term operating leases. The leases generally have a fixed contractual term of 12 to 15 years and contain one or more five to 15-year renewal options. Certain of our leases also contain purchase options, a portion of which could result in the disposition of properties for less than full market value. Most of our rents are received under triple-net leases requiring the operator to pay rent and all additional charges incurred in the operation of the leased property. The tenants are required to repair, rebuild and maintain the leased properties. Substantially all of these operating leases are designed with escalating rent structures. Leases with fixed annual rental escalators are generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the initial lease period, subject to a collectability assessment. Rental income related to leases with contingent rental escalators is generally recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments due for the period. 

&#160; 

At December 31, 2015, approximately 92% of our triple-net properties were subject to master leases. A master lease is a lease of multiple properties to one tenant entity under a single lease agreement. From time to time, we may acquire additional properties that are then leased to the tenant under the master lease. The tenant is required to make one monthly payment that represents rent on all the properties that are subject to the master lease. Typically, the master lease tenant can exercise its right to purchase the properties or to renew the master lease only with respect to all leased properties at the same time. This bundling feature benefits us because the tenant 

&#160; 

cannot limit the purchase or renewal to the better performing properties and terminate the leasing arrangement with respect to the poorer performing properties. This spreads our risk among the entire group of properties within the master lease. The bundling feature should provide a similar advantage to us if the master lease tenant is in bankruptcy. Subject to certain restrictions, a debtor in bankruptcy has the right to assume or reject each of its leases. It is our intent that a tenant in bankruptcy would be required to assume or reject the master lease as a whole, rather than deciding on a property by property basis. 

&#160; 

Our outpatient medical portfolio is primarily self-managed and consists principally of multi-tenant properties leased to health care providers. Our leases typically include increasers and some form of operating expense reimbursement by the tenant. As of December 31, 2015, 82% of our portfolio included leases with full pass through, 15% with a partial expense reimbursement (modified gross) and 3% with no expense reimbursement (gross). Our outpatient medical leases are non-cancellable operating leases that have a weighted-average remaining term of seven years at December 31, 2015 and are often credit enhanced by security deposits, guaranties and/or letters of credit. 

&#160; 

Construction. We occasionally provide for the construction of properties for tenants as part of long-term operating leases. We capitalize certain interest costs associated with funds used for the construction of properties owned by us. The amount capitalized is based upon the amount advanced during the construction period using the rate of interest that approximates our company-wide cost of financing. Our interest expense is reduced by the amount capitalized. We also typically charge a transaction fee at the commencement of construction which we defer and amortize to income over the term of the resulting lease. The construction period commences upon funding and terminates upon the earlier of the completion of the applicable property or the end of a specified period. During the construction period, we advance funds to the tenants in accordance with agreed upon terms and conditions which require, among other things, periodic site visits by a Company representative. During the construction period, we generally require an additional credit enhancement in the form of payment and performance bonds and/or completion guaranties. At December 31, 2015, we had outstanding construction investments of $258,968,000 and were committed to provide additional funds of approximately $525,588,000 to complete construction for investment properties. 

&#160; 

Real Estate Loans. Our real estate loans are typically structured to provide us with interest income, principal amortization and transaction fees and are generally secured by first/second mortgage liens, leasehold mortgages, corporate guaranties and/or personal guaranties. At December 31, 2015, we had outstanding real estate loans of $819,492,000. The interest yield averaged approximately 8.1% per annum on our outstanding real estate loan balances. Our yield on real estate loans depends upon a number of factors, including the stated interest rate, average principal amount outstanding during the term of the loan and any interest rate adjustments. The real estate loans outstanding at December 31, 2015 are generally subject to one to 15-year terms with principal amortization schedules and/or balloon payments of the outstanding principal balances at the end of the term. Typically, real estate loans are cross-defaulted and cross-collateralized with other real estate loans, operating leases or agreements between us and the obligor and its affiliates. 

&#160; 

&#160; Investments in Unconsolidated Entities . Investments in entities that we do not consolidate but have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies are reported under the equity method of accounting. Our investments in unconsolidated entities generally represent interests ranging from 10% to 50% in real estate assets. Under the equity method of accounting, our share of the investee&#8217;s earnings or losses is included in our consolidated results of operations. To the extent that our cost basis is different from the basis reflected at the entity level, the basis difference is generally amortized over the lives of the related assets and liabilities, and such amortization is included in our share of equity in earnings of the entity. The initial carrying value of investments in unconsolidated entities is based on the amount paid to purchase the entity interest or the estimated fair value of the assets prior to the sale of interests in the entity. We evaluate our equity method investments for impairment based upon a comparison of the estimated fair value of the equity method investment to its carrying value. When we determine a decline in the estimated fair value of such an investment below its carrying value is other-than-temporary, an impairment is recorded. See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for more information. 

&#160; 

Principles of Consolidation 

&#160; 

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of our wholly-owned subsidiaries and joint venture entities that we control, through voting rights or other means. All material intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. 

&#160; 

At inception of joint venture transactions, we identify entities for which control is achieved through means other than voting rights (&#8220;variable interest entities&#8221; or &#8220;VIEs&#8221;) and determine which business enterprise is the primary beneficiary of its operations. A VIE is broadly defined as an entity where either (i) the equity investors as a group, if any, do not have a controlling financial interest, or (ii) the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity&#8217;s activities without additional subordinated financial support. We consolidate investments in VIEs when we are determined to be the primary beneficiary. Accounting Standards Codification Topic 810, Consolidations , requires enterprises to perform a qualitative approach to determining whether or not a VIE will need to be consolidated on a continuous basis. This evaluation is based on an enterprise&#8217;s ability to direct and influence the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact that entity&#8217;s economic performance. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

For investments in joint ventures, we evaluate the type of rights held by the limited partner(s), which may preclude consolidation in circumstances in which the sole general partner would otherwise consolidate the limited partnership. The assessment of limited partners&#8217; rights and their impact on the presumption of control over a limited partnership by the sole general partner should be made when an investor becomes the sole general partner and should be reassessed if (i) there is a change to the terms or in the exercisability of the rights of the limited partners, (ii) the sole general partner increases or decreases its ownership in the limited partnership, or (iii) there is an increase or decrease in the number of outstanding limited partnership interests. We similarly evaluate the rights of managing members of limited liability companies. 

&#160; 

Borrowing Policies 

&#160; 

We utilize a combination of debt and equity to fund investments. Our debt and equity levels are determined by management to maintain a conservative credit profile. Generally, we intend to issue unsecured, fixed-rate public debt with long-term maturities to approximate the maturities on our triple-net leases and loans. For short-term purposes, we may borrow on our primary unsecured credit facility. We replace these borrowings with long-term capital such as senior unsecured notes, common stock or preferred stock. When terms are deemed favorable, we may invest in properties subject to existing mortgage indebtedness. In addition, we may obtain secured financing for unleveraged properties in which we have invested or may refinance properties acquired on a leveraged basis. In certain agreements with our lenders, we are subject to restrictions with respect to secured and unsecured indebtedness. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

We compete with other real estate investment trusts, real estate partnerships, private equity and hedge fund investors, banks, insurance companies, finance/investment companies, government-sponsored agencies, taxable and tax-exempt bond funds, health care operators, developers and other investors in the acquisition, development, leasing and financing of health care and seniors housing properties. We compete for investments based on a number of factors including relationships, certainty of execution, investment structures and underwriting criteria. Our ability to successfully compete is impacted by economic and demographic trends, availability of acceptable investment opportunities, our ability to negotiate beneficial investment terms, availability and cost of capital, construction and renovation costs and applicable laws and regulations. 

&#160; 

The operators/tenants of our properties compete with properties that provide comparable services in the local markets. Operators/tenants compete for patients and residents based on a number of factors including quality of care, reputation, physical appearance of properties, location, services offered, family preferences, physicians, staff and price. We also face competition from other health care facilities for tenants, such as physicians and other health care providers that provide comparable facilities and services.

&#160; 

Health Care Industry 

&#160; 

The demand for health care services, and consequently health care properties, is projected to reach unprecedented levels in the near future. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (&#8220;CMS&#8221;) projects that national health expenditures will rise to approximately $3.4 trillion in 2016 or 18.1% of gross domestic product (&#8220;GDP&#8221;). The average annual growth in national health expenditures for 2014 through 2024 is expected to be 5.8%. 

&#160; 

&#160; While demographics are the primary driver of demand, economic conditions and availability of services contribute to health care service utilization rates. We believe the health care property market may be less susceptible to fluctuations and economic downturns relative to other property sectors. Investor interest in the market remains strong, especially in specific sectors such as private-pay senior living and outpatient medical buildings. 

&#160; 

&#160; The total U.S. population for 2014 through 2024 is projected to increase by 9.1%. The elderly population aged 65 and over is projected to increase by 40% through 2024. The elderly are an important component of health care utilization, especially independent living services, assisted living services, long-term/post-acute care services, inpatient and outpatient hospital services and physician ambulatory care. Most health care services are provided within a health care facility such as a hospital, a physician&#8217;s office or a seniors housing community. Therefore, we believe there will be continued demand for companies, such as ours, with expertise in health care real estate. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Health care real estate investment opportunities tend to increase as demand for health care services increases. We recognize the need for health care real estate as it correlates to health care service demand. Health care providers require real estate to house their businesses and expand their services. We believe that investment opportunities in health care real estate will continue to be present due to: 

&#183; &#160; The specialized nature of the industry, which enhances the credibility and experience of the Company; 

&#183; &#160; The projected population growth combined with stable or increasing health care utilization rates, which ensures demand; and 

&#183; &#160; The on-going merger and acquisition activity. 

&#160; 

Certain Government Regulations 

&#160; 

United States 

&#160; 

Health Law Matters &#8212; Generally 

&#160; 

&#160; Typically, operators of seniors housing facilities do not receive significant funding from government programs and are largely subject to state laws, as opposed to federal laws. Operators of long-term/post-acute care facilities and hospitals do receive significant funding from government programs, and these facilities are subject to the federal and state laws that regulate the type and quality of the medical and/or nursing care provided, ancillary services ( e.g ., respiratory, occupational, physical and infusion therapies), qualifications of the administrative personnel and nursing staff, the adequacy of the physical plant and equipment, reimbursement and rate setting and operating policies. In addition, as described below, operators of these facilities are subject to extensive laws and regulations pertaining to health care fraud and abuse, including, but not limited to, the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the Federal Stark Law, and the Federal False Claims Act, as well as comparable state law counterparts. Hospitals, physician group practice clinics, and other health care providers that operate in our portfolio are subject to extensive federal, state, and local licensure, registration, certification, and inspection laws, regulations, and industry standards. Our tenants&#8217; failure to comply with any of these, and other, laws could result in loss of accreditation; denial of reimbursement; imposition of fines; suspension, decertification, or exclusion from federal and state health care programs; loss of license; or closure of the facility. 

&#160; 

Licensing and Certification 

&#160; 

&#160; The primary regulations that affect seniors housing facilities with assisted living are state licensing and registration laws. In granting and renewing these licenses, the state regulatory agencies consider numerous factors relating to a property&#8217;s physical plant and operations, including, but not limited to, admission and discharge standards, staffing, and training. A decision to grant or renew a license is also affected by a property owner&#8217;s record with respect to patient and consumer rights, medication guidelines, and rules. Certain of the seniors housing facilities mortgaged to or owned by us may require the resident to pay an entrance or upfront fee, a portion of which may be refundable. These entrance fee communities are subject to significant state regulatory oversight, including, for example, oversight of each facility&#8217;s financial condition; establishment and monitoring of reserve requirements, and other financial restrictions; the right of residents to cancel their contracts within a specified period of time; lien rights in favor of residents; restrictions on change of ownership; and similar matters. Such oversight, and the rights of residents within these entrance fee communities, may have an effect on the revenue or operations of the facility operators, and, therefore, may adversely affect us. 

&#160; 

&#160; Certain health care facilities are subject to a variety of licensure and certificate of need (&#8220;CON&#8221;) laws and regulations. Where applicable, CON laws generally require, among other requirements, that a facility demonstrate the need for (1) constructing a new facility, (2) adding beds or expanding an existing facility, (3) investing in major capital equipment or adding new services, (4) changing the ownership or control of an existing licensed facility, or (5) terminating services that have been previously approved through the CON process. Certain state CON laws and regulations may restrict the ability of operators to add new properties or expand an existing facility&#8217;s size or services. In addition, CON laws may constrain the ability of an operator to transfer responsibility for operating a particular facility to a new operator. If we have to replace a property operator who is excluded from participating in a federal or state health care program (as discussed below), our ability to replace the operator may be affected by a particular state&#8217;s CON laws, regulations, and applicable guidance governing changes in provider control. 

&#160; 

&#160; With respect to licensure, generally our long-term/post-acute care facilities and acute care facilities are required to be licensed and certified for participation in Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal and state health care programs. This generally requires license renewals and compliance surveys on an annual or bi-annual basis. The failure of our operators to maintain or renew any required license or regulatory approval as well as the failure of our operators to correct serious deficiencies identified in a compliance survey could require those operators to discontinue operations at a property. In addition, if a property is found to be out of compliance with Medicare, Medicaid, or other federal or state health care program conditions of participation, the property operator may be excluded from participating in those government health care programs. Any such occurrence may impair an operator&#8217;s ability to meet their financial obligations to us. If we have to replace an excluded-property operator, our ability to replace the operator may be affected by 

&#160; 

federal and state laws, regulations, and applicable guidance governing changes in provider control. This may result in payment delays, an inability to find a replacement operator, a significant working capital commitment from us to a new operator or other difficulties. 

&#160; 

Reimbursement 

&#160; 

&#160; The reimbursement methodologies applied to health care facilities continue to evolve. Federal and state authorities have considered and may seek to implement new or modified reimbursement methodologies that may negatively impact health care property operations. The impact of any such changes, if implemented, may result in a material adverse effect on our portfolio. No assurance can be given that current revenue sources or levels will be maintained. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that payments under a government health care program are currently, or will be in the future, sufficient to fully reimburse the property operators for their operating and capital expenses. As a result, an operator&#8217;s ability to meet its financial obligations to us could be adversely impacted. 

&#160; 

&#160; Seniors Housing Facilities (excluding long-term/post-acute care facilities). Approximately 54% of our overall revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 were attributable to U.S. seniors housing facilities. The majority of the revenues received by the operators of these facilities are from private pay sources. The remaining revenue source is primarily Medicaid under certain waiver programs. As a part of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (&#8220;OBRA&#8221;) of 1981, Congress established a waiver program enabling some states to offer Medicaid reimbursement to assisted living providers as an alternative to institutional long-term care services. The provisions of OBRA, the subsequent OBRA Acts of 1987 and 1990, and certain provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (&#8220;PPACA&#8221;), permit states to seek a waiver from typical Medicaid requirements or otherwise amend their state plans to develop cost-effective alternatives to long-term care, including Medicaid payments for assisted living and home health. As of September 30, 2015, 16 of our 44 seniors housing operators received Medicaid reimbursement pursuant to Medicaid waiver programs. For the twelve months ended September 30, 2015, approximately 1.4% of the revenues at our seniors housing facilities were from Medicaid reimbursement. There can be no guarantee that a state Medicaid program operating pursuant to a waiver will be able to maintain its waiver status. 

&#160; 

&#160; Rates paid by self-pay residents are set by the facilities and are determined by local market conditions and operating costs. Generally, facilities receive a higher payment per day for a private pay resident than for a Medicaid beneficiary who requires a comparable level of care. The level of Medicaid reimbursement varies from state to state. Thus, the revenues generated by operators of our assisted living facilities may be adversely affected by payor mix, acuity level, changes in Medicaid eligibility, and reimbursement levels. In addition, a state could lose its Medicaid waiver and no longer be permitted to utilize Medicaid dollars to reimburse for assisted living services. Changes in revenues could in turn have a material adverse effect on an operator&#8217;s ability to meet its obligations to us. 

&#160; 

&#160; Long-Term/Post-Acute Care Facilities . Approximately 14% of our overall revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 were attributable to long-term/post-acute care facilities. The majority of the revenues received by the operators of these facilities are from the Medicare and Medicaid programs, with the balance representing reimbursement payments from private payors, including private insurers. Consequently, changes in federal or state reimbursement policies may adversely affect an operator&#8217;s ability to cover its expenses, including our rent or debt service. Long-term/post-acute care facilities are subject to periodic pre- and post-payment reviews, and other audits by federal and state authorities. A review or audit of a property operator&#8217;s claims could result in recoupments, denials, or delay of payments in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on the operator&#8217;s ability to meet its financial obligations to us. Due to the significant judgments and estimates inherent in payor settlement accounting, no assurance can be given as to the adequacy of any reserves maintained by our property operators to cover potential adjustments to reimbursements, or to cover settlements made to payors. Recent attention on billing practices, payments, and quality of care, or ongoing government pressure to reduce spending by government health care programs, could result in lower payments to long-term/post-acute care facilities and, as a result, may impair an operator&#8217;s ability to meet its financial obligations to us. 

&#160; 

&#160; Medicare Reimbursement and Long-Term/Post-Acute Care Facilities. &#160; For the twelve months ended September 30, 2015, approximately 34% of the revenues at our long-term/post-acute care facilities were paid by Medicare. Generally, long-term/post-acute care facilities are reimbursed under the Medicare Skilled Nursing Facility Prospective Payment System (&#8220;SNF PPS&#8221;), the Inpatient Rehabilitation Facility Prospective Payment System (&#8220;IRF PPS&#8221;), or the Long Term Care Hospital Prospective Payment System (&#8220;LTCH PPS&#8221;). There is a risk under these payment systems that costs will exceed the fixed payments, or that payments may be set below the costs to provide certain items and services, which could result in immediate financial difficulties for operators, and could cause operators to seek bankruptcy protection. 

&#160; 

&#160; The CMS, an agency of the Department of Health and Human Services (&#8220;HHS&#8221;), made positive payment updates for the 2016 fiscal year under the SNF PSS, the IRF PPS and the LTCH PPS. 

&#183; &#160; On August 4, 2015, CMS published a final rule regarding fiscal year 2016 (&#8220;FY16&#8221;) Medicare payment rates for skilled nursing facilities (&#8220;SNFs&#8221;). Under the rule, CMS projects that aggregate payments to SNFs will increase by $430 million, or 1.2%, from payments in fiscal year 2015. 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; On August 6, 2015, CMS published a final rule for the IRF PPS. Under the final rule, inpatient rehabilitation facilities (&#8220;IRFs&#8221;) will receive a net increase of 1.8%, accounting for adjustments, such as the multifactor productivity adjustment. An additional 0.1% increase to aggregate payments due to updating the outlier threshold results in an overall update of 1.8% relative to payments in fiscal year 2015. CMS estimates aggregate payments to IRFs will increase by $135 million in fiscal year 2016. 

&#183; &#160; On August 17, 2015, CMS published a final rule regarding FY16 Medicare payment rates for long-term care hospitals (&#8220;LTCHs&#8221;). Under the rule, standard LTCH PPS rates will increase 1.7%. CMS projects overall payments to LTCHs under the rule would decrease by 4.6%, or $250 million, due to the statutory decrease in payment rates for site neutral LTCH PPS cases. Site neutral LTCH PPS cases do not meet the clinical criteria to qualify for the higher standard LTCH PPS payment rates. 

&#160; 

&#160; Other Laws, Regulations (Proposed and Final), and Initiatives Affecting Medicare Reimbursement for LTCHs, SNFs, and IRFs . On December 26, 2013, the President signed into law the Pathway for SGR Reform Act (&#8220;SGR Reform&#8221;). SGR Reform implemented several changes to the Medicare payment rules for LTCHs. For a discharge in cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2015, specified cases in LTCHs will receive the &#8220;applicable&#8221; site-neutral payment rate. Specifically, payment rates will be blended for discharges in cost reporting periods beginning in fiscal year 2016 and fiscal year 2017, consisting of half of the site neutral payment rate and half of the payment rate that would otherwise apply, and then shift to all site-neutral payments in fiscal year 2018. Patients with a three-day stay in an intensive care unit prior to LTCH admission or ventilator patients with at least 96 hours are exempted from the lower site-neutral payments if the discharge does not have a principal diagnosis relating to a psychiatric diagnosis or to rehabilitation. Beginning in fiscal year 2020, LTCHs are to maintain at least 50% of patients that are excluded from the site-neutral payments. SGR Reform also requires the Medicare Payment Advisory Committee (&#8220;MedPAC&#8221;) to conduct a study and submit a report to Congress by June 30, 2019 that includes recommendations that address these changes to the LTCH payment policies. Additionally, beginning in fiscal year 2016, calculation of length of stay requirements for LTCHs will exclude any patients for whom payment is made (i) at the site-neutral payment rate and (ii) under any Medicare Advantage plan. SGR Reform also delayed implementation of a limit of no more than 25% of patients referred from any one hospital (&#8220;25% Rule&#8221;) for another three years, and the Secretary of HHS must issue a report in two years on the need for any further extension or modifications to the 25% Rule. Finally, SGR Reform reinstituted a moratorium on new LTCHs or any increase in LTCH beds from January 1, 2015 through September 30, 2017. 

&#160; 

&#160; On April 1, 2014, the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 (&#8220;Access to Medicare Act&#8221;) was enacted. The Access to Medicare Act implements value-based purchasing for SNFs. Beginning in fiscal year 2019, 2% of SNF payments will be withheld and approximately 50% to 70% of the amount withheld will be paid to SNFs through value-based payments. SNFs began reporting the claims-based 30-Day All-Cause Readmission Measure on October 1, 2015 and will begin reporting a resource use measure by October 1, 2016. Both measures will be publicly available by October 1, 2017. 

&#160; 

&#160; On October 6, 2014, the President signed into law the Improving Medicare Post-Acute Transformation Act of 2014 (&#8220;IMPACT Act&#8221;). The law applies to SNFs, LTCHs, IRFs and home health agencies and requires providers to report standardized patient assessment data, data on quality measures, and data on resource use and other measures. The law requires public reporting of quality and resource use and other measures. MedPAC is required to submit a report to Congress by June 30, 2016, evaluating and recommending features of a post-acute payment system that establishes payment rates according to individual characteristics instead of the post-acute setting where the patient is treated. The report must include a technical prototype for a post-acute prospective payment system and the impact of moving from the current to the new payment system. 

&#160; 

&#160; On July 16, 2015, CMS issued a proposed rule that, for the first time in nearly 25 years, would comprehensively update the SNF requirements for participation under Medicare and Medicaid. Among other things, the proposed rule addresses requirements relating to quality of care and quality of life, facility responsibilities and staffing considerations, resident assessments, and compliance and ethics programs. CMS estimates that this rule would result in an estimated first-year cost of approximately $46,491 per facility and a subsequent-year cost of $40,685 per facility on 15,691 LTCHs. 

&#160; 

&#160; On November 24, 2015, CMS published a final rule to bundle the costs for Lower Extremity Joint Replacement procedures in certain geographic areas. The bundle will begin with the hospital admission and continue for 90 days following hospital discharge. The following services, among others, will be included: physician services, inpatient hospital services (including readmission), LTCH, inpatient rehabilitation, SNF, and/or home health services, hospital outpatient services, outpatient therapy, clinical lab, and hospice. Hospitals subject to the bundling requirements with spending below an established target price that meet the threshold on certain quality measures could earn a reconciliation payment from Medicare. Hospitals with spending that exceeds the target will need to pay the difference to Medicare. 

&#160; 

&#160; On December 1, 2015, CMS published a notice seeking comments on the methodology used to cut Medicare Part A hospital reimbursement by 0.2% as part of the original &#8220;Two-Midnight&#8221; payment policy. The notice was issued in response to a federal district court&#8217;s finding in September that CMS did not adequately explain its reasoning for the 0.2% pay cut in 2013. In accordance with the 

&#160; 

federal district court&#8217;s order in Shands Jacksonville Medical Center, Inc., et al. v. Burwell, No. 14-263 (D.D.C.) , the notice discusses the basis for the 0.2% reduction and its underlying assumptions and invites comments on the same to facilitate the CMS&#8217;s further consideration of the fiscal year 2014 reduction. 

&#160; 

&#160; Finally, in January 2016, MedPAC finalized its recommendations, advising Congress that Medicare payments should remain the same in fiscal year 2017 for LTCHs and IRFs, among other institutions. The final recommendations also urge Congress to eliminate the market basket updates for SNFs for fiscal year 2017 and 2018 and direct the Secretary of HHS to revise the SNF prospective payment system. To the extent such recommendations are implemented, they could impact our operators and tenants. 

&#160; 

&#160; HHS Office of Inspector General (&#8220;OIG&#8221;) Recommendations Addressing SNF Billing. In the OIG&#8217;s March 2015 Compendium of Priority Recommendations, a report that highlights the OIG&#8217;s previous recommendations for which corrective action has not been completed, the OIG cited its prior November 2012 report addressing questionable billing practices by SNFs. The OIG recommended, among other things, changing the current method for determining how much therapy is needed to ensure appropriate payments, monitoring compliance with new therapy assessments, and improving accuracy of data submitted by SNFs. Similarly, in June 2015, the OIG issued a report analyzing CMS&#8217; assessments related to changes in the amount of therapy that a beneficiary receives during stays. The OIG concluded that CMS&#8217; new policies create challenges for oversight and that SNFs&#8217; use of these assessments cost Medicare $143 million over two years. The OIG recommended, among other things, that CMS (1) reduce the financial incentive for SNFs to use assessments differently when decreasing and increasing therapy and (2) accelerate its efforts to implement a new method for paying for therapy. OIG also issued a report in September 2015, calling for reevaluation of the Medicare payment system for skilled nursing facilities. In particular, OIG found that Medicare payments for therapy greatly exceeded SNFs&#8217; costs for therapy, and that, under the current payment system, SNFs increasingly billed for the highest level of therapy even though key beneficiary characteristics remained largely the same. OIG determined that its findings demonstrated the need for CMS to reevaluate the Medicare SNF payment system, concluding that payment reform could save Medicare billions of dollars and encourage SNFs to provide services that are better aligned with beneficiaries&#8217; care needs. Most recently, OIG issued (1) its findings regarding the fiscal year 2015 Top Management and Performance Challenges Facing HHS and (2) the FY 2016 OIG Work Plan. Both cited SNF billing as an area that creates incentives for providers to bill more expensive care instead of the appropriate levels of care, requiring ongoing government monitoring and auditing for compliance. If followed, these reports and recommendations may impact our operators and tenants. 

&#160; 

&#160; Medicare Reimbursement for Physicians, Hospital Outpatient Departments, and Ambulatory Surgical Centers. &#160; Historically, CMS annually adjusted the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule payment rates based on an update formula that included application of the Sustainable Growth Rate (&#8220;SGR&#8221;). As noted above, on April 1, 2014, President Obama signed into law the Access to Medicare Act, which, among other things, provided for a 0% update to the 2015 Medicare Physician Fee Schedule through March 31, 2015. On November 13, 2014, CMS published the calendar year 2015 Physician Fee Schedule final rule, which, consistent with the Access to Medicare Act, called for a 0% update from January 1, 2015 through March 31, 2015 and a negative 21.2% update under the statutory SGR formula for April 1, 2015 through December 31, 2015. However, on April 16, 2015, President Obama signed and enacted into law H.R. 2, the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015, which, among other things: 

&#183; &#160; Repeals the SGR; 

&#183; &#160; Institutes a 0% update to the single conversion factor under the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule from January 1 through June 30, 2015, a 0.5% update for July 2015 through the end of 2019, and a 0% update for 2020 through 2025. For 2026 and subsequent years, the update will be either 0.75% or 0.25%, depending on which Alternate Payment Model the physician participates; 

&#183; &#160; Delays the Geographic Practice Cost Indices payment adjustment until January 1, 2018; 

&#183; &#160; Extends the therapy cap exceptions process through December 31, 2017; and 

&#183; &#160; Imposes a market basket update of 1% for skilled nursing providers for FY 2018. 

&#160; 

&#160; Also, on April 6, 2015, CMS announced final 2016 payment rates for Medicare Advantage, with an expected average payment impact of 3.25%. Changes in Medicare Advantage plan payments may indirectly affect our operators and tenants that contract with Medicare Advantage plans. 

&#160; 

&#160; Additionally, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, enacted on November 2, 2015, contains a provision that alters how much Medicare pays for outpatient services furnished by hospitals. Pursuant to Section 603 of the Act, effective January 1, 2017, an off-campus hospital outpatient department (&#8220;HOPD&#8221;) will no longer qualify for Medicare payment under the Hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment System, unless the off-campus HOPD was established prior to the date of enactment (November 2, 2015), and Medicare payment will, instead, be made under the applicable non-hospital payment system (i.e., the Physician Fee Schedule or Ambulatory Surgical Center (&#8220;ASC&#8221;) system), which typically provides for lower payment rates. This site-neutrality provision is intended to address policymakers&#8217; concerns that Medicare&#8217;s current payment policies incentivize hospitals to acquire and label physician practices and ASCs as HOPDs due to higher rates available for services furnished in hospital outpatient settings. It is unclear whether this provision will significantly impact Welltower&#8217;s operators and tenants. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; CMS also issued additional rules which could impact our tenants and operators. 

&#183; &#160; On November 13, 2015, CMS published a final rule regarding 2016 Medicare payment rates for HOPDs and ASCs. Under the rule, CMS reduced payments to HOPDs by 0.3% and increased payments to ASCs by 0.3%. The final rule also included updates to the &#8220;Two-Midnight&#8221; rule regarding when inpatient admissions are appropriate for payment under Medicare Part A. Under the final rule, an inpatient admission lasting less than two midnights would be payable under Medicare Part A on a case-by-case basis based on the judgment of the admitting physician, supported by documentation in the medical record. 

&#183; &#160; On November 16, 2015, CMS published a final rule regarding 2016 Medicare payment rates under the Physician Fee Schedule. Among other final policies, CMS finalized its plans to initiate implementation of the new payment system for physicians and other practitioners, the Merit-Based Incentive Payment System (&#8220;MIPS&#8221;), required by the legislation that repealed the SGR. Under the legislation, the MIPS will be fully implemented in calendar year 2019. 

&#160; 

&#160; Medicaid Reimbursement and Long-Term/Post-Acute Care Facilities. &#160; For the twelve months ended September 30, 2015, approximately 41% of the revenues of long-term/post-acute care facilities were paid by Medicaid. The federal and state governments share responsibility for financing Medicaid. The federal matching rate, known as the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage, varies by state based on relative per capita income, but is at least 50% in all states. According to the National Association of State Budget Officers, Medicaid was the largest component of total state spending, representing approximately 27.4% of total state expenditures in state fiscal year 2015. The percentage of Medicaid dollars for long-term/post-acute care facilities varies from state to state, due in part to different ratios of elderly population and eligibility requirements. Within certain federal guidelines, states have a fairly wide range of discretion to determine eligibility and reimbursement methodology. Many states reimburse SNFs, for example, using fixed daily rates, which are applied prospectively based on patient acuity and the historical costs incurred in providing patient care. Reasonable costs typically include allowances for staffing, administrative and general expenses, property, and equipment ( e.g ., real estate taxes, depreciation and fair rental). 

&#160; 

&#160; In most states, Medicaid does not fully reimburse the cost of providing services. Certain states are attempting to slow the rate of Medicaid growth by freezing rates or restricting eligibility and benefits. Average Medicaid rates for our long-term/post-acute care facilities will likely vary throughout the year as states continue to make interim changes to their budgets and Medicaid funding. In addition, Medicaid reimbursement rates may decline if revenues in a particular state are not sufficient to fund budgeted expenditures. 

&#160; 

&#160; Health Reform Laws. On March 23, 2010, the President signed into law the PPACA and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, which amends the PPACA (collectively, the &#8220;Health Reform Laws&#8221;). The Health Reform Laws contain various provisions that may directly impact us or the operators and tenants of our properties. Some provisions of the Health Reform Laws may have a positive impact on our operators&#8217; or tenants&#8217; revenues, by, for example, increasing coverage of uninsured individuals, while others may have a negative impact on the reimbursement of our operators or tenants by, for example, altering the market basket adjustments for certain types of health care facilities. The Health Reform Laws also enhance certain fraud and abuse penalty provisions that could apply to our operators and tenants, in the event of one or more violations of the federal health care regulatory laws. In addition, there are provisions that impact the health coverage that we and our operators and tenants provide to our respective employees. The Health Reform Laws also provide additional Medicaid funding to allow states to carry out the expansion of Medicaid coverage to certain financially&#8722;eligible individuals beginning in 2014, and have also permitted states to expand their Medicaid coverage to these individuals since April 1, 2010, if certain conditions are met. On June 28, 2012, the United States Supreme Court upheld the individual mandate of the Health Reform Laws but partially invalidated the expansion of Medicaid. The ruling on Medicaid expansion will allow states not to participate in the expansion &#8211; and to forego funding for the Medicaid expansion &#8211; without losing their existing Medicaid funding. Given that the federal government substantially funds the Medicaid expansion, it is unclear how many states will ultimately pursue this option. The participation by states in the Medicaid expansion could have the dual effect of increasing our tenants&#8217; revenues, through new patients, but could also further strain state budgets. While the federal government will pay for approximately 100% of those additional costs from 2014 to 2016, states will be expected to pay for part of those additional costs beginning in 2017. 

&#160; 

&#160; Challenges to the Health Reform Laws . Since the enactment of the Health Care Laws, there have been multiple attempts through legislative action and legal challenge to repeal or amend the Health Reform Laws, including the case that was before the U.S. Supreme Court, King v. Burwell . Although the Supreme Court in Burwell upheld the use of subsidies to individuals in federally-facilitated health care exchanges on June 25, 2015, which ultimately did not disrupt significantly the implementation of the Health Care Reform Laws, we cannot predict whether other current or future efforts to repeal or amend the Health Reform Laws will be successful, nor can we predict the impact that such a repeal or amendment would have on our operators or tenants and their ability to meet their obligations to us. 

&#160; 

&#160; We cannot predict whether the existing Health Reform Laws, or future health care reform legislation or regulatory changes, will have a material impact on our operators&#8217; or tenants&#8217; property or business. If the operations, cash flows or financial condition of our operators and tenants are materially adversely impacted by the Health Reform Laws or future legislation, our revenue and operations may be adversely affected as well. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Other Related Laws, Initiatives, and Considerations 

&#160; 

&#160; Long-term/post-acute care facilities (and seniors housing facilities that receive Medicaid payments) are subject to federal, state, and local laws, regulations, and applicable guidance that govern the operations and financial and other arrangements that may be entered into by health care providers. Certain of these laws prohibit direct or indirect payments of any kind for the purpose of inducing or encouraging the referral of patients for medical products or services reimbursable by government health care programs. Other laws require providers to furnish only medically necessary services and submit to the government valid and accurate statements for each service. Still other laws require providers to comply with a variety of safety, health and other requirements relating to the condition of the licensed property and the quality of care provided. Sanctions for violations of these laws, regulations, and other applicable guidance may include, but are not limited to, criminal and/or civil penalties and fines, loss of licensure, immediate termination of government payments, and exclusion from any government health care program. In certain circumstances, violation of these rules (such as those prohibiting abusive and fraudulent behavior) with respect to one property may subject other facilities under common control or ownership to sanctions, including exclusion from participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, as well as other government health care programs. In the ordinary course of its business, a property operator is regularly subjected to inquiries, investigations, and audits by the federal and state agencies that oversee these laws and regulations. 

&#160; 

&#160; Long-term/post-acute care facilities (and seniors housing facilities that receive Medicaid payments) are also subject to the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which generally prohibits persons from offering, providing, soliciting, or receiving remuneration to induce either the referral of an individual or the furnishing of a good or service for which payment may be made under a federal health care program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. Long-term/post-acute care facilities are also subject to the Federal Ethics in Patient Referral Act of 1989, commonly referred to as the Stark Law. The Stark Law generally prohibits the submission of claims to Medicare for payment if the claim results from a physician referral for certain designated services and the physician has a financial relationship with the health service provider that does not qualify under one of the exceptions for a financial relationship under the Stark Law. Similar prohibitions on physician self-referrals and submission of claims apply to state Medicaid programs. Further, long-term/post-acute care facilities (and seniors housing facilities that receive Medicaid payments), are subject to substantial financial penalties under the Civil Monetary Penalties Act and the Federal False Claims Act and, in particular, actions under the Federal False Claims Act&#8217;s &#8220;whistleblower&#8221; provisions. Private enforcement of health care fraud has increased due in large part to amendments to the Federal False Claims Act that encourage private individuals to sue on behalf of the government. These whistleblower suits brought by private individuals, known as qui tam actions, may be filed by almost anyone, including present and former patients, nurses and other employees, and competitors. Significantly, if a claim is successfully adjudicated, the Federal False Claims Act provides for treble damages up to $11,000 per claim. 

&#160; 

&#160; Prosecutions, investigations, or whistleblower actions could have a material adverse effect on a property operator&#8217;s liquidity, financial condition, and operations, which could adversely affect the ability of the operator to meet its financial obligations to us. Finally, various state false claim act and anti-kickback laws may also apply to each property operator. Violation of any of the foregoing statutes can result in criminal and/or civil penalties that could have a material adverse effect on the ability of an operator to meet its financial obligations to us. 

&#160; 

&#160; Other legislative developments, including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (&#8220;HIPAA&#8221;), have greatly expanded the definition of health care fraud and related offenses and broadened its scope to include private health care plans in addition to government payors. Congress also has greatly increased funding for the Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services to audit, investigate and prosecute suspected health care fraud. Moreover, a significant portion of the billions in health care fraud recoveries over the past several years has also been returned to government agencies to further fund their fraud investigation and prosecution efforts. 

&#160; 

&#160; Additionally, other HIPAA provisions and regulations provide for communication of health information through standard electronic transaction formats and for the privacy and security of health information. In order to comply with the regulations, health care providers often must undertake significant operational and technical implementation efforts. Operators also may face significant financial exposure if they fail to maintain the privacy and security of medical records and other personal health information about individuals. The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (&#8220;HITECH&#8221;) Act, passed in February 2009, strengthened the HHS Secretary&#8217;s authority to impose civil money penalties for HIPAA violations occurring after February 18, 2009. HITECH directs the HHS Secretary to provide for periodic audits to ensure covered entities and their business associates (as that term is defined under HIPAA) comply with the applicable HITECH requirements, increasing the likelihood that a HIPAA violation will result in an enforcement action. CMS issued an interim Final Rule which conformed HIPAA enforcement regulations to the HITECH Act, increasing the maximum penalty for multiple violations of a single requirement or prohibition to $1.5 million. Higher penalties may accrue for violations of multiple requirements or prohibitions. Additionally, on January 17, 2013, CMS released an omnibus final rule, which expands the applicability of HIPAA and HITECH and strengthens the government&#8217;s ability to enforce these laws. The final rule broadens the definition of &#8220;business associate&#8221; and provides for civil money penalty liability against covered entities and business associates for the acts of their agents regardless of whether a business associate agreement is in place. This rule also modified the standard for when a breach of unsecured personally identifiable health information must be reported. Some covered 

&#160; 

entities have entered into settlement agreements with HHS for allegedly failing to adopt policies and procedures sufficient to implement the breach notification provisions in the HITECH Act. Additionally, the final rule adopts certain changes to the HIPAA enforcement regulations to incorporate the increased and tiered civil monetary penalty structure provided by HITECH, and makes business associates of covered entities directly liable under HIPAA for compliance with certain of the HIPAA privacy standards and HIPAA security standards. HIPAA violations are also potentially subject to criminal penalties. 

&#160; 

&#160; There has been increased federal and state HIPAA privacy and security enforcement efforts and we expect this trend to continue. Under HITECH, state attorneys general have the right to prosecute HIPAA violations committed against residents of their states. Several such actions have already been brought against both covered entities and a business associate, and continued enforcement actions are likely to occur in the future. In addition, HITECH mandates that the Secretary of HHS conduct periodic compliance audits of HIPAA covered entities and business associates. It also tasks HHS with establishing a methodology whereby individuals who are harmed by HIPAA violations may receive a percentage of the civil monetary penalty fine or monetary settlement paid by the violator. 

&#160; 

&#160; In addition to HIPAA, numerous other state and federal laws govern the collection, dissemination, use, access to and confidentiality of individually identifiable health information. In addition, some states are considering new laws and regulations that further protect the confidentiality, privacy or security of medical records or other types of medical or personal information. These laws may be similar to or even more stringent than the federal provisions and are not preempted by HIPAA. Not only may some of these state laws impose fines and penalties upon violators, but some afford private rights of action to individuals who believe their personal information has been misused. 

&#160; 

&#160; Most recently with respect to HIPAA, in September, 2015, OIG issued two reports calling for better privacy oversight of covered entities. The first report, titled &#8220;OCR Should Strengthen its Oversight of Covered Entities&#8217; Compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Standards,&#8221; found that OCR&#8217;s oversight is primarily reactive, as OCR has not fully implemented the required audit program to proactively assess possible noncompliance from covered entities. OIG recommended, among other things, that OCR fully implement a permanent audit program and develop a policy requiring OCR staff to check whether covered entities had previously been investigated for noncompliance. The second report, titled &#8220;OCR Should Strengthen its Follow-up of Breaches of Patient Information Reported by Covered Entities,&#8221; found that (1) OCR did not record corrective action information for 23% of closed &#8220;large-breach&#8221; cases in which it made determinations of noncompliance, and (2) OCR did not record &#8220;small-breach&#8221; information in its case-tracking system, which limits its ability to track and identify covered entities with multiple small breaches. OIG recommended, among other things, that OCR enter small-breach information into its case-tracking system and maintain complete documentation of corrective actions taken. OCR agreed with OIG&#8217;s recommendations in both reports. If followed, these reports and recommendations may impact our operators and tenants. 

&#160; 

&#160; In November 2002, CMS began an ongoing national Nursing Home Quality Initiative (&#8220;NHQI&#8221;). Under this initiative, historical survey information, the NHQI Pilot Evaluation Report and the NHQI Overview is made available to the public on-line. The NHQI website provides consumer and provider information regarding the quality of care in nursing homes. The data allows consumers, providers, states, and researchers to compare quality information that shows how well nursing homes are caring for their residents&#8217; physical and clinical needs. The posted nursing home quality measures come from resident assessment data that nursing homes routinely collect on the residents at specified intervals during their stay. If the operators of nursing facilities are unable to achieve quality of care ratings that are comparable or superior to those of their competitors, they may lose market share to other facilities, reducing their revenues and adversely impacting their ability to make rental payments. 

&#160; 

&#160; In addition, recent government proposals have resulted in an increased emphasis by the government on the quality of care provided by providers. For example, on February 27, 2015, CMS announced the establishment of a Health Care Payment Learning and Action Network as part of its plan to shift the Medicare program, and the healthcare system at large, toward paying providers based on quality, rather than the quantity of care they provide to patients. Through the Learning and Action Network, CMS will work with private payers, employers, consumers, providers, states and state Medicaid programs, and other partners to expand alternative payment models into their programs. To the extent this and similar measures impose additional obligations on our operators or tenants, or decrease the reimbursements that they receive, our revenues and operations may be indirectly adversely affected. 

&#160; 

&#160; In October 2015, the U.S. Government Accountability Office (&#8220;GAO&#8221;) released a report recommending that CMS continue to improve data and oversight of nursing home quality measures. The GAO found that although CMS collects several types of data that give some insight into the quality of nursing homes, the data could provide a clearer picture of nursing home quality if some underlying problems with the data ( i.e ., the use of self-reported data and non-standardized survey methodologies) are corrected. The GAO recommends, among other things, that CMS implement a clear plan for ongoing auditing of self-reported data and establish a process for monitoring oversight modifications to better assess their effects. According to the GAO, timely completion of these actions is particularly important because Medicare payments to nursing homes will be dependent on quality data, through the implementation of the value based purchasing program, starting in fiscal year 2019. HHS agreed with the GAO&#8217;s recommendations, and to the extent such recommendations are implemented, they could impact Welltower&#8217;s operators and tenants. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it is not possible to predict the severity of the upcoming flu season or the efficacy of available flu vaccinations. The U.S. experiences epidemics of seasonal flu each year, which result in increased influenza-related hospitalizations and deaths. According to HHS, each flu season, nearly 111 million workdays are lost due to the flu, which equals approximately $7 billion per year in sick days and lost productivity. As such, depending on the severity and duration of the upcoming flu season, the flu could impact Welltower&#8217;s operators and tenants. 

&#160; 

&#160; Finally, government investigations and enforcement actions brought against the health care industry have increased dramatically over the past several years and are expected to continue. Some of these enforcement actions represent novel legal theories and expansions in the application of the Federal False Claims Act. The costs for an operator of a health care property associated with both defending such enforcement actions and the undertakings in settling these actions can be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on the ability of an operator to meet its obligations to us.

Registration 

&#160; 

&#160; In England, care home services are principally regulated by the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (the &#8220;Act&#8221;) and associated Regulations. The Act requires all persons carrying out &#8220;Regulated Activities&#8221; in England, and the managers of such persons, to be registered. Regulated Activities are defined in the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2014, as amended (the &#8220;2014 Regulations&#8221;), and include (among other activities): 

&#183; &#160; The provision of personal care for persons who, by reason of old age, illness or disability are unable to provide it for themselves, and which is provided in a place where those persons are living at the time the care is provided; and 

&#183; &#160; The provision of residential accommodation, together with nursing or personal care. 

&#160; 

&#160; From April 1, 2015, the 2014 Regulations fully revoked the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2010 (the &#8220;2010 Regulations&#8221;) and while the 2014 Regulations introduce certain modifications with regard to service standards, the registration obligations under the Act remain. 

&#160; 

Service Standards and Notification Obligations 

&#160; 

&#160; The 2014 Regulations aim to streamline the legal obligations in the 2010 Regulations, and replace them with a set of more broadly-phrased, legally binding &#8220;Fundamental Standards&#8221;. The 2014 Regulations list the standards that must be met when providing care services. The service providers&#8217; legal obligations include: 

&#183; &#160; Care and treatment must be appropriate and reflect service user needs and preferences; 

&#183; &#160; Service users must be treated with dignity and respect; 

&#183; &#160; Care and treatment must only be provided with consent; 

&#183; &#160; Care and treatment must be provided in a safe way for service users; 

&#183; &#160; Service users must be protected from abuse and improper treatment; 

&#183; &#160; Service users nutritional and hydration needs must be met; 

&#183; &#160; All premises and equipment must be clean, secure, suitable and used properly; 

&#183; &#160; Complaints must be investigated and appropriate action taken; 

&#183; &#160; Systems and processes must be established to ensure compliance with fundamental standards; 

&#183; &#160; Sufficient numbers of suitably qualified, competent, skilled and experienced staff must be deployed; 

&#183; &#160; Persons employed must be of good character, having the necessary qualifications, skills and experience, and be able to perform the work for which they are employed; and 

&#183; &#160; Health service bodies must be open and transparent with service users about their care and treatment. 

&#160; 

&#160; Failure to comply with certain provisions of the 2014 Regulations is an offense, with a person guilty of the offense liable on summary conviction to a fine. Monetary penalty notices may also be issued. 

&#160; 

&#160; The 2014 Regulations also include: 

&#183; &#160; Requirements around fit and proper persons being employed for the purposes of carrying out a regulated activity. Such persons must be of good character, have the qualifications, competence, skills and experience necessary and be able by reason of their health to perform their tasks. Recruitment procedures must also be established and effectively operated with certain specified information being available in relation to each person employed and registered where required; 

&#183; &#160; A new &#8220;duty of candour&#8221; to notify and apologize to affected persons, in the event of certain incidents having actually or potentially led to the death of the service user, where the death relates directly to the incident rather than to the natural course of the service user's illness or underlying condition, or severe harm, moderate harm or prolonged psychological harm to the service user; 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; A requirement for a service provider to display a performance assessment received as a rating of its performance by the Care Quality Commission (the &#8220;CQC&#8221;); and 

&#183; &#160; A requirement that registered persons have regard to guidance issued by the CQC and any code of practice from the Secretary of State in relation to prevention or control of health care associated infections. 

&#160; 

&#160; Under the Care Quality Commission (Registration) Regulations 2009 certain matters must be notified to the CQC, the government regulatory body overseeing the provision of nursing and other care services in England. Failure to comply with notification obligations is an offense and a person guilty of an offense is liable on summary conviction to a fine of up to &#163;2,500. 

&#160; 

Regulatory Oversight and Inspections 

&#160; 

&#160; The Act also sets out the powers and responsibilities of the CQC. Among other powers, the CQC administers the compulsory registration system and issues guidance to care service providers on how to comply with applicable standards set out in legislation. 

&#160; 

The Care Act 2014 sets out certain provisions concerning (among others): 

&#183; &#160; The duty of a local authority to meet the needs of an adult for care and support and a carer&#8217;s needs where the registered care provider is unable to carry on a regulated activity because of business failure; 

&#183; &#160; The duty of the CQC to assess the financial sustainability of providers subject to its regulatory regime with a view to identifying any threats that such providers may face to their financial sustainability. Where the CQC identifies a significant risk to financial sustainability it can require the provider to develop a sustainability plan setting out the provider&#8217;s plan to mitigate or eliminate risk or require the provider to organize an independent review of the business with the costs being recovered from the provider; 

&#183; &#160; The CQC informing local authorities where a registered care provider is likely to become unable to carry on a regulated activity; and 

&#183; &#160; A new offense where certain registered care providers supply, publish or make available information that is false or misleading in a material respect which can also apply to a director, manager or person purporting to act as such of a company. 

&#160; 

Privacy 

&#160; 

&#160; In the European Union (&#8220;EU&#8221;), data protection is governed by the EU Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC (the &#8220;Data Protection Directive&#8221;). The Data Protection Directive has been implemented in the UK by the Data Protection Act 1998 (the &#8220;Act&#8221;) which entered into force on March 2000 and is enforced by the Information Commissioner&#8217;s Office (&#8220;ICO&#8221;). 

&#160; 

&#160; The Act applies to a data controller that processes personal data in the context of an establishment in the UK, or where not established in the UK, in any other State of the European Economic Area (&#8220;EEA&#8221;), processes personal data through equipment located in the UK other than for the purposes of transit through the UK. Under the Act, a data controller is the person who (either alone or jointly or in common with other persons) determines the purposes for which and the manner in which any personal data are, or are to be, processed. Personal data is widely defined as data which relates to a living individual who can be identified from those data, or from those data and other information which is in the possession of, or is likely to come into the possession of, the data controller. Sensitive personal data is personal data consisting of information as to the racial or ethnic origin of the data subject; his/her political opinions, religious beliefs or other beliefs of a similar nature; whether he/she is a member of a trade union; his/her physical or mental health or condition; his/her sexual life; and the commission or alleged commission by him/her of an offense, any proceedings for any offense committed or alleged to have been committed by him/her, the disposal of such proceedings, or the sentence of any court in such proceedings. 

&#160; 

&#160; The Act imposes a number of obligations on the data controller contained in eight Data Protection Principles: (i) personal data must be processed fairly and lawfully, (ii) personal data must be processed for specified and lawful purposes, (iii) personal data must be adequate, relevant and not excessive, (iv) personal data must be accurate and up to date, (v) personal data must not be kept for longer than necessary, (vi) personal data must be processed in accordance with the rights of data subjects, (vii) appropriate technical and organizational measures shall be taken against unauthorized or unlawful processing of personal data and against accidental loss or destruction of, or damage to, personal data; and (viii) there is a prohibition on transfers of personal data to countries outside the EEA that are not deemed by the European Commission to provide an adequate level of protection, which includes the U.S., unless certain exemptions under the Act apply. 

&#160; 

&#160; The ICO has a number of enforcement powers available which includes, in certain limited cases, criminal prosecution and non-criminal enforcement and audits. In case of a breach of the Act, the ICO may: (i) provide practical advice to organizations on how they should handle data protection matters; (ii) issue undertakings committing an organization to a particular course of action in order to improve its compliance; (iii) serve enforcement notices where there has been a breach, requiring organizations to take (or refrain from taking) specified steps in order to ensure they comply with the law; (iv) conduct consensual assessments (audits) to determine if 

&#160; 

organizations are complying; (v) serve assessment notices to conduct compulsory audits to assess whether organizations&#8217; processing of personal data follows good data protection practices; (vi) issue monetary penalty notices requiring organizations to pay up to &#163;500,000 for serious breaches of the Act occurring on or after April 6, 2010 or serious breaches of the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations occurring after May 26, 2011; and (vii) prosecute those who commit criminal offenses under the Act. Under the Act, individuals also have the right to claim compensation from an organization in respect of damage caused by a breach of any of the requirements of the Act. 

&#160; 

&#160; There is a proposal for an EU Data Protection Regulation which would replace the Data Protection Directive and impose a significant number of new obligations including, among others, a requirement to appoint data protection officers, having detailed documentation on the processing of personal data, carrying out privacy impact assessments in certain circumstances, providing standardized data protection notices, reporting security breaches without undue delay, and providing certain rights to individuals such as a right of erasure of personal data. The EU Data Protection Regulation is to have significant enforcement powers with fines proposed by the European Commission of up to 2% of annual worldwide turnover or &#8364;20 million, whichever is greater. The EU Data Protection Regulation may be adopted sometime in 2016 with EU Member States possibly having two years to implement the Regulation . 

&#160; 

Canada 

&#160; 

&#160; Retirement homes and long-term care facilities are subject to regulation, and long-term care facilities receive funding, under provincial law. There is no federal regulation in this area. Set out below are summaries of the principal regulatory requirements in the provinces where we have a material number of facilities. 

&#160; 

&#160; Licensing and Regulation 

&#160; 

&#160; Alberta 

&#160; 

&#160; In Alberta, there are three relevant designations for seniors&#8217; living arrangements, ordered below from the most independent to the highest level of care. 

&#160; 

&#160; Retirement Homes (also referred to as independent living) are designed for older adults who are able to live on their own. These communities may offer amenities such as fitness centers, gardens, paths, libraries, and beauty salons. Residents may access publicly-funded external care services at the home from funded external suppliers. 

&#160; 

&#160; Alberta retirement residences may be rented, privately owned, or life-leased. They may be operated for profit or non-profit. Retirement residences typically do not offer support services but residents may arrange support services separate from their accommodations. 

&#160; 

&#160; Retirement homes do not generally receive government funding; residents pay for tenancy and services received at retirement homes. Rental subsidies may be available to qualified seniors. 

&#160; 

&#160; Alberta Independent Living residences are legislated under the Residential Tenancies Act, SA 2004, c R-17.1 and the Alberta Housing Act, RSA 2000, c A-25. 

&#160; 

&#160; Supportive Living (also referred to as assisted living) provides accommodation in a home-like setting, where residents can remain as independent as possible while still having access to necessary care, assistance, and services. A provider of designated Supportive Living services provides at least one meal a day or housekeeping services. Supportive living includes many different types of facilities, including seniors lodges, group homes, and mental health and designated supportive living accommodations. These facilities can be operated by private for-profit, private not-for-profit, or public operators. 

&#160; 

&#160; Supportive Living services are licensed under the Supportive Living Accommodation Licensing Act, SA 2009, c S-23.5, and the Supportive Living Accommodation Licensing Regulation, Alta Reg 40/2010. They are governed by the Ministry of Health. 

&#160; 

&#160; Operators that receive public funds, either directly or indirectly, for health and personal care services must also comply with the Ministry of Health Continuing Care Health Service Standards (March 2007, and revised). They are also subject to the Protection for Persons in Care Act, SA 2009, c P-29.1, under which the province investigates suspected abuse of adults receiving government-funded care services. 

&#160; 

&#160; Licenses may be granted for periods of six months to three years, depending on how long the facility has been licensed, and depending on past reports. The Ministry, through a designated director, may conduct inspections of facilities and review records. The 

&#160; 

Director may order a delinquent facility to take specific steps or to stop certain practices or may temporarily stop operations; alternatively, the facility&#8217;s license may be suspended. 

&#160; 

&#160; There are four levels of supportive living, ordered from basic to more advance care: (1) Residential Living (residents can manage most daily tasks and direct own care and assistance can be scheduled); (2) Lodge Living (residents can manage some daily tasks and direct own care and assistance can be scheduled, although some non-scheduled assistance may be required); (3) Assisted Living (residents require assistance with many daily tasks, with increased scheduled and some non-scheduled assistance required); (4) Enhanced Level (residents require assistance with most or all daily tasks and frequent unscheduled assistance). In addition, there are two specialized designations of Supportive Care: (1) Alberta Enhanced Assisted Living (also referred to as Enhanced Lodges or Alberta Designated Supportive Living Level 4 (SL4) (provides 24-hour scheduled and unscheduled professional, personal care and support services provided by Licensed Practical Nurses and Health Care Aides); and (2) Enhanced Assisted Living Dementia Care Sites (also referred to as Designated Supportive Living Level 4 Dementia (SL4-D)) (provides assisted living for seniors living with cognitive impairments (such as Alzheimer&#8217;s disease or other types of dementia) who require safe and secure living accommodation in a therapeutic environment). 

&#160; 

&#160; Residents pay a fee to cover the costs of providing accommodations and services like meals, housekeeping and building maintenance. The accommodation fee varies by accommodation type and the services or amenities that are available to the resident. Alberta Health regulates the maximum accommodation fee in publicly-funded designated supportive living. In other types of supportive living settings, the operator sets the cost of accommodation. Health services are publicly-funded and provided through Alberta Health Services. Private sector operators of Supportive Living facilities are eligible to apply for funding under the Affordable Supportive Living Initiative (&#8220;ASLI&#8221;), an Alberta government capital grant program that provides funding to develop long-term care and affordable supportive living spaces in the province. 

&#160; 

&#160; Nursing Homes (also referred to as long-term care) are for residents who have complex, unpredictable medical needs and who require 24-hour on-site registered nurse assessment or treatment. 

&#160; 

&#160; Nursing homes are subject to the Nursing Homes Act, RSA 2000, c N-7, and the Nursing Home General Regulation, Alta Reg 232/1985, and Long-term Care Accommodation Standards. They are governed by the Ministry of Health. 

&#160; 

&#160; Nursing home operators are not licensed, but enter into agreements with the Ministry for the operation of nursing homes. These facilities can be operated by private for-profit, private not-for-profit, or public operators. 

&#160; 

&#160; All operators must comply with the Ministry of Health Long-term Care Accommodation Standards (March 2007, and revised). Operators that receive public funds, either directly or indirectly, for health and personal care services must also comply with the Continuing Care Health Service Standards and are subject to the Protection for Persons in Care Act. 

&#160; 

&#160; The Ministry may conduct inspections of facilities and review records. Deficient facilities may be ordered to submit a correction plan. 

&#160; 

&#160; Residents pay an accommodation fee to cover the costs of providing accommodations and services like meals, housekeeping and building maintenance. Alberta Health regulates the maximum accommodation fee in publicly-funded long-term care facilities. In other types of supportive living settings, the accommodation fee is set by the operator. Health services in long-term care are publicly-funded and provided through Alberta Health Services. Private sector operators of nursing homes are eligible to apply for funding under the ASLI. The Minister may make grants to an operator in respect of its operating or capital costs as prescribed by the regulations. 

&#160; 

&#160; Ontario 

&#160; 

&#160; Long-term care facilities, or nursing homes, receive government funding, are licensed under the Long-Term Care Homes Act, 2007 and are governed by the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care. The LTC Homes Act places a strong emphasis on the protection of residents. 

&#160; 

&#160; Retirement homes in Ontario are regulated under the Retirement Homes Act, 2010 (the &#8220;Act&#8221;). Retirement homes do not receive any government funding; residents pay for tenancy and services received at retirement homes. Residents may access publicly-funded external care services at the home from funded external suppliers. 

&#160; 

&#160; A license is required to operate a retirement home. Licenses must be applied for and are non-transferable. Applications for licenses are directed to the Registrar of the Retirement Homes Regulatory Authority (&#8220;RHRA&#8221;). All of the homes in which we have an interest in Ontario are licensed as retirement homes. One of the homes also has some licensed long-term care beds. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; Licenses can have conditions imposed upon them or can be suspended in circumstances where the operator is found to be in contravention of the Act. There is no set renewal period for licenses, and they terminate according to the terms set out in the license itself, or if one of the enumerated triggering mechanisms occurs (for example, if the operator ceases to have controlling interest in the license). 

&#160; 

&#160; The licensee of a retirement home must ensure that the care provided by the home meets prescribed standards. The Act and its regulations include a number of detailed provisions with respect to care standards, safety plans in the event of emergency or infectious disease, temperature control, cleanliness, pest control, maintenance, food preparations, risk of resident falls and behavioral management, among other things. A care plan must be developed for each resident of the home (with their consent). The Act establishes a Residents&#8217; Bill of Rights, which provides residents with a list of rights, such as the right to participate fully in decision-making with respect to care, the right not to be restrained and the right to know what care services are provided and their cost. The Residents&#8217; Bill of Rights can be enforced as a contract. 

&#160; 

&#160; The Act requires a report to the RHRA when any person has reasonable grounds to suspect abuse of a resident by anyone, or neglect of a resident by staff. Following a report to the RHRA, there is a mandatory inspection carried out by the RHRA, which results in a report that is posted on the RHRA&#8217;s public website. The most recent report must also be posted in the subject home, and be readily available for review if requested thereafter. The Registrar of the RHRA can receive complaints about a retirement home contravening a provision of the Act, and if such a complaint is received, it must be reviewed promptly. The Registrar may ask the retirement home that is the subject of the complaint to provide information relevant to the complaint, and has the power to conduct an inspection, issue a written warning or take other action as prescribed in the regulations. 

&#160; 

&#160; The Registrar of the RHRA has the power to inspect a retirement home at any time without warning or issue a warrant to ensure compliance with the Act. Compliance inspections occur at least every three years. The Registrar has the power to make a variety of orders including, for example, the imposition of a fine or an order revoking the operator&#8217;s license. There is an appeal process in place with respect to orders made by the Registrar. The Act also enumerates offenses, such as operating without a license, and provides for penalties for offenses. 

&#160; 

&#160; British Columbia 

&#160; 

&#160; The Community Care and Assisted Living Act, the Residential Care Regulation, and the Community Care and Assisted Living Regulation (together, the &#8220;B.C. Act&#8221;) regulate &#8220;community care facilities&#8221; (long-term care facilities) in substantially the same manner as retirement homes are regulated under the Ontario Act. The B.C. Act defines such a facility as premises used for the purpose of supervising vulnerable persons who require three or more prescribed services (from a list that includes regular assistance with activities of daily living; distribution of medication; management of cash resources; monitoring of food intake; structured behavior management and intervention; and psychosocial or physical rehabilitative therapy). 

&#160; 

&#160; The B.C. Act also creates a separate regime for regulating &#8220;assisted living residences,&#8221; which are facilities providing at least one but not more than two prescribed care services. Assisted living residences are designed for those who can live independently, but who require assistance with certain activities. Unlike community care facilities, assisted living residences must be registered with the registrar of assisted living residences, but do not require a license. Nevertheless, assisted living residences must be operated in a manner that does not jeopardize the health or safety of its residents. If the registrar has reason to believe a residence is not being operated in accordance with this standard, the registrar may inspect the assisted living residence and may suspend or cancel a registration. Most of the residences in which we have an interest in B.C. are assisted living residences, with one being an independent living residence. 

&#160; 

&#160; Independent living residences offer housing and hospitality services for retired adults who are functionally independent and able to direct their own care. Services available for residents can include, for example, meals, housekeeping, monitoring and emergency support, social and recreational opportunities, and transportation. 

&#160; 

&#160; Qu&#233;bec 

&#160; 

&#160; In Qu&#233;bec, retirement homes are regulated by the Act respecting Health Services and Social Services (the &#8220;Act&#8221;) and the Regulation respecting the conditions for obtaining a certificate of compliance and the operating standards for a private seniors' residence (the &#8220;Regulation&#8221;), which refer to &#8220;private seniors&#8217; residences.&#8221; Private seniors&#8217; residences in Qu&#233;bec are required to obtain a certificate of compliance. The Regulation is currently in the process of being amended. 

&#160; 

&#160; A certificate of compliance is issued for a period of three years, is renewable and can only be validly transferred to another person with the written permission of the regional licensing agency. An agency may revoke a temporary certificate, or revoke or refuse to issue or renew a certificate of compliance if, among other things, the operator fails to comply with the Act and the Regulation, although the decision of the applicable agency can be contested before the Administrative Tribunal of Qu&#233;bec. The agency may also 

&#160; 

order the residence to take corrective measures, further to an inspection, complaint and/or investigation. The agency is authorized to inspect a residence, at any reasonable time of day, in order to ascertain whether it complies with the Act and the Regulation. 

&#160; 

&#160; Private seniors&#8217; residences may belong to either or both of the following two categories: those offering services to independent elderly persons and those offering services to semi-independent elderly persons. The operator of a residence must, for each category, comply with the applicable criteria and standards, with some exceptions provided for residences with fewer than six or ten rooms or apartments. The Act and the Regulation set out a number of detailed provisions with respect to residents&#8217; health and safety (including mandatory call-for-help systems, safety plans in the event of fire or infectious disease, health assessments, permissible control measures, as well as administration and distribution of medication), meal services and recreation, content of residents&#8217; files, disclosure of information to residents, and staffing requirements, among other things. 

&#160; 

&#160; Other Related Laws 

&#160; 

&#160; Privacy 

&#160; 

&#160; The services provided in our facilities are generally subject to privacy legislation in Canada, including, in certain provinces, privacy laws specifically related to personal health information. Although the obligations of custodians of personal health information in the various provinces differ to some extent, they all include the obligation to protect the information. The organizations with which we have management agreements may be the custodian of personal health information/personal information collected in connection with the operation of our facilities. 

&#160; 

&#160; Privacy laws in Canada are consent-based and require the implementation of a privacy program involving policies, procedures and the designation of an individual or team with primary responsibility for a custodian&#8217;s privacy law compliance. Mandatory breach notification to the affected individuals is a requirement under some laws. Mandatory breach notification to the applicable regulator is a requirement under some laws, although not yet in effect in some provinces. Some laws require notification where personal health information/personal information is processed or stored outside of Canada. One provincial law (in Quebec) provides for fines where an organization fails to perform required due diligence before outsourcing activities involving personal information to a service provider outside of the province. 

&#160; 

&#160; Some privacy regulators in Canada have order-making authority and others are ombudspersons who make recommendations that may only be enforced by a court. Under a number of privacy laws, a finding by a regulator that a custodian has breached the law creates a right to apply to a court for money damages. In some provinces there is a statutory civil cause of action for breach of privacy. In other provinces, the courts have recognized a limited common law cause of action for breach of privacy. 

&#160; 

&#160; The powers of privacy regulators and penalties for violations of privacy law vary according to the applicable law or are left to the courts. To date, penalties have generally not been monetary, although that is changing with civil actions for breach of privacy and may change further as a result of class action activity. Regulators have the authority to make public the identity of a custodian that has been found to have committed a breach, so that there is a reputational risk associated with privacy law violations even where no monetary damages are incurred. The notification of patients (mandatory under some privacy laws) and other activities required to manage a privacy breach can give rise to significant costs. 

&#160; 

&#160; Other Legislation 

&#160; 

&#160; Retirement homes may be subject to residential tenancy laws, such that there can be restrictions on rent increases and termination of tenancies, for instance. Other provincial legislation applicable to occupational health and safety, public health, and the provision of community health care and funded long-term/post-acute care may also apply to retirement homes. In addition, municipal laws with respect to matters such as fire safety, food services and zoning would also apply. In this connection in Ontario, the Building Code and Fire Code have been amended to include various safety measures such as mandatory sprinklers, self-closing doors and increased voice communication system requirements, with grace periods for compliance with some of the requirements. 

&#160; 

&#160; In Quebec, the Safety Code was amended in December 2015 to require that private seniors&#8217; residences be equipped with a fire alarm and detection system, as well as the installation of a sprinkler system in certain private seniors&#8217; residences. The amendments come into force March 18, 2016, except regarding the installation of the sprinkler system, which has a five year grace period, and comes into force December 2, 2020.

&#160; 

Federal Income Tax Considerations 

&#160; 

&#160; 

The following summary of the taxation of the Company and the material federal tax consequences to the holders of our debt and equity securities is for general information only and is not tax advice. This summary does not address all aspects of taxation that may be relevant to certain types of holders of stock or securities (including, but not limited to, insurance companies, tax-exempt entities, financial institutions or broker-dealers, persons holding shares of common stock as part of a hedging, integrated conversion, or constructive sale transaction or a straddle, traders in securities that use a mark-to-market method of accounting for their securities, investors in pass-through entities and foreign corporations and persons who are not citizens or residents of the United States). 

&#160; 

This summary does not discuss all of the aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to you in light of your particular investment or other circumstances. In addition, this summary does not discuss any state or local income taxation or foreign income taxation or other tax consequences. This summary is based on current U.S. federal income tax law. Subsequent developments in U.S. federal income tax law, including changes in law or differing interpretations, which may be applied retroactively, could have a material effect on the U.S. federal income tax consequences of purchasing, owning and disposing of our securities as set forth in this summary. Before you purchase our securities, you should consult your own tax advisor regarding the particular U.S. federal, state, local, foreign and other tax consequences of acquiring, owning and selling our securities. 

&#160; 

General 

&#160; 

We elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust (a &#8220;REIT&#8221;) commencing with our first taxable year. We intend to continue to operate in such a manner as to qualify as a REIT, but there is no guarantee that we will qualify or remain qualified as a REIT for subsequent years. Qualification and taxation as a REIT depends upon our ability to meet a variety of qualification tests imposed under federal income tax law with respect to income, assets, distribution level and diversity of share ownership as discussed below under &#8220;&#8212; Qualification as a REIT.&#8221; There can be no assurance that we will be owned and organized and will operate in a manner so as to qualify or remain qualified. 

&#160; 

In any year in which we qualify as a REIT, in general, we will not be subject to federal income tax on that portion of our REIT taxable income or capital gain that is distributed to stockholders. We may, however, be subject to tax at normal corporate rates on any taxable income or capital gain not distributed. If we elect to retain and pay income tax on our net long-term capital gains, stockholders are required to include their proportionate share of our undistributed long-term capital gains in income, but they will receive a refundable credit for their share of any taxes paid by us on such gain. 

&#160; 

Despite the REIT election, we may be subject to federal income and excise tax as follows: 

&#160; 

&#8226; To the extent that we do not distribute all of our net capital gain or distribute at least 90%, but less than 100%, of our &#8220;REIT taxable income,&#8221; as adjusted, we will be subject to tax on the undistributed amount at regular corporate tax rates; 

&#160; 

&#8226; We may be subject to the &#8220;alternative minimum tax&#8221; (the &#8220;AMT&#8221;) on certain tax preference items to the extent that the AMT exceeds our regular tax; 

&#160; 

&#8226; If we have net income from the sale or other disposition of &#8220;foreclosure property&#8221; that is held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business or other non-qualifying income from foreclosure property, such income will be taxed at the highest corporate rate; 

&#160; 

&#8226; Any net income from prohibited transactions (which are, in general, sales or other dispositions of property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business, other than dispositions of foreclosure property and dispositions of property due to an involuntary conversion) will be subject to a 100% tax; 

&#160; 

&#8226; If we fail to satisfy either the 75% or 95% gross income tests (as discussed below), but nonetheless maintain our qualification as a REIT because certain other requirements are met, we will be subject to a 100% tax on an amount equal to (1) the gross income attributable to the greater of (i) 75% of our gross income over the amount of qualifying gross income for purposes of the 75% gross income test (discussed below) or (ii) 95% of our gross income over the amount of qualifying gross income for purposes of the 95% gross income test (discussed below) multiplied by (2) a fraction intended to reflect our profitability; 

&#160; 

&#8226; If we fail to distribute during each year at least the sum of (1) 85% of our REIT ordinary income for the year, (2) 95% of our REIT capital gain net income for such year (other than capital gain that we elect to retain and pay tax on) and (3) any undistributed taxable income from preceding periods, we will be subject to a 4% excise tax on the excess of such required distribution over amounts actually distributed; 

&#160; 

&#8226; We will be subject to a 100% tax on the amount of any rents from real property, deductions or excess interest paid to us by any of our &#8220;taxable REIT subsidiaries&#8221; that would be reduced through reallocation under certain federal income tax principles in order to more clearly reflect income of the taxable REIT subsidiary. See &#8220;&#8212; Qualification as a REIT &#8212; Investments in Taxable REIT Subsidiaries;&#8221; and 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#8226; We may be subject to the corporate &#8220;alternative minimum tax&#8221; on any items of tax preference, including any deductions of net operating losses. 

&#160; 

If we acquire any assets from a corporation, which is or has been a &#8220;C&#8221; corporation, in a carryover basis transaction, we could be liable for specified liabilities that are inherited from the &#8220;C&#8221; corporation. A &#8220;C&#8221; corporation is generally defined as a corporation that is required to pay full corporate level federal income tax. If we recognize gain on the disposition of the assets during the five-year period beginning on the date on which the assets were acquired by us, then, to the extent of the assets&#8217; &#8220;built-in gain&#8221; (i.e., the excess of the fair market value of the asset over the adjusted tax basis in the asset, in each case determined as of the beginning of the five-year period), we will be subject to tax on the gain at the highest regular corporate rate applicable. The results described in this paragraph with respect to the recognition of built-in gain assume that the built-in gain assets, at the time the built-in gain assets were subject to a conversion transaction (either where a &#8220;C&#8221; corporation elected REIT status or a REIT acquired the assets from a &#8220;C&#8221; corporation), were not treated as sold to an unrelated party and gain recognized. For those properties that are subject to the built-in-gains tax, if triggered by a sale within the five-year period beginning on the date on which the properties were acquired by us, then the potential amount of built-in-gains tax will be an additional factor when considering a possible sale of the properties. See Note 18 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the built-in gains tax. 

&#160; 

Qualification as a REIT 

&#160; 

A REIT is defined as a corporation, trust or association: 

&#160; 

(1) which is managed by one or more trustees or directors; 

&#160; 

(2) the beneficial ownership of which is evidenced by transferable shares or by transferable certificates of beneficial interest; 

&#160; 

(3) which would be taxable as a domestic corporation but for the federal income tax law relating to REITs; 

&#160; 

(4) which is neither a financial institution nor an insurance company; 

&#160; 

(5) the beneficial ownership of which is held by 100 or more persons in each taxable year of the REIT except for its first taxable year; 

&#160; 

(6) not more than 50% in value of the outstanding stock of which is owned during the last half of each taxable year, excluding its first taxable year, directly or indirectly, by or for five or fewer individuals (which includes certain entities) (the &#8220;Five or Fewer Requirement&#8221;); and 

&#160; 

(7) which meets certain income and asset tests described below. 

&#160; 

Conditions (1) to (4), inclusive, must be met during the entire taxable year and condition (5) must be met during at least 335 days of a taxable year of 12 months or during a proportionate part of a taxable year of less than 12 months. For purposes of conditions (5) and (6), pension funds and certain other tax-exempt entities are treated as individuals, subject to a &#8220;look-through&#8221; exception in the case of condition (6). 

&#160; 

Based on publicly available information, we believe we have satisfied the share ownership requirements set forth in (5) and (6) above. In addition, Article VI of our by-laws provides for restrictions regarding ownership and transfer of shares. These restrictions are intended to assist us in continuing to satisfy the share ownership requirements described in (5) and (6) above. These restrictions, however, may not ensure that we will, in all cases, be able to satisfy the share ownership requirements described in (5) and (6) above. 

&#160; 

We have complied with, and will continue to comply with, regulatory rules to send annual letters to certain of our stockholders requesting information regarding the actual ownership of our stock. If, despite sending the annual letters, we do not know, or after exercising reasonable diligence would not have known, whether we failed to meet the Five or Fewer Requirement, we will be treated as having met the Five or Fewer Requirement. If we fail to comply with these regulatory rules, we will be subject to a monetary penalty. If our failure to comply was due to intentional disregard of the requirement, the penalty would be increased. However, if our failure to comply were due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect, no penalty would be imposed. 

&#160; 

We may own a number of properties through wholly owned subsidiaries. A corporation will qualify as a &#8220;qualified REIT subsidiary&#8221; if 100% of its stock is owned by a REIT, and the REIT does not elect to treat the subsidiary as a taxable REIT subsidiary. A &#8220;qualified REIT subsidiary&#8221; will not be treated as a separate corporation, and all assets, liabilities and items of income, deductions and credits of a &#8220;qualified REIT subsidiary&#8221; will be treated as assets, liabilities and items (as the case may be) of the REIT. A 

&#160; 

&#8220;qualified REIT subsidiary&#8221; is not subject to federal income tax, and our ownership of the voting stock of a qualified REIT subsidiary will not violate the restrictions against ownership of securities of any one issuer which constitute more than 10% of the value or total voting power of such issuer or more than 5% of the value of our total assets, as described below under &#8220;&#8212; Asset Tests.&#8221; 

&#160; 

If we invest in a partnership, a limited liability company or a trust taxed as a partnership or as a disregarded entity, we will be deemed to own a proportionate share of the partnership&#8217;s, limited liability company&#8217;s or trust&#8217;s assets. Likewise, we will be treated as receiving our share of the income and loss of the partnership, limited liability company or trust, and the gross income will retain the same character in our hands as it has in the hands of the partnership, limited liability company or trust. These &#8220;look-through&#8221; rules apply for purposes of the income tests and assets tests described below. 

&#160; 

Income Tests. There are two separate percentage tests relating to our sources of gross income that we must satisfy for each taxable year. 

&#160; 

&#8226; At least 75% of our gross income (excluding gross income from certain sales of property held primarily for sale) must be directly or indirectly derived each taxable year from &#8220;rents from real property,&#8221; other income from investments relating to real property or mortgages on real property or certain income from qualified temporary investments. 

&#160; 

&#8226; At least 95% of our gross income (excluding gross income from certain sales of property held primarily for sale) must be directly or indirectly derived each taxable year from any of the sources qualifying for the 75% gross income test and from dividends (including dividends from taxable REIT subsidiaries) and interest. 

&#160; 

As to transactions entered into in taxable years beginning after October 22, 2004 and on or prior to July 30, 2008, any of our income from a &#8220;clearly identified&#8221; hedging transaction that is entered into by us in the normal course of business, directly or indirectly, to manage the risk of interest rate movements, price changes or currency fluctuations with respect to borrowings or obligations incurred or to be incurred by us, or such other risks that are prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service, is excluded from the 95% gross income test. 

&#160; 

For transactions entered into after July 30, 2008, any of our income from a &#8220;clearly identified&#8221; hedging transaction that is entered into by us in the normal course of business, directly or indirectly, to manage the risk of interest rate movements, price changes or currency fluctuations with respect to borrowings or obligations incurred or to be incurred by us is excluded from the 95% and 75% gross income tests. 

&#160; 

For transactions entered into after July 30, 2008, any of our income from a &#8220;clearly identified&#8221; hedging transaction entered into by us primarily to manage risk of currency fluctuations with respect to any item of income or gain that is included in gross income in the 95% and 75% gross income tests is excluded from the 95% and 75% gross income tests. 

&#160; 

In general, a hedging transaction is &#8220;clearly identified&#8221; if (1) the transaction is identified as a hedging transaction before the end of the day on which it is entered into and (2) the items or risks being hedged are identified &#8220;substantially contemporaneously&#8221; with the hedging transaction. An identification is not substantially contemporaneous if it is made more than 35 days after entering into the hedging transaction. 

&#160; 

As to gains and items of income recognized after July 30, 2008, &#8220;passive foreign exchange gain&#8221; for any taxable year will not constitute gross income for purposes of the 95% gross income test and &#8220;real estate foreign exchange gain&#8221; for any taxable year will not constitute gross income for purposes of the 75% gross income test. Real estate foreign exchange gain is foreign currency gain (as defined in Internal Revenue Code Section 988(b)(1)) which is attributable to: (i) any qualifying item of income or gain for purposes of the 75% gross income test; (ii) the acquisition or ownership of obligations secured by mortgages on real property or interests in real property; or (iii) becoming or being the obligor under obligations secured by mortgages on real property or on interests in real property. Real estate foreign exchange gain also includes Internal Revenue Code Section 987 gain attributable to a qualified business unit (a &#8220;QBU&#8221;) of a REIT if the QBU itself meets the 75% gross income test for the taxable year and the 75% asset test at the close of each quarter that the REIT has directly or indirectly held the QBU. Real estate foreign exchange gain also includes any other foreign currency gain as determined by the Secretary of the Treasury. Passive foreign exchange gain includes all real estate foreign exchange gain and foreign currency gain which is attributable to: (i) any qualifying item of income or gain for purposes of the 95% gross income test; (ii) the acquisition or ownership of obligations; (iii) becoming or being the obligor under obligations; and (iv) any other foreign currency gain as determined by the Secretary of the Treasury. 

&#160; 

Generally, other than income from &#8220;clearly identified&#8221; hedging transactions entered into by us in the normal course of business, any foreign currency gain derived by us from dealing, or engaging in substantial and regular trading, in securities will constitute gross income which does not qualify under the 95% or 75% gross income tests. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Rents received by us will qualify as &#8220;rents from real property&#8221; for purposes of satisfying the gross income tests for a REIT only if several conditions are met: 

&#160; 

&#8226; The amount of rent must not be based in whole or in part on the income or profits of any person, although rents generally will not be excluded merely because they are based on a fixed percentage or percentages of receipts or sales. 

&#160; 

&#8226; Rents received from a tenant will not qualify as rents from real property if the REIT, or an owner of 10% or more of the REIT, also directly or constructively owns 10% or more of the tenant, unless the tenant is our taxable REIT subsidiary and certain other requirements are met with respect to the real property being rented. 

&#160; 

&#8226; If rent attributable to personal property leased in connection with a lease of real property is greater than 15% of the total rent received under the lease, then the portion of rent attributable to such personal property will not qualify as &#8220;rents from real property.&#8221; 

&#160; 

&#8226; For rents to qualify as rents from real property, we generally must not furnish or render services to tenants, other than through a taxable REIT subsidiary or an &#8220;independent contractor&#8221; from whom we derive no income, except that we may directly provide services that are &#8220;usually or customarily rendered&#8221; in the geographic area in which the property is located in connection with the rental of real property for occupancy only, or are not otherwise considered &#8220;rendered to the occupant for his convenience.&#8221; 

&#160; 

&#8226; For taxable years beginning after July 30, 2008, the REIT may lease &#8220; qualified health care properties&#8221; on an arm&#8217;s-length basis to a taxable REIT subsidiary if the property is operated on behalf of such subsidiary by a person who qualifies as an &#8220;independent contractor&#8221; and who is, or is related to a person who is, actively engaged in the trade or business of operating health care facilities for any person unrelated to us or our taxable REIT subsidiary, an &#8220; eligible independent contractor . &#8221; Generally, the rent that the REIT receives from the taxable REIT subsidiary will be treated as &#8220;rents from real property.&#8221; &#160; A &#8220;qualified health care property&#8221; includes any real property and any personal property that is, or is necessary or incidental to the use of, a hospital, nursing facility, assisted living facility, congregate care facility, qualified continuing care facility, or other licensed facility that extends medical or nursing or ancillary services to patients and is operated by a provider of such services that is eligible for participation in the Medicare program with respect to such facility. 

&#160; 

A REIT is permitted to render a de minimis amount of impermissible services to tenants and still treat amounts received with respect to that property as rent from real property. The amount received or accrued by the REIT during the taxable year for the impermissible services with respect to a property may not exceed 1% of all amounts received or accrued by the REIT directly or indirectly from the property. The amount received for any service or management operation for this purpose shall be deemed to be not less than 150% of the direct cost of the REIT in furnishing or rendering the service or providing the management or operation. Furthermore, impermissible services may be furnished to tenants by a taxable REIT subsidiary subject to certain conditions, and we may still treat rents received with respect to the property as rent from real property. 

&#160; 

The term &#8220;interest&#8221; generally does not include any amount if the determination of the amount depends in whole or in part on the income or profits of any person, although an amount generally will not be excluded from the term &#8220;interest&#8221; solely by reason of being based on a fixed percentage of receipts or sales. 

&#160; 

If we fail to satisfy one or both of the 75% or 95% gross income tests for any taxable year, we may nevertheless qualify as a REIT for such year if we are eligible for relief. These relief provisions generally will be available if (1) following our identification of the failure, we file a schedule for such taxable year describing each item of our gross income, and (2) the failure to meet such tests was due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect. 

&#160; 

It is not now possible to determine the circumstances under which we may be entitled to the benefit of these relief provisions. If these relief provisions apply, a 100% tax is imposed on an amount equal to (a) the gross income attributable to (1) 75% of our gross income over the amount of qualifying gross income for purposes of the 75% income test and (2) 95% of our gross income over the amount of qualifying gross income for purposes of the 95% income test, multiplied by (b) a fraction intended to reflect our profitability. 

&#160; 

The Secretary of the Treasury is given broad authority to determine whether particular items of income or gain qualify or not under the 75% and 95% gross income tests, or are to be excluded from the measure of gross income for such purposes. 

&#160; 

Asset Tests. Within 30 days after the close of each quarter of our taxable year, we must also satisfy several tests relating to the nature and diversification of our assets determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. At least 75% of the value of our total assets must be represented by real estate assets, cash, cash items (including receivables arising in the ordinary course of our operation), government securities and qualified temporary investments. Although the remaining 25% of our assets generally may be invested without restriction, we are prohibited from owning securities representing more than 10% of either the vote (the &#8220;10% vote test&#8221;) or value (the &#8220;10% value test&#8221;) of the outstanding securities of any issuer other than a qualified REIT subsidiary, 

&#160; 

another REIT or a taxable REIT subsidiary. Further, no more than 25% (20% for tax years beginning after 2017) of the total assets may be represented by securities of one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries (the &#8220;25% asset test&#8221;) and no more than 5% of the value of our total assets may be represented by securities of any non-governmental issuer other than a qualified REIT subsidiary (the &#8220;5% asset test&#8221;), another REIT or a taxable REIT subsidiary. Each of the 10% vote test, the 10% value test and the 25% and 5% asset tests must be satisfied at the end of each quarter. There are special rules which provide relief if the value related tests are not satisfied due to changes in the value of the assets of a REIT. 

&#160; 

Certain items are excluded from the 10% value test, including: (1) straight debt securities (as defined in Internal Revenue Code Section 1361(c)(5)) of an issuer (including straight debt that provides certain contingent payments); (2) any loan to an individual or an estate; (3) any rental agreement described in Section 467 of the Internal Revenue Code, other than with a &#8220;related person&#8221;; (4) any obligation to pay rents from real property; (5) certain securities issued by a state or any subdivision thereof, the District of Columbia, a foreign government, or any political subdivision thereof, or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico; (6) any security issued by a REIT; and (7) any other arrangement that, as determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, is excepted from the definition of security (&#8220;excluded securities&#8221;). Special rules apply to straight debt securities issued by corporations and entities taxable as partnerships for federal income tax purposes. If a REIT, or its taxable REIT subsidiary, holds (1) straight debt securities of a corporate or partnership issuer and (2) securities of such issuer that are not excluded securities and have an aggregate value greater than 1% of such issuer&#8217;s outstanding securities, the straight debt securities will be included in the 10% value test. 

&#160; 

A REIT&#8217;s interest as a partner in a partnership is not treated as a security for purposes of applying the 10% value test to securities issued by the partnership. Further, any debt instrument issued by a partnership will not be a security for purposes of applying the 10% value test (1) to the extent of the REIT&#8217;s interest as a partner in the partnership and (2) if at least 75% of the partnership&#8217;s gross income (excluding gross income from prohibited transactions) would qualify for the 75% gross income test. For purposes of the 10% value test, a REIT&#8217;s interest in a partnership&#8217;s assets is determined by the REIT&#8217;s proportionate interest in any securities issued by the partnership (other than the excluded securities described in the preceding paragraph). 

&#160; 

For taxable years beginning after July 30, 2008, if the REIT or its QBU uses a foreign currency as its functional currency, the term &#8220;cash&#8221; includes such foreign currency, but only to the extent such foreign currency is (i) held for use in the normal course of the activities of the REIT or QBU which give rise to items of income or gain that are included in the 95% and 75% gross income tests or are directly related to acquiring or holding assets qualifying under the 75% asset test, and (ii) not held in connection with dealing or engaging in substantial and regular trading in securities. 

&#160; 

With respect to corrections of failures as to violations of the 10% vote test, the 10% value test or the 5% asset test, a REIT may avoid disqualification as a REIT by disposing of sufficient assets to cure a violation that does not exceed the lesser of 1% of the REIT&#8217;s assets at the end of the relevant quarter or $10,000,000, provided that the disposition occurs within six months following the last day of the quarter in which the REIT first identified the assets. For violations of any of the REIT asset tests due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect that exceed the thresholds described in the preceding sentence, a REIT can avoid disqualification as a REIT after the close of a taxable quarter by taking certain steps, including disposition of sufficient assets within the six month period described above to meet the applicable asset test, paying a tax equal to the greater of $50,000 or the highest corporate tax rate multiplied by the net income generated by the non-qualifying assets during the period of time that the assets were held as non-qualifying assets and filing a schedule with the Internal Revenue Service that describes the non-qualifying assets. 

&#160; 

Investments in Taxable REIT Subsidiaries. &#160; REITs may own more than 10% of the voting power and value of securities in taxable REIT subsidiaries. Unlike a qualified REIT subsidiary, other disregarded entity or partnership, the income and assets of a taxable REIT subsidiary are not attributable to the REIT for purposes of satisfying the income and asset ownership requirements applicable to REIT qualification. We and any taxable corporate entity in which we own an interest are allowed to jointly elect to treat such entity as a &#8220;taxable REIT subsidiary.&#8221; 

&#160; 

Certain of our subsidiaries have elected to be treated as a taxable REIT subsidiary. Taxable REIT subsidiaries are subject to full corporate level federal taxation on their earnings but are permitted to engage in certain types of activities that cannot be performed directly by REITs without jeopardizing their REIT status. Our taxable REIT subsidiaries will attempt to minimize the amount of these taxes, but there can be no assurance whether or the extent to which measures taken to minimize taxes will be successful. To the extent our taxable REIT subsidiaries are required to pay federal, state or local taxes, the cash available for distribution as dividends to us from our taxable REIT subsidiaries will be reduced. 

&#160; 

The amount of interest on related-party debt that a taxable REIT subsidiary may deduct is limited. Further, a 100% tax applies to any interest payments by a taxable REIT subsidiary to its affiliated REIT to the extent the interest rate is not commercially reasonable. A taxable REIT subsidiary is permitted to deduct interest payments to unrelated parties without any of these restrictions. 

&#160; 

The Internal Revenue Service may reallocate costs between a REIT and its taxable REIT subsidiary where there is a lack of arm&#8217;s-length dealing between the parties. Any deductible expenses allocated away from a taxable REIT subsidiary would increase its tax liability. Further, any amount by which a REIT understates its deductions and overstates those of its taxable REIT subsidiary may, subject to certain exceptions, be subject to a 100% tax. Additional taxable REIT subsidiary elections may be made in the future for additional entities in which we obtain an interest. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; Annual Distribution Requirements. In order to avoid being taxed as a regular corporation, we are required to make distributions (other than capital gain distributions) to our stockholders which qualify for the dividends paid deduction in an amount at least equal to (1) the sum of (i) 90% of our &#8220;REIT taxable income&#8221; (computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gain) and (ii) 90% of the after-tax net income, if any, from foreclosure property, minus (2) a portion of certain items of non-cash income. These distributions must be paid in the taxable year to which they relate, or in the following taxable year if declared before we timely file our tax return for that year and if paid on or before the first regular distribution payment after such declaration. Prior to recently enacted legislation, with respect to all REITs the amount distributed could not be preferential. This means that every stockholder of the class of stock to which a distribution is made must be treated the same as every other stockholder of that class, and no class of stock may be treated otherwise than in accordance with its dividend rights as a class (the &#8220;preferential dividend rule&#8221;). Beginning in tax years after 2014, the preferential dividend rule no longer applies to publicly offered REITs, however, the rule is still applicable to other entities taxed as REITs, which would include several of our subsidiaries. To the extent that we do not distribute all of our net capital gain or distribute at least 90%, but less than 100%, of our &#8220;REIT taxable income,&#8221; as adjusted, we will be subject to tax on the undistributed amount at regular corporate tax rates. As discussed above, we may be subject to an excise tax if we fail to meet certain other distribution requirements. We believe we have satisfied the annual distribution requirements for the year of our initial REIT election and each year thereafter through the year ended December 31, 2015. Although we intend to make timely distributions sufficient to satisfy these annual distribution requirements for subsequent years, economic, market, legal, tax or other factors could limit our ability to meet those requirements. See &#8220;Item 1A &#8212; Risk Factors.&#8221; 

&#160; 

It is also possible that, from time to time, we may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet the 90% distribution requirement, or to distribute such greater amount as may be necessary to avoid income and excise taxation, due to, among other things, (1) timing differences between (i) the actual receipt of income and actual payment of deductible expenses and (ii) the inclusion of income and deduction of expenses in arriving at our taxable income, or (2) the payment of severance benefits that may not be deductible to us. In the event that timing differences occur, we may find it necessary to arrange for borrowings or, if possible, pay dividends in the form of taxable stock dividends in order to meet the distribution requirement. 

&#160; 

Under certain circumstances, in the event of a deficiency determined by the Internal Revenue Service, we may be able to rectify a resulting failure to meet the distribution requirement for a year by paying &#8220;deficiency dividends&#8221; to stockholders in a later year, which may be included in our deduction for distributions paid for the earlier year. Thus, we may be able to avoid being taxed on amounts distributed as deficiency dividends; however, we will be required to pay applicable penalties and interest based upon the amount of any deduction taken for deficiency dividend distributions. 

&#160; 

&#160; Failure to Qualify as a REIT 

&#160; 

If we fail to qualify for taxation as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to federal income tax, including any applicable alternative minimum tax, on our taxable income at regular corporate rates. Distributions to stockholders in any year in which we fail to qualify as a REIT will not be deductible nor will any particular amount of distributions be required to be made in any year. All distributions to stockholders will be taxable as ordinary income to the extent of current and accumulated earnings and profits allocable to these distributions and, subject to certain limitations, will be eligible for the dividends received deduction for corporate stockholders. Unless entitled to relief under specific statutory provisions, we also will be disqualified from taxation as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost. It is not possible to state whether in all circumstances we would be entitled to statutory relief. Failure to qualify for even one year could result in our need to incur indebtedness or liquidate investments in order to pay potentially significant resulting tax liabilities. 

&#160; 

In addition to the relief described above under &#8220;&#8212; Income Tests&#8221; and &#8220;&#8212; Asset Tests,&#8221; relief is available in the event that we violate a provision of the Internal Revenue Code that would result in our failure to qualify as a REIT if: (1) the violation is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect; (2) we pay a penalty of $50,000 for each failure to satisfy the provision; and (3) the violation does not include a violation described under &#8220;&#8212; Income Tests&#8221; or &#8220;&#8212; Asset Tests&#8221; above. It is not now possible to determine the circumstances under which we may be entitled to the benefit of these relief provisions. 

&#160; 

Federal Income Taxation of Holders of Our Stock 

&#160; 

Treatment of Taxable U.S. Stockholders. The following summary applies to you only if you are a &#8220;U.S. stockholder.&#8221; A &#8220;U.S. stockholder&#8221; is a holder of shares of stock who, for United States federal income tax purposes, is: 

&#160; 

&#8226; a citizen or resident of the United States; 

&#160; 

&#8226; a corporation, partnership or other entity classified as a corporation or partnership for these purposes, created or organized in or under the laws of the United States or of any political subdivision of the United States, including any state; 

&#160; 

&#8226; an estate, the income of which is subject to United States federal income taxation regardless of its source; or 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#8226; a trust, if, in general, a U.S. court is able to exercise primary supervision over the trust&#8217;s administration and one or more U.S. persons, within the meaning of the Internal Revenue Code, has the authority to control all of the trust&#8217;s substantial decisions. 

&#160; 

So long as we qualify for taxation as a REIT, distributions on shares of our stock made out of the current or accumulated earnings and profits allocable to these distributions (and not designated as capital gain dividends) will be includable as ordinary income for federal income tax purposes. None of these distributions will be eligible for the dividends received deduction for U.S. corporate stockholders. 

&#160; 

Generally, the current maximum marginal rate of tax payable by individuals on dividends received from corporations that are subject to a corporate level of tax is 20%. Except in limited circumstances, this tax rate will not apply to dividends paid to you by us on our shares, because generally we are not subject to federal income tax on the portion of our REIT taxable income or capital gains distributed to our stockholders. The reduced maximum federal income tax rate will apply to that portion, if any, of dividends received by you with respect to our shares that are attributable to: (1) dividends received by us from non-REIT corporations or other taxable REIT subsidiaries; (2) income from the prior year with respect to which we were required to pay federal corporate income tax during the prior year (if, for example, we did not distribute 100% of our REIT taxable income for the prior year); or (3) the amount of any earnings and profits that were distributed by us and accumulated in a non-REIT year. 

&#160; 

Distributions that are designated as capital gain dividends will be taxed as long-term capital gains (to the extent they do not exceed our actual net capital gain for the taxable year), without regard to the period for which you held our stock. However, if you are a corporation, you may be required to treat a portion of some capital gain dividends as ordinary income. 

&#160; 

If we elect to retain and pay income tax on any net long-term capital gain, you would include in income, as long-term capital gain, your proportionate share of this net long-term capital gain. You would also receive a refundable tax credit for your proportionate share of the tax paid by us on such retained capital gains, and you would have an increase in the basis of your shares of our stock in an amount equal to your includable capital gains less your share of the tax deemed paid. 

&#160; 

You may not include in your federal income tax return any of our net operating losses or capital losses. Federal income tax rules may also require that certain minimum tax adjustments and preferences be apportioned to you. In addition, any distribution declared by us in October, November or December of any year on a specified date in any such month shall be treated as both paid by us and received by you on December 31 of that year, provided that the distribution is actually paid by us no later than January 31 of the following year. 

&#160; 

We will be treated as having sufficient earnings and profits to treat as a dividend any distribution up to the amount required to be distributed in order to avoid imposition of the 4% excise tax discussed under &#8220;&#8212; General&#8221; and &#8220;&#8212; Qualification as a REIT &#8212; Annual Distribution Requirements&#8221; above. As a result, you may be required to treat as taxable dividends certain distributions that would otherwise result in a tax-free return of capital. Moreover, any &#8220;deficiency dividend&#8221; will be treated as a dividend (an ordinary dividend or a capital gain dividend, as the case may be), regardless of our earnings and profits. Any other distributions in excess of current or accumulated earnings and profits will not be taxable to you to the extent these distributions do not exceed the adjusted tax basis of your shares of our stock. You will be required to reduce the tax basis of your shares of our stock by the amount of these distributions until the basis has been reduced to zero, after which these distributions will be taxable as capital gain, if the shares of our stock are held as capital assets. The tax basis as so reduced will be used in computing the capital gain or loss, if any, realized upon sale of the shares of our stock. Any loss upon a sale or exchange of shares of our stock which were held for six months or less (after application of certain holding period rules) will generally be treated as a long-term capital loss to the extent you previously received capital gain distributions with respect to these shares of our stock. 

&#160; 

Upon the sale or exchange of any shares of our stock to or with a person other than us or a sale or exchange of all shares of our stock (whether actually or constructively owned) with us, you will generally recognize capital gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized on the sale or exchange and your adjusted tax basis in these shares of our stock. This gain will be capital gain if you held these shares of our stock as a capital asset. 

&#160; 

If we redeem any of your shares in us, the treatment can only be determined on the basis of particular facts at the time of redemption. In general, you will recognize gain or loss (as opposed to dividend income) equal to the difference between the amount received by you in the redemption and your adjusted tax basis in your shares redeemed if such redemption: (1) results in a &#8220;complete termination&#8221; of your interest in all classes of our equity securities; (2) is a &#8220;substantially disproportionate redemption&#8221;; or (3) is &#8220;not essentially equivalent to a dividend&#8221; with respect to you. In applying these tests, you must take into account your ownership of all classes of our equity securities (e.g., common stock, preferred stock, depositary shares and warrants). You also must take into account any equity securities that are considered to be constructively owned by you. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

If, as a result of a redemption by us of your shares, you no longer own (either actually or constructively) any of our equity securities or only own (actually and constructively) an insubstantial percentage of our equity securities, then it is probable that the redemption of your shares would be considered &#8220;not essentially equivalent to a dividend&#8221; and, thus, would result in gain or loss to you. However, whether a distribution is &#8220;not essentially equivalent to a dividend&#8221; depends on all of the facts and circumstances, and if you rely on any of these tests at the time of redemption, you should consult your tax advisor to determine their application to the particular situation. 

&#160; 

Generally, if the redemption does not meet the tests described above, then the proceeds received by you from the redemption of your shares will be treated as a distribution taxable as a dividend to the extent of the allocable portion of current or accumulated earnings and profits. If the redemption is taxed as a dividend, your adjusted tax basis in the redeemed shares will be transferred to any other shareholdings in us that you own. If you own no other shareholdings in us, under certain circumstances, such basis may be transferred to a related person, or it may be lost entirely. 

&#160; 

Gain from the sale or exchange of our shares held for more than one year is generally taxed at a maximum long-term capital gain rate of 20% in the case of stockholders who are individuals and 35% in the case of stockholders that are corporations. Pursuant to Internal Revenue Service guidance, we may classify portions of our capital gain dividends as gains eligible for the long-term capital gains rate or as gain taxable to individual stockholders at a maximum rate of 25%. Capital losses recognized by a stockholder upon the disposition of our shares held for more than one year at the time of disposition will be considered long-term capital losses, and are generally available only to offset capital gain income of the stockholder but not ordinary income (except in the case of individuals, who may offset up to $3,000 of ordinary income each year). 

&#160; 

An additional tax of 3.8% generally will be imposed on the &#8220;net investment income&#8221; of U.S. stockholders who meet certain requirements and are individuals, estates or certain trusts. Among other items, &#8220;net investment income&#8221; generally includes gross income from dividends and net gain attributable to the disposition of certain property, such as shares of our common stock or warrants. In the case of individuals, this tax will only apply to the extent such individual&#8217;s modified adjusted gross income exceeds $200,000 ($250,000 for married couples filing a joint return and surviving spouses, and $125,000 for married individuals filing a separate return). U.S. stockholders should consult their tax advisors regarding the possible applicability of this additional tax in their particular circumstances. 

&#160; 

Treatment of Tax-Exempt U.S. Stockholders. Tax-exempt entities, including qualified employee pension and profit sharing trusts and individual retirement accounts (&#8220;Exempt Organizations&#8221;), generally are exempt from federal income taxation. However, they are subject to taxation on their unrelated business taxable income (&#8220;UBTI&#8221;). The Internal Revenue Service has issued a published revenue ruling that dividend distributions from a REIT to an exempt employee pension trust do not constitute UBTI, provided that the shares of the REIT are not otherwise used in an unrelated trade or business of the exempt employee pension trust. Based on this ruling, amounts distributed by us to Exempt Organizations generally should not constitute UBTI. However, if an Exempt Organization finances its acquisition of the shares of our stock with debt, a portion of its income from us will constitute UBTI pursuant to the &#8220;debt financed property&#8221; rules. Likewise, a portion of the Exempt Organization&#8217;s income from us would constitute UBTI if we held a residual interest in a real estate mortgage investment conduit. 

&#160; 

In addition, in certain circumstances, a pension trust that owns more than 10% of our stock is required to treat a percentage of our dividends as UBTI. This rule applies to a pension trust holding more than 10% of our stock only if: (1) the percentage of our income that is UBTI (determined as if we were a pension trust) is at least 5%; (2) we qualify as a REIT by reason of the modification of the Five or Fewer Requirement that allows beneficiaries of the pension trust to be treated as holding shares in proportion to their actuarial interests in the pension trust; and (3) either (i) one pension trust owns more than 25% of the value of our stock, or (ii) a group of pension trusts individually holding more than 10% of the value of our stock collectively own more than 50% of the value of our stock. 

&#160; 

Backup Withholding and Information Reporting. Under certain circumstances, you may be subject to backup withholding at applicable rates on payments made with respect to, or cash proceeds of a sale or exchange of, shares of our stock. Backup withholding will apply only if you: (1) fail to provide a correct taxpayer identification number, which if you are an individual, is ordinarily your social security number; (2) furnish an incorrect taxpayer identification number; (3) are notified by the Internal Revenue Service that you have failed to properly report payments of interest or dividends; or (4) fail to certify, under penalties of perjury, that you have furnished a correct taxpayer identification number and that the Internal Revenue Service has not notified you that you are subject to backup withholding. 

&#160; 

Backup withholding will not apply with respect to payments made to certain exempt recipients, such as corporations and tax-exempt organizations. You should consult with a tax advisor regarding qualification for exemption from backup withholding, and the procedure for obtaining an exemption. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Rather, the amount of any backup withholding with respect to a payment to a stockholder will be allowed as a credit against such stockholder&#8217;s United States federal income tax liability and may entitle such stockholder to a refund, provided that the required information is provided to the Internal Revenue Service. In addition, withholding a portion of capital gain distributions made to stockholders may be required for stockholders who fail to certify their non-foreign status. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Taxation of Foreign Stockholders. The following summary applies to you only if you are a foreign person. The federal taxation of foreign persons is a highly complex matter that may be affected by many considerations. 

&#160; 

Except as discussed below, distributions to you of cash generated by our real estate operations in the form of ordinary dividends, but not by the sale or exchange of our capital assets, generally will be subject to U.S. withholding tax at a rate of 30%, unless an applicable tax treaty reduces that tax and you file with us the required form evidencing the lower rate. 

&#160; 

In general, you will be subject to United States federal income tax on a graduated rate basis rather than withholding with respect to your investment in our stock if such investment is &#8220;effectively connected&#8221; with your conduct of a trade or business in the United States. A corporate foreign stockholder that receives income that is, or is treated as, effectively connected with a United States trade or business may also be subject to the branch profits tax, which is payable in addition to regular United States corporate income tax. The following discussion will apply to foreign stockholders whose investment in us is not so effectively connected. We expect to withhold United States income tax, as described below, on the gross amount of any distributions paid to you unless (1) you file an Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI with us claiming that the distribution is &#8220;effectively connected&#8221; or (2) certain other exceptions apply. 

&#160; 

Distributions by us that are attributable to gain from the sale or exchange of a United States real property interest will be taxed to you under the Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act of 1980 (&#8220;FIRPTA&#8221;) as if these distributions were gains &#8220;effectively connected&#8221; with a United States trade or business. Accordingly, you will be taxed at the normal capital gain rates applicable to a U.S. stockholder on these amounts, subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax and a special alternative minimum tax in the case of nonresident alien individuals. Distributions subject to FIRPTA may also be subject to a branch profits tax in the hands of a corporate foreign stockholder that is not entitled to treaty exemption. 

&#160; 

We will be required to withhold from distributions subject to FIRPTA, and remit to the Internal Revenue Service, 35% of designated capital gain dividends, or, if greater, 35% of the amount of any distributions that could be designated as capital gain dividends. In addition, if we designate prior distributions as capital gain dividends, subsequent distributions, up to the amount of the prior distributions not withheld against, will be treated as capital gain dividends for purposes of withholding. 

&#160; 

Any capital gain dividend with respect to any class of stock that is &#8220;regularly traded&#8221; on an established securities market will be treated as an ordinary dividend if the foreign stockholder did not own more than 10% of such class of stock at any time during the taxable year. Foreign stockholders generally will not be required to report distributions received from us on U.S. federal income tax returns and all distributions treated as dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes (including any such capital gain dividends) will be subject to a 30% U.S. withholding tax (unless reduced under an applicable income tax treaty) as discussed above. In addition, the branch profits tax will not apply to such distributions. 

&#160; 

Unless our shares constitute a &#8220;United States real property interest&#8221; within the meaning of FIRPTA or are effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business, a sale of our shares by you generally will not be subject to United States taxation. Though, under the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 (the &#8220;PATH Act&#8221;), enacted on December 18, 2015, even if our shares were to constitute a &#8220;United States real property interest,&#8221; non-U.S. stockholders that are &#8220;qualified foreign pension funds&#8221; (or are owned by a qualified foreign pension) meeting certain requirements may be exempt from FIRPTA withholding on the sale or disposition of our shares. Our shares will not constitute a United States real property interest if we qualify as a &#8220;domestically controlled REIT.&#8221; We believe that we, and expect to continue to, qualify as a domestically controlled REIT. A domestically controlled REIT is a REIT in which at all times during a specified testing period less than 50% in value of its shares is held directly or indirectly by foreign stockholders. Generally, under the PATH Act, we are permitted to assume that holders of less than 5% of our shares at all times during a specified testing period are U.S. persons. However, if you are a nonresident alien individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more during the taxable year and certain other conditions apply, you will be subject to a 30% tax on such capital gains. In any event, a purchaser of our shares from you will not be required under FIRPTA to withhold on the purchase price if the purchased shares are &#8220;regularly traded&#8221; on an established securities market or if we are a domestically controlled REIT. Otherwise, under FIRPTA, the purchaser may be required to withhold 10% (increased to 15% under the PATH Act for distributions occurring after February 16, 2016) of the purchase price and remit such amount to the Internal Revenue Service. 

&#160; 

Backup withholding tax and information reporting will generally not apply to distributions paid to you outside the United States that are treated as: (1) dividends to which the 30% or lower treaty rate withholding tax discussed above applies; (2) capital gains dividends; or (3) distributions attributable to gain from the sale or exchange by us of U.S. real property interests. Payment of the proceeds of a sale of stock within the United States or conducted through certain U.S. related financial intermediaries is subject to both backup withholding and information reporting unless the beneficial owner certifies under penalties of perjury that he or she is not a U.S. person (and the payor does not have actual knowledge that the beneficial owner is a U.S. person) or otherwise established an exemption. You may obtain a refund of any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules by filing the appropriate claim for refund with the Internal Revenue Service. 

&#160; 

&#160; Withholding tax at a rate of 30% will be imposed on certain payments to you or certain foreign financial institutions (including investment funds) and other non-US persons receiving payments on your behalf, including distributions in respect of shares of our 

&#160; 

stock and gross proceeds from the sale of shares of our stock, if you or such institutions fail to comply with certain due diligence, disclosure and reporting rules, as set forth in recently issued Treasury regulations. Accordingly, the entity through which shares of our stock are held will affect the determination of whether such withholding is required. Withholding currently applies to payments of dividends made after June 30, 2014, and will apply to payments of gross proceeds from a sale of shares of our stock made after December 31, 2018. Stockholders that are otherwise eligible for an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. withholding taxes with respect to such dividends and proceeds will be required to seek a refund from the Internal Revenue Service to obtain the benefit of such exemption or reduction. Additional requirements and conditions may be imposed pursuant to an intergovernmental agreement, if and when entered into, between the United States and such institution&#8217;s home jurisdiction. We will not pay any additional amounts to any stockholders in respect of any amounts withheld. You are encouraged to consult with your tax advisor regarding U.S. withholding taxes and the application of the recently issued Treasury regulations in light of your particular circumstances. 

&#160; 

U.S. Federal Income Taxation of Holders of Depositary Shares 

&#160; 

Owners of our depositary shares will be treated as if you were owners of the series of preferred stock represented by the depositary shares. Thus, you will be required to take into account the income and deductions to which you would be entitled if you were a holder of the underlying series of preferred stock. 

&#160; 

Conversion or Exchange of Shares for Preferred Stock. No gain or loss will be recognized upon the withdrawal of preferred stock in exchange for depositary shares and the tax basis of each share of preferred stock will, upon exchange, be the same as the aggregate tax basis of the depositary shares exchanged. If you held your depositary shares as a capital asset at the time of the exchange for shares of preferred stock, the holding period for your shares of preferred stock will include the period during which you owned the depositary shares. 

&#160; 

U.S. Federal Income and Estate Taxation of Holders of Our Debt Securities 

&#160; 

The following is a general summary of the United States federal income tax consequences and, in the case that you are a holder that is a non-U.S. holder, as defined below, the United States federal estate tax consequences, of purchasing, owning and disposing of debt securities periodically offered under one or more indentures (the &#8220;notes&#8221;). This summary assumes that you hold the notes as capital assets. This summary applies to you only if you are the initial holder of the notes and you acquire the notes for a price equal to the issue price of the notes. The issue price of the notes is the first price at which a substantial amount of the notes is sold other than to bond houses, brokers or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents or wholesalers. In addition, this summary does not consider any foreign, state, local or other tax laws that may be applicable to us or a purchaser of the notes. 

&#160; 

U.S. Holders 

&#160; 

The following summary applies to you only if you are a U.S. holder, as defined below. 

&#160; 

Definition of a U.S. Holder. A &#8220;U.S. holder&#8221; is a beneficial owner of a note or notes that is for United States federal income tax purposes: 

&#160; 

&#8226; a citizen or resident of the United States; 

&#160; 

&#8226; a corporation, partnership or other entity classified as a corporation or partnership for these purposes, created or organized in or under the laws of the United States or of any political subdivision of the United States, including any state; 

&#160; 

&#8226; an estate, the income of which is subject to United States federal income taxation regardless of its source; or 

&#160; 

&#8226; a trust, if, in general, a U.S. court is able to exercise primary supervision over the trust&#8217;s administration and one or more U.S. persons, within the meaning of the Internal Revenue Code, has the authority to control all of the trust&#8217;s substantial decisions. 

&#160; 

Payments of Interest. Stated interest on the notes generally will be taxed as ordinary interest income from domestic sources at the time it is paid or accrues in accordance with your method of accounting for tax purposes. 

&#160; 

Sale, Exchange or Other Disposition of Notes. The adjusted tax basis in your note acquired at a premium will generally be your cost. You generally will recognize taxable gain or loss when you sell or otherwise dispose of your notes equal to the difference, if any, between: 

&#160; 

&#8226; the amount realized on the sale or other disposition, less any amount attributable to any accrued interest, which will be taxable 

&#160; 

in the manner described under &#8220;&#8212; Payments of Interest&#8221; above; and 

&#160; 

&#8226; your adjusted tax basis in the notes. 

&#160; 

Your gain or loss generally will be capital gain or loss. This capital gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss if at the time of the sale or other disposition you have held the notes for more than one year. Subject to limited exceptions, your capital losses cannot be used to offset your ordinary income (except in the case of individuals, who may offset up to $3,000 of ordinary income each year). 

&#160; 

Backup Withholding and Information Reporting. In general, &#8220;backup withholding&#8221; may apply to any payments made to you of principal and interest on your note, and to payment of the proceeds of a sale or other disposition of your note before maturity, if you are a non-corporate U.S. holder and: (1) fail to provide a correct taxpayer identification number, which if you are an individual, is ordinarily your social security number; (2) furnish an incorrect taxpayer identification number; (3) are notified by the Internal Revenue Service that you have failed to properly report payments of interest or dividends; or (4) fail to certify, under penalties of perjury, that you have furnished a correct taxpayer identification number and that the Internal Revenue Service has not notified you that you are subject to backup withholding. 

&#160; 

The amount of any reportable payments, including interest, made to you (unless you are an exempt recipient) and the amount of tax withheld, if any, with respect to such payments will be reported to you and to the Internal Revenue Service for each calendar year. You should consult your tax advisor regarding your qualification for an exemption from backup withholding and the procedures for obtaining such an exemption, if applicable. The backup withholding tax is not an additional tax and will be credited against your U.S. federal income tax liability, provided that correct information is provided to the Internal Revenue Service. 

&#160; 

Non-U.S. Holders 

&#160; 

The following summary applies to you if you are a beneficial owner of a note and are not a U.S. holder, as defined above (a &#8220;non-U.S. holder&#8221;). 

&#160; 

Special rules may apply to certain non-U.S. holders such as &#8220;controlled foreign corporations,&#8221; &#8220;passive foreign investment companies&#8221; and &#8220;foreign personal holding companies.&#8221; Such entities are encouraged to consult their tax advisors to determine the United States federal, state, local and other tax consequences that may be relevant to them. 

&#160; 

U.S. Federal Withholding Tax. Subject to the discussion below, U.S. federal withholding tax will not apply to payments by us or our paying agent, in its capacity as such, of principal and interest on your notes under the &#8220;portfolio interest&#8221; exception of the Internal Revenue Code, provided that: 

&#160; 

&#8226; you do not, directly or indirectly, actually or constructively, own 10% or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of our stock entitled to vote; 

&#160; 

&#8226; you are not (1) a controlled foreign corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes that is related, directly or indirectly, to us through sufficient stock ownership, as provided in the Internal Revenue Code, or (2) a bank receiving interest described in Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code; 

&#160; 

&#8226; such interest is not effectively connected with your conduct of a U.S. trade or business; and 

&#160; 

&#8226; you provide a signed written statement, under penalties of perjury, which can reliably be related to you, certifying that you are not a U.S. person within the meaning of the Internal Revenue Code and providing your name and address to: 

&#160; 

&#8226; us or our paying agent; or 

&#160; 

&#8226; &#160; a securities clearing organization, bank or other financial institution that holds customers&#8217; securities in the ordinary course of its trade or business and holds your notes on your behalf and that certifies to us or our paying agent under penalties of perjury that it, or the bank or financial institution between it and you, has received from you your signed, written statement and provides us or our paying agent with a copy of such statement. 

&#160; 

Treasury regulations provide that: 

&#160; 

&#8226; if you are a foreign partnership, the certification requirement will generally apply to your partners, and you will be required to provide certain information; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#8226; if you are a foreign trust, the certification requirement will generally be applied to you or your beneficial owners depending on whether you are a &#8220;foreign complex trust,&#8221; &#8220;foreign simple trust,&#8221; or &#8220;foreign grantor trust&#8221; as defined in the Treasury regulations; and 

&#160; 

&#8226; look-through rules will apply for tiered partnerships, foreign simple trusts and foreign grantor trusts. 

&#160; 

If you are a foreign partnership or a foreign trust, you should consult your own tax advisor regarding your status under these Treasury regulations and the certification requirements applicable to you. 

&#160; 

If you cannot satisfy the portfolio interest requirements described above, payments of interest will be subject to the 30% United States withholding tax, unless you provide us with a properly executed (1) Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN claiming an exemption from or reduction in withholding under the benefit of an applicable treaty or (2) Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI stating that interest paid on the note is not subject to withholding tax because it is effectively connected with your conduct of a trade or business in the United States. Alternative documentation may be applicable in certain circumstances. 

&#160; 

If you are engaged in a trade or business in the United States and interest on a note is effectively connected with the conduct of that trade or business, you will be required to pay United States federal income tax on that interest on a net income basis (although you will be exempt from the 30% withholding tax provided the certification requirement described above is met) in the same manner as if you were a U.S. person, except as otherwise provided by an applicable tax treaty. If you are a foreign corporation, you may be required to pay a branch profits tax on the earnings and profits that are effectively connected to the conduct of your trade or business in the United States. 

&#160; 

&#160; Withholding tax at a rate of 30% will be imposed on payments of interest (including original issue discount) and gross proceeds of sale in respect of debt instruments to you or certain foreign financial institutions (including investment funds) and other non-US persons receiving payments on your behalf, if you or such institutions fail to comply with certain due diligence, disclosure and reporting rules, as set forth in recently issued Treasury regulations. However, the Treasury regulations generally exempt from such withholding requirement obligations, such as debt instruments, issued before July 1, 2014, provided that any material modification of such an obligation made after such date will result in such obligation being considered newly issued as of the effective date of such modification. These withholding rules are generally effective with respect to payments of interest made after June 30, 2014, and with respect to proceeds of sales received after December 31, 2018. We will not pay any additional amounts to any holders or our debt instruments in respect of any amounts withheld. You are encouraged to consult with your tax advisor regarding U.S. withholding taxes and the application of the recently issued Treasury regulations in light of your particular circumstances. 

&#160; 

Sale, Exchange or other Disposition of Notes. You generally will not have to pay U.S. federal income tax on any gain or income realized from the sale, redemption, retirement at maturity or other disposition of your notes, unless: 

&#160; 

&#8226; in the case of gain, you are an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more during the taxable year of the sale or other disposition of your notes, and specific other conditions are met; 

&#160; 

&#8226; you are subject to tax provisions applicable to certain United States expatriates; or 

&#160; 

&#8226; the gain is effectively connected with your conduct of a U.S. trade or business. 

&#160; 

If you are engaged in a trade or business in the United States, and gain with respect to your notes is effectively connected with the conduct of that trade or business, you generally will be subject to U.S. income tax on a net basis on the gain. In addition, if you are a foreign corporation, you may be subject to a branch profits tax on your effectively connected earnings and profits for the taxable year, as adjusted for certain items. 

&#160; 

U.S. Federal Estate Tax. If you are an individual and are not a U.S. citizen or a resident of the United States, as specially defined for U.S. federal estate tax purposes, at the time of your death, your notes will generally not be subject to the U.S. federal estate tax, unless, at the time of your death (1) you owned actually or constructively 10% or more of the total combined voting power of all our classes of stock entitled to vote, or (2) interest on the notes is effectively connected with your conduct of a U.S. trade or business. 

&#160; 

Backup Withholding and Information Reporting. Backup withholding will not apply to payments of principal or interest made by us or our paying agent, in its capacity as such, to you if you have provided the required certification that you are a non-U.S. holder as described in &#8220;&#8212; U.S. Federal Withholding Tax&#8221; above, and provided that neither we nor our paying agent have actual knowledge that you are a U.S. holder, as described in &#8220;&#8212; U.S. Holders&#8221; above. We or our paying agent may, however, report payments of interest on the notes. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

The gross proceeds from the disposition of your notes may be subject to information reporting and backup withholding tax. If you sell your notes outside the United States through a non-U.S. office of a non-U.S. broker and the sales proceeds are paid to you outside the United States, then the U.S. backup withholding and information reporting requirements generally will not apply to that payment. However, U.S. information reporting, but not backup withholding, will apply to a payment of sales proceeds, even if that payment is made outside the United States, if you sell your notes through a non-U.S. office of a broker that: 

&#160; 

&#8226; is a U.S. person, as defined in the Internal Revenue Code; 

&#160; 

&#8226; derives 50% or more of its gross income in specific periods from the conduct of a trade or business in the United States; 

&#160; 

&#8226; is a &#8220;controlled foreign corporation&#8221; for U.S. federal income tax purposes; or 

&#160; 

&#8226; is a foreign partnership, if at any time during its tax year, one or more of its partners are U.S. persons who in the aggregate hold more than 50% of the income or capital interests in the partnership, or the foreign partnership is engaged in a U.S. trade or business, unless the broker has documentary evidence in its files that you are a non-U.S. person and certain other conditions are met or you otherwise establish an exemption. If you receive payments of the proceeds of a sale of your notes to or through a U.S. office of a broker, the payment is subject to both U.S. backup withholding and information reporting unless you provide a Form W-8BEN certifying that you are a non-U.S. person or you otherwise establish an exemption. 

&#160; 

You should consult your own tax advisor regarding application of backup withholding in your particular circumstance and the availability of and procedure for obtaining an exemption from backup withholding. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules from a payment to you will be allowed as a refund or credit against your U.S. federal income tax liability, provided the required information is furnished to the Internal Revenue Service. 

&#160; 

U.S. Federal Income and Estate Taxation of Holders of Our Warrants 

&#160; 

Exercise of Warrants. You will not generally recognize gain or loss upon the exercise of a warrant. Your basis in the debt securities, preferred stock, depositary shares or common stock, as the case may be, received upon the exercise of the warrant will be equal to the sum of your adjusted tax basis in the warrant and the exercise price paid. Your holding period in the debt securities, preferred stock, depositary shares or common stock, as the case may be, received upon the exercise of the warrant will not include the period during which the warrant was held by you. 

&#160; 

Expiration of Warrants. Upon the expiration of a warrant, you will recognize a capital loss in an amount equal to your adjusted tax basis in the warrant. 

&#160; 

Sale or Exchange of Warrants. Upon the sale or exchange of a warrant to a person other than us, you will recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between the amount realized on the sale or exchange and your adjusted tax basis in the warrant. Such gain or loss will be capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the warrant was held for more than one year. Upon the sale of the warrant to us, the Internal Revenue Service may argue that you should recognize ordinary income on the sale. You are advised to consult your own tax advisors as to the consequences of a sale of a warrant to us. 

&#160; 

Potential Legislation or Other Actions Affecting Tax Consequences 

&#160; 

Current and prospective securities holders should recognize that the present federal income tax treatment of an investment in us may be modified by legislative, judicial or administrative action at any time and that any such action may affect investments and commitments previously made. The rules dealing with federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the Internal Revenue Service and the Treasury Department, resulting in revisions of regulations and revised interpretations of established concepts as well as statutory changes. Revisions in federal tax laws and interpretations of these laws could adversely affect the tax consequences of an investment in us. 

&#160; 

State, Local and Foreign Taxes 

&#160; 

We, and holders of our debt and equity securities, may be subject to state, local or foreign taxation in various jurisdictions, including those in which we or they transact business, own property or reside. It should be noted that we own properties located in a number of state, local and foreign jurisdictions, and may be required to file tax returns in some or all of those jurisdictions. The state, local or foreign tax treatment of us and holders of our debt and equity securities may not conform to the U.S. federal income tax consequences discussed above. Consequently, you are urged to consult your advisor regarding the application and effect of state, local and foreign tax laws with respect to any investment in our securities. 

&#160; 

&#160; Changes in applicable tax regulations could negatively affect our financial results. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

The Company is subject to taxation in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Because the U.S. maintains a worldwide corporate tax system, the foreign and U.S. tax systems are somewhat interdependent. Longstanding international tax norms that determine each country&#8217;s jurisdiction to tax cross-border international trade are evolving, such as the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting project (&#8220;BEPS&#34;) currently being undertaken by the G8, G20, and Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Tax changes pursuant to BEPS could reduce the ability of our foreign subsidiaries to deduct for foreign tax purposes the interest they pay on loans from the Company, thereby increasing the foreign tax liability of the subsidiaries; it is also possible that foreign countries could increase their withholding taxes on dividends and interest. Given the unpredictability of these possible changes and their potential interdependency, it is very difficult to assess the overall effect of such potential tax changes on our earnings and cash flow, but such changes could adversely impact our financial results.
