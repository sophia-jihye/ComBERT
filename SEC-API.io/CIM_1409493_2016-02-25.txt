 Item 1. Business 

The Company 

We are a publicly traded real estate investment trust, or REIT, that is primarily engaged in the business of investing, on a leveraged basis, in a diversified portfolio of mortgage assets, including Agency RMBS, Non-Agency RMBS, Agency CMBS, residential mortgage loans, and real estate related securities. We were incorporated in Maryland on June 01, 2007 and commenced operations on November 21, 2007. We invest, either directly or indirectly through our subsidiaries, in RMBS, residential mortgage loans, Agency CMBS, commercial mortgage loans, real estate-related securities and various other asset classes. We have elected and believe that we are organized and have operated in a manner that enables us to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code. If we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on our taxable income that is distributed to our stockholders. To ensure we qualify as a REIT, no person may own more than 9.8% of the outstanding shares of any class of our common stock, unless our Board of Directors waives this limitation. 

Our Investment Strategy 

Our objective is to provide attractive risk-adjusted returns to our investors over the long-term, primarily through dividends and secondarily through capital appreciation. We intend to achieve this objective by investing in a diversified investment portfolio of RMBS, Agency CMBS, residential mortgage loans, commercial mortgage loans, real estate-related securities and various other asset classes, subject to maintaining our REIT status and exemption from registration under the 1940 Act. The MBS, and real estate-related securities we purchase may include investment-grade and non-investment grade classes, including the BB-rated, B-rated and non-rated classes. 

We make investment decisions based on various factors, including expected cash yield, relative value, risk-adjusted returns, current and projected credit fundamentals, current and projected macroeconomic considerations, current and projected supply and demand, credit and market risk concentration limits, liquidity, cost of financing and financing availability, as well as maintaining our REIT qualification and our exemption from registration under the 1940 Act. 

The Internalization 

In August 2015, we entered into agreements to internalize the Company&#8217;s management (the &#8220;Internalization&#8221;). Prior to the Internalization, we were managed by Fixed Income Discount Advisory Company, ( &#8220; FIDAC&#8221; ) , an investment advisor registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220;SEC&#8221;) and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Annaly Capital Management Inc. (&#8220;Annaly&#8221;). Pursuant to a transition services agreement that we entered into with FIDAC on August 5, 2015, we terminated the management agreement with FIDAC, and we hired a number of employees formerly employed by FIDAC or its affiliates. In addition, FIDAC agreed to continue to provide us a number of services previously provided under the Management Agreement at the same level, quality and time frame until December 31, 2015, at which time we had the option to extend the term of the Transition Services Agreement (the &#8220;TSA&#8221;) for up to three one-month extension periods. While our transition to internal management was completed by December 31, 2015, we extended the TSA for certain IT and internal audit services through the end of February 2016 primarily in connection with the completion of our 2015 financial audit. Those services are now completed, and FIDAC no longer provides any management services to us. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

As described in the Transition Services Agreement, we extended offers of employment to certain employees of FIDAC and its affiliates, including certain of FIDAC&#8217;s executive officers. We had also been party to an administrative services agreement (the &#8220;Administrative Services Agreement&#8221;) with RCap Securities, Inc. (&#8220; RCap &#8221;), a sister company of FIDAC, pursuant to which RCap provided trade clearing and brokerage services to us from time to time. Under the terms of the Transition Services Agreement and in furtherance of the completion of the Internalization, the Management Agreement and the Administrative Services Agreement were both terminated without the payment of any termination fee. 

On August 5, 2015, we also entered into a share repurchase agreement (the &#8220;Share Repurchase Agreement&#8221;) with Annaly. Pursuant to the terms of the Share Repurchase Agreement, we agreed to purchase the entire 4.4% stake owned by Annaly in the Company, and we are no longer an affiliate of Annaly. The repurchase of these shares owned by Annaly was settled on August 17, 2015. 

For more information regarding the Internalization, including information related to arrangements with our management team and the appointment of certain new members of management, please refer to our Current Report on Form 8-K filed on August 5, 2015. 

Business Overview 

Currently, we focus our investment activities primarily on acquiring Non-Agency and Agency MBS, and on purchasing residential mortgage loans. At December 31, 2015, based on the amortized cost balance of our interest earning assets, approximately 46% of our investment portfolio was Agency MBS, 20% of our investment portfolio was Non-Agency RMBS, and 34% of our investment portfolio was securitized residential mortgage loans. At December 31, 2014, based on the amortized cost balance of our interest earning assets, approximately 52% of our investment portfolio was Agency MBS, 16% of our investment portfolio was Non-Agency RMBS, and 32% of our investment portfolio was securitized residential mortgage loans. As discussed in &#8220; Management's Discussion and Analysis, &#8221; the change in the composition of our assets during 2015 relates primarily to the decrease in our Agency MBS assets to reduce interest rate exposure in our Agency portfolio. 

We have engaged in transactions with residential mortgage lending operations of leading commercial banks and other originators in which we identified and re-underwrote residential mortgage loans owned by such entities, and purchased and securitized such residential mortgage loans. In the past we have also acquired formerly AAA-rated Non-Agency RMBS and immediately re-securitized those securities. We sold the resulting AAA-rated super senior RMBS and retained the rated or unrated mezzanine and subordinate RMBS. 

&#160; 

Our investment decisions depend on prevailing market conditions and our business opportunities at such time and we expect that these will change over time. As a result, we cannot predict the percentage of our assets that will be invested in each asset class or whether we will invest in other classes of investments. We may change our investment strategy and policies without a vote of our stockholders. 

Our investment strategy is intended to take advantage of opportunities in the current interest rate and credit environment. We expect to adjust our strategy to changing market conditions by shifting our asset allocations across these various asset classes as interest rate and credit cycles change over time. We believe that our strategy will enable us to pay dividends and achieve capital appreciation throughout changing market cycles. We expect to take a long-term view of assets and liabilities, and our reported earnings and estimates of the fair value of our investments at the end of a financial reporting period will not significantly impact our objective of providing attractive risk-adjusted returns to our stockholders over the long-term. 

We use leverage to seek to increase our potential returns and to finance the acquisition of our assets. Our income is generated primarily by the difference, or net spread, between the income we earn on our assets and the cost of our borrowings. We finance our investments using a variety of financing sources including, when available, repurchase agreements, warehouse facilities and securitizations. We manage our debt and interest rate risk by utilizing interest rate hedges, such as interest rate swaps, caps, options and futures to reduce the effect of interest rate fluctuations related to our financing sources. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

We have elected to be taxed as a REIT and operate our business to be exempt from registration under the 1940 Act, and therefore we are required to invest a substantial majority of our assets in loans secured by mortgages on real estate and real estate-related assets. Subject to maintaining our REIT qualification and our 1940 Act exemption, we do not have any limitations on the amounts we may invest in any of our targeted asset classes. 

Investment Portfolio 

The following briefly discusses the principal types of investments that we have made and may in the future make: 

Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities 

We invest in mortgage pass-through certificates issued or guaranteed by Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac which are securities representing interests in &#8220;pools&#8221; of mortgage loans secured by residential real property where payments of both interest and principal, plus pre-paid principal, on the securities are made monthly to holders of the security, in effect passing through monthly payments made by the individual borrowers on the mortgage loans that underlie the securities, net of fees paid to the issuer/guarantor and servicers of the securities. We may also invest in collateralized mortgage obligations, or CMOs, issued by the Agencies. CMOs consist of multiple classes of securities, with each class bearing different stated maturity dates. Monthly payments of principal, including prepayments, are first returned to investors holding the shortest maturity class; investors holding the longer maturity classes receive principal only after the first class has been retired. 

Agency RMBS are collateralized by either fixed-rate mortgage loans, or FRMs, adjustable-rate mortgage loans, or ARMs, or hybrid ARMs. Hybrid ARMs are mortgage loans that have interest rates that are fixed for an initial period (typically three, five, seven or ten years) and thereafter reset at regular intervals subject to interest rate caps. Our allocation between securities collateralized by FRMs, ARMs or hybrid ARMs will depend on various factors including, but not limited to, relative value, expected future prepayment trends, supply and demand, costs of financing, costs of hedging, expected future interest rate volatility and the overall shape of the U.S. Treasury and interest rate swap yield curves. We take these factors into account when we make these types of investments. 

We invest in investment grade and non-investment grade RMBS. We evaluate certain credit characteristics of these types of securities, including, but not limited to, loan balance distribution, geographic concentration, property type, occupancy, periodic and lifetime caps, weighted-average loan-to-value and weighted-average Fair Isaac Corporation (&#8220;FICO&#8221;) score. Qualifying securities are then analyzed using base line expectations of expected prepayments and loss severities, the current state of the fixed-income market and broader economy in general. Losses and prepayments are stressed simultaneously based on a credit risk-based model. Securities in this portfolio are monitored for variance from expected prepayments, severities, losses and cash flow. The due diligence process is particularly important and costly with respect to newly formed originators or issuers because there may be little or no information publicly available about these entities and investments. 

We may invest in net interest margin securities, or NIMs, which are notes that are payable from and secured by excess cash flow that is generated by RMBS or home equity line of credit-backed securities, or HELOCs, after paying the debt service, expenses and fees on such securities. The excess cash flow represents all or a portion of a residual that is generally retained by the originator of the RMBS or HELOCs. The residual is illiquid, and thus the originator will monetize the position by securitizing the residual and issuing a NIM, usually in the form of a note that is backed by the excess cash flow generated in the underlying securitization. We may also invest in interest-only (&#8220;IO&#8221;) Agency and Non-Agency RMBS. These IO RMBS represent right to receive a specified proportion of the contractual interest flows of the collateral. 

We have invested in and intend to continue to invest in RMBS which are typically pass-through certificates created by the securitization of a pool of mortgage loans that are collateralized by residential real estate properties. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

The securitization process is typically governed by one or more of the rating agencies, including Fitch Ratings, Moody&#8217;s Investors Service, Standard &#38; Poor&#8217;s, and DBRS Limited which determine the respective bond class sizes, generally based on a sequential payment structure. Bonds that are rated from AAA to BBB by the rating agencies are considered &#8220;investment grade.&#8221; Bond classes that are subordinate to the BBB class or are unrated are considered &#8220;below-investment grade&#8221; or &#8220;non-investment grade.&#8221; The respective bond class sizes are determined based on the review of the underlying collateral by the rating agencies. The payments received from the underlying loans are used to make the payments on the RMBS. Based on the sequential payment priority, the risk of nonpayment for the investment grade RMBS is lower than the risk of nonpayment for the non-investment grade bonds. Accordingly, the investment grade class is typically sold at a lower yield compared to the non-investment grade or unrated classes which are sold at higher yields. 

Residential Mortgage Loans 

We have invested in and may in the future invest in residential mortgage loans (mortgage loans secured by residential real property) primarily through direct purchases from selected mortgage originators. We may enter into additional mortgage loan purchase agreements with a number of primary mortgage loan originators, including mortgage bankers, commercial banks, savings and loan associations, home builders, credit unions and mortgage conduits. We may also purchase mortgage loans on the secondary market. We expect these loans to be secured primarily by residential properties in the United States. 

The residential mortgage loans in which we have previously invested were primarily underwritten to our specifications. The originators performed the credit review of the borrowers, the appraisal of the properties securing the loan, and maintained other quality control procedures. We generally considered the purchase of loans when the originators have verified the borrowers&#8217; income and assets, verified their credit history and obtained appraisals of the properties. We or a third party performed an independent underwriting review of the processing, underwriting and loan closing methodologies that the originators used in qualifying a borrower for a loan. Depending on the size of the loans, we may not have reviewed all of the loans in a pool, but rather selected loans for underwriting review based upon specific risk-based criteria such as property location, loan size, effective loan-to-value ratio, borrower&#8217;s credit score and other criteria we believe to be important indicators of credit risk. Additionally, before the purchase of loans, we obtained representations and warranties from each originator stating that each loan was underwritten to our requirements or, in the event underwriting exceptions have been made, we were informed so that we may evaluate whether to accept or reject the loans. An originator who breaches these representations and warranties in making a loan that we purchase may be obligated to repurchase the loan from us. As added security, we used the services of a third-party document custodian to insure the quality and accuracy of all individual mortgage loan closing documents and to hold the documents in safekeeping. As a result, all of the original loan collateral documents that are signed by the borrower, other than the original credit verification documents, were examined, verified and held by the third-party document custodian. 

We may originate mortgage loans or provide other types of financing to the owners of real estate. We currently do not intend to establish a loan servicing platform, but expect to retain highly-rated servicers to service any mortgage loan portfolio we acquire. We have previously purchased certain residential mortgage loans on a servicing-retained basis. In the future, however, we may decide to originate mortgage loans or other types of financing, and we may elect to service mortgage loans and other types of assets. 

We conduct a due diligence review of each servicer before executing a servicing agreement. Servicing procedures would typically follow Fannie Mae guidelines but will be specified in each servicing agreement. 

We have in the past and may in the future acquire residential mortgage loans for our portfolio with the intention of either securitizing them and retaining them in our portfolio as securitized mortgage loans, or holding them in our residential mortgage loan portfolio. To facilitate the securitization or financing of our loans, we may create subordinate certificates, which provide a specified amount of credit enhancement. We may issue securities through securities underwriters and either retain these securities or finance them in the repurchase agreement market. There is no limit on the amount we may retain of these below-investment-grade subordinate certificates. Until we securitize our residential mortgage loans, we expect to finance our residential mortgage loan portfolio through the use of warehouse facilities and repurchase agreements. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

We withdrew our licenses in various jurisdictions to avoid not being in good standing under such licenses. The failure to maintain licenses or our good standing in various jurisdictions may temporarily require us to cease certain business strategies or modify the way in which we execute such strategies. For example, without the state licenses necessary to purchase residential mortgage loans, it was necessary for us to structure securitization transactions in a different manner than we may otherwise have chosen to do. This may, among other things, cause us to be unable to execute aspects of our business which may have otherwise been profitable, or we may incur additional costs related to such business operations that we otherwise would not have. We have reapplied for licenses in many jurisdictions and have been approved in most but not all jurisdictions. These conditions may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Agency CMBS 

The Agency CMBS we acquire are Ginnie Mae Construction Loan Certificates (&#8220;CLCs&#8221;) and the resulting project loan certificates (&#8220;PLCs&#8221;) when the construction project is complete. Each CLC is backed by a single multifamily property [or health care facilities]. The investor in the CLC is committed to fund the full amount of the project; however, actual funding generally occurs monthly as construction progresses on the property and only after each construction advance is insured by the FHA and issued by Ginnie Mae. The principal balance of the CLC increases as payments by the investor fund each construction advance. Each Ginnie Mae approved mortgage originator must provide the agency with supporting documentation regarding advances and disbursements before each construction advance is issued by Ginnie Mae. We also review this documentation prior to funding each Ginnie Mae guaranteed advance. Upon completion of the construction project the CLC is replaced with a PLC. Ginnie Mae guaranteed the timely payment of principal and interest on each CLC and PLC. This obligation is backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. 

As the holder of a CLC, we generally receive monthly payments of interest equal to a pro rata share of the interest payments on the underlying mortgage loan, less applicable servicing and guaranty fees. GNMA CLCs pay interest only during construction, and so there are no payments of principal. As a holder of a PLC, we generally receive monthly payments of principal and interest equal to the aggregate amount of the scheduled monthly principal and interest payments on the mortgage loans underlying that PLC, less applicable servicing and guaranty fees. In addition, such payments will include any prepayments and other unscheduled recoveries of principal of, and any prepayment penalties on, an underlying mortgage loan to the extent received by the Ginnie Mae Issuer during the month preceding the month of the payment. The mortgage loans underlying the PLCs generally contain a lock-out and prepayment penalty period of 10 years during which the related borrower must pay a prepayment penalty equal to a specified percentage of the principal amount of the mortgage loan in connection with voluntary and certain involuntary prepayments. Ginnie Mae does not guaranty the payment of prepayment penalties. 

Commercial Mortgage Loans 

We may invest in commercial mortgage loans consisting of first or second lien loans secured by multifamily properties, which are residential rental properties consisting of five or more dwelling units, or by mixed residential or other commercial properties, retail properties, office properties or industrial properties. These loans may or may not conform to the Agency guidelines. 

Other Asset-Backed Securities 

We may invest in securities issued in various collateralized debt obligation, ( &#8220; CDO &#8221; ), offerings to gain exposure to bank loans, corporate bonds, asset-backed securities, or ABS, mortgages, RMBS, CMBS, and other instruments. 

We may invest in CMBS, which are secured by, or evidence ownership interests in, a single commercial mortgage loan or a pool of mortgage loans secured by commercial properties. These securities may be senior, subordinated, investment grade or non-investment grade. We intend to invest in CMBS that will yield current interest income and where we consider the return of principal to be likely. We intend to acquire CMBS from private originators of, or investors in, mortgage loans, including savings and loan associations, mortgage bankers, commercial banks, finance companies, investment banks and other entities. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

Investment Guidelines 

We have adopted a set of investment guidelines that set out the asset classes, risk tolerance levels, diversification requirements and other criteria used to evaluate the merits of specific investments as well as the overall portfolio composition. Our investment committee (&#8220;Investment Committee&#8221;) periodically reviews our compliance with the investment guidelines. Our board also reviews our investment portfolio and related compliance with our investment policies and procedures and investment guidelines at each regularly scheduled Board of Directors meeting. 

Our Board of Directors and our Investment Committee have adopted the following guidelines for our investments and borrowings: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

No investment shall be made that would cause us to fail to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

No investment shall be made that would cause us to be regulated as an investment company under the 1940 Act; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

With the exception of real estate and housing, no single industry shall represent greater than 20% of the securities or aggregate risk exposure in our portfolio; and 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Investments in non-rated or deeply subordinated ABS or other securities that are non-qualifying assets for purposes of the 75% REIT asset test will be limited to an amount not to exceed 50% of our stockholders&#8217; equity. 

These investment guidelines may be changed by a majority of our Board of Directors without the approval of our stockholders. 

Our Financing Strategy 

We use leverage to increase potential returns to our stockholders. We are not required to maintain any specific debt-to-equity ratio as we believe the appropriate leverage for the particular assets we are financing depends on the credit quality and risk of those assets. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, our ratio of debt-to-equity was 4.0:1 and 3.8:1, respectively. For purposes of calculating this ratio, our equity is equal to the Total stockholders&#8217; equity on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition, and our debt consists of repurchase agreements and securitized debt. 

Subject to our maintaining our qualification as a REIT, we may use a number of sources to finance our investments, including the following: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Repurchase Agreements . We have financed certain of our assets through the use of repurchase agreements. We anticipate that repurchase agreements will be one of the sources we will use to achieve our desired amount of leverage for our residential real estate assets. We maintain formal relationships with many counterparties to obtain financing on favorable terms. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Warehouse Facilities . We have utilized and may in the future utilize credit facilities for capital needed to fund our assets. We intend to maintain formal relationships with multiple counterparties to maintain warehouse lines on favorable terms. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Securitization . We have acquired and may in the future acquire residential mortgage loans for our portfolio with the intention of securitizing them and retaining a portion of the securitized mortgage loans in our portfolio. To facilitate the securitization or financing of our loans, we generally create subordinate certificates, providing a specified amount of credit enhancement, which we intend to retain in our portfolio. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Re-REMICs. We have acquired and may in the future acquire Non-Agency RMBS for our portfolio with the intention of re-securitizing them and retaining a portion of the re-securitized Non-Agency RMBS in our portfolio, typically the subordinate certificates. To facilitate the re-securitization, we transfer Non-Agency RMBS to a special purpose entity that has been formed as a securitization vehicle that will issue multiple classes of securities secured by and payable from cash flows on the underlying Non-Agency RMBS. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

Our Interest Rate Hedging and Risk Management Strategy 

From time to time, we use derivative financial instruments to hedge all or a portion of the interest rate risk associated with our borrowings. Under the federal income tax laws applicable to REITs, we generally enter into certain transactions to hedge indebtedness that we incur, or plan to incur, to acquire or carry real estate assets. 

We may engage in a variety of interest rate management techniques that seek to mitigate changes in interest rates or other potential influences on the values of our assets. The federal income tax rules applicable to REITs may require us to implement certain of these techniques through a taxable REIT subsidiary, or TRS, that is fully subject to corporate income taxation. Our interest rate management techniques may include: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

puts and calls on securities or indices of securities; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Eurodollar futures contracts and options on such contracts; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

interest rate caps, swaps and swaptions; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

U.S. Treasury futures, contracts, securities and options on U.S. Treasury securities; and 

&#160; 

&#183; 

other similar transactions. 

We may attempt to reduce interest rate risks and to minimize exposure to interest rate fluctuations through the use of match funded financing structures, when appropriate, whereby we seek (i) to match the maturities of our debt obligations with the maturities of our assets and (ii) to match the interest rates on our investments with similar debt (i.e., floating rate assets are financed with floating rate debt and fixed-rate assets are financed with fixed-rate debt), directly or through the use of interest rate swaps, caps or other financial instruments, or through a combination of these strategies. This will allow us to minimize the risk that we have to refinance our liabilities before the maturities of our assets and to reduce the impact of changing interest rates on our earnings. 

Compliance with REIT and Investment Company Requirements 

We monitor our investment securities and the income from these securities and, to the extent we enter into hedging transactions, we monitor income from our hedging transactions as well, so as to ensure at all times that we maintain our qualification as a REIT and our exempt status under the 1940 Act. 

Employees 

As at December 31, 2015, we had 32 employees, all of whom were full-time. We believe that our relationship with our employees is good. None of our employees are unionized or represented under a collective bargaining agreement. 

Competition 

Our net income depends, in large part, on our ability to acquire assets at favorable spreads over our borrowing costs. In acquiring real estate-related assets, we will compete with other mortgage REITs, specialty finance companies, savings and loan associations, banks, mortgage bankers, insurance companies, mutual funds, institutional investors, investment banking firms, financial institutions, hedge funds, governmental bodies (including the U.S. Federal Reserve) and other entities. In addition, there are numerous mortgage REITs with similar asset acquisition objectives, and others that may be organized in the future. These other REITs will increase competition for the available supply of mortgage assets suitable for purchase. Many of our competitors are significantly larger than we are, have access to greater capital and other resources and may have other advantages over us. In addition, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments and establish more favorable relationships than we can. Current market conditions may attract more competitors, which may increase the competition for sources of financing. An increase in the competition for sources of funding could adversely affect the availability and cost of financing, and thereby adversely affect the market price of our common stock. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

Distributions 

To maintain our qualification as a REIT, we must distribute substantially all of our REIT taxable income to our stockholders each year, and we intend to distribute all such taxable income to satisfy such requirement. We have declared and paid regular quarterly dividends in the past and intend to do so in the future. The Board of Directors declared and paid a common stock cash dividend of $0.48 per common share for each quarter of 2015. The Board of Directors have also declared the first quarter 2016 dividend of $0.48 per share and expects to maintain a $0.48 per share dividend for the remaining three quarters of 2016.
