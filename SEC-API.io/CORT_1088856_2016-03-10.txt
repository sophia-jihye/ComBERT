Overview 

&#160; 

We are a pharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery, development and commercialization of drugs that treat severe metabolic, oncologic and psychiatric disorders by modulating the effects of cortisol. Elevated levels and abnormal release patterns of cortisol are implicated in a broad range of human disorders. Since our inception in 1998, we have been developing mifepristone, a compound that modulates the effect s of cortisol by acting as a competitive antagonist at the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). We have also discovered three structurally distinct series of proprietary, selective cortisol modulators, all of which share mifepristone&#8217;s affinity for GR but, unlike mifepristone, do not bind to the progesterone receptor, and so do not terminate pregnancy or cause other side effects associated with progesterone receptor antagonism. We have begun pre-clinical and clinical development of our lead compounds from these series . 

&#160; 

In 2012, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Korlym &#174; (mifepristone) 300 mg Tablets as a once-daily oral medication for the treatment of hyperglycemia secondary to hypercortisolism in adult patients with endogenous Cushing&#8217;s syndrome who have type 2 diabetes mellitus or glucose intolerance and have failed surgery or are not candidates for surgery. FDA approval means that we can market the drug in the United States. We first made Korlym available to patients in April 2012 and continue to develop the sales, marketing, medical affairs and logistical infrastructure needed to commercialize the drug. 

&#160; 

We are conducting a Phase 1/2 trial of mifepristone (Korlym&#8217;s active ingredient) in combination with the chemotherapy drug eribulin (Halaven &#174; ) to treat patients with metastatic, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) &#8211; a form of solid-tumor cancer with a particularly poor prognosis. We expect to have results of this trial by mid-2016. 

&#160; 

By the end of the first quarter of 2016, we plan to begin two Phase 2 trials of our lead selective cortisol modulator, CORT125134. One trial will study the compound&#8217;s efficacy as a treatment for patients with Cushing&#8217;s syndrome. The second trial will combine CORT125134 with anti-cancer agents to treat patients with a variety of solid-tumor cancers. 

&#160; 

The Role of Cortisol in Disease 

&#160; 

Cortisol is a steroid hormone that plays a significant role in the way the body reacts to stressful conditions. It influences metabolism and the immune system and contributes to emotional stability. It is essential for survival. Insufficient cortisol activity may lead to dehydration, hypotension, shock, fatigue, low resistance to infection, trauma, stress and hypoglycemia. Excessive cortisol activity may lead to a suppressed immune response, impaired glucose tolerance, diabetes, obesity, fatty liver disease, depressed mood, psychosis, wasting of the arms and legs, edema, fatigue, hypertension and other problems. Pre-clinical and clinical data suggest that cortisol may reduce the patient&#8217;s own immune response to oncogenesis and shield certain cancer cells from the apoptotic effects of chemotherapy. 

&#160; 

The challenge in regulating excessive levels of cortisol is that destroying the ability of the body to make cortisol can cause serious harm. To have a viable therapeutic effect, a medication must modulate cortisol&#8217;s effects without suppressing them below normal levels or disrupting the body&#8217;s normal cortisol rhythm, in which cortisol levels rise at awakening &#160; and decrease during the day. The action of cortisol can effectively be modulated by the use of compounds that compete with the hormone as it attempts to bind to GR. Mifepristone, the active ingredient in Korlym, is a competitive GR antagonist, as are the compounds in Corcept&#8217;s portfolio of proprietary compounds. 

&#160; 

Because mifepristone works by reducing the binding of excess cortisol to GR, it can modulate the effects of abnormal levels and release patterns of cortisol without compromising cortisol&#8217;s necessary, normal functions and rhythms. However, mifepristone also binds to the progesterone receptor and thereby terminates pregnancy and may cause other side effects, including irregular vaginal bleeding. Our proprietary, selective cortisol modulators block GR as potently as mifepristone does, but have no affinity for the progesterone receptor and so do not terminate pregnancy or cause other progesterone receptor-related side effects. 

&#160; 

Cushing&#8217;s Syndrome 

&#160; 

Background . In February 2012, the FDA approved Korlym &#174; (mifepristone) 300 mg Tablets as a once-daily oral medication for the treatment of hyperglycemia secondary to hypercortisolism in adult patients with endogenous Cushing&#8217;s syndrome who have type 2 diabetes mellitus or glucose intolerance and have failed surgery or are not candidates for surgery. FDA approval means that we can market the drug for the approved indication in the United States. 

&#160; 

Cushing&#8217;s syndrome is caused by prolonged exposure of the body&#8217;s tissues to high levels of cortisol. Sometimes called &#8220;hypercortisolism,&#8221; it is relatively uncommon and most often affects adults aged 20 to 50. An estimated 10 to 15 of every one million people are newly diagnosed with this syndrome each year, resulting in approximately 3,000 new patients and an estimated prevalence of 20,000 patients with Cushing&#8217;s syndrome in the United States. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Symptoms vary, but most people with Cushing&#8217;s syndrome have one or more of the following manifestations: high blood sugar, diabetes, high blood pressure, upper body obesity, rounded face, increased fat around the neck, thinning arms and legs, severe fatigue and weak muscles. Irritability, anxiety, cognitive disturbances and depression are also common. Cushing&#8217;s syndrome can affect every organ system in the body and can be lethal if not treated effectively. 

&#160; 

The preferred treatment for Cushing&#8217;s syndrome patients is surgery, which, if successful, can cure the disease. Depending on the type of tumor, surgery can result in a range of complications and has varying rates of success. In approximately half of the patients, surgery is not successful, either because the tumor cannot be removed completely or the disease returns. 

&#160; 

We received Orphan Drug d esignation from the FDA in 2007 for Korlym &#160; for the treatment of endogenous Cushing&#8217;s syndrome. Orphan Drug d esignation is a special status granted by the FDA to encourage the development of treatments for diseases or conditions that affect fewer than 200,000 patients. Drugs that receive Orphan Drug d esignation receive seven years of marketing exclusivity for the approved indication from the date of drug approval, as well as tax credits for clinical trial costs, marketing application filing fee waivers and assistance from the FDA in the drug development process. Even after an orphan drug is approved for its orphan indication, the FDA can later approve a different drug for the same condition if the FDA concludes that the later drug is safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care. 

&#160; 

Commercialization of Korlym . We first made Korlym available to patients on a commercial basis in April 2012. Physicians prescribing Korlym determine the appropriate dose for each patient by assessing tolerability and degree of improvement in manifestations of Cushing&#8217;s syndrome. In the first six weeks, these manifestations may include changes in glucose control, anti-diabetic medication requirements, insulin levels and psychiatric symptoms. After two months, physicians may assess their patients for improvements in cushingoid appearance, acne, hirsutism, striae and decreased body weight, along with further changes in glucose control. 

&#160; 

We sell Korlym using experienced sales representatives , who target the approximately 1,500 endocrinologists who care for a large portion of the Cushing&#8217;s syndrome population. We also reach patients directly through web-based initiatives and interactions with patient groups. Because a large percentage of the people who suffer from Cushing&#8217;s syndrome remain undiagnosed or inadequately treated, we have developed and continue to refine and expand programs to educate the medical community and patients about early diagnosis of this syndrome and to increase awareness regarding the role of cortisol modulators to treat th e disease . In addition, we have a field-based force of medical science liaisons. &#160; 

&#160; 

We use a specialty pharmacy and a specialty distributor &#160; to distribute Korlym and provide logistical support. 

&#160; 

We have retained a vendor to help patients with the reimbursement process and to administer our financial assistance programs for uninsured or under-insured patients. We also donate money to independent charitable foundations. These organizations, along with our own programs, help us ensure that no Cushing&#8217;s syndrome patient is denied access to Korlym for financial reasons. 

&#160; 

CORT125134 to Treat Patients with Cushing&#8217;s Syndrome . By the end of the first quarter of 2016, we plan to begin a Phase 2 trial of our proprietary, selective cortisol modulator CORT125134 to treat patients with Cushing&#8217;s syndrome. CORT125134 shares Korlym&#8217;s affinity for GR. D ata from its Phase 1 trial showed that it can potently reverse the effects of the steroid prednisone, a commonly-used GR agonist, on serum osteocalcin, white blood cell counts, glucose metabolism and genetic markers of GR activation. Reversing the effect of prednisone is important, because it mirrors Korlym&#8217;s competitive antagonism of GR &#8211; the essential quality of an effective treatment for patients with Cushing&#8217;s syndrome. Phase 1 pharmacokinetic data indicate that CORT125134 is suitable for once-daily oral dosing. 

&#160; 

Oncology Program 

&#160; 

There is substantial in vitro, in vivo and clinical evidence that cortisol&#8217;s binding to GR allows certain solid-tumor cancers to resist treatment. In some cancers, such as TNBC , cortisol activity at GR promotes tumor growth. In simple terms , after binding to GR, cortisol stimulates genes that retard cellular apoptosis. One of the foundational hypotheses of our oncology program is that modulating cortisol activity will promote tumor apoptosis. 

&#160; 

Our oncology development program also seeks to exploit a second mechanism. Cortisol suppresses the body's immune response. This is often beneficial, as it lessens the frequency of autoimmune diseases. However, activating, not suppressing, the body's immune system is beneficial in fighting certain cancers. When a patient undergoes chemotherapy that is designed to promote apoptosis in tumor cells, cortisol&#8217;s immune-suppressive, anti-apoptotic effect is counterproductive. Our expectation is that adding a cortisol modulator to a patient&#8217;s treatment regimen will help the patient &#8217; s own immune system combat the patient&#8217;s disease. 

&#160; 

Our research has shown that a range of tumor-types express GR and are potential targets for cortisol modulation therapy, among them triple-negative breast, ovarian, prostate and pancreatic cancers, as well as melanoma. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) . In January 2014 we began a Phase 1/2 trial of Korlym in combination with eribulin to treat metastatic TNBC, a form of the disease in which the three receptors that fuel most tumor growth &#8211; estrogen, progesterone and the HER-2/neu gene &#8211; are not present. Because the tumor cells lack these receptors, common treatments, such as drugs that target estrogen, progesterone and HER-2 receptors , are ineffective. Approximately 40,000 women are diagnosed with TNBC each year. There is no FDA-approved treatment and neither a targeted treatment nor a preferred standard chemotherapy regimen for relapsed, metastatic, TNBC patients exists. Our research indicates that m ore than 75 percent of the tumors in patients with TNBC express GR and so may respond to therapy using a cortisol modulator. 

&#160; 

We have begun the efficacy phase of our Phase 1/2 trial and plan to enroll 20 patients with metastatic TNBC. These patients will receive one 300 mg Korlym tablet each day, combined with eribulin administered on days one and eight of a 21-day cycle. We expect to have results by the end of the second quarter of 2016. 

&#160; 

CORT125134 to Treat Patients with Solid-Tumor Cancers . We plan to study CORT125134 in combination with anti-cancer agents to treat a range of solid-tumor cancers. Our Phase 1/2 trial&#8217;s first stage , which we plan to start by the end of the first quarter of 2016, will identify the maximum tolerated dose of a chemotherapeutic agent and CORT125134. The trial&#8217;s second stage will test that combination&#8217;s efficacy against one or more solid-tumor cancers. As we gather data from our own research and the work of our academic collaborators, we may include other anti-cancer agents and solid-tumor cancers in the trial. 

&#160; 

We are advancing CORT125134 because it has performed even better than mifepristone in animal models of TNBC and castration-resistant prostate cancer. Mice implanted with TNBC tumor cells were treated with a combination of the chemotherapy drug paclitaxel and CORT125134. Mifepristone in combination with the paclitaxel served as a positive control. The combination of mifepristone and paclitaxel significantly slowed tumor progression. However, the combination of CORT125134 and paclitaxel slowed it more significantly . In a similar experiment, castrated mice implanted with prostate cancer tumor cells were treated with either mifepristone or CORT125134. The outcome was comparable to the TNBC study: When combined with castration (which in humans would be achieved chemically by the administration of an androgen receptor &#160; antagonist such as enzalutamide), mifepristone significantly retarded tumor progression, but CORT125134 had a more pronounced positive effect. In addition to superior efficacy to mifepristone, we believe CORT125134 will produce fewer side effects because it does not bind to the progesterone receptor. 

&#160; 

Our Proprietary, Selective Cortisol Modulators 

CORT125134 is the lead compound in our portfolio of proprietary selective cortisol modulators. There are t h ree structurally distinct series of &#160; these compounds, all of which like Korlym, potently block GR but do not block the progesterone, estrogen, androgen or mineralocorticoid receptors. Both the United States Patent &#38; Trademark Office (USPTO) and the European Patent Office (EPO) have issued to us composition of matter patents related to these compounds . One additional composition of matter patent application is pending. &#160; See &#8220;Business &#8211; Intellectual Property.&#8221; 

&#160; 

In addition to our findings with CORT125134, several of our new compounds have demonstrated positive results in animal or in vitro models in various indications, including but not limited to the prevention and reversal of alcohol dependence; Alzheimer&#8217;s disease; post-traumatic stress disorder; electroconvulsive-induced retrograde amnesia; amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS or Lou Gehrig&#8217;s Disease); muscular dystrophy; prevention of glucocorticoid-induced neurological damage in premature infants; anti-psychotic-induced weight gain; fatty liver disease; metabolic syndrome; obesity; and breast, ovarian and prostate cancer (in combination with an anti-cancer agent). We are advancing the most promising of these compounds towards the clinic. 

&#160; 

We intend to continue our discovery research program with the goal of identifying new selective cortisol modulators, to manufacture and conduct pre-clinical development of one or more of these compounds and to study the most promising of them in humans. &#160; 

&#160; 

Studies by Independent Investigators 

&#160; 

We have , for many years , sought to advance our understanding of cortisol modulation&#8217;s therapeutic potential by supporting the work of independent academic investigators. These researchers have studied the utility of our proprietary selective cortisol modulators &#160; in pre-clinical studies in a wide range of disorders, including Cushing&#8217;s syndrome, metabolic syndrome, fatty liver disease, alcoholism, post-traumatic stress disorder, Alzheimer&#8217;s disease, ALS, muscular dystrophy, ovarian cancer, castration-resistance prostatic cancer and TNBC. 

&#160; 

Independent researchers are also investigating the utility of mifepristone in pre-clinical and human proof-of-concept studies in a variety of disorders, including alcoholism, post-traumatic stress disorder, Alzheimer&#8217;s disease, central serous chorioretinopathy, lung cancer, TNBC, castration resistant prostatic cancer, and ovarian cancer. 

&#160;

&#160; 

Clinical Trial Agreements 

&#160; 

Many of our clinical trials are conducted through the use of clinical research organizations (CROs). These organizations oversee clinical trials at various institutions to test the safety and efficacy of our product candidates for the targeted indications. Our Phase 1/2 trial for the study of mifepristone in the treatment of TNBC is being conducted under an agreement with Chiltern International Limited (Chiltern), formerly known as Ockham Development Group Inc. This agreement may be terminated by us upon 60-days written notice to Chiltern or sooner if the parties agree to do so. &#160; 

&#160; 

Research and Development Spending 

&#160; 

We incurred $15.4 million, $18.4 million and $20.5 million of research and development expenses in the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, which accounted for 29%, 34% and 39% of our total operating expenses in th ose respective years. 

&#160; 

Manufacturing Korlym 

&#160; 

We do not have internal manufacturing capabilities and intend to continue to rely on experienced contract manufacturers to produce Korlym and our product candidates. We have a manufacturing agreement with one contract manufacturer, Produits Chimiques Auxiliaires et de Synthese SA (PCAS), to produce mifepristone, the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) for Korlym. We have a long-term manufacturing and supply agreement with PCAS pursuant to which we agreed to purchase a minimum percentage of our mifepristone requirements. The amount will depend on our future needs. The initial term of the agreement is five years, with an automatic extension of one year, unless either party gives &#160; 12-months prior written termination notice. We have the right to terminate the agreement if PCAS is unable to manufacture mifepristone for nine consecutive months. 

&#160; 

We have one tablet manufacturer for Korlym &#8211; AAI Pharma Services Corp. (AAI). In April 2014, we entered into an agreement with AAI for the manufacture and package of Korlym tablets. The initial term of this agreement is three years, with consecutive automatic extensions of two years, unless either party gives written termination notice (in the case of AAI Pharma, 18 months prior to the end of the applicable term; in our case, 12 months prior to the end of the applicable term). We have the right to terminate the agreement if (i) AAI Pharma is unable to manufacture our product for four consecutive months or (ii) our product is withdrawn from the market. We have no minimum purchase obligations under this agreement. 

&#160; 

Competition for Korlym 

&#160; 

Korlym competes with established treatments, including surgery, radiation and other approved medicines including &#8220;off-label&#8221; uses of drugs such as ketoconazole, an anti-fungal medication. Korlym also competes with Novartis&#8217; drug, Signifor &#174; (pasireotide) Injection, which the FDA approved in December 2012 for the treatment of adult patients with Cushing&#8217;s disease (a subset of Cushing&#8217;s syndrome that afflicts approximately 70 percent of Cushing&#8217;s syndrome patients ) who are not candidates for pituitary surgery or for whom surgery did not work. 

&#160; 

Korlym may also experience competition from compounds under development for Cushing&#8217;s syndrome. For example, Strongbridge Biopharma plc has received Orphan Drug designation in the United States and the EU for the use of levoketoconazole, a chiral form of ketoconazole, to treat Cushing&#8217;s syndrome and has begun a Phase 3 clinical trial in Europe and the United States for this indication. 

&#160; 

Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

Patents and other proprietary rights are important to our business. It is our policy to seek patent protection for our inventions, and to rely upon trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position. 

&#160; 

Mifepristone . The composition of matter patent covering mifepristone has expired. The only other FDA-approved use of mifepristone is to terminate pregnancy. The FDA has imposed significant restrictions on the use of mifepristone to terminate pregnancy. To protect our market for Korlym we plan to rely on (1) the exclusive marketing rights conferred as a benefit of Orphan Drug d esignation in the United States, (2) the restrictions imposed by the FDA on the use of mifepristone to terminate pregnancy, (3) the different patient populations, administering physicians and treatment settings between the use of mifepristone to terminate pregnancy and to treat Cushing&#8217;s syndrome and (4) our method of use patents described below. 

&#160; 

Oncology. We have an exclusive license agreement with the University of Chicago to patents covering the use of cortisol modulators in the treatment of triple-negative breast cancer, as well as patent applications covering their use in the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer. See &#8220;Business &#8211; License Agreements.&#8221; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Method of Use Patents . &#160; We own issued U.S. patents for the use of cortisol modulators in the treatment of mild cognitive impairment, the prevention and treatment of stress disorders, improving the therapeutic response to electroconvulsive therapy, the treatment of delirium, the treatment of catatonia, the treatment of psychosis with Interferon-Alpha therapy, inhibiting cognitive deterioration in adults with Down&#8217;s Syndrome, the treatment of weight gain following treatment with antipsychotic medication, the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease, the treatment of migraine headaches, the treatment of neurological damage in premature infants, and the treatment of diseases using combination steroid and GR antagonist therapy. We also own a method of use patent for optimizing mifepristone levels in plasma serum in patients suffering from mental disorders. The expiration dates of these patents and their foreign counterparts range from 2020 to 2034. 

&#160; 

In addition, we have three U.S. method-of-use applications covering certain cortisol modulators, including the treatment of patients suffering from mental disorders by optimizing mifepristone absorption, muscular dystrophy and ALS. 

&#160; 

We estimate that the expiration dates of the patents that could issue from these applications and their foreign counterparts range from 2029 to 2033. 

&#160; 

Composition of Matter Patents Covering Our Proprietary, Selective Cortisol Modulators. &#160; We have eight U.S. composition of matter patents containing claims relating to three structurally distinct series of next-generation cortisol modulators. Four of these patents have issued in Europe, with an additional U.S. application pending . The expiration dates of these patents and their foreign counterparts range from 2026 to 2033. 

&#160; 

We have also filed, where we deemed appropriate, foreign patent applications corresponding to our U.S. patents and applications. However, we cannot assure you that any of our patent applications will result in the issuance of patents, that any issued patent will include claims of the breadth sought in these applications, or that competitors or other third-parties will not successfully challenge or circumvent our patents if they are issued. 

&#160; 

W e do not have a patent with claims directed to the composition of mifepristone. Our rights under our issued patents related to mifepristone cover only the use of that compound in the treatment of specific diseases. 

&#160; 

The patent positions of companies in the pharmaceutical industry are highly uncertain, involve complex legal and factual questions and have been and continue to be the subject of much litigation. Our product candidates may give rise to claims that we infringe on the products or proprietary rights of others. If it is determined that our drug candidates infringe on others&#8217; patent rights, we may be required to obtain licenses to those rights. If we fail to obtain licenses when necessary, we may experience delays in commercializing our product candidates while attempting to design around other patents, or determine that we are unable to commercialize our product candidates at all. Some of our patents may be challenged. If despite our defense a challenged patent is invalidated, we could be subject to additional competition. If we become involved in intellectual property litigation, we are likely to incur considerable costs in defending or prosecuting the litigation. We believe that our patents are valid and that we do not currently infringe any third - party&#8217;s patents or other proprietary rights, and we are not obligated to pay royalties relating to the use of intellectual property to any third - party other than Stanford University and the University of Chicago. 

&#160; 

License Agreements 

&#160; 

We have exclusively licensed three issued U.S. patents from Stanford University for the use of cortisol modulators, including mifepristone in the treatment of psychotic depression, cocaine-induced psychosis and early dementia, including early Alzheimer&#8217;s disease. We are required to make milestone payments and pay royalties to Stanford University on sales of products commercialized under these patents. Milestone payments are creditable against future royalties. Our license will end upon expiration of the related patents in 2018 and 2019 or upon notification by us to Stanford. &#160; 

&#160; 

We have also exclusively licensed from the University of Chicago two issued U.S. patents for the use of cortisol modulators in the treatment of triple-negative breast cancer , and a second patent family with applications in the U nited S tates and Europe having claims directed to the use of cortisol modulators to treat castration-resistant prostate cancer. We are required to pay the University of Chicago customary milestone fees and royalties on revenue from products commercialized under the issued patents or patents that may issue pursuant to the pending applications. &#160; Our license will end upon expiration of the related patents in 2031 and 2033 or upon notification by us to the University of Chicago. &#160; 

Government Regulation 

&#160; 

Prescription pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive pre- and post-approval regulation, including regulations that govern the testing, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, storage, record keeping, advertising, and promotion of the products under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. All of our product candidates will require regulatory approval by government agencies prior to commercialization. The process required by the FDA before a new drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the 

&#160;

following: completion of preclinical laboratory and animal testing; submission of an IND, which must become effective before clinical trials may begin; performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug or biologic&#8217;s intended use; and, in the case of a new drug, approval by the FDA of an NDA. The process of complying with these and other federal and state statutes and regulations in order to obtain the necessary approvals and subsequently complying with federal and state statutes and regulations involves significant time and expense. 

&#160; 

Preclinical studies are generally conducted in laboratory animals to evaluate the potential safety and the efficacy of a product. Drug developers submit the results of preclinical studies to the FDA as a part of an IND, which must be approved before beginning clinical trials in humans. If it is anticipated that the clinical trial will be conducted in Europe, a Clinical Trial Authorization (CTA) must be submitted and approved by the appropriate European regulatory agency prior to the commencement of the study. Typically, human clinical trials are conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap. 

&#183; 

Phase 1. Clinical trials are conducted with a small number of subjects to determine the early safety profile, maximum tolerated dose and pharmacokinetics of the product candidate in human volunteers. 

&#183; 

Phase 2. Clinical trials are conducted with groups of patients afflicted with a specific disease to determine preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and expanded evidence of safety. 

&#183; 

Phase 3. Large-scale, multi-center, comparative trials are conducted with patients afflicted with a target disease to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the drug and to provide enough data to demonstrate with substantial evidence the efficacy and safety of the product, as required by the FDA. 

&#160; 

The FDA and the Institutional Review Boards closely monitor the progress of each of the three phases of clinical trials that are conducted in the United States and may reevaluate, alter, suspend or terminate the testing at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. The FDA may also require that additional studies be conducted, such as studies demonstrating that the drug being tested does not cause cancer. 

&#160; 

After Phase 3 trials are completed, drug developers submit the results of preclinical studies, clinical trials, formulation studies and data supporting manufacturing to the FDA in the form of an NDA for approval to commence commercial sales. The FDA reviews all NDAs submitted before it accepts them for filing. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. If the FDA accepts an NDA for filing, it may grant marketing approval, request additional information or deny the application if it determines that the application does not meet regulatory approval criteria. Once an NDA has been accepted for filing, by law the FDA has 180 days to examine the application and respond to the applicant. However, the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, the FDA has a goal of responding to NDAs within ten months of the filing date for standard review, and 6 months for priority review if a sponsor shows that its drug candidate provides a significant improvement compared to marketed drugs. FDA approvals may not be granted on a timely basis, or at all. 

&#160; 

If the FDA approves an NDA, the subject drug becomes available for physicians to prescribe in the United States. Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-approval regulatory standards is not maintained. The drug developer must submit periodic reports to the FDA. Adverse experiences with the product must be reported to the FDA and could result in the imposition of marketing restrictions through labeling changes or product removal. Product approvals may be withdrawn if problems with safety or efficacy occur after the product reaches the marketplace. In addition, the FDA may require post-marketing studies, referred to as Phase 4 studies, to monitor the effect of approved products, and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-approval studies. 

&#160; 

Facilities used to manufacture drugs are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA and other authorities where applicable, and must comply with current Good Manufacturing Practices regulations (cGMP). Failure to comply with the statutory and regulatory requirements subjects the manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, such as suspension of manufacturing, seizure of product or voluntary recall of a product. 

&#160; 

With respect to post-approval product advertising and promotion, the FDA imposes a number of complex regulations on entities that advertise and promote pharmaceuticals, which include, among others, standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the Internet. The FDA has very broad enforcement authority under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, and failure to abide by these regulations can result in penalties including the issuance of a warning letter directing a company to correct deviations from FDA standards, a requirement that future advertising and promotional materials be pre-cleared by the FDA, and state and federal civil and criminal investigations and prosecutions. 

&#160; 

In addition to studies requested by the FDA after approval, a drug developer may conduct other studies to explore use of the approved compound for treatment of new indications. The purpose of these trials and studies and related publications is to broaden the application and use of the drug and its acceptance in the medical community. Data supporting the use of a drug for these new indications 

&#160;

must be submitted to the FDA in a new or supplemental NDA that must be approved by the FDA before the drug can be marketed for the new indications. 

&#160; 

Orphan Drug Designation 

&#160; 

We have received Orphan Drug designation for Korlym for the treatment of endogenous Cushing&#8217;s syndrome in the United States. Orphan Drug designation provides special status to a product to treat a rare disease or condition providing that the product meets certain criteria. Orphan designation qualifies the sponsor of the product for the tax credit and marketing incentives of the Orphan Drug Act, including seven years of exclusive marketing rights for the specific drug for the orphan indication, if it receives the first regulatory approval for that indication, with limited exceptions. A marketing application for a prescription drug product that has been designated as a drug for a rare disease or condition is not subject to a prescription drug user fee unless the application includes an indication for other than a rare disease or condition. Orphan Drug designation does not prevent competitors from developing or marketing different drugs for an indication. It also does not convey an advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the review and approval process for a drug by the applicable regulatory authority. 

&#160; 

Marketing Approvals outside the United States &#160; 

&#160; 

We are not seeking regulatory approval to market Korlym outside the United States. If we do so, we (or our potential future partners) will have to complete an approval process similar to the U.S. approval process in foreign target markets for our product candidates before we can commercialize our product candidates in those countries. The approval procedure and the time required for approval vary from country to country and can involve additional testing. Foreign approvals may not be granted on a timely basis, or at all. Regulatory approval of pricing is required in most countries other than the United States. The prices approved may be too low to generate an acceptable return to us. 

&#160; 

Coverage and Reimbursement 

&#160; 

Sales of our products will depend, in part, on the extent to which our products will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health care programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. Although this trend has not had a material impact on the amount or timing of our revenues, these third-party payors are increasingly limiting coverage and reducing reimbursements for medical products and services. In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on coverage and reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit our net revenue and results. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for our products or a decision by a third-party payor to not cover our products could reduce physician utilization of our products and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition. 

&#160; 

Other Healthcare Laws 

&#160; 

We are &#160; subject to healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and the states and foreign governments in which we conduct our business. These laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, privacy and security and physicians sunshine laws and regulations. 

&#160; 

The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person from knowingly and willfully offering, soliciting, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual, for an item or service or the purchasing or ordering of a good or service, for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The Anti-Kickback Statute is subject to evolving interpretations. In the past, the government has enforced the Anti-Kickback Statute to reach large settlements with healthcare companies based on sham consulting and other financial arrangements with physicians. Further, the recently enacted Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively, the PPACA, among other things, amends the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the criminal statute governing healthcare fraud statutes. A person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of these statutes or specific intent to violate them. In addition, the PPACA provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act or federal civil money penalties statute. The majority of states also have anti-kickback laws which establish similar prohibitions and in some cases may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers. 

&#160; 

Additionally , the civil False Claims Act prohibits knowingly presenting or causing the presentation of a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim for payment to the U.S. government. Actions under the False Claims Act may be brought by the Attorney General or as a qui tam action by a private individual in the name of the government. Violations of the False Claims Act can result in very significant monetary penalties and treble damages. The federal government is using the False Claims Act, and the accompanying threat of significant liability, in its investigation and prosecution of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies throughout the country, for example, in connection with the promotion of products for unapproved uses and other sales and marketing practices. The government has obtained 

&#160;

multi-million and multi-billion dollar settlements under the False Claims Act in addition to individual criminal convictions under applicable criminal statutes. Given the significant size of actual and potential settlements, it is expected that the government will continue to devote substantial resources to investigating healthcare providers&#8217; and manufacturers&#8217; compliance with applicable fraud and abuse laws. 

&#160; 

In addition, there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians and other healthcare providers. The PPACA, among other things, imposes new reporting requirements on drug manufacturers for payments made by them to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $150,000 per year (or up to an aggregate of $1 million per year for &#8220;knowing failures&#8221;), for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests that are not timely, accurately and completely reported in an annual submission. Drug manufacturers are required to submit reports to the government by the 90 th day of each calendar year. Certain states also mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs, impose restrictions on drug manufacturer marketing practices and/or require the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to physicians. 

&#160; 

The shifting commercial compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust and expandable systems to comply with different compliance and/or reporting requirements in multiple jurisdictions increase the possibility that a healthcare company may violate one or more of the requirements. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. 

&#160;
