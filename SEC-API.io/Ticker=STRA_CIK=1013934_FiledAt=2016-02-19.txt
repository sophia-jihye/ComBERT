 Item 1. &#160; Business 

Overview 

Our company provides post-secondary education services. We offer a variety of academic programs through two wholly-owned subsidiaries, Strayer University (the &#8220;University&#8221;) and the New York Code and Design Academy (&#8220;NYCDA&#8221;).

Founded in 1892, Strayer University is an institution of higher learning that offers undergraduate and graduate degree programs in business administration, accounting, information technology, education, health services administration, nursing, public administration, and criminal justice at 76 physical campuses, predominantly located in the Mid-Atlantic and Southern regions of the United States, and online. Strayer University also offers an executive MBA online through its Jack Welch Management Institute. For the 2015 fall term, we had 42,975 students enrolled in our programs. Strayer University is accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education (&#8220;Middle States&#8221; or &#8220;Middle States Commission&#8221;), one of the six regional collegiate accrediting agencies recognized by the U.S. Department of Education (&#8220;Department of Education&#8221;). Middle States is located at 3624 Market Street, Philadelphia, PA 19104 (267-284-5000). By offering its programs both online and in physical classrooms, the University provides its working adult students more flexibility and convenience. Strayer University, with its online offerings, attracts students from around the country and throughout the world.

The New York Code and Design Academy provides non-degree courses in web and application software development, primarily at its campus in New York City. NYCDA is licensed by the New York Bureau of Proprietary School Supervision, but is not accredited and does not participate in state or federal student financial aid programs. We acquired NYCDA on January 13, 2016, thus the acquisition did not impact our 2015 results.

We generated net revenue of $434 million in 2015. For more information regarding our revenues, profits and financial condition, please refer to &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; and our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Industry Background 

The market for post-secondary education is large and highly fragmented. The U.S. Census Bureau has reported that approximately 62 million adults over the age of 25 in the United States do not have more than a high school education and approximately 35 million adults over the age of 25 have some college experience but no college degree. Although demand for post-secondary education has been reduced during the past few years, we believe that over time the demand will increase as a result of demographic, economic and social trends, including:

&#8226; &#160; increasing demand by employers for certain types of professional and skilled workers;

&#8226; &#160; growth in the number of high school graduates from 2.8 million in 1999-2000 to an estimated 3.3 million in 2015-2016, according to the National Center for Education Statistics;

&#8226; &#160; the significant and measurable income premium and enhanced employment prospects attributable to post-secondary education; and

&#8226; &#160; a number of initiatives underway to reduce the cost of a post-secondary education.

The adult education market is a significant component of the post-secondary education market. We believe that the market for post-secondary adult education should increase as working adults seek additional education to update and improve their skills. In addition, we believe that many working adults will seek degree programs from regionally accredited institutions that provide flexibility to accommodate the fixed schedules and time commitments associated with their professional, family and personal obligations.

According to the National Center for Education Statistics, in 2014-2015 there were 3,011 four-year degree-granting institutions in the United States, including 701 public colleges and universities, 1,584 not-for-profit colleges and universities, and 726 for-profit institutions.

Growth in the market for post-secondary education has recently been negatively affected by weakness in the economy as well as by the uncertainty associated with legislative and regulatory proposals. Controversy about the cost of higher education and the unemployment, or under-employment, of college graduates due to the difficult economic conditions may also have caused some prospective students to question the value proposition of higher education. According to the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center, college enrollments declined 1.3%

and 1.7% in fall 2014 and 2015, respectively. The industry is heavily dependent on continued availability of funding for programs under Title IV of the Higher Education Act (&#8220;Title IV programs&#8221;) and concerns about potential reductions in such funding also can reduce the level of growth.

Company Strengths 

Strayer University has been in operation since 1892 and has a track record of providing practical and convenient education programs for working adults. We believe the following strengths position us to capitalize on the demand for post-secondary education:

&#8226; &#160; Consistent operating history. The University has been in continuous operation since 1892 and has demonstrated an ability to operate consistently and grow profitably.

&#8226; &#160; Practical and diversified curricula. We offer core curricula in practical areas of adult education. In order to keep pace with a changing knowledge-based economy, we constantly strive to meet the evolving needs of our students and their current and prospective employers by regularly refining, updating, and adding to our portfolio of educational programs. In January 2016, we acquired NYCDA, which offers high-demand non-degree courses in software development. In December 2011, Strayer University acquired the Jack Welch Management Institute, an online leadership education program that enables us to offer a differentiated executive MBA degree and executive certificates to students and employees of leading corporations. Across Strayer University and NYCDA, we currently offer approximately 90 different degree, diploma, certificate, and non-degree training programs and concentrations.

&#8226; &#160; Focus on adults pursuing career-relevant degree and non-degree programs. We focus on serving adults who are pursuing undergraduate and graduate degrees as well as non-degree certificates and training programs that will help them advance their careers and employment opportunities.

&#8226; &#160; Flexible program offerings. We maintain flexible programs that allow students to attend classes and complete coursework at day, evening and weekend classes throughout the calendar year. Online programs offered through Strayer University enable students to take some or all of their classes via the Internet. Approximately 71% of our students enrolled for the 2015 fall term were taking all of their courses online.

&#8226; &#160; Attractive and convenient campus locations. Our campuses are located in growing metropolitan areas, mostly in the Mid-Atlantic and Southern regions where there are large populations of adults with demographic characteristics similar to those of our typical students. Strayer University&#8217;s campuses are attractive and modern, offering conducive learning environments in convenient locations.

&#8226; &#160; Established brand name and alumni support. With a 124-year operating history, Strayer University is an established brand name in post-secondary adult education, and our students and graduates work throughout corporate America. Our alumni network fosters additional referral opportunities for students.

Company Strategy 

Our goal is to be a leading provider of career relevant education programs, primarily in the areas of business, accounting, information technology and software development, that prepare students for advancement in their careers and professional lives. We have identified the following strategic priorities as key to achieving our goal:

&#8226; &#160; Improve student success &#8212; Our success as a Company depends on the success of our students. The more we focus on helping our students succeed, the more likely it is that we will succeed. In order to improve student success, we must continue to hire outstanding faculty, individuals who are experts in their fields and who are great at teaching. We must also offer high quality course content that is relevant in today&#8217;s job market.

&#8226; &#160; Enhance student experience &#8212; Our students are predominately working adults who are furthering their education in order to advance their careers and professional lives. Our students are busy with work and family responsibilities that leave little time for other endeavors. Thus, we must make sure every interaction with our students is a productive one. We are constantly looking for ways to serve them better. This includes providing outstanding service not only in the classroom, but also in areas such as student advising, tutoring, registration, technology, and administration. We measure our performance through student surveys and focus groups.

&#8226; &#160; Address affordability &#8212; The cost of a post-secondary education has increased substantially over the last ten years while average earnings have failed to keep up. Recognizing that affordability is an important factor in a prospective student&#8217;s decision to further his or her education, in late 2013, we commenced an effort at Strayer University to make our degree programs more affordable. In the 2013 summer academic term, we introduced our Graduation Fund. Under this program, qualifying students enrolled in a bachelor&#8217;s degree program are eligible to receive one free course for every three courses successfully completed towards a bachelor&#8217;s degree. The free courses earned are redeemable in one&#8217;s final academic year. Furthermore, beginning the winter term 2014, we reduced undergraduate tuition for new students by 20%. We continue to monitor and assess the impact of our affordability initiatives and explore other ways to make our offerings as affordable as possible.

&#8226; &#160; Establish new platforms for growth &#8212; We are constantly exploring new avenues for growth. Like the acquisition of the Jack Welch Management Institute in 2011, our recent acquisition of NYCDA represents another significant opportunity to leverage our operating track record and our physical campus and online infrastructure. We continue to leverage the strong reputation and track record of Strayer University to develop new programs like the Bachelor of Science in Nursing degree, which began enrolling new students in the fall 2015 academic term.

&#8226; &#160; Build a high performing culture &#8212; In order to be a leading provider of educational services, we must have talented and motivated faculty and employees who are passionate about serving students. We strive to attract the best talent and then develop and retain them. We want to be known as an employer of choice and be a place where one can build a long-term career.

Strayer University 

Curriculum 

Strayer University offers business, information technology and professional curricula to equip students with specialized and practical knowledge and skills for careers in business, industry and government. Our academic leaders regularly review and revise the University&#8217;s course offerings to improve our educational programs and respond to competitive changes in job markets. We regularly evaluate new programs and degrees to ensure that we stay current with the needs of our students and their employers.

Strayer University offers programs in the following areas:

&#160; Graduate Programs &#160; &#160; Undergraduate Programs &#8226; Master of Business Administration (M.B.A.) &#160; &#8226; Bachelor of Science (B.S.) Degree &#160; Degree &#160; &#160; Accounting &#8226; Jack Welch Executive Master of Business &#160; &#160; Information Systems &#160; Administration (M.B.A.) Degree &#160; &#160; Information Technology &#8226; Master of Education (M.Ed.) Degree &#160; &#160; Economics &#8226; Master of Science in Health Services Administration &#160; &#160; Criminal Justice &#160; (M.S.H.S.A.) Degree &#160; &#8226; Bachelor of Business Administration (B.B.A.) &#8226; Master of Public Administration (M.P.A.) Degree &#160; &#160; Degree &#8226; Master of Science (M.S.) Degree &#160; &#8226; Associate in Arts (A.A.) Degree &#160; Information Assurance &#160; &#160; Accounting &#160; Information Systems &#160; &#160; Acquisitions and Contract Management &#160; Accounting &#160; &#160; Business Administration &#160; Human Resource Management &#160; &#160; Information Systems &#160; Management &#160; &#160; Information Technology &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Economics &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Marketing &#160; &#160; &#160; &#8226; Diploma Program &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Acquisition and Contract Management &#160; &#160; &#160; &#8226; Certificate in Business Administration 4

Each undergraduate degree program includes courses in oral and written communication skills as well as mathematics and various disciplines in the humanities and social sciences. In addition to our degree, diploma and certificate programs, we offer classes to non-degree and non-program students wishing to take courses for personal or professional enrichment.

Although all of our programs are generally offered at our campuses and online, the University adapts its course offerings to the demands of the student population at each location. Strayer University students may enroll in courses at more than one campus and take courses online.

Strayer University structures its curricula to allow students to advance sequentially from one learning level to another by applying credits earned in one program toward attainment of a more advanced degree. For example, a student originally pursuing an associate&#8217;s degree in information systems can extend his or her original educational objective by taking additional courses leading to a bachelor&#8217;s degree in information systems, and ultimately a master&#8217;s degree in information systems. This curriculum design provides students a level of competency and a measure of attainment in the event they interrupt their education or choose to work in their field of concentration prior to obtaining their final degree. 

Online 

In August 1997, the University began offering classes online. Students may take classes online using either a synchronous (&#8220;real time&#8221;) or asynchronous (&#8220;on demand&#8221;) format. The asynchronous format was first introduced by the University in the summer 2001 academic term and has grown significantly due to increasing demand. Currently, almost all students taking classes online choose the asynchronous format. Students may take all of their courses online or may take online courses in combination with classroom-based courses. A student taking classes online has the same admission and financial aid requirements, is subject to substantially the same policies and procedures, and receives the same student services and support as campus-based Strayer University students. Tuition for online courses is the same as campus-based courses.

Faculty 

The University appoints faculty who hold appropriate academic credentials, are dedicated, active professionals in their field, and are enthusiastic and committed to teaching working adults. In accordance with our educational mission, the University faculty focuses its efforts on teaching. The normal course load for a full-time faculty member is five courses per quarter for each of three quarters, or 15 courses per academic year. Further, many full-time faculty members participate actively in the University by providing leadership, curriculum, setting academic policy, and serving on assessment committees.

We provide financial support for faculty members seeking to enhance their skills and knowledge. The University maintains a professional development funding program that reimburses eligible faculty and deans for completing courses, continuing education, seminars, and various programs that enhance their current credentials and knowledge base to improve their content expertise. Full-time faculty (and all other full-time employees) receive a 90% discount for all Strayer University courses. The University also conducts annual in-house faculty workshops in each discipline. We believe that our dedicated and capable faculty is one of the keys to our success.

Within the academic, strategic and financial parameters set by the Board of Trustees, the University is managed on a daily basis by the University President. The President is charged with the responsibility of overseeing the implementation of the policies established by the Board of Trustees and is supported in this function by senior administrative officers, including the Chief Academic Officer and the Chief Operating Officer of the University. The majority of the University&#8217;s operations are centralized within the President&#8217;s Office or the University&#8217;s senior administrative staff offices. These operations include academic programs, academic intelligence, academic services, student affairs, accounting and auditing, human resources, operations, marketing, public relations, facilities, information technology, and regulatory compliance, including oversight of the University&#8217;s participation in federal student financial aid programs.

Within this centralized structure, responsibilities fit within the purview of either the Chief Academic Officer or the Chief Operating Officer, both of whom report to the University President. The senior administrative officers that support the Chief Academic Officer in performing academic functions include six Academic Program Directors, a Vice President of Student and Faculty Resources, a Vice President of Student Affairs, a Vice President of Institutional Research, and a Vice President for Content. Together, these individuals are responsible for faculty hiring and management, curriculum development, policy oversight, and student learning outcomes. Each academic function receives further support from the University Registrar.

Operational functions including Student Financial Services, Information Technology, and campus operations are the primary responsibility of the Chief Operating Officer of the University. Other senior administrative officers also support the President in areas such as legal compliance, accounting and auditing, computer technology, insurance and human resources. All of the senior administrative officers collaborate to ensure that University operations meet the annual budget established by the Board of Trustees and all applicable regulatory requirements.

Outreach 

To identify potential students, we engage in a broad range of activities to inform working adults and their employers about the programs offered at Strayer University. These activities include direct and digital marketing, marketing to our existing students and graduates, print and broadcast advertising, student referrals, and corporate and government outreach activities. Direct response methods (direct and digital marketing) are used to generate inquiries from potential students. Strayer University maintains booths and information tables at appropriate conferences and expos, as well as at transfer days at community colleges. We also depend on the recommendation of our alumni network to maintain and enhance Strayer University&#8217;s reputation and promote its quality education. Our business-to-business outreach efforts include personal telephone calls, distribution of information through corporate intranets and human resource departments, and on-site information meetings. We record inquiries in our database and track them through to application and registration. Additionally, we provide information about new programs to students and alumni to encourage them to return for further education.

Student Profile 

The majority of Strayer University students are working adults completing their first college degree to improve their job skills and advance their careers. Of the students enrolled in Strayer University&#8217;s programs at the beginning of the 2015 fall quarter, approximately 66% were age 31 or older and approximately 85% were engaged in part-time study (fewer than three courses each quarter for undergraduate students and fewer than two for graduate students).

In the 2015 fall quarter, our undergraduate students registered for an average of approximately two courses and our graduate students for an average of approximately one course.

Strayer University has a very diverse student population.

Our business is seasonal and as a result, our quarterly results of operations tend to vary within the year due to student enrollment patterns. Enrollment generally is lowest in the third quarter, or summer term.

Student Admissions 

Students attending Strayer University&#8217;s undergraduate programs must possess a high school diploma or a General Educational Development (GED) Certificate. Students attending Strayer University&#8217;s graduate programs must have a bachelor&#8217;s degree from an accredited institution and meet certain other requirements. If a student&#8217;s undergraduate major varies widely from the student&#8217;s proposed graduate course of study, certain undergraduate prerequisite courses may also be necessary for admission. To maximize undergraduate students&#8217; chances for academic success and to ensure they receive the support they need, Strayer University evaluates incoming students&#8217; proficiency in fundamental English and math prior to the first quarter&#8217;s registration.

International students applying for admission must meet the same admission requirements as other students. Those students whose native language is not English must provide evidence that they are able to use the English language with sufficient facility to perform college-level work in an English-speaking institution.

Tuition and Fees 

Strayer University charges tuition by the course. Tuition rates may vary in states with specific regulations governing tuition costs. Each course is 4.5 credit hours. As of January 1, 2016, undergraduate students who were new to the University after January 1, 2014 are charged $1,420 per course. Undergraduate students who initially enrolled at Strayer prior to January 1, 2014 are charged $1,700 per course if the student attends on a full-time basis or $1,775 per course if the student attends on a part-time basis. As of January 1, 2016, graduate students who were new to the University after January 1, 2015 are charged at a rate of $2,450 per course while all other graduate students are charged at a rate of $2,325 per course. For the Jack Welch Management Institute, students who were new as of July 1, 2014 are charged at a rate of $3,250 per course; new as of July 1, 2013 at a rate of $3,000 per course; and new prior to July 1, 2013 at a rate of $2,580 per course. Under a variety of different programs and in connection with various corporate and government sponsorship and tuition reimbursement arrangements, Strayer University offers scholarships and tuition discounts to students. One of these programs, the Graduation Fund, offers a student in a bachelor&#8217;s program an opportunity to earn up to a 25% reduction of the tuition required for a degree. A new undergraduate student seeking to obtain a bachelor&#8217;s degree in four years and who was eligible for our Graduation fund would currently pay on average approximately $11,000 per year in tuition.

Career Development Services 

Although most of Strayer University&#8217;s students are already employed, the University actively assists its students and alumni with career-related matters. The focus for Career Services at Strayer University is to provide career guidance and resources to assist students and alumni in reaching their educational and professional goals. Services are delivered through various media including online, in person, recorded video, books, periodicals, and by telephone. The services provided include career webinars, recorded seminars, career teleconferences, career advising and resume review. 

We regularly conduct alumni surveys to monitor the career progression of our graduates and to support outcome assessment efforts required by Middle States and state regulators.

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015, we had a total of 1,401 full-time employees including 273 full-time faculty members and 1,128 non-faculty staff. Full-time faculty members teach on average 4-5 courses per quarter. The balance of classes are taught by adjunct faculty who normally teach 1-2 courses per quarter. Although we had approximately 1,600 adjunct faculty, not all of them teach every quarter. In the 2015 fall quarter, approximately 25% of our courses were taught by full-time faculty. Because we are not a research university, all faculty members are expected to spend their time teaching and advising students. In addition to our faculty, our non-faculty staff, including 63 part-time employees, serve in the areas of information systems, financial aid, recruitment and admissions, student administration, marketing, human resources, corporate accounting, and other administrative functions.

Intellectual Property 

In the ordinary course of business, we develop many kinds of intellectual property that are or will be the subject of copyright, trademark, service mark, patent, trade secret or other protections. Such intellectual property includes, but is not limited to, our courseware materials for classes taught online or other distance-learning means and business know-how and internal processes and procedures developed to respond to the requirements of our operations and various education regulatory agencies. We also claim rights to certain marks, and have obtained federal registration of the marks, including the mark &#8220;STRAYER&#8221; for educational services.

Competition 

The higher education industry is highly competitive, but with no single participant possessing a significant market share. We compete for students with traditional public and private two-year and four-year degree-granting accredited colleges and universities, other proprietary degree-granting accredited schools and also alternatives to higher education. In addition, we face competition from various nontraditional, credit-bearing and noncredit-bearing education programs, provided by both proprietary and not-for-profit providers, including massive open online courses offered worldwide without charge by traditional educational institutions and other direct-to-consumer education services. As the proportion of traditional colleges providing alternative learning modalities increases, we will face increasing competition for students from traditional colleges, including colleges with well-established reputations for excellence. As the online and distance learning segment of the post-secondary education market matures, we believe that the intensity of the competition we face will continue to increase.

We believe the key factors affecting our competitive position include the quality of the programs offered, the quality of other services provided to students, our reputation among students and in the general marketplace, the cost and perceived value of our offerings, the employment rate and terms of employment for our graduates, the ease of access to our offerings, the quality and reputation of our faculty and other employees, the quality of our campus facilities and online platform, the time commitment required to complete our program and obtain a degree, the quality and size of our alumni base, and our relationship with other learning institutions.

Regulation 

Regulatory Environment 

As an institution of higher education accredited by Middle States and operating in multiple jurisdictions, Strayer University is subject to accreditation rules and varying state licensing and regulatory requirements. In addition, the federal Higher Education Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder require all higher education institutions that participate in the various Title IV programs, including Strayer University, both to comply with detailed substantive 

and reporting requirements and to undergo periodic regulatory scrutiny. The Higher Education Act mandates specific regulatory responsibility for each of the following components of the higher education regulatory triad: (1) the institutional accrediting agencies recognized by the U.S. Secretary of Education (&#8220;Secretary of Education&#8221;); (2) state education regulatory bodies; and (3) the federal government through the Department of Education. The regulations, standards and policies of these regulatory agencies are subject to frequent change. 

Accreditation 

Strayer University has been institutionally accredited since 1981 by Middle States, a regional accrediting agency recognized by the Secretary of Education. Strayer University&#8217;s current period of accreditation by Middle States extends through 2017. Accreditation is a system for recognizing educational institutions and their programs for integrity, educational quality, faculty, physical resources, administrative capability and financial stability that signifies that they merit the confidence of the educational community and the public. In the United States, this recognition comes primarily through private voluntary associations of institutions and programs of higher education. These associations establish criteria for accreditation, conduct peer-review evaluations of institutions and programs, and publicly designate those institutions that meet their standards. Accredited schools are subject to periodic review by accrediting bodies to determine whether such schools maintain the performance, integrity and quality required for accreditation.

Middle States accredits degree-granting public and private colleges and universities in its region (including Delaware, Washington, D.C., Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands), including distance education programs offered by those institutions. Accreditation by Middle States is an important attribute of Strayer University. Colleges and universities depend on accreditation in evaluating transfers of credit and applications to graduate schools. Employers rely on the accreditation status of institutions when evaluating a candidate&#8217;s credentials or considering tuition reimbursement programs. Students rely on accreditation status for assurance that an institution maintains quality educational standards.

In order for institutions to be eligible to participate in federal student financial assistance programs, they must be accredited by an institutional accreditor recognized by the Department of Education. The Higher Education Act charges the National Advisory Committee on Institutional Quality and Integrity (&#8220;NACIQI&#8221;) with recommending to the Secretary of Education which accrediting or state approval agencies should be recognized as reliable authorities for judging the quality of post-secondary institutions and programs. In December 2014, NACIQI renewed its recognition of Middle States through fall 2017.

As with all its regulatory relationships, Strayer University strives to maintain close contact with, and to provide frequent status updates to, Middle States regarding matters pertinent to accrediting standards and policies. This regular contact keeps Middle States informed of the University&#8217;s planned activities and aims to ensure that the University&#8217;s performance continues to meet Middle States&#8217; expectations. To this end, Strayer University is committed to evaluating periodically its own performance, submitting reports to Middle States and making any necessary improvements to continue meeting Middle States&#8217; accreditation standards as the University grows and expands geographically. If an institution&#8217;s performance were ever not to meet its accrediting agency&#8217;s (or other regulator&#8217;s) expectations or applicable standards, then its operations could be conditioned, severely constrained or even curtailed, depending on the severity of the non-compliance.

Accordingly, Strayer University endeavors proactively to keep Middle States (and all of its other regulators) fully informed and satisfied with its performance and strives to maintain good regulatory relationships as a key University priority. Beginning in 2013, Middle States undertook a review of its accreditation standards and, in June 2014, approved revised accreditation standards. Both accreditation standards remain in effect, and Middle States will begin measuring some institutions against the revised standards starting with the 2016-2017 institutional evaluations, but institutions scheduled for evaluations during that time frame were given the opportunity to proceed under either set of standards. Strayer&#8217;s next evaluation, which commenced with a self-study begun in spring 2015, will proceed under the accreditation standards in place prior to the revision.

In 2006, Strayer University completed a comprehensive self-study report, which was submitted to Middle States in support of Strayer University&#8217;s request for early reaffirmation of accreditation prior to Middle States&#8217; next scheduled accreditation review in 2011. Our objective is to provide a high quality post-secondary education to working adult students, and participation in academic peer review processes is an important way to help us meet that objective. Middle States reviewed Strayer University&#8217;s report and on June 28, 2007, reaffirmed Strayer University&#8217;s

accreditation for 10 years through 2017. In accordance with Middle States&#8217; accreditation standards, every accredited institution must file a periodic review report at the mid-point between its decennial evaluations. Strayer University filed its periodic review report on May 15, 2012, demonstrating that the institution continues to meet Middle States&#8217; standards. At its regular meeting on November 15, 2012, Middle States accepted the Periodic Review Report and reaffirmed Strayer University&#8217;s accreditation. Strayer University subsequently filed a progress report in November 2013, and the next evaluation visit is scheduled for 2016-2017. All of Strayer University&#8217;s substantive changes require prior Middle States approval.

In 2000, the agencies that accredit higher education institutions in various regions of the United States adopted a Policy Statement on Evaluation of Institutions Operating Interregionally. Under that policy, both the home regional accreditor and the host regional accreditor cooperate to evaluate an institution that delivers education at a physical site in the host accreditor&#8217;s region. Although the home region is solely responsible for final accreditation actions, as we open campuses in regions outside Middle States&#8217; region, the host regional accreditors may elect to participate in the accreditation process of such expansion operations.

In addition to our institutional accreditation, we have obtained specialized or programmatic accreditation, or professional recognition, from the following organizations for specific programs: The Accreditation Council for Business Schools and Programs, The Society for Human Resource Management, The National Security Agency&#8217;s Committee on National Security Systems, and the Council for the Accreditation of Educator Preparation (formerly the Teacher Education Accreditation Council).

State Education Licensure 

Licensure of Physical Campuses 

Strayer University is required by the federal Higher Education Act and certain state laws to be legally authorized to provide educational programs in the states in which the University is physically located. We are authorized to offer our programs by the applicable educational regulatory agencies in all states where our physical campuses and online delivery facilities are located. We are dependent upon the authorization of each state where we are physically located to allow us to operate and to grant degrees, diplomas or certificates to students in those states. We are subject to extensive regulation in each jurisdiction in which our campuses are located, including in 2015: Alabama, Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, New Jersey, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, West Virginia, and Washington, D.C. We will be subject to similar extensive regulation in those additional states in which we may expand our operations in the future. State laws and regulations affect our operations and may limit our ability to introduce educational programs or establish new campuses. At the end of 2013, we implemented a restructuring intended to better align our resources with our current student enrollments, and have closed campus locations in eight states, including Louisiana in 2015.

On October 29, 2010, the Department of Education adopted new regulations, effective July 1, 2011, that set new requirements for state authorization for purposes of Title IV eligibility. We believe that every state above in which Strayer is authorized has processes in place that comply with these new requirements.

Licensure of Online Programs 

The increasing popularity and use of the Internet and other technology for the delivery of education has led, and may continue to lead, to the adoption of new laws and regulatory practices in the United States or foreign countries or to interpretation of existing laws and regulations to apply to such services. These new laws and interpretations may relate to issues such as the requirement that online education institutions be licensed as a school in one or more jurisdictions even where they have no physical location. New laws, regulations, or interpretations related to doing business over the Internet could increase Strayer University&#8217;s cost of doing business, affect its ability to increase enrollments and revenues, or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business.

On October 29, 2010, the Department of Education adopted new regulations, which were to be effective July 1, 2011, regarding state authorization of online programs. The revised rules specified that that if an institution offers post-secondary education through distance or correspondence education to students in a state in which it is not physically located or in which it is otherwise subject to state jurisdiction as determined by the state, the institution must meet any state requirements for it to be legally offering post-secondary distance or correspondence education in that state. On May 6, 2011, the Department of Education issued a Dear Colleague Letter interpreting this new regulation, stating that 

it &#8220;will not initiate any action to establish repayment liabilities or limit student eligibility for distance education activities undertaken by an institution before July 1, 2014, so long as the institution is making good faith efforts to identify and obtain necessary State authorizations before that date.&#8221; On July 12, 2011, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia vacated the regulation relating to state authorization for distance education, which decision was upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit on June 5, 2012. In April 2013, the Department of Education announced that it would add state authorization of distance education to a negotiated rulemaking previously initiated in May 2012. While four negotiated rulemaking sessions were conducted from February through May 2014, no consensus was reached. To date the Department of Education has not issued a proposed rulemaking on this issue. 

Department of Education 

To be eligible to participate in Title IV programs, Strayer University must comply with specific standards and procedures set forth in the Higher Education Act and the regulations issued thereunder by the Department of Education. An institution must, among other things, be authorized to offer its educational programs by each state in which it is physically located and maintain institutional accreditation by a recognized accrediting agency as discussed above. The institution also must be certified by the Department of Education to participate in Title IV programs and follow Department of Education rules regarding the awarding and processing of funds issued under the Title IV programs. For purposes of the Title IV programs, Strayer University and all of its campuses are considered to be a single institution of higher education, such that Department of Education requirements applicable to an institution of higher education are generally applied to all of Strayer University&#8217;s campuses in the aggregate rather than on an individual basis. On October 1, 2014, Strayer University received an executed provisional Program Participation Agreement with the Department of Education allowing it to participate in Title IV programs until June 30, 2017. The Program Participation Agreement is provisional because of the program reviews that were open at the time the agreement was issued (described below).

Other Approvals 

Strayer University is approved by appropriate authorities for the education of veterans and members of the selective reserve and their dependents, as well as for the rehabilitation of veterans. In addition, Strayer University is authorized by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to admit foreign students for study in the United States subject to applicable requirements. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security, working with the U.S. Department of State, has implemented a mandatory electronic reporting system for schools that enroll foreign students and exchange visitors. The University is also authorized to participate in state financial aid programs in Pennsylvania, Florida and Vermont.

Financing Student Education 

Students finance their Strayer University education in a variety of ways, and historically about three quarters of our students participated in one or more Title IV programs. Many financial aid programs are designed to assist eligible students whose financial resources are inadequate to meet the cost of education. With these programs, financial aid is awarded on the basis of financial need, generally defined under the Higher Education Act as the difference between the cost of attending a program of study and the amount a student reasonably can be expected to contribute to those expenses. All recipients of federal student financial aid must maintain a satisfactory grade point average (&#8220;GPA&#8221;) and progress in a timely manner toward completion of a program of study. Undergraduate students must have a 2.0 cumulative GPA to graduate; graduate students other than JWMI students must have a 3.0 cumulative GPA to graduate; and JWMI students must have a 2.5 cumulative GPA to graduate.

In addition, many of our working adult students finance their own education or receive full or partial tuition reimbursement from their employers. Congress has enacted several tax credits for students pursuing higher education and has provided for a tax deduction for interest on student loans and exclusions from income of certain tuition reimbursement amounts. Eligible students at Strayer University may also participate in educational assistance programs administered by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the State of Florida, the State of Vermont, private organizations, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (and related state agencies), and the U.S. Department of Defense (&#8220;DOD&#8221;).

Congress recently expanded education benefits available to veterans who have served on active duty since September 11, 2001. Under the relevant law, known as the Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2009 (as amended August 1, 2011), sometimes referred to as the &#8220;New GI Bill,&#8221; eligible veterans may receive, among other

benefits, tuition benefits up to the net cost to the student (after accounting for state and federal aid, scholarships, institutional aid, fee waivers, and similar assistance), subject to a cap of $21,085 for non-public domestic institutions for 2015-2016. In addition, eligible students pursuing an educational program solely through distance learning are eligible to receive a housing stipend, equal to half the amount available to students attending certain classroom-based programs or programs that combine classroom learning and distance learning.

DOD promulgated regulations, published December 7, 2012 and effective January 7, 2013, requiring all institutions participating in DOD military tuition assistance programs to sign a Memorandum of Understanding (&#8220;MOU&#8221;) by March 1, 2013. At that time, Strayer University executed such an MOU with DOD. In 2014, the DOD revised the MOU and required participating institutions to execute a new MOU. Strayer University participates in DOD military tuition assistance programs under a revised Memorandum of Understanding with the DOD, executed on September 5, 2014, and various branches of the armed services. Thereunder, the University agrees to comply with DOD rules and procedures regarding the receipt of tuition assistance on behalf of active duty military personnel (and qualifying family members) in attendance at the University.

Title IV Programs 

Strayer University maintains eligibility for its students to participate in the following Title IV programs:

&#8226; &#160; Federal Grants. Grants under the Federal Pell Grant program are available to eligible students based on financial need and other factors. In April 2011, year-round Pell Grant awards beginning with the 2011-2012 award year were permanently eliminated. In addition, effective July 1, 2012, eligibility for Pell Grants was reduced from 18 semesters to 12 semesters.

&#8226; &#160; Campus-Based Programs. The campus-based Title IV programs include the Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant program, the Federal Perkins Loan, and the Federal Work-Study Program. Strayer University does not actively participate in the Perkins Loan or the Federal Work-Study Program.

&#8226; &#160; Federal Direct Student Loans. Under the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program, the Department of Education makes loans directly to students and their parents. Students who demonstrate financial need may qualify for a subsidized loan. With a subsidized loan, the federal government will pay the interest on the loan while the student is in school and during any approved periods of deferment, until the student&#8217;s obligation to repay the loan begins. Unsubsidized loans are available to students who do not qualify for a subsidized loan or, in some cases, in addition to a subsidized loan. PLUS loans, including Graduate PLUS loans, are unsubsidized. The Budget Control Act of 2011, signed into law on August 2, 2011, eliminated federal direct subsidized loans for graduate and professional students as of July 1, 2012. The terms and conditions of subsidized loans originated prior to July 1, 2012 are not affected by the change.

Federal Financial Aid Regulation 

To be eligible to participate in Title IV programs, Strayer University must comply with specific standards and procedures set forth in the Higher Education Act and the regulations issued thereunder by the Department of Education. As part of those participation standards, the Department of Education determines whether, among other things, the institution meets certain standards of administrative capability and financial responsibility. The institution must also follow extensive Department of Education rules regarding the awarding and processing of funds issued under the Title IV programs. Some of the key provisions regarding institutional eligibility and processing federal financial aid are described below.

Program Participation Agreement 

Each institution participating in Title IV programs must enter into a Program Participation Agreement with the Department of Education. Under the agreement, the institution agrees to follow the Department of Education&#8217;s rules and regulations governing Title IV programs. Strayer University&#8217;s provisional Program Participation Agreement with the Department of Education allows it to participate in Title IV programs until June 30, 2017.

Provisional Certification 

In certain circumstances, the Department of Education may certify an institution&#8217;s continuing eligibility to participate in Title IV programs on a provisional basis for up to three complete award years (July 1 &#8211; June 30) from the date of provisional certification. During the period of provisional certification, the institution must

comply with any additional conditions included in its program participation agreement. If the Department of Education determines that a provisionally certified institution is unable to meet its responsibilities under its program participation agreement, it may seek to revoke or further condition the institution&#8217;s certification to participate in Title IV programs with fewer due process protections for the institution than if it were fully certified. Should the Department of Education seek to revoke eligibility during the provisional period, the institution will have an opportunity to show cause why such revocation is not warranted and the Department of Education&#8217;s decision to accept or reject such cause will constitute final agency action. Strayer University is operating under a provisional Program Participation Agreement through June 30, 2017, and the only material additional condition with which the University must comply as a result of this provisional certification is obtaining the Department of Education&#8217;s approval for substantial changes, including the addition of any new location, level of academic offering, or non-degree and degree programs.

Administrative Capability 

Department of Education regulations specify extensive criteria by which an institution must establish that it has the requisite administrative capability to participate in Title IV programs. To meet the administrative capability standards, an institution, among other things, must comply with all applicable Title IV program regulations, must not have cohort default rates above specified levels, must have various procedures in place for safeguarding federal funds, must not be, and not have any principal or affiliate who is, debarred or suspended from federal contracting or engaging in activity that is cause for debarment or suspension, must submit in a timely manner all reports and financial statements required by the regulations and must not otherwise appear to lack administrative capability.

Financial Responsibility 

The Higher Education Act and Department of Education regulations establish extensive standards of financial responsibility that institutions such as Strayer University must satisfy in order to participate in Title IV programs. These standards generally require that an institution provide the services described in its official publications and statements, properly administer the Title IV programs in which it participates and meet all of its financial obligations, including required refunds and any repayments to the Department of Education for debts and liabilities incurred in programs administered by the Department of Education.

Department of Education standards utilize a complex formula to assess financial responsibility. The standards focus on three financial ratios: (1) equity ratio (which measures the institution&#8217;s capital resources and ability to borrow); (2) primary reserve ratio (which measures the institution&#8217;s financial viability and liquidity) and (3) net income ratio (which measures the institution&#8217;s ability to operate at a profit or within its means). An institution&#8217;s financial ratios must yield a composite score of at least 1.5 for the institution to be deemed financially responsible without alternative measures and further federal oversight. Strayer University has applied the financial responsibility standards to its financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015, and based on its composite score and other relevant factors, we believe that Strayer University meets the Department of Education&#8217;s financial responsibility standards.

Student Loan Defaults 

Under the Higher Education Act, an educational institution may lose its eligibility to participate in some or all of the Title IV programs if defaults on the repayment of Direct Loan or Federal Family Education Loan (&#8220;FFEL&#8221;) Program loans by its students exceed certain levels. The Department of Education uses a specific methodology to determine default rates and imposes varying sanctions based upon the results of that calculation. As discussed below, the cohort default rate calculation and threshold for regulatory sanctions changed effective 2014 as a result of the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act through the Higher Education Opportunity Act (&#8220;HEOA&#8221;), which was effective August 18, 2008.

The Department of Education calculates a rate of student defaults (known as a cohort default rate) for each institution with 30 or more borrowers entering repayment in a given federal fiscal year. The Department of Education includes in the cohort all student borrowers at the institution who entered repayment on any Direct or FFEL Program loan during that year. The cohort default rate is the percentage of those borrowers who become subject to their repayment obligation in the relevant federal fiscal year and default by the end of the second federal fiscal year following that fiscal year, resulting in a three-year cohort default rate. Because of the need to collect data on defaults, the Department of Education publishes cohort default rates three years in arrears; for example, in the fall of 2015, the Department of Education issued cohort default rates for federal fiscal year 2012.

The Department of Education may take adverse action against an institution if it has excessive cohort default rates, including the following:

&#8226; &#160; If an institution&#8217;s cohort default rate is 30% or more in a given fiscal year, the institution will be required to assemble a &#8220;default prevention task force&#8221; and submit to the Department of Education a default improvement plan.

&#8226; &#160; If an institution&#8217;s cohort default rate exceeds 30% for two consecutive years, the institution will be required to review, revise and resubmit its default improvement plan. The Department of Education may direct that the plan be amended to include actions, with measurable objectives, that it determines will promote loan repayment.

&#8226; &#160; If an institution&#8217;s cohort default rate exceeds 30% for two out of three consecutive years, the Department of Education may subject the institution to provisional certification. The institution may file a timely appeal on specified grounds according to specified procedures, and if the Secretary of Education determines that the institution demonstrated a basis for relief, the Secretary may not subject the institution to provisional certification based solely on the institution&#8217;s cohort default rate.

&#8226; &#160; If an institution&#8217;s cohort default rate is equal to or greater than 30% for each of the three most recent federal fiscal years for which data are available, the institution will be ineligible to participate in the Direct Loan Program and Federal Pell Grant Program.

An institution generally loses eligibility to participate in Title IV programs if its most recent cohort default rate is greater than 40%, and institutions with a cohort default rate equal to or greater than 15% for any of the three most recent fiscal years for which data are available are subject to a 30-day delayed disbursement period for first-year, first-time undergraduate borrowers. Because its cohort default rate for 2010 was 15.1%, Strayer disburses Direct Loans in this manner.

Strayer&#8217;s official three-year cohort default rates for 2010, 2011, and 2012, as well as the average official three-year cohort default rates for proprietary institutions nationally, were as follows:

As part of its compliance program related to the cohort default rate, Strayer University provides entrance and exit counseling to its students and engages the services of a third party to counsel students once they are in repayment status regarding their repayment obligations.

The 90/10 Rule 

A requirement of the Higher Education Act, commonly referred to as the 90/10 Rule, applies only to proprietary institutions of higher education, which includes Strayer University. Under this rule, a proprietary institution is prohibited from deriving more than 90% of its revenues (as revenues are computed under the Department of Education&#8217;s methodology) from Title IV funds on a cash accounting basis (except for certain institutional loans) for any fiscal year.

The 90/10 Rule is a compliance obligation that is part of an institution&#8217;s program participation agreement with the Department of Education. A proprietary institution of higher education that violates the 90/10 Rule for any fiscal year will be placed on provisional status for up to two fiscal years. Proprietary institutions of higher education that violate the 90/10 Rule for two consecutive fiscal years will become ineligible to participate in Title IV programs for at least two fiscal years and will be required to demonstrate compliance with Title IV eligibility and certification requirements for at least two fiscal years prior to resuming Title IV program participation. In addition, the Department of Education discloses on its website any proprietary institution of higher education that fails to meet the 90/10 requirement, and reports annually to Congress the relevant ratios for each proprietary institution of higher education. 

HEOA changes in 2008 generally codified the regulatory formula for 90/10 rule calculations, but also expanded on the Department of Education&#8217;s formula in certain respects, including by broadening the categories of funds that may be counted as non-Title IV revenue for 90/10 Rule purposes. The HEOA provisions were effective on August 14, 2008, and the Department of Education issued final regulations implementing the 90/10 Rule and certain

other HEOA provisions that were effective July 1, 2010, but institutions could have, at their discretion, implemented the 90/10 Rule regulations on or after November 1, 2009. These regulations clarify the treatment of certain types of revenue, and require institutions to report in their annual financial statement audits not only the percentage of revenues derived from Title IV funds during the fiscal year, but also the dollar amounts of the numerator and denominator of the 90/10 calculation and specified categories of revenue. The regulations also shorten from 90 to 45 days the time period within which institutions must notify the Secretary after the end of a fiscal year in which the institution failed to meet the 90/10 Rule requirement.

Using the HEOA formula, Strayer University derived approximately 73% of its cash-basis revenues from Title IV program funds in 2014. Our computation for 2015 has not yet been finalized and audited; however, we believe we will remain in compliance with the 90/10 Rule requirement.

The key components of non-Title IV revenue for Strayer University are individual student payments, employer tuition reimbursement payments, veterans&#8217; benefits, vocational rehabilitation funds, private loans, state grants, and scholarships. Certain members of Congress have proposed to revise the 90/10 Rule to count DOD tuition assistance and veterans&#8217; education benefits along with Title IV revenue toward the 90% limit and to reduce the limit to 85% of total revenue.

Incentive Compensation 

As a part of an institution&#8217;s program participation agreement with the Department of Education and in accordance with the Higher Education Act, the institution may not provide any commission, bonus or other incentive payment based directly or indirectly on success in securing enrollments or financial aid to any person or entity engaged in any student recruitment, admissions or financial aid awarding activity. Failure to comply with the incentive payment rule could result in loss of certification to participate in federal student financial aid programs, limitations on participation in the federal student financial aid programs, or financial penalties.

Effective July 1, 2011, the Department of Education eliminated 12 &#8220;safe harbors&#8221; that had been established in 2002 to define circumstances under which an institution would not run afoul of the incentive payment prohibition. The final rules prohibit payments made &#8220;in any part,&#8221; directly or indirectly, upon the success of securing enrollments or financial aid, apply to all employees at an institution who are engaged in or responsible for any student recruitment or admission activity, limit &#8220;profit-sharing payments,&#8221; and set rules for third-party contracts. The Department of Education published Dear Colleague Letter GEN-11-05 interpreting this regulation. We believe we are in compliance with the regulation. 

Gainful Employment 

Under the Higher Education Act, a proprietary institution offering programs of study other than a baccalaureate degree in liberal arts (for which there is a limited statutory exception) must prepare students for gainful employment in a recognized occupation. The Department of Education previously attempted to define &#8220;an eligible program of training to prepare students for gainful employment in a recognized occupation.&#8221; After a federal court invalidated the Department of Education&#8217;s regulation (except for disclosure requirements), the Department of Education established a negotiated rulemaking committee to again consider the issue of gainful employment, and appointed Strayer University&#8217;s then-General Counsel to serve on the committee. The Committee did not achieve the required consensus, allowing the Department of Education to put forth its own proposed rules. On March 25, 2014, the Department of Education issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking for public comment, and on October 31, 2014, the Department of Education published the final regulation which became effective on July 1, 2015.

The new requirements include two debt-to-earnings measures, consisting of an annual income rate and a discretionary income rate. The annual income rate measures student debt in relation to earnings, and the discretionary income rate measures student debt in relation to discretionary income. Under the new gainful employment regulation, a program would pass if the program&#8217;s graduates:

&#8226; &#160; have an annual income rate ratio that does not exceed 8%; or 

&#8226; &#160; have a discretionary income rate that does not exceed 20%.

In addition, a program that does not pass either of the debt-to-earnings metrics, and that has an annual income rate between 8% and 12%, or a discretionary income rate between 20% and 30%, would be considered to be in a warning zone. A program would fail if the program&#8217;s graduates have an annual income rate of 12% or greater and a discretionary income rate of 30% or greater. A program would become Title IV-ineligible for three years if it fails both metrics for two out of three consecutive years, or fails to pass at least one metric for four consecutive award years. 

If an institution is notified by the Secretary that a program could become ineligible, based on its final rates, for the next award year:

&#8226; &#160; the institution must provide a warning with respect to the program to students and prospective students indicating, among other things, that students may not be able to use Title IV funds to attend or continue in the program; and

&#8226; &#160; the institution must not enroll, register or enter into a financial commitment with a prospective student until a specified time after providing the warning to the prospective student.

The new regulation also requires institutions to report student and program level data to the Department of Education, and comply with additional disclosure requirements beginning in January 2017. The University timely submitted the required reporting in July and September 2015. On October 9, 2015, the Department of Education notified the University that it was not in full compliance with reporting requirements for gainful employment programs and thus no decisions on new programs or locations will be issued. Although the University had timely reported all information for gainful employment programs, the Department did not recognize the submissions as complete due to erroneous academic program codes in the Common Origination and Disbursement system. The University has remediated the errors, and the Department of Education has acknowledged the University&#8217;s submissions as complete. 

In addition, the gainful employment regulation requires institutions to certify by December 31, 2015, among other things, that each eligible gainful employment program is programmatically accredited if required by a federal governmental entity or a state governmental entity of a state in which it is located or is otherwise required to obtain state approval, and that each eligible program satisfies the applicable educational prerequisites for professional licensure or certification requirements in each state in which it is located or is otherwise required to obtain state approval, so that a student who completes the program and seeks employment in that state qualifies to take any licensure or certification exam that is needed for the student to practice or find employment in an occupation that the program prepares students to enter. The University timely made the required certification.

The requirements associated with the gainful employment regulations may substantially increase our administrative burdens and could affect our student enrollment, persistence and retention. Further, although the regulations provide opportunities for an institution to correct any potential deficiencies in a program prior to the loss of Title IV eligibility, the continuing eligibility of our academic programs may be affected by factors beyond management&#8217;s control, such as changes in our graduates&#8217; employment and income levels, changes in student borrowing levels, increases in interest rates, and various other factors. Even if we were able to correct any deficiency in the gainful employment metrics in a timely manner, the disclosure requirements associated with a program&#8217;s failure to meet at least one metric may adversely affect student enrollments in that program and may adversely affect the reputation of our institution.

Return of Federal Funds 

Under the Higher Education Act&#8217;s return-of-funds provision, an institution must return Title IV funds to a Title IV program in a timely manner if a student received funds from that program but did not earn them due to the student&#8217;s withdrawal from the institution. In order to determine if funds should be returned, the institution must first determine the amount of Title IV program funds that the student earned. If the student attends the institution, but withdraws during the first 60% of any period of enrollment or payment period, the amount of Title IV program funds that the student earned is equal to a pro rata portion of the funds for which the student would otherwise be eligible. Strayer University uses the student&#8217;s last day of attendance as the withdrawal date for purposes of return to Title IV. Effective July 1, 2011, institutions that use the last day of attendance are required to measure the last day of attendance based on official attendance records, and &#8220;attendance&#8221; for online classes must include participation in an academically related activity. Strayer University&#8217;s systems allow for measurement on this basis. If the student withdraws after the 60% point, then the student has earned 100% of the Title IV program funds. The institution must return to the appropriate Title IV programs, in a specified order, the lesser of the unearned Title IV program funds or the institutional charges incurred by the student for the period multiplied by the percentage of unearned Title IV program funds. An institution must return the funds no later than 45 days after the date that the institution determines that a student withdrew.

If the funds are not returned in a timely manner, an institution may be subject to adverse action, including being required to submit a letter of credit equal to 25% of the refunds the institution should have made in its most recently completed fiscal year. Under Department of Education regulations, if late returns of Title IV program funds

constitute 5% or more of students sampled in the institution&#8217;s annual compliance audit for either of its two most recently completed fiscal years, an institution generally must submit an irrevocable letter of credit payable to the Secretary of Education.

Third-Party Servicers 

Department of Education regulations permit an institution to enter into a written contract with a third-party servicer for the administration of any aspect of the institution&#8217;s participation in Title IV programs. The third-party servicer must, among other obligations, comply with Title IV requirements and be jointly and severally liable with the institution to the Secretary of Education for any violation by the servicer of any Title IV provision. An institution must report to the Department of Education new contracts or any significant modifications to contracts with third-party servicers as well as other matters related to third-party servicers. Strayer University has written contracts with third-party servicers to perform activities related to Strayer University&#8217;s participation in Title IV programs. Strayer University also has a contract with Heartland Payment Systems, Inc. for processing stipends due to students. For loan default prevention, Strayer University had contracted with General Revenue Corporation through February 2015, and with i3 Group, LLC for the remainder of 2015. Prior to September 30, 2011, Strayer University utilized Global Financial Aid Services, Inc., for services including certifying Title IV loan applications, preparing reports from Strayer University to the Department of Education, and issuing federal grant program payments. The University&#8217;s agreement with Global Financial Aid Services expired on September 30, 2011, at which point Strayer University in-sourced its financial aid processing.

Lender Relationships 

As part of an institution&#8217;s program participation agreement with the Department of Education, the institution must adopt a code of conduct pertaining to student loans. Strayer University has a code of conduct that it believes complies with the provisions of HEOA in all material respects. In addition to the code of conduct requirements that apply to institutions, HEOA contains provisions that apply to lenders, prohibiting lenders from engaging in certain activities as they interact with institutions.

Prior to the termination of the FFEL Program on June 30, 2010, Strayer University was subject to rules applicable to institutions that make available a list of recommended or suggested federal loan lenders for use by potential borrowers. Strayer University remains subject to those rules with respect to private education loans.

Restrictions on Adding Locations and Educational Programs 

State requirements and accrediting agency standards limit the ability of Strayer University to establish additional locations and programs. Most states require approval before institutions can add new programs, campuses or teaching locations. Middle States requires institutions that it accredits to notify it in advance of implementing new programs or locations, which may require additional approval. At its discretion, Middle States may also conduct site visits to additional locations to ensure that accredited institutions that experience rapid growth in the number of additional locations, among other reasons, maintain educational quality. All new Strayer University campus locations require Middle States approval before students are enrolled, and the Higher Education Act requires Middle States to monitor institutions with significant enrollment growth. In addition, under Strayer University&#8217;s provisional certification, the Department of Education must approve any new campus location, level of academic offering and non-degree and degree programs.

The Higher Education Act requires proprietary institutions of higher education to be in full operation for two years before qualifying to participate in Title IV programs. However, the applicable regulations in many circumstances permit an institution that is already qualified to participate in Title IV programs to establish additional locations that are exempt from the two-year rule. These additional locations generally may qualify immediately for participation in the Title IV programs, unless the location was acquired from another institution that has ceased offering educational programs at that location and has Title IV liabilities that it is not repaying in accordance with an agreement to do so, and the acquiring institution does not agree, among other matters, to be responsible for certain liabilities of the acquired institution. The new location must satisfy all other applicable requirements for institutional eligibility, including approval of the additional location by the relevant state authorizing agency and the institution&#8217;s accrediting agency. Strayer University&#8217;s expansion plans assume its continued ability to establish new campuses as additional locations of Strayer University under such applicable regulations and thereby to avoid incurring the two-year delay in participation in Title IV programs. The loss of state authorization or accreditation of Strayer University or an existing campus, or the failure of Strayer University or a new campus to obtain state authorization

or accreditation, would render Strayer University ineligible to participate in Title IV programs at least in that state or at that location. Department of Education regulations require institutions to report to the Department of Education a new additional location at which at least 50% of an eligible program will be offered, if the institution wants to disburse Title IV program funds to students enrolled at that location. Under its provisional Program Participation Agreement with the Department of Education, Strayer University must obtain Department of Education approval for the addition of any new location. Institutions are responsible for knowing whether they need approval, and institutions that add locations and disburse Title IV program funds without having obtained any necessary approval may be subject to administrative repayments and other sanctions.

The gainful employment regulation that became effective July 1, 2015 provides that an institution may establish a new program&#8217;s Title IV eligibility by updating the list of the institution&#8217;s programs maintained by the Department of Education, and thereby making the certification required by the regulation. However, an institution may not update its list of eligible programs to include a gainful employment program, or a gainful employment program that is substantially similar to a failing or zone program that the institution voluntarily discontinued or became ineligible, that was subject to the three-year loss of eligibility until that three-year period expires.

Other Regulations Governing Title IV Programs 

The Department of Education has enacted a comprehensive set of regulations governing an institution&#8217;s participation in the Title IV programs. If Strayer University were not to continue to comply with these regulations, such non-compliance might affect the operations of the University and its ability to participate in Title IV programs.

Compliance Reviews 

Strayer University is subject to announced and unannounced compliance reviews and audits by various external agencies, including the Department of Education, its Office of Inspector General, state licensing agencies, guaranty agencies, and accrediting agencies. The Higher Education Act and Department of Education regulations also require an institution to submit annually to the Secretary of Education a compliance audit of its administration of the Title IV programs conducted by an independent certified public accountant in accordance with Government Auditing Standards and applicable audit guides of the Department of Education&#8217;s Office of Inspector General. In addition, to enable the Secretary of Education to make a determination of financial responsibility, an institution must submit annually to the Secretary of Education audited financial statements prepared in accordance with Department of Education regulations.

In an August 2010 letter to members of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee, the Secretary of Education announced plans to increase the number of program reviews by 50%, from 200 conducted in 2010 to 300 in 2011. The Department of Education conducted four campus-based program reviews of Strayer University locations in three states and the District of Columbia, with one on-site review conducted August 18-20, 2014; one on-site review conducted September 8-11, 2014; and two on-site reviews conducted September 22-26, 2014. The reviews covered federal financial aid years 2012-2013 and 2013-2014, and two of the reviews also covered compliance with the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act, the Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act, and regulations related thereto. On October 21, 2014, the Department issued an Expedited Final Program Review Determination Letter for one of the program reviews conducted the week of September 22, 2014, closing the program review with no further action required by us. On November 17, 2014, we received a Program Review Report for the program review conducted in August 2014, and provided a response to the Department of Education on December 15, 2014. On January 7, 2015, we received a Final Program Review Determination letter from that August 2014 review, closing the review with no further action required by us. On March 24, 2015, the Company received a Program Review Report for another program review, and provided a response to the Department on April 21, 2015. On April 29, 2015, the Company received a Final Program Review Determination Letter closing the review and identifying a payment of less than $500 due to the Department of Education based on an underpayment on a return to Title IV calculation. The Company remitted payment, and received a letter from the Department on May 26, 2015, indicating that no further action was required and that the matter was closed. On September 15, 2015, the Company received a Program Review report for the final program review, and provided a response to the Department on October 5, 2015. On January 5, 2016 the Company received a Final Program Review Determination letter for the final program review, indicating that the program review was closed and no further action was required.

Potential Effect of Regulatory Violations 

If Strayer University fails to comply with the regulatory standards governing Title IV programs, the Department of Education could impose one or more sanctions, including transferring Strayer University from the advance payment method to the reimbursement or cash monitoring system of payment, seeking to require repayment of certain Title IV funds, requiring the University to post a letter of credit in favor of the Department of Education as a condition for continued Title IV certification, taking emergency action against the University, referring the matter for criminal prosecution or initiating proceedings to impose a fine or to limit, condition, suspend or terminate Strayer University&#8217;s participation in Title IV programs. Although there are no such sanctions currently in force, if such sanctions or proceedings were imposed against Strayer University and resulted in a substantial curtailment, or termination, of the University&#8217;s participation in Title IV programs or resulted in substantial fines or monetary liabilities, Strayer University would be materially and adversely affected.

If Strayer University lost its eligibility to participate in Title IV programs, or if Congress reduced the amount of available federal student financial aid, the University would seek to arrange or provide alternative sources of revenue or financial aid for students. Although the University believes that one or more private organizations would be willing to provide financial assistance to students attending Strayer University, there is no assurance that this would be the case, and the interest rate and other terms of such student financial aid are unlikely to be as favorable as those for Title IV program funds. Strayer University might be required to guarantee all or part of such alternative assistance in a manner that complies with rules governing schools&#8217; relationships with lenders or might incur other additional costs in connection with securing alternative sources of financial aid. Accordingly, the loss of eligibility of Strayer University to participate in Title IV programs, or a reduction in the amount of available federal student financial aid, would be expected to have a material adverse effect on Strayer University, even if it could arrange or provide alternative sources of revenue or student financial aid.

In addition to the actions that may be brought against us as a result of our participation in Title IV programs, we also may be subject, from time to time, to complaints and lawsuits relating to regulatory compliance brought not only by our regulatory agencies, but also by other government agencies and third parties.

Change in Ownership Resulting in a Change of Control 

Many states and accrediting agencies require institutions of higher education to report or obtain approval of certain changes in ownership or other aspects of institutional status, but the types of and triggers for such reporting or approval vary among states and accrediting agencies. In addition, Strayer University&#8217;s accrediting agency, Middle States, requires institutions that it accredits to inform it in advance of any substantive change, including a change that significantly alters the ownership or control of the institution. Examples of substantive changes requiring advance notice to and approval of Middle States include changes in the legal status, ownership or form of control of the institution, such as the sale of a proprietary institution. Middle States must approve a substantive change in advance in order to include the change in the institution&#8217;s accreditation status. Middle States will undertake a site visit to an institution that has undergone a change in ownership or control no later than six months after the change.

The Higher Education Act provides that an institution that undergoes a change in ownership resulting in a change of control loses its eligibility to participate in the Title IV programs and must apply to the Department of Education in order to reestablish such eligibility. An institution is ineligible to receive Title IV program funds during the period prior to recertification. The Higher Education Act provides that the Department of Education may temporarily, provisionally certify an institution seeking approval of a change of ownership and control based on preliminary review by the Department of Education of a materially complete application received by the Department of Education within 10 business days after the transaction. The Department of Education may continue such temporary, provisional certification on a month-to-month basis until it has rendered a final decision on the institution&#8217;s application. If the Department of Education determines to approve the application after a change in ownership and control, it issues a provisional certification, which extends for a period expiring not later than the end of the third complete award year following the date of provisional certification. The Higher Education Act defines one of the events that would trigger a change in ownership resulting in a change of control as the transfer of the controlling interest of the stock of the institution or its parent corporation. For a publicly traded corporation, the securities of which are required to be registered under the Exchange Act, such as Strayer, the Department of Education regulations implementing the Higher Education Act define a change in ownership resulting in a change of control as occurring when a person acquires ownership and control of a corporation such that the corporation is required to file a Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) publicly disclosing the change of

control. The regulations also provide that a change in ownership and control of a publicly traded corporation occurs if a person who is a controlling stockholder of the corporation ceases to be a controlling stockholder. A controlling stockholder is a stockholder who holds or controls through agreement both 25% or more of the total outstanding voting stock of the corporation and more shares of voting stock than any other stockholder.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security, working with the U.S. Department of State, has implemented a mandatory electronic reporting system for schools that enroll foreign students and exchange visitors. Strayer University currently is authorized by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to admit foreign students for study in the United States subject to applicable requirements. In certain circumstances, the Department of Homeland Security may require an institution to obtain approval for a change in ownership and control.

Pursuant to federal law providing benefits for veterans and reservists, some of the programs offered by Strayer University are approved for the enrollment of persons eligible to receive U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs educational benefits by the state approving agencies. In 2015, we had such approval in Alabama, Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, New Jersey, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Washington, D.C. In certain circumstances, state approving agencies may require an institution to obtain approval for a change in ownership and control.

If Strayer University underwent a change of control that required approval by any state authority, Middle States or any federal agency, and any required regulatory approval were significantly delayed, limited or denied, there could be a material adverse effect on Strayer University&#8217;s ability to offer certain educational programs, award certain degrees, diplomas or certificates, operate one or more of its locations, admit certain students or participate in Title IV programs, which in turn would materially and adversely affect Strayer University&#8217;s operations. A change that required approval by a state regulatory authority, Middle States or a federal agency could also delay Strayer University&#8217;s ability to establish new campuses or educational programs and may have other adverse regulatory effects. Furthermore, the suspension from Title IV programs and the necessity of obtaining regulatory approvals in connection with a change of control may materially limit Strayer University&#8217;s flexibility in future financing or acquisition transactions.

Recent or Pending Legislative and Regulatory Activity 

Congress has been considering legislation that would make further changes in the Higher Education Act and other education-related federal laws. Congressional activity may adversely affect enrollment in for-profit educational institutions. We cannot predict the impact, if any, of these recent or pending legislative changes on our long-term business model, or whether future congresses will consider similar legislation, although uncertainty associated with Congressional activity has had a negative impact on the industry as a whole.

As discussed more fully above, the Department of Education recently issued a final regulation on gainful employment, which became effective on July 1, 2015. This regulation establishes debt-to-earnings metrics that a Title IV eligible program must pass in order to maintain eligibility. A program failing both debt-to-earnings metrics in two out of three consecutive years, or failing or in a warning zone for four consecutive years, would be deemed ineligible to receive Title IV funds for a period of three years.

Congress 

Congress historically has reauthorized the Higher Education Act (&#8220;HEA&#8221;) , which is the law governing Title IV programs, approximately every five to six years. On July 31, 2008, Congress reauthorized the HEA through the end of 2013, by passing the HEOA, which President Bush signed into law on August 14, 2008. The HEOA provisions became effective upon enactment, unless otherwise specified in the law. HEOA includes numerous new and revised requirements for higher education institutions. In October 2009, the Department of Education published final regulations to implement HEOA changes to Title IV of the Higher Education Act. Those regulations were effective July 1, 2010. Congress extended funding for Title IV through September 30, 2016, through the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015. Both the House and Senate have continued to hold hearings regarding the reauthorization of the HEA. We cannot predict what the final reauthorization will, or will not do, or when or how it will be enacted, or its effects on Strayer University.

In addition to HEOA, three other laws to amend and reauthorize aspects of the Higher Education Act have been enacted over the last few years. In February 2006, President Bush signed the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, which included the Higher Education Reconciliation Act of 2005, or HERA. Among other measures, HERA

reauthorized the Higher Education Act with respect to the federal guaranteed student loan programs. In September 2007, President Bush signed the College Cost Reduction and Access Act, which increased benefits to students under the Title IV programs and reduced payments to and raised costs for lenders that participate in the federal student loan programs. In May 2008, President Bush signed the Ensuring Continued Access to Student Loans Act of 2008, or ECASLA, which was designed to facilitate student loan availability and to increase student access to federal financial aid in light of then-current market conditions. Congress extended ECASLA for an additional year, to June 30, 2010. In March 2010, Congress passed the Student Aid and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2009, which eliminated the FFEL Program and required all institutions participating in Title IV programs to convert exclusively to the Direct Loan Program by July 1, 2010.

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (&#8220;CFPB&#8221;) submitted two reports to Congress in 2012 with specific recommendations for restructuring the student borrowing experience, including requiring institutions to certify that a student is not eligible for any further federal funds before a private loan may be issued to such student. On October 16, 2014, the CFPB Student Loan Ombudsman released its third annual report analyzing more than 5,300 complaints the CFPB received from private student loan borrowers between October 1, 2013 and September 30, 2014. The report stated that, as Congress considers HEA reauthorization, it may be useful to assess whether certain reforms related to the servicing of credit cards and mortgages might also strengthen loan servicing. We do not know what steps the CFPB or Congress may take in response to these actions and whether such actions (if any) will have an adverse effect on our business or results of operations.

On August 9, 2013, the Bipartisan Student Loan Certainty Act became law. Under the Act, interest rates on all Direct loans to undergraduates are pegged to the 10-year T-bill rate plus 2.05%, with a cap at 8.25%. Interest rates on Direct loans to post-graduate students will be at the T-bill rate plus 3.6%, with a cap at 9.5%. Interest rates on Direct PLUS loans are set at the T-bill rate plus 4.6%, with a cap at 10.5%. Direct consolidation loan rates will be a weighted average of the interest rates of the consolidated loans rounded to the nearest 1/8 th of 1%. Interest rates would be reset every July 1 st and effective for loans taken out from July 1 st to June 30 th of the next year. Those interest rates would be effective for the life of the loan.

On December 19, 2013, Senator Jack Reed (D-RI) introduced legislation in the Senate that would create a risk sharing program for those institutions with more than 25% of its students participating in a student loan program. Institutions in the program would be assessed between 5 and 20 percent of the amount students owe on their loans, depending on the degree to which the institution&#8217;s cohort default rate exceeded 15%. Senator Reed again introduced such legislation in the Senate on April 4, 2015. Similar legislation was introduced in the House in September 2014 and May 2015. The POST Act of 2013, introduced in the Senate by Senator Richard Durbin (D-IL) and in the House by Representative Steve Cohen (D-TN), would require proprietary institutions to derive at least 15% of their revenue from non-federal funding sources, and federal funding sources would be redefined to include funds from the Department of Defense and Department of Veterans Affairs except any housing stipend provided under the Post-9/11 Veterans Assistance Education Program. The POST Act of 2015 was reintroduced in the Senate on November 10, 2015 and in the House on November 19, 2015. We cannot predict whether these or similar bills, and others affecting our business, will be reintroduced in the 114 th Congress and will pass or what, if any, impact they would have on our business. 

Appropriations 

Congress reviews and determines appropriations for Title IV programs on an annual basis. An elimination of certain Title IV programs, a reduction in federal funding levels of such programs, material changes in the requirements for participation in such programs, or the substitution of materially different programs could reduce the ability of certain students to finance their education. This, in turn, could lead to lower enrollments at Strayer University or require us to increase our reliance upon alternative sources of student financial aid. Given the significant percentage of our revenues that are derived indirectly from the Title IV programs, the loss of or a significant reduction in Title IV program funds available to our students could have a material adverse effect on Strayer University.

Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee 

In 2010, the U.S. Congress increased its focus on proprietary education institutions, including regarding participation in Title IV programs and DOD oversight of tuition assistance for military service members. Since June 2010, the Senate HELP Committee, formerly led by Senator Harkin, has held hearings to examine the proprietary education sector. Other committees of the U.S. Congress have also held hearings into, among other

things, the standards and procedures of accrediting agencies, credit hours and program length, the portion of federal student financial aid going to proprietary institutions, and the receipt of veterans and military education benefits by students enrolled at proprietary institutions. Strayer University has cooperated with these inquiries. A number of legislators have variously requested the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to review and make recommendations regarding, among other things, recruitment practices, educational quality, student outcomes, the sufficiency of integrity safeguards against waste, fraud and abuse in Title IV programs, and the percentage of proprietary institutions&#8217; revenue coming from Title IV and other federal funding sources. The GAO released four reports on for-profit post-secondary education: first, a report in August 2010 (subsequently revised in November 2010) that concluded, based on a three-month undercover investigation, that employees at a non-random sample of 15 proprietary institutions (not including Strayer University) made deceptive statements to students about accreditation, graduation rates, job placement, program costs, and financial aid; second, a report in October 2010 critical of the Department of Education&#8217;s efforts to enforce the ban on incentive payments; third, a report in October 2011 critical of the student experience and instructor performance at some for-profit online institutions; and fourth, a report in December 2011 comparing various student outcomes across proprietary, non-profit, and public institutions.

On July 30, 2012, the then-majority of the Senate HELP Committee, led by Democrats, released its final report on the for-profit sector of higher education entitled &#8220;For Profit Higher Education: The Failure to Safeguard the Federal Investment and Ensure Student Success.&#8221; While acknowledging that for-profit institutions have a role to play in higher education, the report criticized the proprietary institution industry on many fronts. However, the report also concluded that Strayer University&#8217;s &#8220;performance, measured by student withdrawal and default rates, is one of the best of any company examined, and it appears that students are faring well at this degree based for-profit college.&#8221; S. Rept. 112-37. The report ultimately recommended several measures for reform which could change the participation of proprietary institutions in Title IV funding, including the following:

&#8226; &#160; Tie access to federal financial aid to minimum student outcome thresholds.

&#8226; &#160; Prohibit institutions from funding marketing, advertising and recruiting activities with federal financial aid dollars.

&#8226; &#160; Expand the reporting period for cohort default rates beyond three years.

&#8226; &#160; Require that for-profits receive 15% of revenues from non-federal sources.

&#8226; &#160; Extend the ban on incentive compensation to include all employees of institutions of higher education, and clarify that this ban extends to numeric threshold or quota-based termination policies.

The report was not adopted by the full Committee, and the Republican minority released their own report criticizing the majority&#8217;s investigation in many aspects, including that it did not include a review of all institutions of higher education. In addition, on July 30, 2014, the then-majority of the Committee released a report entitled &#8220;Is the New G.I. Bill Working?: For-Profit Colleges Increasing Veteran Enrollment and Federal Funds,&#8221; detailing the amount of Post-9/11 GI Bill Benefits paid to for-profit colleges, including Strayer, and recommending that the 90/10 rule be &#8220;strengthened.&#8221; The report states that at least four companies, including Strayer, &#8220;appear to be receiving close to or more than half of their reported non-federal financial aid revenue on the 10 side of the equation from Post-9/11 GI bill benefit funds.&#8221; Of the top ten proprietary institutions mentioned receiving such funds, Strayer University was noted as receiving one of the lowest amounts of Post-9/11 GI Bill funds.

On September 21, 2012, a group of Democratic senators wrote a letter to the Federal Trade Commission urging it to evaluate the marketing practices utilized by many proprietary institutions through the use of third-party lead generators. In addition, legislation was introduced in the Senate by then Senator Harkin in April 2012, which would prevent institutions from using Title IV funds for marketing activities. Similar legislation may be introduced in the 114 th Congress.

This increased congressional activity is expected to continue and may result in legislation, further rulemaking affecting participation in Title IV programs, and other governmental actions.

U.S. Department of Education 

Title IV regulations applicable to Strayer University have been subject to frequent revisions, many of which have increased the level of scrutiny to which higher education institutions are subjected and have raised applicable standards. In October 2009, the Department of Education published final regulations to implement

the HEOA&#8217;s numerous new and revised requirements for higher education institutions. These regulations were effective July 1, 2010. On October 29, 2010, the Department of Education published final regulations regarding program integrity at higher education institutions (Program Integrity Regulations), most of which became effective July 1, 2011. On November 25, 2014, the Department of Education issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking related to teacher preparation programs which would, among other things, encourage states to develop systems to identify high- and low-performing teacher preparation programs and report annually on the performance of such programs. On August 20, 2015, the Department of Education initiated a new negotiated rulemaking process to develop proposed regulations for determining which acts or omissions of an institution a borrower may assert as a defense to repayment of a loan made under the Direct Loan Program and the consequences of such borrower defenses for borrowers, institutions, and the Secretary of Education. The negotiations began in January 2016. On October 30, 2015, the Department of Education published final regulations amending the Department&#8217;s cash management regulations and rules related to repeat coursework. On October 30, 2015, the Department of Education also published final regulations creating a new income-contingent repayment plan and implementing changes to streamline and enhance existing processes for borrowers.

On February 8, 2016, the Department of Education announced the creation of a Student Aid Enforcement Unit to enable the Department to respond more quickly and efficiently to allegations of illegal actions by higher education institutions. The Enforcement Unit will consist of four divisions, including an Investigations Group, a Borrower Defense Group, an Administrative Actions and Appeals Service Group, and a Clery Group. The creation of the Enforcement Unit is designed to ensure that the Department can support more reviews of high-risk institutions, respond to concerns raised by states&#8217; and other federal agencies&#8217; investigations, and respond to complaints and claims for loan forgiveness by students.

Strayer University must comply with the campus safety and security reporting requirements as well as other requirements in the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act, or Clery Act, including recent changes made to the Clery Act by the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013, which was signed into law on March 7, 2013. On April 1, 2014, a negotiated rulemaking committee reached consensus on proposed regulations, and on October 20, 2014, the Department of Education promulgated final regulations implementing the recent amendments to the Clery Act. In addition, the Department of Education has interpreted Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (&#8220;Title IX&#8221;) to categorize sexual violence as a form of prohibited sex discrimination and to require institutions to follow certain disciplinary procedures with respect to such offenses. Failure to comply with Clery Act or Title IX requirements or regulations thereunder could result in action by the Department of Education to require corrective action, fine the University or limit or suspend its participation in Title IV programs, could lead to litigation, and could harm the University&#8217;s reputation.

State Licensure 

Under the Program Integrity Regulations regarding state licensure, a proprietary institution is considered legally authorized by a state if the state has a process to review and appropriately act on complaints concerning the institution, including enforcing applicable state laws, and the institution complies with certain state approval or licensure requirements consistent with the Program Integrity Regulations. These requirements became effective July 1, 2011, but the Department of Education issued a series of extensions of the implementation date provided certain conditions were met, the last of which expired on June 30, 2015. As of July 1, 2015, these requirements are fully operative.

On October 29, 2010, the Department of Education adopted new regulations, which were to be effective July 1, 2011, regarding state authorization of online programs. The revised rules specified that if an institution offers post-secondary education through distance or correspondence education to students in a state in which it is not physically located or in which it is otherwise subject to state jurisdiction as determined by the state, the institution must meet any state requirements for it to be legally offering post-secondary distance or correspondence education in that state. On June 5, 2012, the Court of Appeals upheld a lower court&#8217;s ruling vacating the state authorization of online programs requirement. On July 27, 2012, the Department of Education issued a Dear Colleague Letter cautioning education institutions to remain in compliance with all applicable state laws and regulations related to distance education. In April 2013, the Department of Education announced that it would add state authorization of distance education to a negotiated rulemaking previously initiated in May 2012. While four negotiated rulemaking sessions were conducted from February through May 2014, no consensus was reached. To date, the Department of Education has not issued a proposed rulemaking on this issue.

The Program Integrity Regulations also amended the general provisions regarding student consumer information. Under this revision, the institution must make available for review to any enrolled or prospective student upon request, a copy of the documents describing the institution&#8217;s accreditation and its state, federal, or tribal approval or licensing. The institution must also provide its students or prospective students with contact information for filing complaints with its accreditor and with its state approval or licensing entity and any other relevant state official or agency that would appropriately handle a student&#8217;s complaint.

We are authorized to offer our programs by the applicable educational regulatory agencies in all states where our physical campuses and online delivery facilities are located, and these states have the applicable complaint processes in place as required by the regulations.

Incentive Compensation 

Institutions participating in the Title IV programs may not pay any commission, bonus, or other incentive payment based directly or indirectly on securing enrollments or financial aid to personnel engaged in recruitment or admissions or making decisions about awarding Title IV aid. Previously, there were 12 &#8220;safe harbors&#8221; relating to payment and compensation plans that institutions may practice without fear of violating the prohibition. The Program Integrity Regulations removed the safe harbors when they became effective on July 1, 2011. In June 2015, the Department of Education announced in a memorandum that it will revise its approach to measuring damages for noncompliance with the incentive payment prohibition. The Department of Education will calculate the amount of institutional liability based on the cost to the Department of the Title IV funds improperly received by the institution, including the cost to the Department of all Title IV funds received by the institution over a period of time if those funds were obtained through implementation of a policy or practice in which students were recruited in violation of the incentive payment prohibition.

The regulations prohibit incentive compensation to employees engaged in any student recruitment or admission activity or in making decisions regarding the award of Title IV funds that is based in any part, directly or indirectly, upon success in securing enrollments or the award of financial aid. Merit-based adjustments to employee compensation may be made if they are not based in any part, directly or indirectly, upon success in securing enrollments or the award of financial aid. Profit-sharing payments may be made as long as they are not provided to any person who is engaged in student recruitment or admission activity or in making decisions regarding the award of Title IV funds. The regulations also obligate a third-party servicer to refer to the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Education any information indicating payment of any commission, bonus, or other incentive payment based in any part, directly or indirectly, upon success in securing enrollments or the award of financial aid to any person or entity engaged in any student recruitment or admission activity or in making decisions regarding the award of Title IV funds. 

Misrepresentation 

Under the Higher Education Act, the Department of Education may fine, suspend or terminate the participation in Title IV programs by an institution that engages in substantial misrepresentation of the nature of its educational program, its financial charges, or the employability of its graduates. The Program Integrity Regulations set forth the types of activities that constitute misrepresentation and describe the adverse actions that the Department of Education may take if it finds that an institution or a third party that provides educational programs, marketing, advertising, recruiting or admissions services to the institution engaged in substantial misrepresentation. The new rule specifies the types of statements that can subject the institution to liability for misrepresentation, the nature and form of misleading statements, and provides that an institution may not describe the eligible institution&#8217;s participation in Title IV programs in a manner that suggests approval or endorsement by the U.S. Department of Education of the quality of its educational programs. On June 5, 2012, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit held that the Department of Education&#8217;s expansion of the definition of misrepresentation to include &#8220;any statement that has the likelihood or tendency to deceive or confuse&#8221; was unsupported by law, and thus vacated that portion of the regulation. In response to the court&#8217;s ruling, on September 20, 2013, the Department of Education published technical amendments to the regulation.

Gainful Employment Reporting and Disclosure 

Under the Higher Education Act, a proprietary institution offering programs of study other than a baccalaureate degree in liberal arts (for which there is a limited statutory exception) must prepare students for gainful employment in a recognized occupation. The Program Integrity Regulations established new annual reporting requirements that are applicable to these programs. For each such program, Strayer University reported specific information regarding the program, the students enrolled in the program, and students who completed the program, including the amount the student received from private educational loans and institutional financing plans. In addition, the Program Integrity Regulations require institutions with gainful employment programs to disclose to prospective students certain information relating to those programs, including the occupations that the program prepares students to enter; the on-time graduation rate; tuition, fees, and costs; job placement rates, if applicable; and median loan debt of students who completed the program. Strayer University makes such disclosures on its website and in promotional materials. The June 30, 2012 U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia decision related to Gainful Employment vacated the reporting requirements, but the disclosure requirements remain in effect. The Department of Education required institutions to make the first disclosures by July 1, 2011 to update the disclosures for the 2011-2012 award year by January 31, 2013, and to update the disclosures for the 2012-2013 award year, using a newly developed template released by the Department of Education in November 2013 by January 31, 2014, which was subsequently updated in September 2014. We made our first disclosures in 2011, and completed timely updates of the disclosures for the 2011-2012, 2012-2013, and 2013-2014 years.

The new gainful employment regulations, which became effective on July 1, 2015, re-established reporting requirements previously invalidated by the U.S. District Court, with the first reporting required by July 31, 2015 of information related to the previous second through seventh award years. In addition, institutions will be required every year thereafter to report certain student and program level information to the Department of Education every subsequent year for the most recently concluded award year. In addition, the new regulation will sunset the current program disclosures on December 31, 2016, with new disclosures required, as determined by subsequent releases to be published by the Department of Education in the Federal Register, starting in January 2017.

New Programs 

The new gainful employment regulation that became effective July 1, 2015 provides that an institution may establish a new program&#8217;s Title IV eligibility by updating the list of the institution&#8217;s programs maintained by the Department of Education. However, an institution may not update its list of eligible programs to include a gainful employment program, or a gainful employment program that is substantially similar to a failing or zone program that the institution voluntarily discontinued or became ineligible, that was subject to the three-year loss of eligibility until that three-year period expires.

Administration of Financial Aid 

Several of the Program Integrity Regulations relate to the administration of financial aid, including the areas of the definition of online attendance, definition of credit hours, measuring satisfactory academic progress, return of federal funds when a student withdraws, verification and disbursement.

College Affordability and Transparency Lists 

The Department of Education publishes on its website lists of the top 5% of institutions, in each of nine categories, with (1) the highest tuition and fees for the most recent academic year, (2) the highest &#8220;net price&#8221; for the most recent academic year, (3) the largest percentage increase in tuition and fees for the most recent three academic years, and (4) the largest percentage increase in net price for the most recent three academic years. An institution that is placed on a list for high percentage increases in either tuition and fees or in net price must submit a report to the Department of Education explaining the increases and the steps that it intends to take to reduce costs. The Department of Education will report annually to Congress on these institutions and will publish their reports on its website. The Department of Education also posts lists of the top 10% of institutions in each of the nine categories with lowest tuition and fees or the lowest net price for the most recent academic year. Under HEOA, net price means average yearly price actually charged to first-time, full-time undergraduate students who receive student aid at a higher education institution after such aid is deducted.

College Scorecard 

On December 19, 2014, the Department of Education issued a framework for a college ratings system, which was to include predominantly four-year and two-year institutions. On June 25, 2015, the Department of Education stated that in lieu of the previously announced college ratings system, it would instead create a consumer-driven website that will allow users to compare colleges based on measures that may be of importance to them. In September 2015, the Department of Education publicly released its &#8220;College Scorecard&#8221; website. Among other characteristics, the College Scorecard allows users to search for schools based upon programs offered, location, size, tax status, mission, and religious affiliation.

Executive Order on Military and Veterans Benefits Programs 

In April 2012, President Obama issued an Executive Order directing the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs, along with other Executive Branch agencies, to implement actions to establish &#8220;Principles of Excellence&#8221; to apply to educational institutions receiving funding from Federal military and veterans educational benefits programs, including benefits programs provided by the Post-9/11 GI Bill and the tuition assistance program. The Principles of Excellence relate broadly to information regarding tuition and fees, academic quality, marketing, and state authorization requirements. The Principles of Excellence require federal agencies to create a centralized complaint system for students receiving federal military and veterans&#8217; educational benefits to register complaints that relevant agencies can track and address. On January 30, 2014, the Department of Defense, Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of Education, and Federal Trade Commission, in collaboration with the CFPB and the U.S. Department of Justice, announced a new online student complaint system for service members, veterans, and their families to report negative experiences at education institutions and training programs administering the Post-9/11 GI Bill, Department of Defense tuition assistance programs, and other military-related education benefit programs.

Credit Hours 

In 2009, the Department of Education&#8217;s Office of Inspector General criticized three accreditors, including Middle States, for deficiency in their oversight of institutions&#8217; credit hour allocations. In June 2010, the House Education and Labor Committee held a hearing concerning accrediting agencies&#8217; standards for assessing institutions&#8217; credit hour policies. The Program Integrity Regulations define the term &#8220;credit hour&#8221; for the first time and require accrediting agencies and/or state authorization agencies to review the reliability and accuracy of an institution&#8217;s credit hour assignments. If an accreditor does not comply with this requirement, its recognition by the Department of Education could be jeopardized. If an accreditor identifies systematic or significant noncompliance in one or more of an institution&#8217;s programs, the accreditor must notify the Secretary of Education. If the Department of Education determines that an institution is out of compliance with the credit hour definition, the Department of Education could impose liabilities or other sanctions.
