 Item 1. Business. 

&#160; 

Overview 

&#160; 

Inspired Builders, Inc., a Nevada Corporation, was located in Boston, Massachusetts. On January 13, 2012, pursuant to the change of control transaction, we relocated to Santa Monica, California. Until the change of control transaction, we focused on the real estate construction services business through a residential property repair and home improvement business. 

&#160; 

Since then we have redirected the Company&#8217;s focus to acquiring, investing in, developing and managing real estate properties and related investments. We have evaluated numerous real estate investment opportunities emphasizing commercial real estate development. Any such efforts in real estate will require substantial financial and management resources, which the Company does not currently possess. Therefore, while we will seek to acquire these resources as a part of our business plans, there can be no assurance of our success, and therefore, in our ability to enter the real estate investment or any other market.

Agreement to Purchase of Duval Property 

&#160; 

On June 24, 2013 the Company entered into an agreement with a related party to purchase a parcel of undeveloped land in Duval County, Florida. The purchase price for the Duval property was $1,350,000, payable as to $750,000 by the Company&#8217;s delivery of a 3% mortgage in the amount of $750,000, which is due June 24, 2014. The maturity date was extended to June 24, 2016. The $600,000 balance of the purchase price was paid by approving the issuance to the seller of 100,000 shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock, $0.001 par value per share, which was valued by the parties at $6.00 per share. Due to the related party nature of this transaction, the Company&#8217;s carrying value was deemed to be the historical basis of the property, $307,504. The difference between the purchase price and the historical basis was treated as a deemed distribution and recorded against Additional Paid In Capital.
