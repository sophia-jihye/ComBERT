&#160; 

Corporate History 

&#160; 

FactSet Research Systems Inc. (the &#8220;Company&#8221; or &#8220;FactSet&#8221;) was founded in 1978 and has been publicly held since 1996. The Company is dual listed on the New York Stock Exchange (&#8220;NYSE&#8221;) and the NASDAQ Stock Market (&#8220;NASDAQ&#8221;) under the symbol &#8220;FDS.&#8221; Fiscal 2016 marked the Company&#8217;s 38th year of operation, its 36th consecutive year of revenue growth and its 20th consecutive year of earnings growth as a public company. 

&#160; 

In fiscal 2016, FactSet earned recognition as the &#8220;Best Overall Provider&#8221; of market data, research and analytics from Inside Market Data (&#8220;IMD&#8221;). It was named &#8220;Best Data Analytics Provider&#8221; in the annual rankings announced by Waters Technology. FactSet was also honored with the &#8220;Best Research and Analytics Tool&#8221; award at the annual Systems in the City Awards presented in London by Goodacre UK. 

&#160; 

The awards added to a long list of achievements for FactSet in fiscal 2016, including &#8220;Best Research Provider&#8221; and &#8220;Best Analytics Provider&#8221; by IMD in May 2016 and earning a spot for the eighth time as one of Fortune&#8217;s &#8220;100 Best Companies to Work For&#8221;. 

&#160; 

In October 2015, FactSet completed its acquisition of Portware, LLC (&#8220;Portware&#8221;), an award-winning, multi-asset execution management system (&#8220;EMS&#8221;). The addition of Portware enables FactSet to support client workflows in additional segments of the investment process. Together, FactSet and Portware expect to provide the investment community with state-of-the-art analytic and execution applications across more of the portfolio lifecycle, from analyst to portfolio manager to trader. 

&#160; 

FactSet also announced in July 2016 the sale of its market research business focused on advisor-sold investments and insurance, consisting of Market Metrics and Matrix-Data Limited (collectively &#8220;Market Metrics&#8221;). The divestment of this business is consistent with the Company&#8217;s long-term strategic direction and commitment to delivering value to shareholders. 

&#160; 

Client Subscription Growth 

&#160; 

Annual subscription value (&#8220;ASV&#8221;) at any given point in time represents the forward-looking revenues for the next twelve months from all subscription services currently being supplied to clients. At August 31, 2016, ASV was $1.15 billion, up 8.8% organically from a year ago. The increase in ASV during fiscal 2016 was primarily driven by the Analytics, Content &#38; Technology Solutions (&#8220;CTS&#8221;), Research Management Solutions (&#8220;RMS&#8221;) and Portware businesses. 

&#160; 

During fiscal 2016, FactSet added 116 net new clients, increasing the number of clients by 3.9% over the prior year. This net number reflects a reduction of 41 clients due to the sale of the Market Metrics business. The number of new client additions is an important metric for FactSet as new clients typically come on with modest deployments and often experience substantial growth in subsequent years. In terms of users, 3,450 net new users were added during fiscal 2016. FactSet saw healthy progression in the number of users at both its buy-side and sell-side clients. 

&#160;

The following charts provide a snapshot view of FactSet&#8217;s ASV growth over the past 10 fiscal years. &#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

Financial Information on Geographic Areas 

&#160; 

Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise that engage in business activities from which they may earn revenues and incur expenses, whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the enterprise&#8217;s chief operating decision maker to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance, and for which discrete financial information is available. Financial information at the operating segment level is reviewed jointly by the Chief Executive Officer (&#8220;CEO&#8221;) and senior management. Senior management consists of executives who directly report to the CEO, comprising the Chief Financial Officer , Chief Operating Officer, Global Head of Sales, General Counsel, Chief Human Resources Officer and three senior directors in charge of product strategy. Senior management, along with the CEO, constitute FactSet&#8217;s chief operating decision making group and is responsible for making decisions about resources allocated amongst the operating segments based on actual results. 

&#160; 

FactSet&#8217;s operations are organized into three reportable segments based on geographic business activities: the U.S., Europe and Asia Pacific. This alignment reflects the Company&#8217;s approach to managing the business and transacting in the various markets in which FactSet serves by providing integrated global financial and economic information. Sales, consulting, data collection, product development and software engineering are the primary functional groups within the U.S., Europe and Asia Pacific segments that provide global financial and economic information to investment managers, investment banks and other financial services professionals. The U.S. segment services finance professionals including financial institutions throughout the Americas, while the European and Asia Pacific segments service investment professionals located throughout Europe and the Asia Pacific region, respectively. Financial information, including revenues, operating income and long-lived assets related to the Company&#8217;s operations in each geographic area are presented in Note 7, Segment Information , in the Notes to the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. 

&#160; 

The European segment is headquartered in London, England and maintains offices in France, Germany, Italy, Ireland, Latvia, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Spain, South Africa, Sweden and Dubai. The Asia Pacific segment is headquartered in Tokyo, Japan with office locations in Australia, Hong Kong, Singapore and Mumbai, India. Segment revenues reflect direct sales to clients based in their respective geographic locations. There are no intersegment or intercompany sales of the FactSet services. Each segment records compensation expense, including stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets, depreciation of furniture and fixtures, amortization of leasehold improvements, communication costs, professional fees, rent expense, travel, marketing, office and other direct expenses. Expenditures associated with the Company&#8217;s data centers, third party data costs and corporate headquarters charges are recorded by the U.S. segment and are not allocated to the other segments. The content collection centers located in India and the Philippines benefit all of the Company&#8217;s operating segments and thus the expenses incurred at these locations are allocated to each segment based on a percentage of revenues.

Business Strategy 

&#160; 

Workstations 

&#160; 

FactSet&#8217;s most widely known product is its flagship FactSet workstation, deployed on thousands of desks around the globe. In fiscal 2016 , user growth was 5.5%, and there are now more than 65,000 global FactSet users. In the workstation , FactSet has focused on optimizing speed and responsiveness and on building out unique content sets. Such unique content includes its StreetAccount news content, Revere Geographic Revenue data, and the addition of real time fixed income pricing through a third party partnership. With increased regulatory scrutiny and regulations, FactSet RMS has also driven growth. As one of the largest providers of RMS in the industry, FactSet is used by firms of all asset classes, from the startup hedge fund to the largest institutional asset managers, and from small endowments to the largest pensions and sovereign wealth funds. FactSet RMS helps clients institutionalize and optimize their research workflow providing a solution that boosts cross-firm collaboration, helps create transparency to ensure compliance, and promotes business continuity. 

&#160; 

Analytics 

&#160; 

Investment professionals want to focus on producing results. They need in-depth insight, powerful analytics, and comprehensive datasets integrated seamlessly with their portfolios. FactSet helps to solve this need by integrating petabytes of data each day (from clients, FactSet&#8217;s own unique content and hundreds of third-party providers), as well as by offering multi-asset class analytics, performance, and risk. FactSet Portfolio Analysis is a multi-asset class, global solution that helps investment professionals spend more time discovering alpha and less time managing their portfolios. Portfolio Analysis is an interactive tool that helps portfolio managers make smarter decisions with a flexible, multi-tile interface of reports and charts. FactSet&#8217;s Multi-Asset Class (MAC) model helps users understand risk factors across different asset types and classes. Additionally, the Company has enhanced its offering with client-requested functionality such as a linear MAC model, fixed income optimization, and the DTS (Duration Times Spread) attribution model. 

&#160; 

Content and Technology Solutions (CTS) 

&#160; 

FactSet is focused on delivering value to its clients in the way they want to consume it. This delivery includes offering powerful analytics and comprehensive datasets through desktop, mobile and web interfaces, as well as giving clients direct access to insight and information outside of the Workstation through cloud-based application program interfaces (&#8220;APIs&#8221;) , data feeds and white label solutions. The CTS suite includes a growing number of standardized data feeds that complement and mirror the data in the FactSet workstation. These capabilities and data solutions are powering a growing number of workflows for the middle and front office. 

&#160; 

Portware 

&#160; 

Since FactSet&#8217;s acquisition of Portware in October 2015, the multi-asset EMS has continued to provide a leading trading platform technology. In addition to being named the "Best FX trading platform technology" by Wall Street Letter, the FactSet-Portware acquisition was named the "Best M&#38;A Deal" at Markets Media's Markets Choice Awards. Both of these awards reinforce the strategic benefit of combining Portware&#8217;s innovative execution management expertise with FactSet&#8217;s integrated financial information and analytical applications. Portware embeds in the middle of the buy-side trader workflow and integrates tightly with other key components to automate simpler trades, freeing traders to focus on more complex trades. Since the acquisition, Portware client volume increased as did new client and broker connections. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Client Service and Support 

&#160; 

At its core , FactSet is client centric and always has been. FactSet partners with clients to help them work intelligently and more efficiently. As client needs have changed, FactSet has evolved its business to meet those needs, and this shift has helped to fuel growth even in a challenging market. 

&#160; 

FactSet prioritizes customer service and the client experience. Clients have wide access to a team of consultants and product specialists. They are able to leverage a wide range of combined industry knowledge and FactSet product experience to maximize the value of FactSet. Client feedback is regularly incorporated into the product through constant enhancements and technology innovations. This client-focused dedication helped FactSet's achieve a client retention rate of more than 95% of ASV , and 94% when expressed as a percentage of clients, consistent with the prior year. 

&#160; 

FactSet Clients 

&#160; 

Buy Side 

&#160; 

FactSet is focused on understanding the buy-side workflow across all firm types and user types. This segment includes portfolio managers, analysts, traders, wealth managers, performance teams and risk and compliance teams at a variety of firms, such as traditional asset managers, wealth advisors, hedge funds, insurance companies, plan sponsors and fund of funds. 

&#160; 

As buy-side clients shift towards multi-asset class investment strategies, FactSet is well positioned to be a partner in the space, given its ability to provide solutions across their entire workflow. Through its workstation , powerful analytics, unique content like FactSet&#8217;s Geographic Revenue data, data feeds and portfolio services, FactSet is able to provide solutions across asset classes and at nearly every stage of the investment process. 

&#160; 

The buy-side ASV growth rate for fiscal 2016 was 9.0%. Buy-side clients accounted for 82.6% of ASV as of August 31, 2016 . 

&#160; 

Sell Side 

&#160; 

FactSet is a market leader within banking and is continuing to expand beyond investment banking into various other parts of banking institutions. The Company anticipates that future growth may come from the breadth of solutions FactSet provides to the sell side&#8212;across analytics, content and technology. 

&#160; 

FactSet has historically focused on selling workstations to banks. Over the last few years, its emphasis has shifted to focus on selling more differentiated product offerings outside the workstation including StreetAccount, RMS, Portfolio Analytics and Alpha Testing. FactSet is also expanding its banking user base outside investment banking to commercial banking, research, quant groups, compliance and regulatory divisions and sales and trading teams. 

&#160; 

The sell-side ASV growth rate for fiscal 2016 was 7.6%. Sell-side clients accounted for 17.4% of ASV as of August 31, 2016 . 

&#160; 

Talent 

&#160; 

Over the last 38 years, FactSet has built a collaborative culture that recognizes and rewards innovation and offers employees a variety of opportunities and experiences. FactSet&#8217;s employees are critical to its success and the reason it continues to execute at a high level. Its focus on engaging and enabling employees to do their best work is central to FactSet&#8217;s ability to deliver the best insight and information to clients around the globe. 

&#160;

&#160; 

As of August 31, 2016, employee headcount was 8,375 up 13.8% from a year ago. Excluding the acquired Portware workforce and employees of the divested Market Metrics business, headcount increased 13.4% from a year ago. Of FactSet&#8217;s total employees, 2,407 were located in the U.S., 849 in Europe and 5,119 in Asia Pacific. Approximately 55% of the Company&#8217;s employees were involved with content collection, 24% worked in product development, software and systems engineering, another 18% conducted sales and consulting services and the remaining 3% provided administrative support. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

FactSet believes that its current relations with employees are good . Company management keeps employees informed of decisions and encourages and implements employee suggestions whenever practicable. 

&#160; 

As of August 31, 2016, approximately 155 FactSet employees within certain French subsidiaries were represented by a mandatory works council. No other employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement. 

&#160; 

Third Party Content 

&#160; 

FactSet aggregates third party content from more than 220 data suppliers, 115 news sources and 85 exchanges into its own dedicated online service which clients access to perform their analyses. FactSet carries content from premier providers such as Thomson Reuters, S&#38;P Global Inc., Axioma, Inc., Interactive Data Corporation, LLC, Dow Jones &#38; Company Inc., Northfield Information Services, Inc., Barclays, Intex Solutions, Inc., Bureau van Dijk, ProQuote Limited, MSCI Inc., SIX Financial Information USA Inc., Morningstar, Inc., Russell Investments, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, NYSE Euronext Inc., London Stock Exchange, Tokyo Stock Exchange, NASDAQ OMX, Australian Securities Exchange and Toyo Keizai Inc.. Content fees billed to the Company may be on a fixed or royalty (per client) basis. 

&#160; 

FactSet seeks to maintain contractual relationships with a minimum of two content providers for each major type of financial data, though certain data sets on which FactSet relies have a limited number of suppliers. The Company makes every effort, when reasonable, to locate alternative sources to ensure that FactSet is not dependent on any one third party data supplier. The Company has entered into third party content agreements with varying lengths, which in some cases can be terminated on one year&#8217;s notice at predefined dates, and in other cases on shorter notice. No single vendor or data supplier represented more than 10% of FactSet's total fixed data expenses in any fiscal year . 

&#160; 

Data Centers 

&#160; 

FactSet&#8217;s business is dependent on its ability to process substantial volumes of data and transactions rapidly and efficiently on its networks and systems. The Company&#8217;s global technology infrastructure supports its operations and is designed to facilitate the reliable and efficient processing and delivery of data and analytics to its clients. FactSet&#8217;s data centers contain multiple layers of redundancy to enhance system performance, including maintaining, processing and storing data at multiple data centers. User connections are load balanced between data centers. In the event of a site failure, equipment problem or localized disaster, the remaining center has the capacity to handle the additional load. FactSet continues to be focused on maintaining a global technological infrastructure that allows the Company to support its growing business. 

&#160; 

FactSet launched its multi-phase project, Project NextGen, several years ago to evolve away from large mainframe computers to a more distributed environment powered by a vast array of smaller, faster and more cost-effective machines. The Company operates fully redundant data centers in Virginia and New Jersey. These data centers handle FactSet&#8217;s entire client capacity. In addition, FactSet maintains a vast private wide area network that provides a high-speed direct link between the client&#8217;s local network and the data content and powerful applications found on the Company&#8217;s mainframe machines. 

&#160; 

The Competitive Landscape 

&#160; 

FactSet is part of the financial information services industry, which provides accurate financial information and software solutions to the global investment community. According to industry reports, global spend on market data and analysis grew 1.2% to $26.6 billion in 2016 compared to the prior year. This extremely competitive market is comprised of both large, well-capitalized companies and smaller, niche firms including market data suppliers, news and information providers and many of the content providers that supply the Company with financial information included in the FactSet workstation. The largest competitors to FactSet are Bloomberg L.P. (&#8220;Bloomberg&#8221;), Thomson Reuters Inc. (&#8220;Thomson&#8221;) and S&#38;P Global Market Intelligence (&#8220;S&#38;P Capital IQ&#8221;). Industry reports state that Bloomberg&#8217;s market share grew slightly to 33.3%, up from 32.0% a year ago while Thomson&#8217;s was approximately 24.3%, down from 25.9% in the prior year. S&#38;P Capital IQ&#8217;s was approximately 4.8%, comparable to that of FactSet. Other competitors and competitive products include online database suppliers and integrators and their applications, such as, MSCI Inc., Morningstar Inc., BlackRock Solutions, RIMES Technologies Corporation and Wilshire Associates Inc. Many of these firms offer products or services which are similar to those sold by the Company. FactSet&#8217;s development of its own robust sets of proprietary content combined with its news and quotes offering have resulted in more direct competition with the largest financial data providers. 

&#160; 

Despite competing products and services, FactSet enjoys high barriers to entry and believes it would be difficult for another vendor to replicate quickly the extensive databases the Company currently offers. Through its in-depth analytics and superior client service, FactSet believes it can offer clients a more complete solution with one of the broadest sets of functionalities, through a desktop user interface or data feed. In addition, FactSet's applications, including its client support and service offerings, are entrenched in the workflow of many financial professionals given the downloading functions and portfolio analysis/screening capabilities they offer. The Company is entrusted with significant amounts of our clients' own proprietary data, including portfolio holdings. As a result, the Company's products have become central to investment analysis and decision-making for clients. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

FactSet has registered trademarks and copyrights for many of its products and services and will continue to evaluate the registration of additional trademarks and copyrights as appropriate. FactSet enters into confidentiality agreements with its employees, clients, data suppliers and vendors. The Company seeks to protect its software, documentation and other written materials under trade secret, copyright and patent laws. While FactSet does not believe it is dependent on any one of its intellectual property rights, the Company does rely on the combination of intellectual property rights and other measures to protect its proprietary rights. Despite these efforts, existing intellectual property laws may afford only limited protection. 

&#160; 

Research and Product Development Costs 

&#160; 

A key aspect of the Company&#8217;s growth strategy is to enhance its existing products and applications by making them faster and the data within them more reliable. FactSet strives to adopt rapidly new technology that can improve its products and services. Research and product development costs relate to the salary and benefits for the Company&#8217;s product development, software engineering and technical support staff and, as such, these costs are expensed when incurred within cost of services as employee compensation. The Company expects to allocate a similar percentage of its workforce in future years in order to continue to develop new products and enhancements, respond quickly to market changes and meet the needs of its clients efficiently. 

&#160; 

Government Regulation 

&#160; 

The Company is subject to reporting requirements, disclosure obligations and other recordkeeping requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220;SEC&#8221;) and the various local authorities that regulate each location in which FactSet operates. The Company&#8217;s wholly owned subsidiaries, FactSet Data Systems, Inc. and P.A.N. Securities, Inc., are each members of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. and registered broker-dealers under Section 15 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. FactSet Data Systems, Inc. and P.A.N. Securities, Inc., as registered broker-dealers, are subject to Rule 15c3-1 under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, which requires that the Company maintain minimum net capital requirements. The Company claims exemption under Rule 15c3-3(k)(2)(i).
