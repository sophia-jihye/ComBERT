&#160;

On January 25, 2010, Articles of Merger were filed with the state of Oklahoma, merging U.S. Highland, Inc. into Harcom Productions, Inc. Pursuant to the Articles of Merger, the name of the corporation was changed from Harcom Productions, Inc. to US Highland, Inc. (the "Merger").

Description of New Business Strategy 

&#160;

After the Merger, the Company solely focused on the business of being a recreational powersports Original Equipment Manufacturer ("OEM"). In September 2015, the Company redefined its business model to be one of a diversified holdings Company. The Company will seek investments in acquisitions, joint ventures and strategic partnerships that will development new holdings and business lines that take advantage of management's ability to sell, market, and distribute products. The Company has realigned its mission statement to include providing companies and emerging brands with the knowledge and expertise needed to launch their products in the United States marketplace. &#160; &#160; 3 

&#160; 

&#160;

As part of the Company's new strategy to diversify its operations by engaging in new business lines to assist companies and emerging brands launch their products in the U.S., on September 23, 2015, the Company formed two wholly-owned subsidiaries, USH Distribution Corp., a Nevada corporation ("USH"), and Powersports Brands Alliance, Inc., a Nevada corporation ("PBA") The Company formed USH to provide sales, marketing and distribution services primarily to international and domestic companies seeking sales of their products in the U.S.; and PBA to acquire brands in the powersports industry with the intended goal of being a business that sells powersports products, including, but not limited to, powersports parts and accessories, such as helmets, gloves, gear, etc. 

&#160;

The Company's new business strategy consists of the following divisions: 

&#160;

1. 

Distribution. Through USH, the Company's strategy is to provide sales, marketing and distribution services to primarily international and domestic companies seeking sales of their products in the U.S. Specifically, USH is expected to provide its customers with third party logistics, sales/marketing, product strategy and product development. 

2. 

Powersports. Through PBA, the Company intends to acquire brands in the powersports industry with the intended goal of being a business that sells powersports products, including, but not limited to, powersports parts and powersports accessories such as helmets, gloves and gear, etc. 

3. 

Apparel Sourcing. Through USH, the Company has a 40% minority equity stake in a joint venture, Lahva. The joint venture was formed with a Malaysian company, M&#38;M, to provide apparel sourcing and supply chain management services to U.S. apparel companies and retailers for international sourcing and production of apparel items. Specifically, Lahva's goal is to provide clients with end-to-end sourcing services, managing the entire apparel supply chain from design concept to consumer point of purchase. 

4. 

Recreational Powersports OEM. The Company's original business is a recreational powersports Original Equipment Manufacturer ("OEM"), developing motorcycles, quads, single cylinder engines, and v-twin engines under its own brand and for other OEMs. The Company still owns and maintains its intellectual property rights to engine platforms and plans to continue its development of these platforms in the power sports industry. The Company's goal is to adopt a Powersports OEM business plan, with a focus on marketing its intellectual property. 

&#160;

Management believes that our cash balance will not be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements for the next twelve month period. We plan to raise the capital required to satisfy our immediate short-term needs and additional capital required to meet our estimated funding requirement for the next twelve months primarily through equity and or debt financings. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain further funds required for our continued working capital requirements.

Market Analysis Apparel Industry 

&#160;

According to the most recent data issued by the US Department of Commerce - Office of Textiles and Apparel http://otexa.trade.gov/ ("OTEXA") on December 31, 2015, US imports of apparel continued to climb in 2015, reaching almost $84.9 billion (year-end Nov. 2015) for an increase of 3.97% over the previous year. 

&#160;

As the OTEXA data reflects, the growth of apparel imports into the US is being driven by the lower cost and quality improvements of offshore manufacturing, a relatively strong US dollar, and recent weakness in the Chinese yuan. According to OTEXA, shipments from China, the largest supplier of apparel to the US, were up 1.98% in the last year to $30.44 billion (35.86% of total US apparel imports). Other major manufacturers and exporters of apparel to the US are Vietnam (12.34%), Bangladesh (6.3%), Indonesia (5.78%), India (4.3%), and Mexico (4.24%). 

&#160;

US Highland believes it is well-positioned to take advantage of this growth trend in apparel and other imports that it expects to create numerous new business opportunities for the Company and its joint venture, Lahva, Inc., as it believes in an ongoing trend of many US companies choosing to partner with sourcing specialists to cost effectively manage their production in low-cost foreign manufacturing centers. Sourcing specialists breakdown cultural and geographic barriers between US apparel firms and international factories, providing a competitive advantage to U.S. apparel firms by reducing production cost and facilitating production of simple to complex designs. 

&#160;

Lahva, Inc., 40% owned by US Highland, is a sourcing joint-venture with M&#38;M Sourcing Sdn Bhd, an established Malaysian apparel sourcing consortium. Lahva provides customers with end-to-end sourcing of the apparel supply chain. This strategy includes overseeing the entire process, including design, raw material acquisition, garment construction, packaging, shipping, distribution/warehousing, delivery to retail, and consumer purchase. Lahva also utilizes its resources to incubate and support emerging apparel brands. &#160;

&#160; 

Powersports Industry 

&#160;

Market data for the motorcycle industry shows that the industry is growing in most global market segments, with Europe showing flat sales, illustrating generally positive expected performance of the powersports industry for the next 5+ years. It is important to note that 45% for on-road motorcycles, 45% for ATV plus 10% for off-road motorcycles show a good balance within the powersports industry. Honda, Harley Davidson and Polaris Industries are the largest OEMs for many global markets. Estimated new unit sales for the U.S. powersport market is 1.4mm units annually. [1] US Highland management believes the metric parts and accessory sales volume to be approximately $3.6B annually. US Highland has chosen the U.S. market as its primary target and domicile market. 

&#160;

OEM (Original Equipment Manufacture) Cycle 

&#160;

The OEM motorcycle market is a cyclical business, with the largest sales occurring during late summer and fall for next year's models. Time to market for new products can be 8-14 months before final units are produced, tested and capable of delivery to the public. Finished goods can remain selling for 5+ years, before model changes are needed. 

&#160;

On-Road Motorcycles Market 

&#160;

Comparisons between the dirt bike sales forecast and the total motorcycle sales forecast illustrates that on-road or street motorcycles represent a much larger market segment, by a ratio of 4.5:1. Harley Davidson continues to have the largest market share of this market segment. [2] 

&#160;

On-Road Seasonality 

&#160;

On-road seasonality is even more severe than off-road seasonality. In the on-road market segment, summer month sales are the strongest, though spring sales are within 20-30% of summer sales. Winter sales are as much as 75% lower than summer sales. 

&#160;

Dual Sport Market 

&#160;

2012 data indicates this segment as the fastest growing segment, with the largest gains. US Highland engines are dual purpose ready. 

&#160;

Wholesale/Custom Builder Market 

&#160;

With the growing and positive movement in product customization, US Highland management estimates that more "NEW" powersport manufactures will be entering the market than ever before. Currently no other US supplier offers 250cc-1150cc metric engines available for sale. US Highland management believes that by comparison the V-Twin market is offering products sold specifically for the On-Road market, the estimated market size for the V-Twin parts and accessory market is $1.6B annually. US Highland will fully capitalize on this market opportunity and offer metric engines for the use in any type of powersport product representing 4 times the available sales of the V-Twin market. 

&#160;

Intellectual Property 

&#160;

US Highland owns the intellectual property corresponding to the 350cc, 450cc, 507cc, 750cc, 950cc engines and was granted limited intellectual property rights to an 1150cc engine by Folan AB. The 1150cc is limited to the right to modify, manufacture and sell the 1150cc engine into the flat bottom boat market exclusively in the United States. US Highland has also developed a unique throttle body which allows "linear proportional air flow" control to the engine. Conventional throttle bodies do not have linear response, requiring operators to manually adjust to uneven response from the throttle. US Highland owns US Registered Trademark "HIGHLAND " , which is the subject of U. S. Trademark Registration No. 2,362,734 which was issued on June 27, 2000. US Highland has also applied on December 20, 2011 for two additional US Registered Trademarks, "POWERED BY US HIGHLAND" on December 19, 2011 and "AMERICAN MADE PERFORMANCE". Currently, US Highland is no longer seeking trademark registration for "POWERED BY US HIGHLAND" and "AMERICAN MADE PERFORMANCE". &#160;

Number Of Total Employees And Number Of Full-Time Employees. 

&#160;

At December 31, 2015, we had a total of two full-time employees. Our President, Kevin Malone works part-time on the affairs of the Company. Our Interim Chief Financial Officer, Deborah E. Engles works on as needed basis for the Company
