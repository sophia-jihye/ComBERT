 Item 1. BUSINESS 

&#160;

Background 

&#160;

Wound Management Technologies, Inc. (&#8220;WMT&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) was organized on December 14, 2001, as a Texas corporation under the name eAppliance Innovations, Inc. In June of 2002, MB Software Corporation, a public corporation formed under the laws of Colorado, merged with the Company (which at the time was a wholly owned subsidiary of MB Software Corporation), and the Company changed its name to MB Software Corporation as part of the merger. In May of 2008, the Company changed its name to Wound Management Technologies, Inc. 

&#160;

Wound Care Innovations, LLC (&#8220;WCI&#8221;), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, is a rapidly growing provider of the patented CellerateRX&#174; product in the wound care market, which is quickly expanding, particularly with respect to diabetic wound applications. As a result of aging populations and the increase of diabetes around the globe, treatment of wounds in diabetic patients is one of the most serious issues faced in healthcare today. In 2012 WCI expanded its CellerateRX product line to include CellerateRX Surgical products and the company believes that this line will be a key factor in our growth. 

&#160;

Product, Patent, License and Royalty Agreements 

&#160;

CellerateRX is cleared by the FDA as a medical device for use on all acute and chronic wounds, except third degree burns, and is ready for distribution in both gel and powder form. Manufacturing of these products is conducted by Applied Nutritionals, LLC (&#8220;Applied Nutritionals&#8221;), which owns the CellerateRX trademark. WMT has incurred no research and development costs related to CellerateRX during the last two fiscal years. As of September of 2015. Warehousing, shipping, and physical inventory management were brought back in-house to the corporate office located in Addison, TX and Pac-Soucee, LLC of Rochester, NY and no longer outsourced to Farris Laboratories, Inc. of Fort Worth, TX and WellDyne Health, LLC. 

&#160;

Effective November 28, 2007, we entered into separate exclusive license agreements with both Applied Nutritionals and its founder George Petito, pursuant to which WCI obtained the exclusive worldwide license to certain patented technologies and processes related to CellerateRX. WCI had been marketing and selling CellerateRX during the previous four years under the terms of a distribution agreement with Applied Nutritionals that was terminated in 2005. The new licenses are limited to the human health care market for external wound care including surgical wounds, and include any new product developments based on the licensed patent and processes and any continuations. The term of these licenses extends through the life of the licensed patent which expires in 2018. 

&#160;

In consideration for the licenses, WCI agreed to pay Applied Nutritionals and Mr. Petito the following royalties, beginning January 3, 2008 (amounts listed are the aggregate of amounts paid/owed to Applied Nutritionals and Mr. Petito): (a) an advance royalty of $100,000; (b) a royalty of fifteen percent (15%) of gross sales occurring during the first year of the license; (c) an additional advance royalty of $400,000 on January 3, 2009; plus (d) a royalty of three percent (3%) of gross sales for all sales occurring after the payment of the $400,000 advance royalty. In addition, WCI must maintain a minimum aggregate annual royalty payment of $375,000 for 2009 and thereafter if the royalty payments made do not meet or exceed that amount. 

&#160;

Product marketing, sales and distribution 

&#160;

CellerateRX is available without a prescription and the wound care products are currently approved for reimbursement under Medicare Part B. The diabetic care and long term care markets, as well as the professional medical markets, are a major focus of our marketing efforts due to the prevalence of diabetic and pressure ulcers. We believe that these products are unique in composition, applicability and clinical performance, and demonstrate the ability to reduce costs associated with standard wound management. In 2012 the company added the CellerateRX Surgical product line to broaden the product line. The unique collagen benefits, biocompatibility with other therapies, low price point, and performance are attracting increased business in hospitals and surgery centers. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

CellerateRX wound care and surgical products are sold via independent distributors, distributor organizations, healthcare distributors, representatives and through inside sales activities. The surgical products are sold through a growing network of surgical product distributors who are credentialed to demonstrate the products in surgical settings. WCI has increased its presence at wound care, podiatry and surgical trade shows and meetings throughout the country. 

&#160;

In September 2013 the Company entered into a Shipping and Consulting Agreement with WellDyne Health, LLC, (&#8220;WellDyne&#8221;) under which all CellerateRX orders are taken by and fulfilled by WellDyne. In addition, WellDyne provides guidance and advice for the sale and marketing of CellerateRX products and programs. On June 4, 2015, the Company delivered written notice to WellDyne, terminating the Agreement pursuant to Section Five thereof, such termination to be effective as of September 19, 2015. The termination of this agreement contributed to the bottom line of the company beginning the fourth quarter of 2015 and will continue to affect all preceding months materially. 

&#160;

WCI continues to work with international parties to expand the distribution of CellerateRX outside of the US. In 2013 WCI engaged a new distributor to market the products in several countries in the Middle East, and received registration and an initial order for Saudi Arabia. CellerateRX is also registered in South Africa and in 2014 registration was achieved in Nigeria and in Mexico. Registration efforts have continued for a CE mark and in February 2014 the company agreed to work with new parties on achieving this. 

&#160;

Staffing 

&#160;

As of April 14, 2016, the Company and its subsidiaries have a staff of 10, with 9 full-time employees, 1 part-time employee and 2 contractors. 

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

The wound care market is served by a number of large, multi-product line companies offering a suite of products to the market. CellerateRX products compete with all primary dressings, some prescription drug therapies and other medical devices. Manufacturers and distributors of competitive products include: Smith &#38; Nephew, Systagenix, Healthpoint, Medline, Integra and Biocore. Many of our competitors are significantly larger than we are and have more financial and personnel resources than we do. Consequently, we will be at a competitive disadvantage in marketing and selling our products in the marketplace. We believe, however, that the patented molecular form of collagen used in CellerateRX allows our products to outperform currently available non-active dressings, reduce the cost of wound management, and replace a variety of other products with a single primary dressing. 

&#160;

New products, markets and Services 

&#160;

In September 2009 the Company acquired a patent (7,074,425) from Resorbable Orthopedics, LLC, (&#8220;ROP&#8221;) for a resorbable bone wax and delivery system for orthopedic bone void fillers (see Note 9 &#8220;Intangible Assets&#8221;) and established the Resorbable Orthopedic Products, LLC subsidiary. The patent offers innovative, safe and effective resorbable orthopedic products that are complementary to the already existing CellerateRX products. The bone wax and delivery system address issues such as bone wax granuloma and the cost-effective delivery of materials that manage bone wound healing. The resorbable orthopedic products covered by the patent are (a) a resorbable orthopedic hemostat (resorbable bone wax) used to stop blood flow, (b) a delivery system for osteogenic/osteoinductive orthopedic products (bone void fillers), and (c) the formula as a delivery system for bone growth factors. 

&#160;

The Company received 510(k) approval for the resorbable orthopedic hemostat in February 2016. We are in the process of preparing for a market launch in 2016. The company is also exploring a relationship with an international distributor to market this product outside the US and to obtain CE approval for the product. 

&#160;

On November 8, 2011 ROP executed a development and license agreement with BioStructures, LLC. The agreement licensed certain bone wax rights to BioStructures, LLC to develop products in the field of bone remodeling, based on Resorbable&#8217;s patent number 7,074,425 (see Note 9 &#8220;Intangible Assets&#8221;) for use in the human skeletal system. The license agreement with BioStructures, LLC excludes the fields of (1) a resorbable hemostat (resorbable bone wax), (2) a resorbable orthopedic hemostat (bone wax) and antimicrobial dressing, and (3) veterinary orthopedic applications. According to the terms of the agreement, BioStructures, LLC paid an initial fee of $100,000 for a 24 month period in which to develop royalty bearing products based on the Company&#8217;s patent. The agreement entitles the Company to additional fees upon the regulatory clearance of the products, fees for a commercial license for each regulatory cleared product, and a 3% royalty on related product sales over the life of the patent, which expires in 2023. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

In January 2014, BioStructures received 510(K) approval (K132071) for their first product under the ROP license, an innovative bioactive bone graft putty and bone graft extender and paid ROP the regulatory milestone fee of $50,000. In February 2014, ROP granted a commercial license to BioStructures according to the terms of the development and license agreement, and accordingly BioStructures paid ROP a $100,000 fee and in December 2014 BioStructures paid the minimum 2014 royalty of $102,000. In November of 2015 Bioventus acquired BioStructures interests and negotiated down the royalty percentage to be paid from 3% to 1.5% for 2016, 2017 and then from 3% to 2% for product royalty on sales of these products over the life of the patent with certain minimums to remain constant. In March 2016, Bioventus paid the minimum 2015 royalty of $201,000 to ROP.
