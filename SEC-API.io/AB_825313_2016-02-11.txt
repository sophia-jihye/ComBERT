Retail 

We provide investment management and related services to a wide variety of individual retail investors, both in the U.S. and internationally, through retail mutual funds we sponsor, mutual fund sub-advisory relationships, separately-managed account programs ( see below ), and other investment vehicles (&#8220; Retail Products and Services &#8221;). 

We distribute our Retail Products and Services through financial intermediaries, including broker-dealers, insurance sales representatives, banks, registered investment advisers and financial planners. These products and services include open-end and closed-end funds that are either (i) registered as investment companies under the Investment Company Act (&#8220; U.S. Funds &#8221;), or (ii) not registered under the Investment Company Act and generally not offered to United States persons (&#8220; Non-U.S. Funds &#8221; and, collectively with the U.S. Funds, &#8220; AB Funds &#8221;). They also include separately-managed account programs, which are sponsored by financial intermediaries and generally charge an all-inclusive fee covering investment management, trade execution, asset allocation, and custodial and administrative services. In addition, we provide distribution, shareholder servicing, transfer agency services and administrative services for our Retail Products and Services. See &#8220;Net Revenues &#8211; Investment Advisory and Services Fees&#8221; in Item 7 &#32;for information about our retail investment advisory and services fees. See Note 2 to AB&#8217;s consolidated financial statements in Item 8 &#32;for a discussion of the commissions we pay to financial intermediaries in connection with the sale of open-end AB Funds. 

Fees paid by the U.S. Funds are reflected in the applicable investment management agreement, which generally must be approved annually by the boards of directors or trustees of those funds, including by a majority of the independent directors or trustees. Increases in these fees must be approved by fund shareholders; decreases need not be, including any decreases implemented by a fund&#8217;s directors or trustees. In general, each investment management agreement with the U.S. Funds provides for termination by either party &#160; at any time upon 60 days&#8217; notice. 

Fees paid by Non-U.S. Funds are reflected in investment management agreements that continue until they are terminated. Increases in these fees generally must be approved by the relevant regulatory authority, depending on the domicile and structure of the fund, and Non-U.S. Fund shareholders must be given advance notice of any fee increases. 

The mutual funds we sub-advise for AXA and its subsidiaries together constitute our largest retail client. They accounted for approximately 22%, 21% and 23% of our retail AUM as of December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively, and approximately 3%, 3% and 2% of our retail net revenues as of 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively. 

Certain subsidiaries of AXA, including AXA Advisors, LLC (&#8220; AXA Advisors &#8221;), a subsidiary of AXA Financial, were responsible for approximately 4%, 3% and 2% of total sales of shares of open-end AB Funds in 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively. UBS AG was responsible for approximately 8%, 11% and 12% of our open-end AB Fund sales in 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively. Neither our affiliates nor UBS AG are under any obligation to sell a specific amount of AB Fund shares and each also sells shares of mutual funds that it sponsors and that are sponsored by unaffiliated organizations. No other entity accounted for 10% or more of our open-end AB Fund sales. 

Most open-end U.S. Funds have adopted a plan under Rule 12b-1 of the Investment Company Act that allows the fund to pay, out of assets of the fund, distribution and service fees for the distribution and sale of its shares (&#8220; Rule 12b-1 Fees &#8221;). The open-end U.S. Funds have entered into such agreements with us, and we have entered into selling and distribution agreements pursuant to which we pay sales commissions to the financial intermediaries that distribute our open-end U.S. Funds. These agreements are terminable by either party upon notice (generally 30 days) and do not obligate the financial intermediary to sell any specific amount of fund shares. 

As of December 31, 2015 , retail U.S. Fund AUM were approximately $45 billion, or 29% of retail AUM, as compared to $49 billion, or 30%, as of December 31, 2014 , and $47 billion, or 31%, as of December 31, 2013 . Non-U.S. Fund AUM, as of December 31, 2015 , totaled $52 billion, or 33% of retail AUM, as compared to $57 billion, or 36%, as of December 31, 2014 , and $56 billion, or 36%, as of December 31, 2013 . 

Our Retail Services represented approximately 33%, 34% and 34% of our AUM as of December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively, and the fees we earned from providing these services represented approximately 45%, 46% and 47% of our net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively. Our AUM and revenues are as follows:

While these regulatory requirements often may be comparable to the requirements of the SEC and other U.S. regulators, they are sometimes more restrictive and may cause us to incur substantial expenditures of time and money related to our compliance efforts. 

Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act 

AB, AB Holding and their global subsidiaries had no transactions or activities requiring disclosure under the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act (&#8220; Iran Act &#8221;), nor were they involved in the AXA Group matters described immediately below . 

The non-U.S. based subsidiaries of AXA operate in compliance with applicable laws and regulations of the various jurisdictions in which they operate, including applicable international (United Nations and European Union) laws and regulations. While AXA Group companies based and operating outside the United States generally are not subject to U.S. law, as an international group, AXA has in place policies and standards (including the AXA Group International Sanctions Policy) that apply to all AXA Group companies worldwide and often impose requirements that go well beyond local law. For additional information regarding AXA, see "Principal Security Holders" in Item 12 . 

AXA has informed us that AXA Konzern AG (" AXA Konzern "), an AXA insurance subsidiary organized under the laws of Germany, had a German client designated under Executive Order 13382. The client had a pension savings contract with AXA Konzern with an annual premium of approximately $15,000. The related annual net profit associated with this contract, which is difficult to calculate with precision, was estimated to be $1,500. This contract was terminated in March 2015. 

AXA also has informed us that AXA Konzern provides car insurance to two diplomats based at the Iranian embassy in Berlin, Germany. The total annual premium of these policies is approximately $13,000 and the annual net profit arising from these policies, which is difficult to calculate with precision, is estimated to be $1,950. These policies were underwritten by a broker who specializes in providing insurance coverage for diplomats. Provision of motor vehicle insurance is mandatory in Germany 

and cannot be cancelled until the policies expire. 

&#160; 

In addition, AXA has informed us that AXA Insurance Ireland, an AXA insurance subsidiary, provides statutorily required car insurance under three separate policies to the Iranian embassy in Dublin, Ireland. AXA has informed us that compliance with the Declined Cases Agreement of the Irish Government prohibits the cancellation of these policies unless another insurer is willing to assume the coverage. The total annual premium for these policies is approximately $3,750 and the annual net profit arising from these policies, which is difficult to calculate with precision, is estimated to be $563. 

Also, AXA has informed us that AXA Sigorta, a subsidiary of AXA organized under the laws of Turkey, provides car insurance coverage for vehicle pools of the Iranian General Consulate and the Iranian embassy in Istanbul, Turkey. Motor liability insurance coverage is mandatory in Turkey and cannot be cancelled unilaterally. The total annual premium in respect of these policies is approximately $3,150 and the annual net profit, which is difficult to calculate with precision, is estimated to be $473. 

In addition, AXA has informed us that AXA Ukraine, an AXA insurance subsidiary, provides car insurance for the Attach&#233; of the Embassy of Iran in Ukraine. Motor liability insurance coverage cannot be cancelled under Ukrainian law. The total annual premium in respect of this policy is approximately $1,000 and the annual net profit, which is difficult to calculate with precision, is estimated to be $150. 

&#160; 

Lastly, AXA previously informed us about a pension contract that had been in place between a subsidiary in Hong Kong, AXA China Region Trustees Limited (" AXA CRT "), and an entity listed as a Specially Designated National (" SDN ") with the identifier [IRAN] by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (" OFAC "). The pension contract was entered into in May 2012 and the individual enrolled in the pension contract was listed by OFAC as a designated SDN with the identifier [IRAN] in May 2013. Local authorities had informed AXA CRT that the pension contract could not be cancelled. In May 2015, however, the individual enrolled in the pension contract permanently departed Hong Kong and, as a result, claimed withdrawal of any accrued pension benefits. The annual pension contributions received under this pension contract had totaled approximately $7,800 and the related net profit, which is difficult to calculate with precision, was estimated to be $780. 

The aggregate annual premiums for the above-referenced insurance policies and pension contracts are approximately $43,700, representing approximately 0.00004% of AXA&#8217;s 2015 consolidated revenues, which are likely to be approximately $100 billion. The related net profit, which is difficult to calculate with precision, is estimated to be $5,416, representing approximately 0.0001% of AXA&#8217;s 2015 aggregate net profit. 

History and Structure 

We have been in the investment research and management business for nearly 50 years. Alliance Capital was founded in 1971 when the investment management department of Donaldson, Lufkin &#38; Jenrette, Inc. (since November 2000, a part of Credit Suisse Group) merged with the investment advisory business of Moody&#8217;s Investor Services, Inc. Bernstein was founded in 1967. 

In April 1988, AB Holding &#8220;went public&#8221; as a master limited partnership. AB Holding Units, which trade under the ticker symbol &#8220;AB&#8221;, have been listed on the NYSE since that time. 

In October 1999, AB Holding reorganized by transferring its business and assets to AB, a newly-formed operating partnership, in exchange for all of the AB Units (&#8220; Reorganization &#8221;). Since the date of the Reorganization, AB has conducted the business formerly conducted by AB Holding and AB Holding&#8217;s activities have consisted of owning AB Units and engaging in related activities. Unlike AB Holding Units, AB Units do not trade publicly and are subject to significant restrictions on transfer. The General Partner is the general partner of both AB and AB Holding. 

In October 2000, our two legacy firms, Alliance Capital and Bernstein, combined, bringing together Alliance Capital&#8217;s expertise in growth equity and corporate fixed income investing and its family of retail mutual funds, with Bernstein&#8217;s expertise in value equity investing, tax-exempt fixed income management, and its Private Wealth Management and Bernstein Research Services businesses. For additional details about this business combination, see Note 2 to AB&#8217;s consolidated financial statements in Item 8 . 

As of December 31, 2015 , the condensed ownership structure of AB is as follows (for a more complete description of our ownership structure, see &#8220;Principal Security Holders&#8221; in Item 12 ): 

The General Partner owns 100,000 general partnership units in AB Holding and a 1% general partnership interest in AB. Including these general partnership interests, AXA, through certain of its subsidiaries ( see &#8220;Principal Security Holders&#8221; in Item 12 ), had an approximate 62.8% economic interest in AB as of December 31, 2015 . 

Competition 

We compete in all aspects of our business with numerous investment management firms, mutual fund sponsors, brokerage and investment banking firms, insurance companies, banks, savings and loan associations, and other financial institutions that often provide investment products that have similar features and objectives as those we offer. Our competitors offer a wide range of financial services to the same customers that we seek to serve. Some of our competitors are larger, have a broader range of product choices and investment capabilities, conduct business in more markets, and have substantially greater resources than we do. These factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage, and we can give no assurance that our strategies and efforts to maintain and enhance our current client relationships, and create new ones, will be successful. 

In addition, AXA and its subsidiaries provide financial services, some of which compete with those we offer. The AB Partnership Agreement specifically allows AXA and its subsidiaries (other than the General Partner) to compete with AB and to pursue opportunities that may be available to us. AXA, AXA Financial, AXA Equitable and certain of their respective subsidiaries have substantially greater financial resources than we do and are not obligated to provide resources to us. 

To grow our business, we believe we must be able to compete effectively for AUM. Key competitive factors include: 

&#8226; 

our investment performance for clients; 

&#8226; 

our commitment to place the interests of our clients first; 

&#8226; 

the quality of our research; 

&#8226; 

our ability to attract, motivate and retain highly skilled, and often highly specialized, personnel; 

&#8226; 

the array of investment products we offer; 

&#8226; 

the fees we charge; 

&#8226; 

Morningstar/Lipper rankings for the AB Funds; 

&#8226; 

our ability to sell our actively-managed investment services despite the fact that many investors favor passive services; 

&#8226; 

our operational effectiveness; 

&#8226; 

our ability to further develop and market our brand; and 

&#8226; 

our global presence. 

Competition is an important risk that our business faces and should be considered along with the other risk factors we discuss in &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in Item 1A .

W.P. Stewart 

On December 12, 2013, we acquired WPS, an equity investment manager that managed, as of December 12, 2013, approximately $2.1 billion in U.S., Global and Europe, Australasia (Australia and New Zealand) and Far East (&#8220; EAFE &#8221;) concentrated growth equity strategies for its clients, primarily in the U.S. and Europe. On the date of the WPS Acquisition, each of approximately 4.9 million outstanding shares of WPS common stock (other than certain specified shares, as previously disclosed in Amendment No. 2 to Form S-4 filed by AB on November 8, 2013) was converted into the right to receive $12.00 per share and one transferable contingent value right (&#8220; CVRs &#8221;) entitling the holders to an additional $4.00 per share cash payment if the Assets Under Management (as such term is defined in the Contingent Value Rights Agreement (&#8220; CVR Agreement &#8221;) dated as of December 12, 2013, a copy of which we filed as Exhibit 4.01 (&#8220; Exhibit 4.01 &#8221;) to our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013) in the acquired WPS investment services exceed $5 billion on or before December 12, 2016, subject to measurement procedures and limitations set forth in the CVR Agreement. See the definition of AUM Milestone in the CVR Agreement filed as Exhibit 4.01 . The foregoing description of the CVR Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by the full text of the CVR Agreement. 

As of December 31, 2015 , the Assets Under Management are approximately $4.0 billion. Accordingly, management has determined that the AUM Milestone did not occur during the fourth quarter of 2015 .
