 Item 1. Business Overview 

We are an innovative biopharmaceutical company dedicated to discovering, developing and delivering best-in-class medicines to patients with difficult-to-treat diseases. We combine proven scientific expertise with a passion for developing novel small molecule drugs that target disease pathways for potential applications in oncology. Our most advanced product candidate is duvelisib, also known as IPI-145, an oral, dual-inhibitor of the delta and gamma isoforms of phosphoinositide-3-kinase, or PI3K, which is currently being evaluated for the treatment of hematologic malignancies, or blood cancers. We believe that duvelisib is the only inhibitor of PI3K-delta and gamma being investigated in Phase 3 clinical trials. We are pursuing duvelisib in oncology through a strategic collaboration with AbbVie Inc., or AbbVie. For information regarding our collaboration, please see below under the heading &#147;AbbVie&#148; in the section entitled &#147;Strategic Alliances.&#148; 

Through the efforts of our dedicated discovery research program, during 2016 we expanded our pipeline with the addition of IPI-549, an orally administered, clinical-stage, immuno-oncology product candidate that selectively inhibits the gamma isoform of PI3K. In addition to duvelisib and IPI-549, we are working to generate new product candidates for potential investigation in oncology. 

Product Development Pipeline 

Historically, our product development programs have arisen from a combination of internally developed programs and strategic licensing arrangements. We focus on targets that have the potential to fundamentally change how disease is treated and where we believe we can use our scientific capabilities to identify differentiated product candidates with well-defined development paths. We seek to leverage what we believe to 

&#160; 

be our innovative approaches to drug discovery and translational medicine and our robust internal capabilities across all of the relevant scientific disciplines, including medicinal chemistry, cell biology, biochemistry, pharmacology and molecular pathology. Our goal is to integrate these disciplines to rapidly identify product candidates and to better understand which populations of patients may benefit most from our product candidates. 

The table and descriptions below summarize key information about our product candidates, duvelisib and IPI-549. None of our product candidates are approved for any indication by the United States Food and Drug Administration or any other regulatory agency.

PI3 Kinase Inhibitor Program 

The PI3Ks are a family of enzymes involved in multiple cellular functions, including cell proliferation and survival, cell differentiation, cell migration, and immunity. PI3K-delta and PI3K-gamma are two proteins with distinct and mostly non-overlapping roles believed to support the growth and survival of malignant B-cells. Specifically, preclinical data suggest that PI3K-delta signaling can lead to the proliferation of malignant B-cells, and that both PI3K-gamma and PI3K-delta play an important role in the formation and maintenance of the supportive tumor microenvironment. 

Duvelisib: Targeting Hematologic Malignancies by Dual Inhibition of PI3K Delta and Gamma Isoforms 

We believe that dual inhibition of PI3K-delta and PI3K-gamma may provide multiple opportunities to develop a differentiated therapy for the treatment of certain hematologic malignancies. Our lead product candidate, duvelisib, is an oral, dual inhibitor of PI3K-delta and PI3K-gamma, which we believe is the only dual inhibitor of PI3K-delta and PI3K-gamma being investigated in Phase 3 clinical trials. Duvelisib is an investigational compound, and its safety and efficacy have not yet been evaluated by the FDA or any other health authority. 

Hematologic malignancies are cancers of the blood or bone marrow such as non-Hodgkin lymphoma, or NHL, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, or CLL. It is estimated that there will be approximately 134,650 newly diagnosed cases of NHL in the seven major pharmaceutical markets (United States, France, Germany, Italy, 

&#160; 

Japan, Spain, and United Kingdom) in 2016. The distribution of NHL subtypes differs by country. In the United States and major European countries in 2012, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, or DLBCL, accounted for 37-43% of NHL cases while CLL accounted for 25-33% and follicular lymphoma for 17-22%. Even with advances in treatment options for these diseases, the clinical outlook for patients still remains poor. A significant proportion of patients relapse following treatment and become refractory to current agents, representing a significant unmet medical need. 

To address this need, we are conducting DUETTS&#153; (Duvelisib Trials in Hematologic Malignancies), a worldwide clinical investigation of duvelisib in blood cancers initially focusing on lymphoma and CLL. The investigation of duvelisib in our DUETTS trials, discussed below in detail, is supported by data from our Phase 1, open-label, dose-escalation study designed to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics and clinical activity of duvelisib in patients with advanced hematologic malignancies. The maximum tolerated dose of duvelisib was defined at 75 mg twice daily, or BID, and we have closed the trial to further enrollment. Data from this study, presented in December 2014 at the Annual Meeting of the American Society for Hematology, or ASH 2014, showed that duvelisib is clinically active in CLL, iNHL, aggressive NHL, or aNHL, and T-cell lymphoma, as well as other hematologic malignancies. We are continuing to evaluate duvelisib in 14 patients with hematologic malignancies across multiple dose levels from 10 mg BID to 75 mg BID with eight patients (57%) continuing to receive 25 mg bid. These 14 remaining patients represent several hematology indications: four patients with iNHL, mantle cell lymphoma, or MCL, or CLL; seven treatment-na&#239;ve, high-risk CLL patients, with high-risk defined as patients aged 65 or older or having either of two genetic abnormalities known as a 17p- deletion or a p53 mutation; two patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, or CTCL, or noncutaneous T-cell lymphoma; and one patient with aNHL. 

Indolent Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma 

As part of the DUETTS program in lymphoma, we are conducting DYNAMO&#153;, a Phase 2, open-label, single&#150;arm monotherapy study evaluating the safety and efficacy of duvelisib dosed at 25 mg twice daily in 129 patients with iNHL. DYNAMO enrollment criteria include patients with follicular lymphoma, the most common subtype of iNHL, marginal zone lymphoma, and small lymphocytic lymphoma, or SLL, whose disease is refractory to rituximab, a monoclonal antibody treatment, and to either chemotherapy or radioimmunotherapy and who must have progressed within six months of receiving their last therapy. The primary endpoint of the study is response rate according to the International Working Group, or IWG, Criteria. We completed enrollment in DYNAMO in September 2015 and expect to report topline data in the third quarter of 2016. 

The DYNAMO study is designed with the potential to support accelerated approval of duvelisib in patients with follicular lymphoma and SLL, assuming we are able to generate positive safety and efficacy data from the study and on the condition that we conduct a confirmatory study. The FDA has granted orphan drug designation to duvelisib for the potential treatment of follicular lymphoma, and has granted fast track designation to the investigation of duvelisib for the treatment of patients with follicular lymphoma who have received at least two prior therapies. The availability of accelerated approval is uncertain, and is dependent on a number of factors including whether duvelisib has demonstrated a meaningful benefit relative to available therapies. For a further discussion of the FDA&#146;s accelerated approval pathway, and certain risks related to our ability to seek accelerated approval for duvelisib, see &#147;Government Regulation and Product Approvals&#151;Review and Approval of Drugs in the United States&#148; and &#147;Risk Factors&#151; Risks Related to Regulatory Approval and Marketing of Our Product Candidates and Other Legal Compliance Matters&#148; elsewhere in this report. 

The investigation of duvelisib in DYNAMO is supported by preliminary data from our Phase 1, open-label, dose-escalation study designed to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics and clinical activity of duvelisib in patients with advanced hematologic malignancies, discussed in more detail below. Data presented at ASH 2014 from our Phase 1 study have demonstrated that duvelisib administered at 25 mg BID is clinically active in patients with iNHL, with a 72% (13 of 18 evaluable patients) overall response rate and a 33% (6 of 18 evaluable 

&#160; 

patients) complete response rate. Among patients with follicular lymphoma, the overall response rate was 69% (9 of 13 evaluable patients), including a 38% complete response rate (5 of 13 evaluable patients). As of the time of ASH 2014, the median progression free survival and median overall survival had not yet been reached, with 69% of patients progression-free and with an 89% overall survival rate at 24 months. Duvelisib was generally well tolerated, and the majority of side effects were low-grade, asymptomatic and transient. The majority of adverse events were Grade 1 or 2, reversible and/or clinically manageable. At the 25 mg BID dose, the most common Grade 3 side effects were an increase in alanine aminotransferase, or ALT, or aspartate aminotransferase, or AST (32%), diarrhea (16%), neutropenia and pneumonia (11% each). Grade 4 neutropenia was 11% (two patients), Grade 4 ALT or AST increase was 5% (one patient) and Grade 4 pneumonia was 5% (one patient). 

Additional DUETTS clinical studies in lymphoma include CONTEMPO, BRAVURA, and FRESCO. CONTEMPO is a Phase 1b/2 clinical study of duvelisib in combination with obinutuzumab, a monoclonal antibody treatment, or rituximab in patients with previously untreated follicular lymphoma. We expect to report initial data from CONTEMPO in the second half of 2016. BRAVURA is a Phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in patients with relapsed iNHL designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of duvelisib plus rituximab and bendamustine, a chemotherapy, compared to placebo plus rituximab and bendamustine in approximately 600 patients. The primary endpoint is progression-free survival. We requested advice from the FDA to determine if BRAVURA, as designed, can serve as a confirmatory study if DYNAMO supports an accelerated approval. FRESCO is a Phase 2 randomized study in patients with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma that is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of duvelisib plus rituximab compared to rituximab plus a combination of chemotherapies referred to as &#147;CHOP&#148; in approximately 230 patients. The chemotherapies included in CHOP are cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin hydrochloride, vincristine sulfate, and prednisone. The primary endpoint of FRESCO is progression-free survival. DYNAMO+R, a Phase 3 randomized, placebo-controlled study evaluating duvelisib dosed at 25 mg BID in combination with rituximab compared to placebo plus rituximab in patients with previously treated follicular lymphoma has been identified for closure and is no longer enrolling patients. 

Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia 

As part of the DUETTS investigation in CLL, we are conducting DUO TM and SYNCHRONY. DUO is a randomized, Phase 3 monotherapy study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of duvelisib dosed at 25 mg BID compared to ofatumumab, a monoclonal antibody treatment, in 319 patients with relapsed or refractory CLL. The primary endpoint of the study is progression-free survival. Enrollment of DUO was completed in November 2015, and we expect to report topline data in the second half of 2016 if supported by the interim analysis. SYNCHRONY is a Phase 1b trial of duvelisib in combination with obinutuzumab in CLL patients whose disease has progressed following treatment with a Bruton&#146;s tyrosine kinase, or BTK, inhibitor. This study is supported by Phase 1 data of duvelisib in six CLL patients previously treated with ibrutinib, a BTK inhibitor, presented at ASH 2014. Early clinical activity was observed, with partial responses in one CLL patient and stable disease in five CLL patients. The safety profile of duvelisib in these patients appeared consistent with the safety profile observed in other patients with advanced hematologic malignancies treated with duvelisib in the Phase 1 study. The FDA and the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, have granted orphan drug designation to duvelisib for the potential treatment of CLL and SLL. The FDA has granted fast track designation to the investigation of duvelisib for the potential treatment of patients with CLL who have received at least one prior therapy. 

The investigation of duvelisib in DUO and SYNCHRONY is supported by preliminary data from our Phase 1 study that demonstrated that duvelisib administered at 25 mg BID is clinically active in patients with relapsed or refractory CLL, with a 57% overall response rate (17 of 30 evaluable patients), including one complete response. At the time of ASH 2014, the median progression free survival and median overall survival in the 31 patients who received the 25 mg BID dose had not yet been reached with a median time on treatment of 7.6 months (range: 0.9 months to 34.1 months). The majority of side effects were Grade 1-2, reversible and/or clinically manageable. Across all doses evaluated in the study (N = 55), the most common Grade 3 side effects were pneumonia (24%), neutropenia (18%) and anemia (16%). Grade 4 pneumonia was 2% (one patient), Grade 4 neutropenia was 24% (13 patients) and Grade 4 anemia was 2% (one patient). 

&#160; 

Additional data from our Phase 1 study has demonstrated clinical activity of duvelisib dosed at 25 mg BID in previously untreated patients with CLL, with an 88% overall response rate (15 partial responses out of 17 evaluable patients, with two additional patients exhibiting stable disease) based on International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia, or iwCLL, criteria. The study included 18 treatment-na&#239;ve CLL patients who were high-risk, defined as age 65 or over and/or having certain genetic abnormalities known as 17p deletions or p53 mutations. Data presented at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, or ASCO, in June 2015, showed that the median time to response was 3.7 months, and the median progression-free survival and median overall survival had not yet been reached. The majority of adverse events were grade 1 or grade 2 and clinically manageable. The most common Grade 3 side effects among the 18 enrolled patients were diarrhea (22%), an increase in ALT and AST (17%), and rash (11%). Five patients (28%) had Grade 4 neutropenia or decreases in neutrophil count. There were no Grade 4 events of diarrhea, increases in ALT or AST or rash. Six patients discontinued treatment due to an adverse event. 

Investigating Duvelisib in Combination with Venetoclax 

As part of our collaboration, AbbVie has initiated the first clinical study investigating duvelisib in combination with venetoclax, a first-in-class, investigational, selective B-cell lymphoma 2, or BCL-2, inhibitor. This Phase 1b/2 trial is designed to evaluate the safety and activity of duvelisib in combination with venetoclax in approximately 174 patients with relapsed or refractory, iNHL, aNHL, CLL or SLL. Preclinical data for duvelisib presented at ASCO in June 2015 demonstrates synergy with standards-of-care and emerging therapeutics in development for hematologic malignancies, including duvelisib in combination with venetoclax. For information regarding our collaboration with AbbVie, please see below under the heading &#147;AbbVie&#148; in the section entitled &#147;Strategic Alliances.&#148; 

T-Cell Lymphoma, aNHL and Other Lymphomas 

Data from our Phase 1 study presented at ASH 2014 and at the 7 th Annual T-cell Lymphoma Forum held in January 2015 demonstrates that duvelisib is clinically active in advanced T-cell lymphomas. Treatment with duvelisib in heavily pre-treated patients with relapsed or refractory T-cell lymphoma resulted in an overall response rate of 42% (14 of 33 patients evaluable for response), including two complete responses and twelve partial responses. Among the 15 patients with peripheral T-cell lymphoma, or PTCL, who were evaluable for response, treatment with duvelisib resulted in two complete responses and six partial responses, for an overall response rate of 53%. Among the 18 patients with CTCL evaluable for response, treatment with duvelisib resulted in to six partial responses for an overall response rate of 33%. Stable disease was observed in one patient with PTCL and six patients with CTCL. The Grade 3 side effects in patients with T-cell lymphoma included increases in ALT or AST in 11 patients (31%), rash in six patients (17%) and pneumonia in five patients (14%). Two patients (6%) had Grade 4 ALT or AST increases, and one patient (3%) had Grade 4 pneumonia. The majority of patients (27 of 35) received duvelisib dosed at 75 mg BID. 

Duvelisib Global Regulatory Filings 

We expect to report topline data from our DYNAMO study in the third quarter of 2016, and if supported by the DYNAMO data, we anticipate that we will submit a New Drug Application, or NDA, in the fourth quarter of 2016 seeking accelerated approval of duvelisib from the FDA for the treatment of follicular lymphoma and SLL. In addition, we expect to conduct a planned interim analysis of data from our DUO study in the second half of 2016. If supported by the interim analysis of data from our DUO study, we expect to report topline data from our DUO study in the second half of 2016 and submit an NDA in the fourth quarter of 2016 seeking regular approval of duvelisib from the FDA for the treatment of certain patients with CLL. Additionally, if supported by an interim analysis of data from the DUO study and data from our DYNAMO study, we expect that AbbVie will submit a Marketing Authorization Application, or MAA, in the fourth quarter of 2016 seeking approval from the EMA to market duvelisib for certain patients with follicular lymphoma and CLL. 

&#160; 

IPI-549: Targeting Solid Tumors by Selective Inhibition of the PI3K Gamma Isoform 

In 2015, we expanded our pipeline to include IPI-549, an orally administered, selective PI3K-gamma inhibitor that we intend to evaluate as a potential treatment in solid tumors. Preclinical data from studies investigating IPI-549 indicates that IPI-549 has the potential to heighten an anti-cancer response by targeting macrophages in the immune-suppressive tumor microenvironment and may have the potential to treat a broad range of solid tumors. IPI-549 has demonstrated dose-dependent, single-agent, anti-tumor activity in multiple solid tumor models, including mouse models of lung cancer, colon cancer and breast cancer. Additionally, mice treated with IPI-549 in combination with a type of therapy called a &#147;checkpoint inhibitor&#148; showed greater tumor growth inhibition than treatment with either IPI-549 or the checkpoint inhibitor alone. Preclinical in vivo data also demonstrated that T-cells, a type of cell that plays a role in the human immune system, are required for the anti-tumor activity of IPI-549. These data were presented at CRI-CIMT-EATI-AACR - The Inaugural International Cancer Immunotherapy Conference in September 2015. 

Based on our preclinical data generated to date, we have initiated a Phase 1 first-in-human study that includes a dose-escalation phase to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of IPI-549 as a monotherapy, as well as a dose-escalation phase evaluating IPI-549 in combination with a &#147;checkpoint inhibitor&#148; therapy that targets a receptor in the human body called programmed death receptor 1, or PD-1. If supported by data from the initial portion of the study, a Phase 1b portion would investigate IPI-549 in patients with selected solid tumors, including non-small cell lung cancer and melanoma. 

Strategic Alliances 

Since our inception, corporate alliances have been integral to our strategy. These alliances have provided access to breakthrough science, significant research and development support and funding, and innovative drug development programs, all intended to help us realize the full potential of our product pipeline. All of our revenues to date have been generated under research collaborative agreements including our corporate alliances. 

AbbVie 

On September 2, 2014, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with AbbVie, which we refer to as the AbbVie Agreement. Under the AbbVie Agreement, we are collaborating with AbbVie to develop and commercialize products containing duvelisib, which we refer to as Duvelisib Products, in oncology indications. IPI-549 is excluded from the collaboration. Under the terms of the AbbVie Agreement, we have granted to AbbVie licenses under applicable patents, patent applications, know-how and trademarks to develop, commercialize and manufacture Duvelisib Products in oncology indications. These licenses are generally co-exclusive with rights we retain, except that we have granted AbbVie exclusive licenses to commercialize Duvelisib Products outside the United States. We and AbbVie retain the rights to perform our respective obligations and exercise our respective rights under the AbbVie Agreement, and we and AbbVie may each grant sublicenses to affiliates or third parties. 

Under the AbbVie Agreement, we and AbbVie have created a governance structure, including committees and working groups to manage the development, manufacturing and commercialization responsibilities for Duvelisib Products. Generally, we and AbbVie must mutually agree on decisions, although in specified circumstances either we or AbbVie would be able to break a deadlock. 

We and AbbVie share oversight of development and have each agreed to use diligent efforts, as defined in the AbbVie Agreement, to carry out our development activities under an agreed upon development plan. We have primary responsibility for the conduct of development of Duvelisib Products, unless otherwise agreed, and AbbVie has responsibility for the conduct of certain contemplated combination clinical studies, including those examining duvelisib and venetoclax, which we refer to as the AbbVie Studies. We have the responsibility to manufacture Duvelisib Products until we transition manufacturing responsibility to AbbVie, which we expect to 

&#160; 

occur as promptly as practicable while ensuring continuity of supply. Excluding the AbbVie Studies, we are responsible for all costs to develop and manufacture Duvelisib Products up to a maximum amount of $667 million after which we will share Duvelisib Product development and manufacturing costs equally with AbbVie. The development and manufacturing costs of the AbbVie Studies will be shared equally. 

We and AbbVie share operational responsibility and decision making authority for commercialization of Duvelisib Products in the United States. Specifically, we have the primary responsibility for advertising, distribution, and booking sales, and we share certain other commercialization functions with AbbVie. Assuming regulatory approval, we and AbbVie are obligated to each provide half of the sales representative effort to promote Duvelisib Products in the United States. Outside the United States, AbbVie has, with limited exceptions, operational responsibility and decision making authority to commercialize Duvelisib Products. We and AbbVie will share the cost of manufacturing and supply for commercialization of Duvelisib Products in the United States, and AbbVie will bear the cost of manufacturing and supply for commercialization of Duvelisib Products outside the United States. 

AbbVie paid us a non-refundable $275 million upfront payment in 2014 and a $130 million milestone payment in November 2015 associated with the completion of enrollment of DYNAMO in September 2015. Further, AbbVie has agreed to pay us up to an additional $400 million in potential future milestone payments comprised of $125 million associated with the acceptance by the FDA of the first NDA submission for duvelisib, $75 million associated with the acceptance of the first MAA submission for duvelisib, up to $75 million associated with the achievement of specified regulatory approval milestones, and up to $125 million associated with the achievement of specified commercialization milestones. Under the terms of the AbbVie Agreement, we and AbbVie will equally share commercial profits or losses of Duvelisib Products in the United States, including sharing equally the existing royalty obligations to Mundipharma International Corporation Limited, or Mundipharma, and Purdue Pharmaceutical Products L.P., or Purdue, for sales of Duvelisib Products in the United States, as well as sharing equally the existing U.S. milestone payment obligations to Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, or Takeda. For more information about such obligations, refer to the sections below titled &#147;Takeda&#148; and &#147;Mundipharma and Purdue.&#148; 

Additionally, AbbVie has agreed to pay us tiered royalties on net sales of Duvelisib Products outside the United States ranging from 23.5% to 30.5%, depending on annual net sales of Duvelisib Products by AbbVie, its affiliates and its sublicensees. We are responsible for the existing royalty obligations to Mundipharma and Purdue outside the United States, and AbbVie has agreed to reimburse us for our existing Duvelisib Product milestone payment obligations to Takeda outside the United States. The tiered royalty from AbbVie is subject to a reduction of 4% at each tier if our royalties to Mundipharma and Purdue are reduced according to the terms of our respective agreements with Mundipharma and Purdue. This tiered royalty can further be reduced based on specified factors, including patent expiry, generic entry, and royalties paid to third parties with blocking intellectual property. These royalties are payable on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis until AbbVie ceases selling the product in the country. 

Subject to limited exceptions, we have agreed that we and our affiliates will not commercialize, or assist others in commercializing, in oncology indications any product that is a PI3K delta, gamma inhibitor that meets certain agreed-to criteria, other than Duvelisib Products, and AbbVie has agreed to similar restrictions. Registration-directed clinical trials and commercialization of Duvelisib Products for uses outside of oncology indications would require our and AbbVie&#146;s mutual consent. 

The AbbVie Agreement will remain in effect until all development, manufacturing and commercialization of Duvelisib Products cease, unless terminated earlier. Either we or AbbVie may terminate the AbbVie Agreement if the other party is subject to certain insolvency proceedings or if the other party materially breaches the AbbVie Agreement and the breach remains uncured for a specified period, which may be extended in certain circumstances. However, we may terminate the AbbVie Agreement only on a country-by-country basis in the event AbbVie is not using diligent efforts to obtain regulatory approval or to commercialize Duvelisib Products 

&#160; 

in a country outside the United States. AbbVie may also terminate the AbbVie Agreement for convenience after a specified notice period. In the event there is a material uncured breach by either us or AbbVie of development or commercialization obligations, the non-breaching party may also have the right to assume and conduct such applicable development or commercialization obligations. If AbbVie or any of its affiliates or sublicensees challenges the patents we have licensed to AbbVie, we can terminate the AbbVie Agreement if the challenge is not withdrawn after a specified notice period. 

If the AbbVie Agreement is terminated, we would receive all rights to the regulatory filings related to duvelisib upon our request, our license to AbbVie would terminate, and AbbVie would grant us a perpetual, irrevocable license to develop, manufacture and commercialize products containing duvelisib, excluding any compound which is covered by patent rights controlled by AbbVie or its affiliates. This license would be royalty-free, unless the AbbVie Agreement is terminated for material breach, in which case, depending on the breaching party and the timing of the material breach, a royalty rate may be payable by us ranging from a low single-digit percentage to a low double-digit percentage of net sales, and, in some cases, subject to a payment cap. 

If the AbbVie Agreement is terminated, we would not be entitled to receive payment for any milestone achieved after notice of termination but before the effective date of termination. Further, if the AbbVie Agreement is terminated, there are certain wind-down obligations to ensure a smooth transition of the responsibilities of the parties including, unless the AbbVie Agreement is terminated by AbbVie for our material breach, the continued conduct of certain development and commercialization activities by AbbVie for a limited transition period and the continued funding by AbbVie of its half of the cost of the AbbVie Studies ongoing at the time of termination, except for those AbbVie Studies that may be transitioned to Infinity following termination. 

Takeda 

In July 2010, we entered into a development and license agreement with Intellikine, Inc., or Intellikine, under which we obtained rights to discover, develop and commercialize pharmaceutical products targeting the delta and/or gamma isoforms of PI3K, including duvelisib and IPI-549, and we paid Intellikine a $13.5 million upfront license fee. In January 2012, Intellikine was acquired by Takeda, acting through its Millennium business unit. We refer to our PI3K inhibitor program licensor as Takeda. In December 2012, we amended and restated our development and license agreement with Takeda. 

Under the terms of the amended and restated agreement, we retained worldwide development rights and, in exchange for an agreement to pay Takeda $15 million in installments, we regained commercialization rights for products arising from the agreement for all therapeutic indications, and we are solely responsible for research conducted under the agreement. 

We are obligated to pay to Takeda up to $5 million in remaining success-based milestone payments for the development of a product candidate other than duvelisib, which could include IPI-549. We are also obligated to pay Takeda up to an aggregate of $450 million in success-based milestone payments for the approval and commercialization of two distinct products, of which one could be a Duvelisib Product and the other could be a product containing IPI-549. In February 2014, we paid Takeda a $10 million milestone payment in connection with the initiation of DUO, our Phase 3 study of duvelisib in patients with relapsed or refractory CLL. On March 31, 2015, we paid a $52.5 million fee to exercise an option that we purchased from Takeda in July 2014 for a one-time upfront payment of $5 million. As a result of our exercise of this option, we are no longer obligated under the amended and restated development and license agreement to pay to Takeda tiered royalties with respect to worldwide net sales in oncology indications of products containing or comprised of duvelisib. 

Except for duvelisib products in oncology indications, we are obligated to pay Takeda tiered royalties ranging from 7% to 11% on worldwide net sales of products described in the agreement, which could include IPI-549 if successfully developed and commercialized. Such royalties are payable until the later to occur of the 

&#160; 

expiration of specified patent rights and the expiration of non-patent regulatory exclusivities in a country, subject to reduction of the royalties, and, in certain circumstances, limits on the number of products subject to a royalty obligation. 

The amended and restated agreement expires on the later of the expiration of certain patents and the expiration of the royalty payment terms for the products, unless earlier terminated. Either party may terminate the agreement on 75 days&#146; prior written notice if the other party materially breaches the agreement and fails to cure such breach within the applicable notice period, provided that the notice period is reduced to 30 days where the alleged breach is non-payment. Takeda may also terminate the agreement if we are not diligent in developing or commercializing the licensed products and do not, within three months after notice from Takeda, demonstrate to Takeda&#146;s reasonable satisfaction that we have not failed to be diligent. The foregoing periods are subject to extension in certain circumstances. Additionally, Takeda may terminate the agreement upon 30 days&#146; prior written notice if we or a related party bring an action challenging the validity of any of the licensed patents, provided that we have not withdrawn such action before the end of the 30-day notice period. We may terminate the agreement at any time upon 180 days&#146; prior written notice. The agreement also provides for customary reciprocal indemnification obligations of the parties. 

Mundipharma and Purdue 

On July 17, 2012, we terminated our strategic alliance with Mundipharma and Purdue, and we entered into termination and revised relationship agreements with each of those entities, which we refer to as the 2012 Termination Agreements. The strategic alliance was previously governed by strategic alliance agreements that we entered into with each of Mundipharma and Purdue in November 2008. The strategic alliance agreement with Purdue was focused on the development and commercialization in the United States of products targeting fatty acid amide hydrolase, or FAAH. The strategic alliance agreement with Mundipharma was focused on the development and commercialization outside the United States of all products and product candidates that inhibit or target the Hedgehog pathway, FAAH, PI3K and product candidates arising out of our early discovery projects in all disease fields. 

Under the terms of the 2012 Termination Agreements: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; All intellectual property rights that we had previously licensed to Mundipharma and Purdue to develop and commercialize products under the previous strategic alliance agreements terminated resulting in the return to us of worldwide rights to all product candidates that had previously been covered by the strategic alliance. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; We have no further obligation to provide research and development services to Mundipharma and Purdue as of July 17, 2012. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Mundipharma and Purdue have no further obligation to provide research and development funding to us. Under the strategic alliance, Mundipharma was obligated to reimburse us for research and development expenses we incurred, up to an annual aggregate cap for each strategic alliance program other than FAAH. We did not record a liability for amounts previously funded by Purdue and Mundipharma as this relationship was not considered a financing arrangement. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; We are obligated to pay Mundipharma and Purdue a 4% royalty in the aggregate, subject to reduction as described below, on worldwide net sales of products that were covered by the alliance until such time as they have recovered approximately $260 million, representing the research and development funding paid to us for research and development services performed by us through the termination of the strategic alliance. After this cost recovery, our royalty obligations to Mundipharma and Purdue will be reduced to a 1% royalty on net sales in the United States of products that were previously subject to the strategic alliance. All payments are contingent upon the successful commercialization of products that were subject to the alliance, which products require significant further development. As such, there is significant uncertainty about whether any such products will ever be approved or commercialized. If no products are commercialized, no payments will be due by us to Mundipharma and Purdue; therefore, no amounts have been accrued. 

&#160; 

Royalties are payable under these agreements until the later to occur of the last-to-expire of specified patent rights and the expiration of non-patent regulatory exclusivities in a country, provided that if royalties are payable solely on the basis of non-patent regulatory exclusivity, each of the royalty rates is reduced by 50%. In addition, royalties payable under these agreements after Mundipharma and Purdue have recovered all research and development expenses paid to us are subject to reduction on account of third-party royalty payments or patent litigation damages or settlements which might be required to be paid by us if litigation were to arise, with any such reductions capped at 50% of the amounts otherwise payable during the applicable royalty payment period. 

Intellectual Property 

Our intellectual property consists of patents, trademarks, trade secrets and know-how. Our ability to compete effectively depends in large part on our ability to obtain patents and trademarks for our technologies and products, maintain trade secrets, operate without infringing the rights of others and prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. We will be able to protect our proprietary technologies from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that they are covered by valid and enforceable patents, or are effectively maintained as trade secrets. As a result, patents or other proprietary rights are an essential element of our business. 

We have eight issued or allowed U.S. patents related to our duvelisib program, which expire on various dates between 2029 and 2032, excluding any patent term extension. We have three issued or allowed U.S. patents related to our PI3K gamma program, which expire on various dates between 2033 and 2034, excluding any patent term extension. In addition, we have approximately 275 patents and patent applications pending worldwide related to our PI3K programs. Any patents that may issue from our pending patent applications would expire between 2029 and 2035, excluding any patent term extension. These patents and patent applications disclose compositions of matter, pharmaceutical compositions, methods of use and synthetic methods. 

Our policy is to obtain and enforce the patents and proprietary technology rights that are commercially important to our business, and we intend to continue to file patent applications to protect such technology and compounds in countries where we believe it is commercially reasonable and advantageous to do so. We also rely on trade secrets to protect our technology where patent protection is deemed inappropriate or unobtainable. We protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, collaborators and contractors. 

Competition 

The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are intensely competitive. Many companies, including biotechnology, chemical and pharmaceutical companies, are actively engaged in the research and development of drugs for the treatment of the same diseases and conditions as our current and potential future product candidates. Many of these companies have substantially greater financial and other resources, larger research and development staffs and more extensive marketing and manufacturing organizations than we do. In addition, some of them have considerably more experience than us in preclinical testing, clinical trials and other regulatory approval procedures. There are also academic institutions, governmental agencies and other research organizations that are conducting research in areas in which we are working. They may also develop products that may be competitive with our product candidates, either on their own or through collaborative efforts. 

We expect to encounter significant competition for any drugs we develop. Companies that complete clinical trials, obtain required regulatory approvals and commence commercial sales of their products before their competitors may achieve a significant competitive advantage. We are aware that many other companies or institutions are pursuing the development of drugs in the areas in which we are currently seeking to develop our own product candidates, and there may be other companies working on competitive projects of which we are not aware. 

&#160; 

Our competitors may commence and complete clinical testing of their product candidates, obtain regulatory approvals and begin commercialization of their products sooner than we may for our own product candidates. These competitive products may have superior safety or efficacy, or be manufactured less expensively, than our product candidates. If we are unable to compete effectively against these companies on the basis of safety, efficacy or cost, then we may not be able to commercialize our product candidates or achieve a competitive position in the market. This would adversely affect our business. 

PI3K Inhibitor Program 

We believe that the following companies, among others, have developed or are in the clinical stage of development of compounds targeting the delta and/or gamma isoforms of PI3K: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Gilead Sciences, Inc., or Gilead, has received approval from the FDA of idelalisib for the treatment of people with CLL, SLL, or follicular lymphoma, and which we believe is conducting a Phase 1b clinical trial of acalisib; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Bayer AG, which we believe is conducting Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials of copanlisib; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Incyte Corporation, which we believe is conducting a Phase 1 clinical trial of INCB-050465, and which we also believe is conducting a Phase 1 clinical trial of INCB-040093; and 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Rhizen Pharmaceuticals S.A., which we believe is conducting Phase 1 clinical trials of RP-6530. 

In addition, many companies are developing product candidates directed to disease targets such as Bruton&#146;s tyrosine kinase (or BTK), B-cell lymphoma 2 (or BCL-2), Janus Kinase (or JAK), B-lymphocyte antigen CD-19, and programmed death 1/ligand 1 (or PD-1/PD-L1), Cluster of Differentiation 79B antibody-drug conjugate (or CD79B ADC), and pleiotropic pathways in the fields of hematology-oncology, including in the specific diseases for which we are currently developing duvelisib, or for which we may develop duvelisib or other PI3K inhibitors in the future. Such companies include: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Pharmacyclics LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of AbbVie, through its collaboration with Janssen Biotech, which has received approval from the FDA of ibrutinib, a BTK inhibitor, for the treatment of people with MCL, CLL, or Waldenstr&#246;m&#146;s macroglobulinemia, and is conducting multiple late stage clinical studies of ibrutinib in additional hematologic malignancies; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; AbbVie, which we believe is conducting a Phase 3 and multiple Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials of venetoclax, a BCL-2 inhibitor, in hematologic malignancies; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Celgene Corporation, which has received FDA approval of lenalidomide, an immunomodulator, for the treatment of people with multiple myeloma, MCL, and myelodyplastic syndromes, and is conducting late stage clinical studies of lenalidomide in additional hematologic malignancies; we also believe that Celgene is conducting a Phase 1 clinical trial of CC-292, a BTK inhibitor, in patients with CLL; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Acerta Pharma BV, which we believe is conducting a Phase 3 clinical trial of ACP-196, a BTK inhibitor, in patients with CLL; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Incyte Corporation, which has received FDA approval of ruxolitinib, a JAK inhibitor, in patients with intermediate or high-risk myelofibrosis, and which we believe is conducting a Phase 2 clinical trial in CLL; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#149; &#160; Novartis AG, which we believe is conducting a Phase 2 trial of CTL-019, which targets CD-19, in a trial that includes iNHL and CLL and acute lymphocytic leukemia, or ALL, patients; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Novartis AG, which we believe is conducting a Phase 1b trial of BCL-201, a BCL-2 inhibitor, in combination with idelalisib in patients with follicular lymphoma or MCL; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Genentech, which we believe is conducting a Phase 2 trial of polatuzumab vedotin, which targets CD79b ADC, in patients with follicular lymphoma or DLBCL; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; MorphoSys, which we believe is conducting Phase 2 clinical trials of MOR208, a B-lymphocyte antigen CD-19 inhibitor, in patients with NHL, CLL, and ALL; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Celgene, which we believe is conducting Phase 1/2 and Phase 1 clinical trials of CC-122, a pleiotropic pathway modifier, in patients with CLL, and NHL; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; BeiGene Co., Ltd, which we believe is conducting Phase 1 clinical trials of BGB-3111, a BTK inhibitor, in patients with B-cell malignancies; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Gilead Sciences, Inc./Ono Pharmaceutical Group, which we believe is conducting Phase 1 clinical trials of ONO-4059, a BTK inhibitor, in patients with NHL and CLL; and 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Roche Group and its subsidiary Genentech, and AstraZeneca PLC, each of which we believe is conducting clinical trials of anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 antibodies, in patients with hematologic malignancies. 

Research and Development 

As of February 1, 2016, our research and development group consisted of 164 employees, of whom 34% hold Ph.D. or M.D. degrees and an additional 13% hold other advanced degrees. Our research and development group is focusing on drug discovery, preclinical research, translational medicine, clinical trials and manufacturing technologies. Our research and development expense for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was approximately $199.1 million, $143.6 million and $99.8 million, respectively. 

Manufacturing and Supply 

We rely primarily on third parties, and in some instances we rely on only one third party, to manufacture critical raw materials, drug substance and final drug product for our research, preclinical development and clinical trial activities. As required by our agreement with AbbVie, we are in the process of transitioning the responsibility to manufacture Duvelisib Products to AbbVie as promptly as is practicable while ensuring continuity of supply. Excluding the AbbVie Studies, we are responsible for all costs to develop and manufacture Duvelisib Products up to a maximum amount of $667 million, after which we will share Duvelisib Product development and manufacturing costs equally with AbbVie. The development and manufacturing costs of the AbbVie Studies will be shared equally. We and AbbVie will share the cost of manufacturing and supply for commercialization of Duvelisib Products in the United States, and AbbVie will bear the cost of manufacturing and supply for commercialization of Duvelisib Products outside the United States. Commercial quantities of any drugs we seek to develop will have to be manufactured in facilities and by processes that comply with the FDA and other regulations, and we plan to rely on third parties to manufacture commercial quantities of any products we successfully develop. 

Sales and Marketing 

Under the AbbVie Agreement, we and AbbVie share operational responsibility and decision making authority for commercialization of Duvelisib Products in the United States, while AbbVie has, with limited exceptions, operational responsibility and decision making authority to commercialize Duvelisib Products outside of the United States. We are currently developing the infrastructure and personnel we believe to be necessary to successfully market, sell, and distribute Duvelisib Products in the United States, and we intend for 

&#160; 

such infrastructure to serve as the foundation for the launch of future drug products, subject to receiving marketing approval for those products. Further, we expect AbbVie&#146;s established marketing and sales infrastructure, global marketing presence, and history of successful product launches positions duvelisib to best be delivered to patients, subject to receipt of marketing approval by the requisite regulatory bodies. 

Government Regulation and Product Approvals 

Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries and jurisdictions, including the European Union, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, post-approval monitoring and reporting, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. The processes for obtaining marketing approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory authorities, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. We are currently developing the infrastructure and personnel we believe to be necessary to support an effective compliance program. 

Review and Approval of Drugs in the United States 

In the United States, the FDA approves and regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and implementing regulations. The failure to comply with requirements under the FDCA and other applicable laws at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant and/or sponsor to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, including refusal by the FDA to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters and other types of letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal investigations and penalties brought by the FDA and the Department of Justice or other governmental entities. 

A product candidate must be approved by the FDA through the new drug application, or NDA. An applicant seeking approval to market and distribute a new drug product in the United States must typically undertake the following: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA&#146;s good laboratory practice, or GLP, regulations; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; submission to the FDA of an IND, which must take effect before human clinical trials may begin; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, representing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practices, or GCP, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each indication; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; preparation and submission to the FDA of a new drug application, or NDA, requesting marketing for one or more proposed indications; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; review by an FDA advisory committee, where appropriate or if applicable; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; satisfactory completion of one or more FDA inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product, or components thereof, are produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product&#146;s identity, strength, quality and purity; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; satisfactory completion of FDA audits of clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCPs and the integrity of the clinical data; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#149; &#160; payment of user fees and securing FDA approval of the NDA; and 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; compliance with any post-approval requirements, including the potential requirement to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, and the potential requirement to conduct post-approval studies. 

Preclinical Studies 

Before an applicant begins testing a compound with potential therapeutic value in humans, the drug candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, and the purity and stability of the drug substance, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the drug for initial testing in humans and to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations. Applicants usually must complete some long-term nonclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the drug in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. Preclinical tests and studies can take several years to complete. 

The IND Process 

An IND is an exemption from the FDCA that allows an unapproved drug to be shipped in interstate commerce for use in an investigational clinical trial and a request for FDA authorization to administer an investigational drug to humans. Such authorization must be secured prior to interstate shipment and administration of any new drug that is not the subject of an approved NDA. In support of a request for an IND, applicants must submit a protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical trials, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. The FDA requires a 30-day waiting period after the filing of each IND before clinical trials may begin. This waiting period is designed to allow the FDA to review the IND to determine whether human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. At any time during this 30-day period, the FDA may raise concerns or questions about the conduct of the trials as outlined in the IND and impose a clinical hold. In this case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can begin. 

Following commencement of a clinical trial under an IND, the FDA may also place a clinical hold or partial clinical hold on that trial. A clinical hold is an order issued by the FDA to the sponsor to delay a proposed clinical investigation or to suspend an ongoing investigation. A partial clinical hold is a delay or suspension of only part of the clinical work requested under the IND. For example, a specific protocol or part of a protocol is not allowed to proceed, while other protocols may do so. No more than 30 days after imposition of a clinical hold or partial clinical hold, the FDA will provide the sponsor a written explanation of the basis for the hold. Following issuance of a clinical hold or partial clinical hold, an investigation may only resume after the FDA has notified the sponsor that the investigation may proceed. The FDA will base that determination on information provided by the sponsor correcting the deficiencies previously cited or otherwise satisfying the FDA that the investigation can proceed. 

A sponsor may choose, but is not required, to conduct a foreign clinical study under an IND. When a foreign clinical study is conducted under an IND, all FDA IND requirements must be met unless waived. When the foreign clinical study is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor must ensure that the study complies with FDA 

&#160; 

certain regulatory requirements in order to use the study as support for an IND or application for marketing approval. Specifically, on April 28, 2008, the FDA amended its regulations governing the acceptance of foreign clinical studies not conducted under an investigational new drug application as support for an IND or a new drug application. The final rule provides that such studies must be conducted in accordance with good clinical practice, or GCP, including review and approval by an independent ethics committee, or IEC, and informed consent from subjects. The GCP requirements in the final rule encompass both ethical and data integrity standards for clinical studies. The FDA&#146;s regulations are intended to help ensure the protection of human subjects enrolled in non-IND foreign clinical studies, as well as the quality and integrity of the resulting data. They further help ensure that non-IND foreign studies are conducted in a manner comparable to that required for IND studies. 

In addition to the foregoing IND requirements, an IRB representing each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must conduct continuing review and reapprove the study at least annually. The IRB must review and approve, among other things, the study protocol and informed consent information to be provided to study subjects. An IRB must operate in compliance with FDA regulations. Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, for public dissemination on its ClinicalTrials.gov website. 

Human Clinical Trials in Support of an NDA 

Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include, among other things, the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing before their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under written study protocols detailing, among other things, the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. 

Human clinical trials are typically conducted in four sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Phase 1. The drug is initially introduced into a small number of healthy human subjects or, in certain indications such as cancer, patients with the target disease or condition (e.g., cancer) and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness and to determine optimal dosage. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Phase 2. The drug is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Phase 3. These clinical trials are commonly referred to as &#147;pivotal&#148; studies, which denotes a study that presents the data that the FDA or other relevant regulatory agency will use to determine whether or not to approve a drug. The drug is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well-controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, identify adverse effects, establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Phase 4. Post-approval studies may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These studies are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. 

Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. In addition, IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA for any of the following: serious and unexpected suspected adverse reactions; findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the drug; and any clinically important increase in the case of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The FDA or the sponsor or the data monitoring committee may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at 

&#160; 

any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution, or an institution it represents, if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB&#146;s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. The FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP and the integrity of the clinical data submitted. 

Concurrent with clinical trials, companies often complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, purity, and potency of the final drug. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 

Review of an NDA by the FDA 

If clinical trials are successful, the next step in the drug development process is the preparation and submission to the FDA of a NDA. The NDA is the vehicle through which drug applicants formally propose that the FDA approve a new drug for marketing and sale in the United States for one or more indications. The NDA must contain a description of the manufacturing process and quality control methods, as well as results of preclinical tests, toxicology studies, clinical trials and proposed labeling, among other things. Every new drug must be the subject of an approved NDA before it may be commercialized in the United States. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs is subject to an application user fee, currently exceeding $2.3 million, and the sponsor of an approved NDA is also subject to annual product and establishment user fees, currently exceeding $114,000 per product and $585,000 per establishment. These fees are typically increased annually. Certain exceptions and waivers are available for some of these fees, such as an exception from the application fee for drugs with orphan designation and a waiver for certain small businesses, an exception from the establishment fee when the establishment does not engage in manufacturing the drug during a particular fiscal year, and an exception from the product fee for a drug that is the same as another drug approved under an abbreviated pathway. 

Following submission of an NDA, the FDA conducts a preliminary review of an NDA generally within 60 calendar days of its receipt and strives to inform the sponsor by the 74th day after the FDA&#146;s receipt of the submission to determine whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA has agreed to specified performance goals in the review process of NDAs. Under that agreement, 90% of applications seeking approval of New Molecular Entities, or NMEs, are meant to be reviewed within ten months from the date on which FDA accepts the NDA for filing, and 90% of applications for NMEs that have been designated for &#147;priority review&#148; are meant to be reviewed within six months of the filing date. For applications seeking approval of drugs that are not NMEs, the ten-month and six-month review periods run from the date that FDA receives the application. The review process and the Prescription Drug User Fee Act goal date may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider new information or clarification provided by the applicant to address an outstanding deficiency identified by the FDA following the original submission. 

Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is or will be manufactured. These pre-approval inspections may cover all facilities associated with an NDA submission, including drug component manufacturing (e.g., active pharmaceutical ingredients), finished drug product manufacturing, and control testing laboratories. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. 

&#160; 

In addition, as a condition of approval, the FDA may require an applicant to develop a REMS. REMS use risk minimization strategies beyond the professional labeling to ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh the potential risks. To determine whether a REMS is needed, the FDA will consider the size of the population likely to use the product, seriousness of the disease, expected benefit of the product, expected duration of treatment, seriousness of known or potential adverse events, and whether the product is a new molecular entity. REMS can include medication guides, physician communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use, or ETASU. ETASU may include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. The FDA may require a REMS before approval or post-approval if it becomes aware of a serious risk associated with use of the product. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of a product. 

The FDA is required to refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee or explain why such referral was not made. Typically, an advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. 

The FDA&#146;s Decision on an NDA 

On the basis of the FDA&#146;s evaluation of the NDA and accompanying information, including the results of the inspection of the manufacturing facilities, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA&#146;s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. 

If the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use for the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess the drug&#146;s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms, including REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-market studies or surveillance programs. After approval, many types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval. 

Fast Track, Breakthrough Therapy and Priority Review Designations 

The FDA is authorized to designate certain products for expedited review if they are intended to address an unmet medical need in the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition. These programs are fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation and priority review designation. 

Specifically, the FDA may designate a product for fast track review if it is intended, whether alone or in combination with one or more other products, for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and it demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for such a disease or condition. For fast track products, sponsors may have greater interactions with the FDA and the FDA may initiate review of sections of a fast track product&#146;s application before the application is complete. This rolling review may be available if the FDA determines, after preliminary evaluation of clinical data submitted by the sponsor, that a fast 

&#160; 

track product may be effective. The sponsor must also provide, and the FDA must approve, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the sponsor must pay applicable user fees. However, the FDA&#146;s time period goal for reviewing a fast track application does not begin until the last section of the application is submitted. In addition, the fast track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process. 

Second, in 2012, Congress enacted the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA. This law established a new regulatory scheme allowing for expedited review of products designated as &#147;breakthrough therapies.&#148; A product may be designated as a breakthrough therapy if it is intended, either alone or in combination with one or more other products, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The FDA may take certain actions with respect to breakthrough therapies, including holding meetings with the sponsor throughout the development process; providing timely advice to the product sponsor regarding development and approval; involving more senior staff in the review process; assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the review team; and taking other steps to design the clinical trials in an efficient manner. 

Third, the FDA may designate a product for priority review if it is a product that treats a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. The FDA determines, on a case-by-case basis, whether the proposed product represents a significant improvement when compared with other available therapies. Significant improvement may be illustrated by evidence of increased effectiveness in the treatment of a condition, elimination or substantial reduction of a treatment-limiting product reaction, documented enhancement of patient compliance that may lead to improvement in serious outcomes, and evidence of safety and effectiveness in a new subpopulation. A priority designation is intended to direct overall attention and resources to the evaluation of such applications, and to shorten the FDA&#146;s goal for taking action on a marketing application from ten months to six months. 

Accelerated Approval Pathway 

The FDA may grant accelerated approval to a product for a serious or life-threatening condition that provides meaningful therapeutic advantage to patients over existing treatments based upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. The FDA may also grant accelerated approval for such a condition when the product has an effect on an intermediate clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality, or IMM, and that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Products granted accelerated approval must meet the same statutory standards for safety and effectiveness as those granted regular approval. 

For the purposes of accelerated approval, a surrogate endpoint is a marker, such as a laboratory measurement, radiographic image, physical sign, or other measure that is thought to predict clinical benefit, but is not itself a measure of clinical benefit. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. An intermediate clinical endpoint is a measurement of a therapeutic effect that is considered reasonably likely to predict the clinical benefit of a product, such as an effect on IMM. The FDA has limited experience with accelerated approvals based on intermediate clinical endpoints, but has indicated that such endpoints generally may support accelerated approval where the therapeutic effect measured by the endpoint is not itself a clinical benefit and basis for regular approval, if there is a basis for concluding that the therapeutic effect is reasonably likely to predict the ultimate clinical benefit of a product. 

The accelerated approval pathway is most often used in settings in which the course of a disease is long and an extended period of time is required to measure the intended clinical benefit of a product, even if the effect on 

&#160; 

the surrogate or intermediate clinical endpoint occurs rapidly. Thus, accelerated approval has been used extensively in the development and approval of products for treatment of a variety of cancers in which the goal of therapy is generally to improve survival or decrease morbidity and the duration of the typical disease course requires lengthy and sometimes large trials to demonstrate a clinical or survival benefit. 

The accelerated approval pathway is usually contingent on a sponsor&#146;s agreement to conduct, in a diligent manner, additional post-approval confirmatory studies to verify and describe the product&#146;s clinical benefit. As a result, a product candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, would allow the FDA to withdraw the product from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for product candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA. 

Post-Approval Requirements 

Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data. 

In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. 

Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, suspension of the approval, or complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. 

The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the 

&#160; 

approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. 

In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, and its implementing regulations, as well as the Drug Supply Chain Security Act, or DSCA, which regulate the distribution and tracing of prescription drugs and prescription drug samples at the federal level, and set minimum standards for the regulation of drug distributors by the states. The PDMA, its implementing regulations and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples, and the DSCA imposes requirements to ensure accountability in distribution and to identify and remove counterfeit and other illegitimate products from the market. 

Abbreviated New Drug Applications for Generic Drugs 

In 1984, with passage of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments to the FDCA, Congress established an abbreviated regulatory scheme authorizing the FDA to approve generic drugs that are shown to contain the same active ingredients as, and to be bioequivalent to, drugs previously approved by the FDA pursuant to NDAs. To obtain approval of a generic drug, an applicant must submit an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, to the agency. An ANDA is a comprehensive submission that contains, among other things, data and information pertaining to the active pharmaceutical ingredient, bioequivalence, drug product formulation, specifications and stability of the generic drug, as well as analytical methods, manufacturing process validation data and quality control procedures. ANDAs are &#147;abbreviated&#148; because they generally do not include preclinical and clinical data to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. Instead, in support of such applications, a generic manufacturer may rely on the preclinical and clinical testing previously conducted for a drug product previously approved under an NDA, known as the reference-listed drug, or RLD. 

Specifically, in order for an ANDA to be approved, the FDA must find that the generic version is identical to the RLD with respect to the active ingredients, the route of administration, the dosage form, the strength of the drug and the conditions of use of the drug. At the same time, the FDA must also determine that the generic drug is &#147;bioequivalent&#148; to the innovator drug. Under the statute, a generic drug is bioequivalent to a RLD if &#147;the rate and extent of absorption of the drug do not show a significant difference from the rate and extent of absorption of the listed drug...&#148; 

Upon approval of an ANDA, the FDA indicates whether the generic product is &#147;therapeutically equivalent&#148; to the RLD in its publication &#147;Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations,&#148; also referred to as the &#147;Orange Book.&#148; Physicians and pharmacists consider a therapeutic equivalent generic drug to be fully substitutable for the RLD. In addition, by operation of certain state laws and numerous health insurance programs, the FDA&#146;s designation of therapeutic equivalence often results in substitution of the generic drug without the knowledge or consent of either the prescribing physician or patient. 

Under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, the FDA may not approve an ANDA until any applicable period of non-patent exclusivity for the RLD has expired. The FDCA provides a period of five years of non-patent data exclusivity for a new drug containing a new chemical entity. For the purposes of this provision, a new chemical entity, or NCE, is a drug that contains no active moiety that has previously been approved by the FDA in any other NDA. An active moiety is the molecule or ion responsible for the physiological or pharmacological action of the drug substance. In cases where such NCE exclusivity has been granted, an ANDA may not be filed with the FDA until the expiration of five years unless the submission is accompanied by a Paragraph IV certification, in which case the applicant may submit its application four years following the original product approval. 

The FDCA also provides for a period of three years of exclusivity if the NDA includes reports of one or more new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies, that were conducted by or for the applicant and are essential to the approval of the application. This three-year exclusivity period often 

&#160; 

protects changes to a previously approved drug product, such as a new dosage form, route of administration, combination or indication. Three-year exclusivity would be available for a drug product that contains a previously approved active moiety, provided the statutory requirement for a new clinical investigation is satisfied. Unlike five-year NCE exclusivity, an award of three-year exclusivity does not block the FDA from accepting ANDAs seeking approval for generic versions of the drug as of the date of approval of the original drug product. The FDA typically makes decisions about awards of data exclusivity shortly before a product is approved. 

505(b)(2) NDAs 

As an alternative path to FDA approval for modifications to formulations or uses of products previously approved by the FDA pursuant to an NDA, an applicant may submit an NDA under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA. Section 505(b)(2) was enacted as part of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments and permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by, or for, the applicant. If the 505(b)(2) applicant can establish that reliance on FDA&#146;s previous findings of safety and effectiveness is scientifically and legally appropriate, it may eliminate the need to conduct certain preclinical or clinical studies of the new product. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional studies or measurements, including clinical trials, to support the change from the previously approved reference drug. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for all, or some, of the label indications for which the reference drug has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the 505(b)(2) applicant. 

Hatch-Waxman Patent Certification and the 30-Month Stay 

Upon approval of an NDA or a supplement thereto, NDA sponsors are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims that cover the applicant&#146;s product or an approved method of using the product. Each of the patents listed by the NDA sponsor is published in the Orange Book. When an ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant files its application with the FDA, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the reference product in the Orange Book, except for patents covering methods of use for which the ANDA applicant is not seeking approval. Specifically, the applicant must certify with respect to each patent that: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; the required patent information has not been filed; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; the listed patent has expired; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by the new product. 

A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product&#146;s listed patents or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents or indicates that it is not seeking approval of a patented method of use, the application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired (other than method of use patents involving indications for which the applicant is not seeking approval). 

If the ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA or the 505(b)(2) application has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days after the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application until the earlier of 30 months after the receipt of the Paragraph IV notice, expiration of the patent, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the applicant. The ANDA or 505(b)(2) application also will not be approved until any applicable non-patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the branded reference drug has expired. 

&#160; 

Pediatric Studies and Exclusivity 

Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, an NDA or supplement thereto must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. With enactment of the Food and Drug Safety and Innovation Act, or the FDASIA, in 2012, sponsors must also submit pediatric study plans prior to the assessment data. Those plans must contain an outline of the proposed pediatric study or studies the applicant plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, any deferral or waiver requests, and any other information required by regulation. The applicant, the FDA, and the FDA&#146;s internal review committee must then review the information submitted, consult with each other, and agree upon a final plan. The FDA or the applicant may request an amendment to the plan at any time. 

The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. Additional requirements and procedures relating to deferral requests and requests for extension of deferrals are contained in FDASIA. Unless and until FDA promulgates a regulation stating otherwise, the pediatric data requirements do not apply to products with orphan designation. 

Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non-patent marketing exclusivity in the United States and, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months of marketing protection to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity, including the non-patent and orphan exclusivity. This six-month exclusivity may be granted if an NDA sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from the FDA for such data. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to the FDA&#146;s request, the additional protection is granted. If reports of requested pediatric studies are submitted to and accepted by the FDA within the statutory time limits, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity or patent protection cover the product are extended by six months. This is not a patent term extension, but it effectively extends the regulatory period during which the FDA cannot approve another application. With regard to patents, the six-month pediatric exclusivity period will not attach to any patents for which an ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant submitted a paragraph IV patent certification, unless the NDA sponsor or patent owner first obtains a court determination that the patent if valid and infringed by the proposed product. 

Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity 

Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a drug product as an &#147;orphan drug&#148; if it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition, generally meaning that it affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more in cases in which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug product available in the United States for treatment of the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. A company must request orphan drug designation before submitting an NDA for the drug and rare disease or condition. If the request is granted, the FDA will disclose the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential use. Orphan drug designation does not shorten the PDUFA goal dates for the regulatory review and approval process, although it does convey certain advantages such as tax benefits and exemption from the PDUFA application fee. 

If a product with orphan designation receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation or for a select indication or use within the rare disease or condition for which it was designated, the product generally will receive orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity means that the FDA may not approve another sponsor&#146;s marketing application for the same drug for the same indication for seven years, except in certain limited circumstances. Orphan exclusivity does not block the approval of a different drug for the same rare disease or condition, nor does it block the approval of the same drug for different indications. If a drug designated as an orphan drug ultimately receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what was designated in its orphan drug application, it may not be entitled to exclusivity. Orphan 

&#160; 

exclusivity will not bar approval of another product under certain circumstances, including if a subsequent product with the same drug for the same indication is shown to be clinically superior to the approved product on the basis of greater efficacy or safety, or providing a major contribution to patient care, or if the company with orphan drug exclusivity is not able to meet market demand. 

Patent Term Restoration and Extension 

A patent claiming a new drug product or its method of use may be eligible for a limited patent term extension, also known as patent term restoration, under the Hatch-Waxman Act, which permits a patent restoration of up to five years for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review. Patent term extension is generally available only for drug products whose active ingredient has not previously been approved by the FDA. The restoration period granted is typically one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the ultimate approval date. Patent term extension cannot be used to extend the remaining term of a patent past a total of 14 years from the product&#146;s approval date. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug product is eligible for the extension, and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent in question. A patent that covers multiple drugs for which approval is sought can only be extended in connection with one of the approvals. The United States PTO reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension in consultation with the FDA. 

Review and Approval of Drugs in Europe and other Foreign Jurisdictions 

In addition to regulations in the United States, a manufacturer is subject to a variety of regulations in foreign jurisdictions to the extent it chooses to sell any drug products in those foreign countries. Even if a manufacturer obtains FDA approval of a product, it must still obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. To obtain regulatory approval of an investigational drug in the European Union (EU), a manufacturer must submit a marketing authorization application, or MAA, to the European Medicines Agency, or EMA. For other countries outside of the European Union, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, clinical trials are to be conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. 

Clinical Trial Approval in the EU 

Pursuant to the currently applicable Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC and the Directive 2005/28/EC on Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, an applicant must obtain approval from the competent national authority of the EU Member State in which the clinical trial is to be conducted. If the clinical trial is conducted in different EU Member States, the competent authorities in each of these EU Member States must provide their approval for the conduct of the clinical trial. Furthermore, the applicant may only start a clinical trial at a specific study site after the competent ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion. 

In April 2014, the EU adopted a new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014, which is set to replace the current Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC. The new Clinical Trials Regulation will be directly applicable to and binding in all 28 EU Member States without the need for any national implementing legislation. The new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 will become applicable no earlier than 28 May 2016. It will overhaul the current system of approvals for clinical trials in the EU. Specifically, the new legislation aims at simplifying and streamlining the approval of clinical trials in the EU. Under the new coordinated procedure for the approval of clinical trials, the sponsor of a clinical trial will be required to submit a single application for approval of a clinical trial to a reporting EU Member State (RMS) through an EU Portal. The submission procedure will be the same irrespective of whether the clinical trial is to be conducted in a single EU Member State or in more than one EU Member State. The Clinical Trials Regulation also aims to streamline and simplify the rules on safety reporting for clinical trials. 

&#160; 

Marketing Authorization 

In the EU, marketing authorizations for medicinal products may be obtained through several different procedures founded on the same basic regulatory process. 

The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all EU Member States. The centralized procedure is compulsory for medicinal products produced by certain biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, and products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases,. It is optional for those products that are highly innovative or for which a centralized process is in the interest of patients. Under the centralized procedure in the EU, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a MAA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human use or CHMP. Accelerated evaluation may be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases. These are defined as circumstances in which a medicinal product is expected to be of a &#147;major public health interest.&#148; Three cumulative criteria must be fulfilled in such circumstances: the seriousness of the disease, such as severely disabling or life-threatening diseases, to be treated; the absence or insufficiency of an appropriate alternative therapeutic approach; and anticipation of high therapeutic benefit. In these circumstances, the EMA ensures that the opinion of the CHMP is given within 150 days. 

The decentralized procedure provides for approval by one or more other concerned EU Member States of an assessment of an application for marketing authorization conducted by one EU Member State, known as the reference EU Member State. In accordance with this procedure, an applicant submits an application for marketing authorization to the reference EU Member State and the concerned EU Member States. This application is identical to the application that would be submitted to the EMA for authorization through the centralized procedure. The reference EU Member State prepares a draft assessment and drafts of the related materials within 120 days after receipt of a valid application. The resulting assessment report is submitted to the concerned EU Member States which, within 90 days of receipt, must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials. If a concerned EU Member State cannot approve the assessment report and related materials due to concerns relating to a potential serious risk to public health, disputed elements may be referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all EU Member States. In accordance with the mutual recognition procedure, the sponsor applies for national marketing authorization in one EU Member State. Upon receipt of this authorization the sponsor can then seek the recognition of this authorization by other EU Member States. Authorization in accordance with either of these procedures will result in authorization of the medicinal product only in the reference EU Member State and in the other concerned EU Member States.. 

A marketing authorization may be granted only to an applicant established in the EU. Regulation No. 1901/2006 provides that, prior to obtaining a marketing authorization in the EU, an applicant must demonstrate compliance with all measures included in a Pediatric Investigation Plan, or PIP, approved by the Pediatric Committee of the EMA, covering all subsets of the pediatric population, unless the EMA has granted a product-specific waiver, class waiver, or a deferral for one or more of the measures included in the PIP. 

Regulatory Data Exclusivity in the European Union 

Innovative medicinal products authorized in the EU on the basis of a full MAA (as opposed to an application for marketing authorization that relies on data available in the marketing authorization dossier for another, previously approved, medicinal product) are entitled to eight years of data exclusivity. During this period, applicants for authorization of generic versions of these innovative products cannot rely on data contained in the marketing authorization dossier submitted for the innovative medicinal product. Innovative medicinal products are also entitled to ten years&#146; of market exclusivity. During this ten year period no generic version of the medicinal product can be placed on the EU market. The overall ten-year period will be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to 

&#160; 

authorization, is held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. Even if a compound is considered to be a new chemical entity so that the innovator gains the prescribed period of data exclusivity, another company may market another version of the product if such company obtained marketing authorization based on an MAA with a complete independent data package of pharmaceutical tests, preclinical tests and clinical trials. 

Periods of Authorization and Renewals in the EU 

A marketing authorization is valid for five years, in principle, and it may be renewed after five years on the basis of a reevaluation of the risk-benefit balance by the EMA or by the competent authority of the relevant EU Member State. To that end, the marketing authorization holder must provide the EMA or the relevant competent authority of the EU Member State with a consolidated version of the file in respect of quality, safety and efficacy, including all variations introduced since the marketing authorization was granted, at least six months before the marketing authorization ceases to be valid. Once renewed, the marketing authorization is valid for an unlimited period, unless the European Commission or the relevant competent authority of the EU Member State decides, on justified grounds relating to pharmacovigilance, to proceed with one additional five-year renewal period. Any marketing authorization that is not followed by the marketing of the medicinal product on the EU market (in the case of the centralized procedure) or on the market of the EU Member State which delivered the marketing authorization within three years after authorization ceases to be valid. 

Regulatory Requirements after Marketing Authorization 

As in the United States, marketing authorization holders and manufacturers of medicinal products are subject to comprehensive regulatory oversight by the EMA and the competent authorities of the individual EU Member States both before and after grant of the manufacturing and marketing authorizations. 

The holder of an EU marketing authorization for a medicinal product must also comply with EU pharmacovigilance legislation and its related regulations and guidelines, which detail requirements for conducting pharmacovigilance or the assessment and monitoring of the safety of medicinal products. These rules can impose on central marketing authorization holders for medicinal products the obligation to conduct a labor intensive collection of data regarding the risks and benefits of marketed products and to engage in ongoing assessments of those risks and benefits, including the possible requirement to conduct additional clinical studies. 

The manufacturing process for medicinal products in the EU is highly regulated and regulators may shut down manufacturing facilities that they believe do not comply with regulations. Manufacturing requires a manufacturing authorization, and the manufacturing authorization holder must comply with various requirements set out in the applicable EU laws, regulations and guidance, including Directive 2001/83/EC, Directive 2003/94/EC, Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and the European Commission Guidelines for Good Manufacturing Practice. These requirements include compliance with EU cGMP standards when manufacturing medicinal products and active pharmaceutical ingredients, including the manufacture of active pharmaceutical ingredients outside of the EU with the intention to import the active pharmaceutical ingredients into the EU. Similarly, the distribution of medicinal products into and within the EU is subject to compliance with the applicable EU laws, regulations and guidelines, including the requirement to hold appropriate authorizations for distribution granted by the competent authorities of the EU Member States. 

In the EU, the advertising and promotion of products are subject to EU Member States&#146; laws governing promotion of medicinal products, interactions with physicians, misleading and comparative advertising and unfair commercial practices. In addition, other legislation adopted by individual EU Member States may apply to the advertising and promotion of medicinal products. These laws require that promotional materials and advertising in relation to medicinal products comply with the product&#146;s Summary of Product Characteristics, or SmPC, as approved by the competent authorities. Promotion of a medicinal product that does not comply with the SmPC is considered to constitute off-label promotion. The off-label promotion of medicinal products is 

&#160; 

prohibited in the EU. The applicable laws at EU level and in the individual EU Member States also prohibit the direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription-only medicinal products. These laws may further limit or restrict the advertising and promotion of products to the general public and may also impose limitations on promotional activities with health care professionals. 

Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity in the EU 

Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 and Regulation (EC) No. 847/2000 provide that a product can be designated as an orphan medicinal product by the European Commission if its sponsor can establish that the product is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of: (1) a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting not more than five in ten thousand persons in the EU when the application is made, or (2) a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition in the EU and that without incentives the medicinal product is unlikely to be developed. For either of these conditions, the applicant must demonstrate that there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition in question that has been authorized in the EU or, if such method exists, the medicinal product will be of significant benefit to those affected by that condition. 

Once authorized, orphan medicinal products are entitled to ten years of market exclusivity in all EU Member States and, in addition, a range of other benefits during the development and regulatory review process, including scientific assistance for study protocols, authorization through the centralized marketing authorization procedure covering all member countries and a reduction or elimination of registration and marketing authorization fees. However, marketing authorization may be granted to a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication during the ten year period with the consent of the marketing authorization holder for the original orphan medicinal product or if the manufacturer of the original orphan medicinal product is unable to supply sufficient quantities. Marketing authorization may also be granted to a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication if the product is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the original orphan medicinal product. The period of market exclusivity may, in addition, be reduced to six years if it can be demonstrated on the basis of available evidence that the original orphan medicinal product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. 

Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement 

In the United States and markets in other countries, patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of products approved by the FDA and other government authorities. Thus, even if a product candidate is approved, sales of the product will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors, including government health programs in the United States such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations, provide coverage, and establish adequate reimbursement levels for, the product. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged, examining the medical necessity, and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services and imposing controls to manage costs. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the approved products for a particular indication. 

In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, a company may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the product, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable marketing approvals. Nonetheless, product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost effective. A decision by a third-party payor not to cover a product candidate could reduce physician utilization once the product is approved and have a material adverse effect on sales, results of operations and financial condition. 

&#160; 

Additionally, a payor&#146;s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor&#146;s determination to provide coverage for a drug product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage and reimbursement for the product, and the level of coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor. 

The containment of healthcare costs also has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. Governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit a company&#146;s revenue generated from the sale of any approved products. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which a company or its collaborators receive marketing approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. 

Outside the United States, ensuring adequate coverage and payment for a product also involves challenges. Pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control in many countries. Pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can extend well beyond the receipt of regulatory marketing approval for a product and may require a clinical trial that compares the cost effectiveness of a product to other available therapies. The conduct of such a clinical trial could be expensive and result in delays in commercialization. 

In the European Union, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular drug candidate to currently available therapies or so called health technology assessments, in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. European Union member states may approve a specific price for a product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the product on the market. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for products, but monitor and control prescription volumes and issue guidance to physicians to limit prescriptions. Recently, many countries in the European Union have increased the amount of discounts required on pharmaceuticals and these efforts could continue as countries attempt to manage healthcare expenditures, especially in light of the severe fiscal and debt crises experienced by many countries in the European Union. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. Political, economic and regulatory developments may further complicate pricing negotiations, and pricing negotiations may continue after reimbursement has been obtained. Reference pricing used by various European Union member states, and parallel trade, i.e., arbitrage between low-priced and high-priced member states, can further reduce prices. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any products, if approved in those countries. 

Healthcare Law and Regulation 

Healthcare providers and third-party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of drug products that are granted marketing approval. Arrangements with providers, consultants, third-party payors and customers are subject to broadly applicable fraud and abuse, anti-kickback, false claims laws, reporting of payments to physicians and teaching physicians and patient privacy laws and regulations and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain business and/or financial arrangements. Restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations, include the following: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, paying, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or 

&#160; 

&#160; indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; the federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, and civil monetary penalties laws, which prohibit individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false, fictitious or fraudulent or knowingly making, using or causing to made or used a false record or statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which created additional federal criminal laws that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, and their respective implementing regulations, including the Final Omnibus Rule published in January 2013, which impose obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; the federal false statements statute, which prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing &#183;or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; the federal transparency requirements known as the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care Education Reconciliation Act, or the Affordable Care Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to report annually to the Centers for Medicare &#38; Medicaid Services, or CMS, within the United States Department of Health and Human Services, information related to payments and other transfers of value made by that entity to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; and 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to healthcare items or services that are reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers. 

Some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry&#146;s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring drug manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other health care providers or marketing expenditures. State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. 

Healthcare Reform 

A primary trend in the United States healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. There have been a number of federal and state proposals during the last few years regarding the pricing of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical products, limiting coverage and reimbursement for drugs and other medical products, government control and other changes to the healthcare system in the United States. 

&#160; 

By way of example, the United States and state governments continue to propose and pass legislation designed to reduce the cost of healthcare. In March 2010, the United States Congress enacted the Affordable Care Act, which, among other things, includes changes to the coverage and payment for products under government health care programs. Among the provisions of the Affordable Care Act of importance to potential drug candidates are: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs, although this fee would not apply to sales of certain products approved exclusively for orphan indications; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to certain individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing a manufacturer&#146;s Medicaid rebate liability; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; expanded manufacturers&#146; rebate liability under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program by increasing the minimum rebate for both branded and generic drugs and revising the definition of &#147;average manufacturer price,&#148; or AMP, for calculating and reporting Medicaid drug rebates on outpatient prescription drug prices and extending rebate liability to prescriptions for individuals enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; addressed a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; expanded the types of entities eligible for the 340B drug discount program; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; established the Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program by requiring manufacturers to provide a 50% point-of-sale-discount off the negotiated price of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period as a condition for the manufacturers&#146; outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; the Independent Payment Advisory Board, or IPAB, which has authority to recommend certain changes to the Medicare program to reduce expenditures by the program that could result in reduced payments for prescription drugs. However, the IPAB implementation has been not been clearly defined. PPACA provided that under certain circumstances, IPAB recommendations will become law unless Congress enacts legislation that will achieve the same or greater Medicare cost savings; and 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; established the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation within CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending. Funding has been allocated to support the mission of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation from 2011 to 2019. 

Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. For example, in August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2012 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation&#146;s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and will remain in effect through 2024 unless additional Congressional action is taken. In January 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. 

&#160; 

There have been, and likely will continue to be, legislative and regulatory proposals at the foreign, federal and state levels directed at broadening the availability of healthcare and containing or lowering the cost of healthcare. Such reforms could have an adverse effect on anticipated revenues from product candidates that we may successfully develop and for which we may obtain marketing approval and may affect overall financial condition and ability to develop product candidates.
