We are differentiated by our comprehensive and unique datasets, our next-generation technology and our analytics and decisioning capabilities, which enable us to deliver insights across the entire consumer lifecycle. We believe we are the largest provider of risk and information solutions in the United States to possess both nationwide consumer credit data and comprehensive, diverse public records data, which allows us to better predict behaviors, assess risk and address a broader set of business issues for our customers. We have deep domain expertise across a number of attractive industries, sometimes referred to as verticals, including financial services, specialized risk, insurance and healthcare. We have a global presence in over 30 countries across North America, Africa, Latin America and Asia. 

Our addressable market includes the big data and analytics market, which continues to grow as companies around the world recognize the benefits of building an analytical enterprise where decisions are made based on data and insights, and as consumers recognize the importance that data and analytics play in their ability to procure goods and services and protect their identities. International Data Corporation ("IDC") estimates worldwide spending on big data and analytics services to be approximately $52 billion in 2014, growing at a projected compounded annual growth rate (&#8220;CAGR&#8221;) of approximately 15% from 2014 through 2018. There are several underlying trends supporting this market growth, including the creation of large amounts of data, advances in technology and analytics that enable data to be processed more quickly and efficiently to provide business insights, and growing demand for these business insights across industries and geographies. Leveraging our 48-year operating history and our established position as a leading provider of risk and information solutions, we have evolved our business by investing in a number of strategic initiatives, such as transitioning to the latest big data and analytics technologies, expanding the breadth and depth of our data, strengthening our analytics capabilities and enhancing our business processes. As a result, we believe we are well positioned to expand our share within the markets we currently serve and capitalize on the larger big data and analytics opportunity. 

We believe that we have the capabilities and assets, including comprehensive and unique datasets, advanced technology and analytics to provide differentiated solutions to our customers. We have over 30 petabytes of data, growing at an average rate of over 25% each year since 2010, representing over one billion consumers globally. We obtain financial, credit, alternative credit, identity, bankruptcy, lien, judgment, insurance claims, automotive and other relevant information from an average of 90,000 data sources, including financial institutions, private databases and public records repositories. We refine, standardize and enhance this data using sophisticated algorithms to create proprietary databases. Our next-generation technology allows us to quickly and efficiently integrate our data with our analytics and decisioning capabilities to create and deliver innovative solutions to our customers and to quickly adapt to changing customer needs. Our deep analytics expertise, which includes our people as well as tools such as predictive modeling and scoring, customer segmentation, benchmarking and forecasting, enables businesses and consumers to gain better insights into their risk and financial data. Our decisioning capabilities, which are generally delivered on a software-as-a-service platform, allow businesses to interpret data and apply their specific qualifying criteria to make decisions and take actions. Collectively, our data, analytics and decisioning capabilities allow businesses to authenticate the identity of 

consumers, effectively determine the most relevant products for consumers, retain and cross-sell to existing consumers, identify and acquire new consumers and reduce loss from fraud. Similarly, our capabilities allow consumers to see how their credit profiles have changed over time, understand the impact of financial decisions on their credit scores, manage their personal information and take precautions against identity theft. 

We leverage our differentiated capabilities in order to serve a broad set of customers across multiple geographies and industry verticals. We have a global customer base of over 65,000 businesses and millions of consumers. We offer our solutions to business customers in financial services, insurance, healthcare and other industries. Our customer base includes many of the largest companies in each of the primary industries we serve. For example, in the United States, we contract with all of the ten largest banks, all of the top five credit card issuers, all of the top twenty-five auto lenders, fourteen of the fifteen auto insurance carriers, thousands of healthcare providers and federal, state and local government agencies. We have been successful in leveraging our brand, our expertise and our solutions in our global operations and have a leading presence in several high-growth international markets, including India, Hong Kong and Africa. 

We believe we have an attractive business model that has highly recurring and diversified revenue streams, low capital requirements, significant operating leverage and strong and stable cash flows. The proprietary and embedded nature of our solutions and the integral role that we play in our customers&#8217; decision-making processes have historically translated into high customer retention and revenue visibility. For example, our top ten financial institution customers have an average tenure of over ten years. We continue to demonstrate organic growth by further penetrating existing customers, innovating new solutions and gaining new customers. We have a diversified portfolio of businesses across our segments, reducing our exposure to cyclical trends in any particular industry or geography. We operate primarily on a contributory data model in which we typically obtain updated information at little or no cost and own most of our data. We augment this data with a growing set of public record and alternative data as we develop new solutions and expand into new industries and geographies. We also directly manage and control our technology, which provides us with an efficient cost structure and allows us to benefit from economies of scale. Additionally, our technology investments enable us to grow and expand our business with low incremental cost, providing significant operating leverage. 

Our total revenues increased from $1,304.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $1,506.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, representing year-over-year growth of 15.5%. Our net income attributable to the Company increased from a loss of $12.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to income of $5.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Our Adjusted EBITDA increased from $454.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $526.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, representing year-over-year growth of 15.9%. As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately $2,208.5 million of total indebtedness. 

Our Evolution 

Our business has a 48-year operating history and a long track record of providing risk and information solutions to businesses and consumers while continuing to innovate to meet their changing needs. Since our founding as a provider of regional credit reporting services, we have built a comprehensive database of U.S. consumers, which created a unique and highly valuable base to build solutions that span many industry verticals and customer processes. From this base, we expanded our operations by targeting new customers, industry verticals and geographies and also entering into the consumer space. We have strengthened our analytics and decisioning capabilities and acquired complementary datasets enabling us to enhance our solutions, diversify our revenue base and expand into high-growth verticals, such as healthcare and insurance. We have grown our global presence to over 30 countries, creating credit reporting agencies in new geographies and establishing strong international footholds from which we could expand into other emerging markets. We also expanded the reach of our consumer solutions by partnering with other market leaders and innovators. 

As part of our continued evolution, we have invested in a number of strategic initiatives that we believe will allow us to cater to the growing demand for data and analytics, provide differentiated solutions and better serve our customers. These initiatives include: 

&#8226; 

Investing in our Technology: Technology is at the core of the solutions we provide to our customers.

Our investment strategy has been to build capabilities and leverage them across multiple geographies and industry verticals. 

&#8226; 

Expanding our Data: We have continued to invest in the breadth and depth of our data. We introduced the concept of trended data to provide the trajectory of a consumer&#8217;s risk profile, used public records data to enhance the scope of business issues we can address and incorporated alternative data into our databases to better assess risk for banked and unbanked consumers. We believe we are the only provider of scale in the United States to possess both nationwide consumer credit data and comprehensive, diverse public records data. All of these initiatives improve the quality of our data, provide deeper insights into risk and allow us to create differentiated solutions for our customers. 

&#8226; 

Strengthening our Analytics Capabilities: We have strengthened our analytics capabilities by leveraging our next-generation technology and expanded data, utilizing more advanced tools and growing our analytics team. This has allowed us to create solutions that produce greater insights and more predictive results, which help our customers make better decisions. In addition, our strengthened analytics capabilities have shortened our time-to-market to create and deliver these solutions to our customers. 

&#8226; 

Broadening our Target Markets: We have grown our target markets by establishing a presence in attractive high-growth international markets such as India and the Philippines, entering new verticals such as government and investigative services in the United States and expanding the reach of our consumer offerings by partnering with traditional and emerging providers in new verticals. Our capabilities enable us to develop scalable products that we are able to deploy across new markets and verticals. 

&#8226; 

Enhancing our Business Processes and Capabilities: We have enhanced our business processes and capabilities to support our growth. We have hired additional industry experts, which has allowed us to create and sell new vertical-specific solutions that address our customers&#8217; needs. Our global sales force effectiveness program reallocates our sales resources more effectively and increases our sales team&#8217;s coverage of customers across our target markets. In conjunction with our other initiatives, we have also recently refreshed our company brand to reinforce our global position as a trusted, consumer-friendly company. 

We believe that our ongoing focus on evolving with the market and with our customers&#8217; needs ensures continued improvement in our overall services to businesses and consumers. Leveraging our trusted brand, global scale and strong market position in the verticals we serve will allow us to capitalize on business opportunities worldwide and contribute to our long-term growth. 

Our Market Opportunity 

We believe there is a long-term trend of businesses and consumers using data and analytics to make more informed decisions and manage risk more effectively, resulting in a large and rapidly growing market. According to a September 2014 report from IDC, spending on business analytics services worldwide is projected to reach approximately $52 billion in 2014 and is projected to grow at a CAGR of approximately 15% from 2014 through 2018. 

&#160;

Numbers have been rounded

We believe there are several key trends in the global macroeconomic environment affecting the geographies and industry verticals we serve that will create increasing demand for our solutions: 

&#8226; 

Rapid Growth in Data Creation and Application: Larger and more diversified datasets are now assembled faster while the breadth of analytical applications and solutions has expanded. Companies are increasingly relying on business analytics and big data technologies to help process this data in a cost-efficient manner. In addition, non-traditional sources of structured and unstructured data have become important in deriving alternative metrics. The proliferation of smartphones and other mobile devices also generates enormous amounts of data tied to consumers, activities and locations. We believe that the demand for targeted data and sophisticated analytical solutions will continue to grow meaningfully as businesses seek real-time access to more granular views of consumer populations and more holistic views on individual consumers. &#32; 

&#8226; 

Advances in Technology and Analytics Unlocking the Value of Data: Ongoing advances in data collection, storage and analytics technology have contributed to the greater use and value of data and analytics in decision making. As businesses have gained the ability to rapidly aggregate and analyze data, they increasingly expect access to real-time data and analytics from their information providers as well as solutions that fully integrate into their workflows. We believe this has made sophisticated technology critical for gaining and retaining business in the risk and information services industry. &#32; 

&#8226; 

Greater Adoption of Big Data Solutions across New and Existing Industry Verticals: With the proliferation of data, we believe companies across new and existing industry verticals recognize the value of risk information and analytical tools, particularly when tailored to their specific needs. 

&#9702; 

Financial Services Industry: The combination of increased regulatory capital, additional compliance costs and the overhang of legacy assets is pushing large segments of small-to-medium-sized business and consumer lending out of the banking sector, and resulting in the creation of new specialty finance companies, such as peer-to-peer lending platforms and online balance sheet lenders, which are actively filling the void. These technology-enabled lending platforms provide access to credit in a fast and efficient manner by utilizing sophisticated risk assessment tools that leverage data, such as behavioral data, transactional data and employment and credit information. At the same time, traditional financial services companies are also increasing the use of applications and data in order to address regulatory requirements, lower operating costs and better serve their customers. 

&#9702; 

Insurance Industry: As consumers increasingly obtain quotes from multiple insurers in an effort to lower their costs, insurers are trying to improve the accuracy of their risk assessments and initial quotes. For example, insurance carriers are using driver violation data to uncover offenses that will impact pricing earlier in the quoting process so consumers have a more accurate view of the premiums they will be charged. 

&#9702; 

Healthcare Industry: Greater patient financial responsibility, focus on cost management and regulatory supervision are driving healthcare providers to use data and related analytics tools to better manage their revenue cycle. For example, to reduce collection risks, healthcare providers seek information about their patients&#8217; insurance coverage and ability to pay at the time of registration. In addition, insurance discovery tools are being utilized to optimize accounts receivable management, maximize collections and minimize uncompensated care 

&#8226; 

Increasing Lending Activity in Emerging International Markets: &#160; As economies in emerging markets continue to develop and mature, we believe there will continue to be favorable socio-economic trends, such as an increase in the size of the middle class and a significant increase in the use of financial services by under-served and under-banked consumers. In addition, credit penetration is relatively low in emerging markets when compared to developed markets. For example, using our database of information compiled from financial institutions as a benchmark of credit activity, we estimate that less than 15% of the adult population in India is currently credit active. Furthermore, the widespread adoption and use of mobile phones in emerging markets have enabled greater levels of financial inclusion and access to banking and credit. We expect the populations in emerging markets to continue to become more credit active, resulting in increased demand for our services. 

&#8226; 

Increased Management and Monitoring of Personal Financial Information and Identity Protection by Consumers: Demand for consumer solutions is rising with higher consumer awareness of the importance and usage 

of their credit information, increased risk of identity theft due to data breaches and more readily available free credit information. The annual growth in the number of consumers subscribing to a credit monitoring or identity protection service has been almost 20% over the last several years. In addition, the proliferation of mobile devices has made data much more accessible, enabling consumers to manage their finances and monitor their information in real-time. We believe these trends will continue to fuel growth for our consumer business.

&#160; Our Competitive Strengths 

Comprehensive and Unique Datasets 

Our long operating history and leadership in the industry have allowed us to build comprehensive and unique data assets that would be difficult for a new market entrant to replicate. We have over 30 petabytes of data, growing at an average rate of over 25% each year since 2010, representing over one billion consumers globally. We obtain financial, credit, alternative credit, identity, bankruptcy, lien, judgment, insurance claims, automotive and other relevant information from an average of 90,000 data sources, including financial institutions, private databases and public records repositories. We refine, standardize and enhance this data using sophisticated algorithms to create proprietary databases. We keep our data current by processing approximately 3.6 billion updates each month, and we continue to identify opportunities to acquire additional data. We believe that our data is unique and differentiates us from our competitors. We own several proprietary datasets such as consumer credit information, driver violation history, healthcare eligibility information, business data and rental payment history. Internationally, our data assets also encompass alternative data, such as the voter registry in India with over 750 million records and the vehicle information database in South Africa with over 18 million vehicle records. We have also acquired public record datasets, which are time consuming and difficult for others to obtain and associate with the correct person. We believe we are the only provider of scale in the United States to possess both nationwide consumer credit data and comprehensive, diverse public records data, which allows us to better predict behaviors, assess risk and address a broader set of business issues for our customers. 

Next-generation Technology 

Our transformation to next-generation technology allows us to continually improve our overall services to businesses and consumers and ensures that we are well positioned to differentiate our datasets and capabilities. We believe that our strategic initiative to build next-generation technology capabilities has resulted in increased throughput, improved data matching, greater efficiency, advanced platform flexibility and lower operating costs. 

&#8226; 

Powerful Big Data Capabilities: Our technology gives us the ability to process, organize and analyze high volumes of data across multiple operating systems, databases and file types as well as to deal with both structured and unstructured data that changes frequently. We process billions of transactions and trillions of data transformations on a daily basis. 

&#8226; 

Enhanced Linking and Matching: Because our data matching technology is able to interrelate data across disparate sources, industries and time periods, we believe that we are able to create differentiated datasets and provide our customers with comprehensive insights that allow them to better evaluate risk. For example, our TLOxp &#32;solution leverages these data matching capabilities across various datasets to identify and investigate relationships among people, assets, locations and businesses, allowing us to offer enhanced due diligence, threat assessment, identity authentication and fraud prevention and detection solutions. 

&#8226; 

Greater Efficiency: From ingestion of data to distribution of analytics and insights, our next-generation technology enables a faster time to market. For example, a portion of our platform now allows for data profiling, cleansing and ingestion of data at least ten times faster and can be done in a self-service approach by non-IT power users, allowing us to significantly reduce overall production times for new products. 

&#8226; 

Advanced Platform Flexibility: Our technology offers a high degree of flexibility, speed and customization of our solutions, via capabilities like graphical development and business rules environments, and allows easy integration with our customers&#8217; workflows. We manage and control our technology instead of outsourcing it, which provides us with the flexibility to prioritize changes and to quickly implement any updates to our applications and solutions. 

&#8226; 

Lower Operating Costs: Our technology investments have lowered our overall cost to maintain and develop our systems, allowing us to redeploy significantly more resources to support revenue generating initiatives, such as vertical expansion and new product development. 

&#160; Sophisticated and Flexible Analytics and Decisioning Capabilities 

We have developed sophisticated and flexible analytics and decisioning capabilities by investing in technology, tools and people. Our technology allows us to quickly build sophisticated analytics and decisioning functionality that caters to our customers&#8217; evolving needs. Our analysts leverage our next-generation technology and data matching capabilities to gain real-time access to our entire dataset across different data sources and run analyses across this data while remaining compliant with permitted data use. Our analysts are typically able to create data samples for model development, model validations and custom analyses in less than one day using self-serve data access. Our analysts are equipped with a diverse modeling and analytical toolkit, such as visualization and machine learning, which allows them to quickly build and deploy these capabilities. For example, our team was able to build a new loan consolidation model in our CreditVision &#32;solution in less than one day using our advanced tools, instead of a typical development time of four to five weeks with legacy tools and technology. We have an experienced analytics team with substantial industry experience, complemented by a deep knowledge of consumer credit data. Our team is highly qualified with advanced degrees or doctorates in statistics, math, finance or engineering, and is instrumental in understanding customer requirements, sourcing raw data and turning that data into solutions that provide insights and decisions to solve our customers&#8217; problems.

We consistently focus on innovation to develop new and enhanced solutions that meet the evolving needs of our customers. We believe our specialized data, analytics and decisioning services and collaborative approach with our customers differentiate us from our competitors. Our solutions are often scalable across different customers, geographies and verticals. Recent examples of our innovative and differentiated solutions include: 

&#8226; 

AdSurety : &#160; AdSurety &#32;is a digital marketing solution that allows our customers to identify an audience across a network of 135 million U.S. consumers, display personalized messages to that audience and measure the effect. The network leverages our offline-to-online matching technology, which increases reach with greater targeting certainty. 

&#8226; 

CreditView : &#160; CreditView &#32;is a first-to-market interactive dashboard that provides consumers with credit education and information in a comprehensive, user-friendly format. Consumers are able to easily see how their credit profiles have changed over time as well as simulate the impact of financial decisions on their credit score. 

&#8226; 

CreditVision : We continue to enhance our credit data by including new data fields, enriching values in existing data fields and expanding account history. Our enhanced credit data has been combined with hundreds of algorithms to produce CreditVision , a market-leading solution that provides greater granularity and evaluates consumer behavior patterns over time. This results in a more predictive view of the consumer, increases the total population of consumers who can effectively be scored and helps consumers gain improved pricing. 

&#8226; 

DecisionEdge : &#160; DecisionEdge &#32;is a software-as-a-service decisioning offering which allows businesses to identify and authenticate customers, interpret data and predictive model results, and apply customer-specific criteria to facilitate real-time, automated decisions at the point of consumer interaction. 

&#8226; 

Insurance Coverage Discovery : For our healthcare customers, we offer the Insurance Coverage Discovery &#32;solution, which enables the discovery of previously unidentified health insurance coverage to help our customers recover uncompensated care costs. Our proprietary technology identifies patient accounts covered by Medicaid, Supplemental Security Income, Medicare and TRICARE as well as commercial insurance benefits at the time of service and monitors an account for up to three years for retroactive eligibility that providers may have missed. 

&#8226; 

SmartMove : &#160; SmartMove &#32;allows independent landlords to screen applicants on a real-time basis by pushing the screening information of the individual renter to the landlord, based on the consent of the renter. The solution is delivered through our mobile channel and through our partners and provides independent landlords with convenient access to the same quality information provided to large property management firms. 

&#8226; 

TLOxp : &#160; TLOxp &#32;leverages our data matching capabilities across thousands of data sources to identify and investigate relationships among specific people, assets, locations and businesses. This allows us to offer enhanced due diligence, threat assessment, identity authentication and fraud prevention and detection solutions and to expand our solutions into new verticals such as government and law enforcement. 

&#160; Deep and Specialized Industry Expertise 

We have deep expertise in a number of attractive industry verticals including financial services, insurance and healthcare. Our expertise has allowed us to develop sophisticated vertical-specific solutions within these targeted industries that play an integral role in our customers&#8217; decision-making processes and are often embedded into their workflows. Our team includes industry experts with significant experience in the verticals that we target and relationships with leading companies in those verticals. We also possess regulatory compliance expertise across the industries that we serve. Together, this provides us with a comprehensive understanding of business trends and insights for customers in these verticals, allowing us to build solutions that cater to these customers&#8217; specific requirements. We have been able to apply our industry knowledge, data assets, technology and analytics capabilities to develop new solutions and revenue opportunities within key verticals. For example, in financial services, our differentiated position allowed us to anticipate the increased demand for alternative consumer lending providers such as peer-to-peer lending platforms, and we created solutions that catered to these emerging providers. In insurance, we partnered with a vehicle history data provider to launch a vehicle history score that helps insurance carriers further segment risk based on the attributes of a specific automobile. In healthcare, we developed a solution that allows healthcare providers to search for additional health insurance coverage and recover additional uncompensated care costs, lowering their overall cost of operation. 

Leading Presence in Attractive International Markets 

We have been operating internationally for over 30 years and have strong global brand recognition. We have strategically targeted attractive markets in both developed and emerging economies and have a diversified global presence in over 30 countries and a leading presence in several attractive international markets across North America, Africa, Latin America and Asia. We have local, senior management in many of our international markets, and we believe this provides us with deeper insights into these markets and stronger relationships with our customers. We have leveraged our brand, operating history, global footprint and technology infrastructure to establish new credit bureaus in several international markets, such as Canada in 1989, India in 2001 and the Philippines in 2011. Once established, our model is to expand the services we offer within these markets and then move into adjacent emerging markets. For example, we have used our operations in Hong Kong to expand into other ASEAN countries, and we have used our operations in South Africa to expand into neighboring African countries. In addition, we have been able to leverage our technology and experience from our U.S. operations to develop and grow our international operations. For example, we have expanded our CreditVision &#32;product into Canada and Hong Kong, expanded our interactive business in Hong Kong and South Africa and implemented DecisionEdge &#32;across more than 600 active solutions in over 10 countries. 

Proven and Experienced Management Team 

Our senior management team has a track record of strong performance and significant expertise in the markets we serve, with an average of over twenty years of industry experience. We continue to attract and retain experienced management talent for our businesses. Our team has deep knowledge of the data and analytics sector and expertise across the various industries that we serve. Our team has overseen our expansion into new industries and geographies while managing ongoing strategic initiatives, including our significant technology investments. As a result of the sustained focus of our management team, we have been successful in consistently driving growth, both organically and through acquiring and integrating businesses. 

Our Growth Strategy 

Enhance Underlying Data, Technology and Analytics Capabilities to Develop Innovative Solutions 

As the demand for big data and analytics solutions grows across industries and geographies, we will continue to expand the scope of our underlying data, improve our tools and technology and enhance our analytics and decisioning capabilities to provide innovative solutions that address this demand. As the needs of businesses and consumers evolve, we plan to continue to help them meet their challenges, which our recent investments in data, technology and analytics enable us to do more quickly and efficiently. For example, we enhanced our solutions with incremental data such as rental trade lines, additional contact data and auto asset data in order to address a broader set of customer requirements. Our recent technology investments have also reduced the time to market for new solutions, in certain instances from several weeks to a few days, which allow us to react quickly to customer requirements. We also intend to continue to take advantage of strategic partnerships to develop innovative services that differentiate us from our competitors. 

Further Penetrate Existing Industry Verticals with Current and New Solutions 

We are a leading provider of risk and information solutions in several industry verticals today, including financial services, insurance and healthcare. We believe there is significant opportunity for further growth within these industries by expanding the number of customers to whom we sell our current solutions as well as by creating innovative new solutions that we can use to grow our presence in these industries. We focus on developing new solutions that address evolving customer needs within our industry 

verticals. For example, in the financial services vertical, we developed CreditVision , which provides customers with a time-based risk trend and increases the total eligible population of consumers. Similarly, in the insurance vertical, we introduced the DriverRisk &#32;solution that integrates with the Drivers History violation database to cost effectively identify drivers with ratable violations, resulting in unique insights into driver risk and reduced costs and higher returns for insurance carriers. In order to more effectively address these opportunities, we have redeployed and reallocated our sales resources to focus either on new customer opportunities or on selling additional services and solutions to existing customers. With our leading market positions, existing strong relationships in financial services, insurance and healthcare verticals and with our consumer partners, we believe we have the opportunity to further penetrate our existing customer base and capture a greater proportion of their spending across the consumer lifecycle. 

Establish Positions in New, Adjacent Industry Verticals 

In addition to increasing penetration in industries where we have a substantial presence, we also intend to create solutions that address customer needs in attractive new industries. Our strategy is to develop new solutions for a specific application, industry vertical or geography and then deploy them to other markets where they may be applicable. We believe that our capabilities allow us to quickly create and deliver solutions to new industries and geographies where information-based analytics and decisioning capabilities are currently underutilized. For example, our strong position in financial services and insurance verticals has allowed us to establish a presence in the healthcare vertical to capitalize on the increasing demand for data and analytics solutions. We have created innovative solutions that automate the insurance and payment processes at the beginning of the revenue cycle, help payers analyze claims-related data, facilitate performance reporting and help patients make informed decisions. Similarly, we are targeting other verticals such as government, rental screening and investigative services, where we see an opportunity to leverage our existing data, analytics and decisioning capabilities. 

Expand our Presence in Attractive International Markets 

We believe international markets present a significant opportunity for growth, as these economies continue to develop and their populations become more credit active. We have significant scale in some of the world&#8217;s fastest growing markets, which positions us well to take advantage of the favorable dynamics in these regions. We leverage solutions developed in the United States and deploy them to international markets, after localizing them to individual market requirements. For example, after launching CreditVision &#32;in the United States, we expanded our offerings with a similar solution in Canada and Hong Kong. In markets where we have established a presence in a particular vertical, we will expand further into adjacent verticals, such as insurance and consumer solutions. We intend to expand into new geographic markets by forming alliances with financial services institutions, industry associations and other local partners, and by pursuing strategic acquisitions. Across all our international expansion initiatives, we will continue to leverage our next-generation technology to drive speed to market, scale and differentiation. 

Continue to Broaden Reach in Consumer Market through Direct and Indirect Channels 

Growth in our consumer business has outpaced the market. We expect this trend to continue, due to a rising consumer appetite for information and increasing demand for our solutions from existing and new partners. We currently serve consumers in the United States directly and through indirect channels. We recognized that more consumers could be reached through multiple channels and business models. Therefore, our strategy is to enable partners by providing them with data and analytics to support their services. Our growth plans focus both on increasing our own member base as well as expanding our reach through partnerships. For our direct consumers, we continually develop new products, features and services. We will also continue to improve the consumer experience with more user-friendly interfaces, better customer service, and education. For partners, we will leverage our flexible model, technology and innovative solutions to grow with new and existing customers and enter new industry verticals. We believe that partnerships not only enable us to build our own business quickly and effectively, but they also expand the market and provide us access to new consumer segments. 

Pursue Strategic Acquisitions 

We will continue to pursue acquisitions to accelerate growth within our existing businesses and diversify into new businesses. We are focused primarily on opportunities that are strategic to us, including opportunities that expand our geographic footprint, increase the breadth and depth of our datasets, enhance our services, provide us with industry expertise in our key verticals or deepen our presence in our international markets. For example, we expanded into new countries such as Brazil and Chile and enhanced our domestic healthcare offerings through various acquisitions. Other recent examples include our December 2013 acquisition of TLO&#8217;s assets, providing data solutions leveraging proprietary public records data for identity authentication, fraud prevention and debt recovery, our November 2014 acquisition of DHI, a provider of traffic violations and criminal court data, our October 2014 acquisition of L2C, an innovator in predictive analytics using alternative data that is able to provide risk perspectives on non-traditional and non-credit active consumers, and our December 2015 acquisition of Trustev, Ltd., a provider of digital verification technology to multiple industries. From time to time, we may also seek to increase our investments in foreign entities in which we have less than a 100% equity interest, as we did with CIBIL in India in 2014 and 2015. We have a strong track record of 

integrating acquisitions and driving long-term value creation, and we will continue to maintain a disciplined approach to pursuing acquisitions. 

Segment Overview 

We manage our business and report our financial results in three operating segments: USIS, International and Consumer Interactive. We also report expenses for Corporate, which provides shared services and conducts enterprise functions. See &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; and note 16 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information about our segments. 

USIS 

USIS provides consumer reports, risk scores, analytical services and decisioning capabilities to businesses. These businesses use our services to acquire new customers, assess consumer ability to pay for services, identify cross-selling opportunities, measure and manage debt portfolio risk, collect debt, verify consumer identities and investigate potential fraud. 

USIS leverages our comprehensive data assets, data matching expertise and predictive analytics to develop and deliver solutions across multiple vertical markets. 

&#8226; 

Comprehensive Data Assets: Our credit database contains the name and address of substantially all of the U.S. credit-active population, a listing of their existing credit relationships and their timeliness in repaying debt obligations. The information in our database is voluntarily provided by thousands of credit-granting institutions and other data furnishers. We enhance our data assets with alternative credit sources such as rental payments and utility payments. We also actively source information from courts, government agencies and other public records including suits, liens, judgments, bankruptcies, professional licenses, real property, vehicle ownership, other assets, driver violations, criminal records and contact information. Our databases are updated, reviewed and monitored on a regular basis.

Our databases are updated, reviewed and monitored on a regular basis. 

&#8226; 

Predictive Analytics: Our predictive analytics capabilities allow us to analyze our proprietary datasets and provide insights to our customers to allow them to drive better business decisions. Our tools allow customers to investigate past behavior, reasonably predict the likelihood of future events and strategize actions based on those predictions. We have numerous tools such as predictive modeling and scoring, customer segmentation, benchmarking, forecasting, fraud modeling and campaign optimization, all of which caters to specific customer requirements. Our predictive analytics capabilities are developed by an analytics team with deep industry experience and a broad array of specialized qualifications. 

&#160; Our core capabilities leverage our next-generation technology, which has a common code base and allows us to build solutions once and deploy them multiple times across different verticals. We use varying combinations of these core capabilities and provide services to our customers through three delivery platforms, which are Online Data Services, Marketing Services and Decision Services. 

Online Data Services 

Online Data Services encompass services delivered in real-time, using both credit and public record datasets. These services include credit reports and predictive scores delivered to qualified businesses to help them assess the risk of prospective consumers seeking to access credit or insurance. We also provide online reports that link public record datasets for qualified businesses that seek to locate consumers or specific assets, or investigate relationships among consumers, businesses and locations. Collectively, the reports, characteristics and scores, with variations tailored for specific industries, form the basis of Online Data Services. We also provide online services to help businesses manage fraud and authenticate a consumer&#8217;s identity when they initiate a new business relationship. Our fraud database, which is updated daily, contains data elements such as addresses and Social Security numbers from multiple sources that alert businesses to identities associated with known or suspected fraudulent activity. 

Additionally, we provide data to businesses to help them satisfy &#8220;know your customer&#8221; compliance requirements and to confirm an individual&#8217;s identity. Revenue from Online Data Services accounted for approximately 66% of our USIS revenue in 2015. 

Marketing Services 

Marketing Services help businesses proactively acquire new customers, cross-sell to existing customers and monitor and manage risk in their existing portfolios. We help our customers develop marketing lists of prospects via direct mail, web and mobile. Our databases are used by our customers to contact individuals to extend firm offers of credit or insurance. We provide portfolio review services, which are periodic reviews of our customers&#8217; existing accounts, to help our customers develop cross-selling offers to their existing customers and monitor and manage risk in their existing consumer portfolios. We also provide trigger services which are daily notifications of changes to a consumer profile. Revenue from Marketing Services accounted for approximately 16% of our USIS revenue in 2015. 

Decision Services 

Decision Services, our software-as-a-service offerings, include a number of platforms that help businesses interpret data and predictive model results and apply their customer-specific criteria to facilitate real-time automated decisions at the time of customer interaction. Our customers use Decision Services to evaluate business risks and opportunities, including those associated with new consumer credit and checking accounts, insurance applications, account collection, patient registrations and apartment rental requests. Revenue from Decision Services accounted for approximately 18% of our USIS revenue in 2015. 

&#160; 

These core capabilities and delivery platforms in our USIS segment allow us to serve a broad set of customers and business issues. We offer our services to customers in the financial services, insurance, healthcare and other industries. In financial services we serve nine of the top ten banks in all facets of the customer lifecycle from acquisition through account management to collections. For example, our customers use our CreditVision &#32;solutions, which is based on 30 months of time series data and delivered across all our platforms, to bring insight to the velocity and magnitude of change in consumer risk over time, allowing them to segment risk with greater precision. We also recently introduced AdSurety &#32;digital marketing capabilities that allow banks to deliver personalized messages on the Internet, increasing reach with measurable results. In insurance, fourteen of the top fifteen auto insurance carriers use TransUnion services to improve the speed and accuracy of quoting and underwriting policies, improving the consumer shopping experience and lowering costs for the carriers. We do this by providing pre-fill services that use our data assets to populate an application once basic identity information is supplied by the consumer, then use our driver violation data, insurance and asset risk scores, and fraud detection tools to provide a quote that is more consistent with the final premium than previous methods used. In healthcare, thousands of healthcare providers and over 1,000 hospitals use our revenue cycle management solutions to verify patients&#8217; identity, check insurance eligibility and the patients&#8217; capacity to pay, estimate patient payment amounts and if needed, qualify patients for federal, state and local entitlement programs. 

International 

The International segment provides services similar to our USIS segment to businesses in select regions outside the United States. Depending on the maturity of the credit economy in each country, services may include credit reports, analytics and decisioning services and other value-added risk management services. In addition, we have insurance, business and automotive databases in select geographies. These services are offered to customers in a number of industries including financial services, insurance, automotive, collections and communications, and are delivered through both direct and indirect channels. The International segment also provides consumer services similar to those offered by our Consumer Interactive segment to help consumers proactively manage their personal finances. The two market groups in the International segment are as follows: 

Developed Markets 

We offer online data services, marketing services and decision services in Canada and Hong Kong. Revenue from these developed markets accounted for approximately 35% of our International revenue in 2015. 

Canada : We have operated in Canada since 1989 and are one of only two nationwide consumer reporting agencies in the Canadian market. We operate across multiple verticals in Canada with leading positions in insurance, collections and automotive and a growing presence in financial services. Our Canadian customer base encompasses some of the largest companies in their verticals, including two of the three largest banks, the top seven credit card issuers, seven of the top ten insurance companies and four of the top automotive manufacturers. We have recently grown our operations in Canada by acquiring new customers and we expect to continue to grow by introducing innovative new solutions, such as CreditVision &#32;and DecisionEdge , by increasing our presence with existing customers and by growing our market share with businesses and consumers. &#32; 

Hong Kong: We have had a majority ownership interest in the principal consumer credit reporting company in Hong Kong since 1998. We are a primary supplier of data and value-added solutions to the top ten banks in Hong Kong. Additionally, we use our established operations in Hong Kong as a base to expand into other emerging markets in the Asia Pacific region. We expect to continue to grow and transform the Hong Kong business by offering analytics, identity management, decisioning and consumer solutions. 

Emerging Markets 

Together with our unconsolidated subsidiaries, we also provide online data services, marketing services and decision services in emerging markets, such as South Africa, Brazil, India and other countries in the Africa, Latin America and Asia Pacific regions. Once credit databases are established in these markets, we can introduce services that have demonstrated success in developed markets. We believe that our flexible approach to forming local partnerships has allowed us to establish a foothold in certain emerging markets where our major competitors have not, such as in India and the Philippines. We also believe that our presence in emerging markets helps foster the growth and development of economies in these markets, thereby resulting in an accelerated demand for credit information services and analytics. Revenue from emerging markets accounted for approximately 65% of our International revenue in 2015. 

Africa: We launched our operations in Africa by entering South Africa in 1993. We are highly diversified and serve a variety of industries through traditional consumer credit reporting services, insurance solutions, auto information solutions, commercial credit information services and consumer solutions in South Africa. We are a primary risk and information solutions provider in South Africa for the top three leading banks, the top ten retailers, the top seven dealer groups and the top five insurers. We manage the database of all personal claims, policy and vehicle information on behalf of the South African Insurance Association and offer innovative solutions throughout the policy lifecycle. Our extensive vehicle information database in South Africa, which has over 18 million vehicle records and includes unique vehicle identifier codes, differentiates us from other providers. Our leading presence in South Africa has allowed us to expand into surrounding countries including Kenya, Namibia, Swaziland, Botswana, Mozambique, Zambia, Rwanda, Malawi and Uganda. We intend to roll out our next-generation technology to our African operations, which will make us the only provider with a big data platform in Africa and will provide us with further competitive advantages. 

Latin America: We have been active in Latin America since 1985 when we entered the Puerto Rican market, and we have operations in several Central and South American countries, including a strong presence in the Dominican Republic and a 26% ownership interest in Trans Union de M&#233;xico, S.A., the primary credit reporting agency in Mexico. In Guatemala, we maintain a centralized database that services Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and Costa Rica. We expanded our footprint in Latin America through our acquisition of majority interests in a Chilean credit reporting agency in 2010 that we subsequently increased to 100%, a Brazilian decisioning services provider in 2011 and a Brazilian data enrichment and registry information services provider in 2013. In Brazil, which is our largest operation in Latin America, we are a leading provider in decisioning with over 100 customers and over 25 million transactions processed monthly across key industry verticals. Our customer base in Brazil includes three of the top four private banks, eighteen of the top twenty automotive insurance carriers, five of the top ten telecommunication companies and the largest Latin America online sales site. One of our differentiated capabilities in Brazil is our &#8220;data driver technology&#8221;, which allows us to access hundreds of public data sources, such as the Receita Federal &#32;(tax record information). We also own ZipCode, which we believe is the most extensive alternative database in Brazil with information on over 190 million consumers and 29 million companies, and is a leading industry data source for collections and marketing. 

India: In 2003, we partnered with prominent Indian financial institutions to create CIBIL, the first consumer and business credit reporting agency in India. In 2014, we acquired a majority interest in CIBIL and further increased our ownership interest in 2015. We now include their results in our consolidated financial statements. We are CIBIL&#8217;s sole technology, analytics and decision services provider for its consumer risk information services business. In the absence of a comprehensive national ID, we created an innovative matching algorithm that allowed us to create the most extensive consumer credit database in India. Our credit database includes information on over 200 million consumers and over 10 million business entities. In addition, we own or have access to several non-credit data sources that we use to enhance our solutions. 

&#160; 

These include the national voters registry with over 750 million records and the national ID database with over 500 million records, as well as other sources such as the confirmed and suspected fraud registry, property registry and tax ID database. We offer a suite of risk and information solutions across the credit lifecycle for banks, telecommunication companies and insurance companies. Our suite of offerings includes analytics and decisioning solutions that enable our customers to make faster decisions. We are the primary risk and information solutions provider for financial institutions in India and our customers include all of the top fifteen private banks. We developed and launched the first generic credit score for India in 2007, which is the most widely used and adopted credit score across the financial services industry in India. In addition to our business solutions, we also offer online credit scores and reports to consumers and are in the process of building additional capabilities in the consumer interactive area. 

Asia Pacific: Our operations in Asia Pacific include markets such Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, China and the Philippines. Asia Pacific is a growing market with increasing demand for credit driven by a rising middle class that offers significant growth potential in analytics and decisioning. Using Hong Kong as a base, we have leveraged our global intellectual property to expand to other countries in the Asia Pacific region. For example, we launched the first consumer credit reporting agency in the Philippines in 2011 in partnership with the top-five credit card issuers in that market. We leverage our global intellectual property to scale very quickly and our solutions are now used for lending decisions by over 25% of the major banks in the Philippines. We have built credit risk scores for the National Credit Bureau of Thailand, in which we have a 12% ownership interest, Credit Bureau of Singapore and Credit Bureau of Malaysia. We also have a presence in China, where we currently provide fraud and authentication solutions to financial institutions. 

Consumer Interactive 

Consumer Interactive offers solutions that help consumers manage their personal finances and take precautions against identity theft. Services in this segment include credit reports and scores, credit monitoring, fraud protection and resolution and financial management. Our products are provided through user friendly online and mobile interfaces and are supported by educational content and customer support. Our Consumer Interactive segment serves consumers through both direct and indirect channels. 

Direct: We provide services directly to consumers, primarily on a subscription basis through websites and mobile applications. Product features include credit reports, credit scores and analysis, alerts to changes in credit information, debt analysis, identity protection services, insurance scores and the ability to restrict third-party access to a consumer&#8217;s TransUnion credit report. We complement these features with educational content that explains how credit and financial data is used in various industries to evaluate consumers and how a consumer&#8217;s financial choices impact this evaluation. Our integrated, data-driven marketing strategy spans multiple channels including television, paid search, online display and email, which allows us to acquire high quality consumers cost effectively. 

Indirect: We also provide our services to business partners who may combine them with their own or other branded services to be offered as a bundle to consumers, governmental agencies and businesses in support of fraud or credit protection, credit monitoring, identity authentication, insurance or credit underwriting and collections. We have a broad suite of products and services that include many of the product features, educational content and customer support offered in our direct channel. We have taken a proactive and flexible partnership approach which has resulted in many long-standing relationships with other market leaders and innovators. Some of these partners are the largest providers of credit information or identity protection services to the U.S. consumer market. Through these partnerships, we have significantly expanded the overall market as well as the reach of our business. 

Corporate 

Corporate provides support services to each operating segment, holds investments and conducts enterprise functions. Certain costs incurred in Corporate that are not directly attributable to one or more of the operating segments remain in Corporate. These costs are primarily enterprise-level costs and are administrative in nature. 

Markets and Customers 

We have a highly diversified customer base, with our largest customer accounting for approximately 2% of revenue in 2015 and 3% of revenue in 2014. Our top ten customers accounted for approximately 14% of revenue in 2015 and 20% of revenue in 2014. Our customers include companies across multiple industries, including financial services, insurance and healthcare. A substantial portion of our revenue is derived from companies in the financial services industry. 

We have a presence in over 30 countries including the United States, South Africa, Brazil, Canada, Hong Kong, India, and other countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America. The following table summarizes our revenue based on the region where the revenue was earned: &#160;

We market our services primarily through our own sales force. We have dedicated sales teams for our largest customers focused by industry group and geography. These dedicated sales teams provide strategic account management and direct support to customers. We use shared sales teams to sell our services to mid-size customers. These sales teams are based in our headquarters office and in field offices strategically located throughout the United States and abroad. Smaller customers&#8217; sales needs are serviced primarily through call centers. We also market our services through indirect channels such as resellers, who sell directly to businesses and consumers. Our interactive direct-to-consumer services are sold primarily through our website. 

Seasonality 

Seasonality in the USIS segment is correlated to volumes of online credit data purchased by our financial services and mortgage customers, and our sales have generally been higher during the second and third quarters. Seasonality in our International segment is driven by local economic conditions and relevant macroeconomic market trends. In our Consumer Interactive segment, demand for our products is usually higher in the first half of the year, impacted by seasonality and our advertising spend. 

Competition 

The market for our services is highly competitive. We primarily compete on the basis of differentiated solutions, datasets, analytics capabilities, ease of integration with our customers&#8217; technology, stability of services, customer relationships, innovation and price. We believe that we compete favorably in each of these categories. Our competitors vary based on the business segment, industry vertical and geographical market that our solutions address. 

In our USIS segment, our competition generally includes Equifax, Experian and LexisNexis, in addition to certain competitors whom we only compete with in specific verticals. For example, we compete with FICO in the financial services vertical, with Solera and Verisk in the insurance vertical, with Emdeon, IMS Health, Inovalon and Trizetto in the healthcare vertical and with LifeLock, Experian and CSIdentity in the fraud solutions market. 

In our International segment, we generally compete with Equifax and Experian directly or indirectly through their subsidiaries or investments. We also compete with other competitors that may focus on a particular vertical, country or region. 

In our Consumer Interactive segment, we generally compete with Equifax, Experian, FICO and LifeLock as well as emerging businesses, some of whom offer free credit information. 

In addition to these competitors, we also compete with a number of other companies that may offer niche solutions catering to more specific customer requirements. 

We believe the services we provide to our customers reflect our understanding of our customers&#8217; businesses, the depth and breadth of our data and the quality of our analytics and decisioning capabilities. By integrating our services into our customers&#8217; workflows, we ensure efficiency, continuous improvement and long-lasting relationships. 

Information Technology 

Technology 

The continuous operation of our information technology systems is fundamental to our business. Our information technology systems collect, refine, access, process, deliver and store the data that is used to provide our solutions. Customers connect to our systems using a number of different technologies, including secured internet connections, virtual private networks and dedicated network connections. Control and management of the technology that operates our business is critical to our success and to this end, we directly control and manage all of our technology and infrastructure. Our technology relies on several third-party best-of-breed solutions as well as proprietary software and tools which we integrate into our platforms. We control our technology and 

infrastructure, which allows us to prioritize any changes and control the roll-out of any upgrades or changes. We contract with various third-party providers to help us maintain and support our systems. 

We have established technology Centers-of-Excellence that utilize similar tools and technology in order to provide scale and efficiency in modifying existing applications and developing new applications for our businesses. We deploy new development methodologies to enable rapid delivery of solutions and increase our speed-to-market. Our technology team includes both our own employees as well as additional resources from third-party providers. 

&#160; 

We believe that our technology is at the core of our innovative solutions, and we have continued to invest in our technology to ensure our market leadership. We have recently made significant investments to transition our technology infrastructure to the latest big data and analytics technologies. We believe that our next-generation platform enables us to be quicker, more efficient and more cost-effective across each step of our process chain, including receiving, consolidating and updating data, implementing analytics and decisioning capabilities, creating innovative solutions, delivering those solutions to our customers and incorporating customer feedback. Our platform has significant scale and capacity and enables us to deliver high-quality solutions to our customers. Our next-generation technology infrastructure gives us the ability to organize and handle high volumes of disparate data, improves our delivery speeds, increases availability and enhances our product development capabilities, while at the same time lowering our overall cost structure. 

Data Centers and Business Continuity 

In order to create redundancy and increase resiliency, we utilize multiple data centers in all of our major markets. We generally employ similar technologies and infrastructures in each data center to enable the optimal sharing of technical resources across geographies. 

We maintain a framework for business continuity that includes written policies requiring each business and operating unit to identify critical functions. Our businesses and operating units have processes in place that are designed to maintain such functions in case there is a disruptive event. We also have a specific disaster recovery plan that will take effect if critical infrastructure or systems fail or become disabled. 

As part of our program, each business unit&#8217;s continuity plan is periodically updated and stored in a centralized database. These plans are monitored and reviewed by our compliance team. From time to time, our compliance team tests one or more of these plans using desktop exercises or in connection with actual events. We also periodically test the state of preparedness of our most critical disaster recovery procedures. We maintain systems redundancy plans for our primary U.S. data centers that allow for the transfer of capacity between geographically disbursed environments in the event there is a failure of computer hardware or a loss of our primary telecommunications lines or power sources, and are designed to recover the majority of our operational capacity in a scenario which makes either of our primary data centers inoperable. 

Security 

The security and protection of non-public consumer information is one of our highest priorities. We have a written information security program based on the ISO/IEC 27001:2013 standard with dedicated personnel charged with overseeing that program. Our information security program incorporates continuous improvement methodology and evaluates threats, industry events and asset values to help us appropriately adjust security controls. We employ a wide range of physical and technical safeguards that are designed to provide security around the collection, storage, use, access and delivery of information we have in our possession. These safeguards include firewalls, intrusion protection and monitoring, anti-virus and malware protection, vulnerability threat analysis, management and testing, advanced persistent threat monitoring, forensic tools, encryption technologies, data transmission standards, contractual provisions, customer credentialing, identity and access management, data loss, access and anomaly reports and training programs for associates. We, with other global financial services organizations, including U.S. nationwide consumer credit reporting companies, share cyber threat and attack information through our participation in the Financial Information Sharing and Analysis Council (&#8220;FS-ISAC&#8221;) and other forums that may be targeted at our industry to better understand and monitor our systems and our connectivity to our customers, as well as how specific solutions that were implemented to protect against such attacks are performing. We undergo SSAE 16 reviews annually, and several of our major customers routinely audit our security controls. We conduct an annual Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS) compliance program and remain PCI certified. Additionally, we also hire third parties to conduct independent information security assessments. 

Intellectual Property and Licensing Agreements 

Our intellectual property is a strategic advantage and protecting it is critical to our business. Because of the importance of our intellectual property, we treat our brand, software, technology, know-how, concepts and databases as proprietary. We attempt to protect our intellectual property rights under the trademark, copyright, patent, trade secret and other intellectual property laws of 

the United States and other countries, as well as through the use of licenses and contractual agreements, such as nondisclosure agreements. While we hold various patents, we do not rely primarily on patents to protect our core intellectual property. Through contractual arrangements, disclosure controls and continual associate training programs, our principal focus is to treat our key proprietary information and databases as trade secrets. Also, we have registered certain trademarks, trade names, service marks, logos, internet URLs and other marks of distinction in the United States and foreign countries, the most important of which is the trademark TransUnion name and logo. This trademark is used in connection with most of the services we sell and we believe it is a known mark in the industry. 

We own proprietary software that we use to maintain our databases and to develop and deliver our services. We develop and maintain business-critical software that transforms data furnished by various sources into databases upon which our services are built. We also develop and maintain software to manage our consumer interactions, including providing disclosures and resolving disputes. In all business segments, we develop and maintain software applications that we use to deliver services to our customers, through a software-as-a-service model. In particular, we develop and maintain decisioning technology infrastructure that we host and integrate into our customers&#8217; workflow systems to improve the efficiency of their operations. 

We license certain data and other intellectual property to other companies on arms-length terms that are designed to protect our rights to our intellectual property. We generally use standard licensing agreements and do not provide our intellectual property to third parties without a nondisclosure and license agreement in place. 

We also license certain intellectual property that is important for our business from third parties. For example, we license credit-scoring algorithms and the right to sell credit scores derived from those algorithms from third parties for a fee. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015, we employed approximately 4,200 employees throughout the world. Other than certain employees in Brazil, none of our employees is currently represented by a labor union or have terms of employment that are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationships with our employees to be good and have not experienced any work stoppages. 

Our History 

TransUnion Corp. was spun-off from its parent, Marmon Holdings, Inc. (&#8220;Marmon&#8221;), in 2005 to the Pritzker family. On June 15, 2010, an affiliate of Madison Dearborn Partners, LLC, on behalf of certain of its investment funds, acquired 51.0% of our outstanding common stock from the Pritzker family and certain employee and director stockholders of TransUnion Corp. On April 30, 2012, TransUnion Corp. was acquired by TransUnion Holding Company, Inc., substantially all the common stock of which was and is owned by the Sponsors, and became TransUnion Holding Company, Inc.&#8217;s wholly-owned subsidiary. On March 26, 2015, TransUnion Holding Company, Inc. was renamed TransUnion and TransUnion Corp. was renamed TransUnion Intermediate Holdings, Inc. On June 30, 2015, we completed the initial public offering of 33,977,273 shares of our common stock, including shares sold to the underwriters pursuant to their over-allotment option, at a public offering price of $22.50 per share. Our stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker "TRU." 

Legal and Regulatory Matters 

Compliance with legal and regulatory requirements is a top priority. Numerous laws govern the collection, protection, dissemination and use of the non-public personal information we have in our possession. These laws are enforced by federal, state and local regulatory agencies, foreign regulatory authorities and, in some instances, through private civil litigation. 

We proactively manage our compliance with laws and regulations through a dedicated legal and compliance team that is generally locally sourced and tasked to ensure that enterprise standards are followed. To that end, we have legal and compliance personnel situated at business operations in the United States, Brazil, Canada, Hong Kong and South Africa. All such personnel report directly to the functional department leaders, who are located in our corporate offices in Chicago, Illinois. Through the legal and compliance functions, we provide training to our associates, monitor all material laws and regulations, establish compliance policies, routinely review internal processes to determine whether business practice changes are warranted, assist in the development of new services, and promote regular meetings with principal regulators and legislators to establish transparency of our operations and create a means to understand and react should any issues arise. In addition, as a controlled financial company of a U.S. bank holding company, we have committed to implement certain compliance programs as directed by that bank holding company pursuant to the Amended and Restated Major Stockholders&#8217; Agreement (as later defined) entered into by the Company and our principal shareholders. 

U.S. Data and Privacy Protection 

Our U.S. operations are subject to numerous laws that regulate privacy, data security and the use of consumer credit or an individual&#8217;s healthcare information. Certain of these laws provide for civil and criminal penalties for the unauthorized release of, or access to, this protected information. The laws and regulations that affect our U.S. business include, but are not limited to, the following: 

&#8226; 

FCRA : FCRA applies to consumer credit reporting agencies, including us, as well as data furnishers and users of consumer reports. FCRA promotes the accuracy, fairness and privacy of information in the files of consumer reporting agencies that engage in the practice of assembling or evaluating information relating to consumers for certain specified purposes. FCRA limits what information may be reported by consumer reporting agencies, limits the distribution and use of consumer reports, establishes consumer rights to access and dispute their own credit files, requires consumer reporting agencies to make available to consumers a free annual credit report and imposes many other requirements on consumer reporting agencies, data furnishers and users of consumer report information. Violation of FCRA can result in civil and criminal penalties. The law contains an attorney fee shifting provision to provide an incentive to consumers to bring individual or class action lawsuits against a consumer reporting agency for violations of FCRA. Regulatory enforcement of FCRA is under the purview of the FTC, the CFPB and state attorneys general, acting alone or in concert with one another. 

&#8226; 

State Fair Credit Reporting Acts : Many states have enacted laws with requirements similar to FCRA. Some of these state laws impose additional, or more stringent, requirements than FCRA. FCRA preempts some of these state laws but the scope of preemption continues to be defined by the courts. 

&#8226; 

The Dodd-Frank Act : A central purpose of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (&#8220;Dodd-Frank Act&#8221;) is to protect consumers from abusive financial services practices, and for other purposes.&#8221; An important new regulatory body created by Title X of the Dodd-Frank Act is the CFPB. The CFPB, through rulemaking, confirmed that the Company is subject to the examination and supervision of the CFPB, and such examinations began in 2012. In addition to transferring authority under certain existing laws to the CFPB and providing it with examination and supervisory authority, the Dodd-Frank Act also prohibits unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices (&#8220;UDAAP&#8221;) with respect to consumer financial products and provides the CFPB with authority to enforce those provisions. The CFPB has stated that its UDAAP authority may allow it to find statutory violations even where a specific regulation does not prohibit the relevant conduct. 

&#8226; 

State unfair practices acts : Many state have enacted statutes that prohibit unfair and deceptive marketing acts and practices within the state. The Company and others in the industry may be subject to these acts with respect to the marketing of consumer credit information products. 

&#8226; 

GLBA : The GLBA regulates the receipt, use and disclosure of non-public personal information of consumers that is held by financial institutions, including us. Several of our datasets are subject to GLBA provisions, including limitations on the use or disclosure of the underlying data and rules relating to the technological, physical and administrative safeguarding of non-public personal information. Violation of the GLBA can result in civil and criminal liability. Regulatory enforcement of the GLBA is under the purview of the FTC, the federal prudential banking regulators, the SEC and state attorneys general, acting alone or in concert with each other. 

&#8226; 

DPPA : The DPPA requires all states to safeguard certain personal information included in licensed drivers&#8217; motor vehicle records from improper use or disclosure. Protected information includes the driver&#8217;s name, address, phone number, Social Security Number, driver identification number, photograph, height, weight, gender, age, certain medical or disability information and, in some states, fingerprints, but does not include information on vehicular accidents, driving violations and driver&#8217;s status. The DPPA limits the use of this information sourced from State departments of motor vehicles to certain specified purposes, and does not apply if a driver has consented to the release of their data. The DPPA imposes criminal fines for non-compliance and grants individuals a private right of action, including actual and punitive damages and attorneys&#8217; fees. The DPPA provides a federal baseline of protections for individuals, and is only partially preemptive, meaning that except in a few narrow circumstances, state legislatures may pass laws to supplement the protections made by the DPPA. Many States are more restrictive than the federal law. 

&#8226; 

Data security breach laws : Most states have adopted data security breach laws that require notice be given to affected consumers in the event of a breach of personal information, and in some cases the provision of additional benefits such as free credit monitoring to affected individuals. Some of these laws require additional data protection measures over and above the GLBA data safeguarding requirements. If data within our system is compromised by a breach, we may be subject to provisions of various state security breach laws. 

&#8226; 

Identity theft laws : In order to help reduce the incidence of identity theft, most states and the District of Columbia have passed laws that give consumers the right to place a security freeze on their credit reports to prevent others from opening new accounts or obtaining new credit in their name. Generally, these state laws require us to respond to requests for a 

freeze within a certain period of time, to send certain notices or confirmations to consumers in connection with a security freeze and to unfreeze files upon request within a specified time period. 

&#8226; 

FTC Act : The FTC Act prohibits unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices. We must comply with the FTC Act when we market our services, such as consumer credit monitoring services through our Consumer Interactive segment. The security measures we employ to safeguard the personal data of consumers could also be subject to the FTC Act, and failure to safeguard data adequately may subject us to regulatory scrutiny or enforcement action. There is no private right of action under the FTC Act. 

&#8226; 

&#160; The Credit Repair Organizations Act (&#8220;CROA&#8221;) : CROA regulates companies that claim to be able to assist consumers in improving their credit standing. Some courts have applied CROA to credit monitoring services offered by consumer reporting agencies and others. CROA allows for a private right of action and permits consumers to recover all money paid for alleged &#8220;credit repair&#8221; services in the event of violation. We, and others in our industry, have settled purported consumer class actions alleging violations of CROA without admitting or denying liability. 

&#8226; 

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (&#8220;HIPAA&#8221;) and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (&#8220;HITECH&#8221;) : HIPAA and HITECH require companies to implement reasonable safeguards to prevent intentional or unintentional misuse or wrongful disclosure of protected health information. In connection with receiving data from and providing services to healthcare providers, we may handle data subject to HIPAA and HITECH requirements. We obtain protected health information from healthcare providers and payers of healthcare claims that are subject to the privacy, security and transactional requirements imposed by HIPAA. We are frequently required to secure HIPAA-compliant &#8220;business associate&#8221; agreements with the providers and payers who supply data to us. As a business associate, we are obligated to limit our use and disclosure of health-related data to certain statutorily permitted purposes, HIPAA regulations, as outlined in our business associate agreements, and to preserve the confidentiality, integrity and availability of this data. HIPAA and HITECH also require, in certain circumstances, the reporting of breaches of protected health information to affected individuals and to the United States Department of Health and Human Services. A violation of any of the terms of a business associate agreement or noncompliance with HIPAA or HITECH data privacy or security requirements could result in administrative enforcement action and/or imposition of statutory penalties by the United States Department of Health and Human Services or a state Attorney General. HIPAA and HITECH requirements supplement but do not preempt state laws regulating the use and disclosure of health-related information; state law remedies, which can include a private right of action, remain available to individuals affected by an impermissible use or disclosure of health-related data. 

We are also subject to federal and state laws that are generally applicable to any U.S. business with national or international operations, such as antitrust laws, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, state unfair or deceptive practices act and various employment laws. We continuously monitor federal and state legislative and regulatory activities that involve credit reporting, data privacy and security to identify issues in order to remain in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. 

International Data and Privacy Protection 

We are subject to data protection, privacy and consumer credit laws and regulations in the foreign countries where we conduct business. These laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, the following: 

&#8226; 

South Africa: National Credit Act of 2005 (the &#8220;NCA&#8221;) - The NCA and its implementing regulations govern credit bureaus and consumer credit information. The NCA sets standards for filing, retaining and reporting consumer credit information. The Act also defines consumers&#8217; rights with respect to accessing their own information and addresses the process for disputing information in a credit file. The NCA is enforced by The National Credit Regulator who has authority to supervise and examine credit bureaus. 

&#8226; 

Canada: Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act of 2000 (&#8220;PIPEDA&#8221;) - The PIPEDA and substantially similar provincial laws govern how private sector organizations collect, use and disclose personal information in the course of commercial activities. The PIPEDA gives individuals the right to access and request correction of their personal information collected by such organizations. The PIPEDA requires compliance with the Canadian Standard Association Model Code for the Protection of Personal Information. Most Canadian provinces also have laws dealing with consumer reporting. These laws typically impose an obligation on credit reporting agencies to have reasonable processes in place to maintain the accuracy of the information, place limits on the disclosure of the information and give consumers the right to have access to, and challenge the accuracy of, the information. 

&#8226; 

India: Credit Information Companies Regulation Act of 2005 (&#8220;CICRA&#8221;) - The CICRA requires entities that collect and maintain personal credit information to ensure that it is complete, accurate and protected. Entities must adopt certain privacy principles in relation to collecting, processing, preserving, sharing and using credit information. In addition, India 

has privacy legislation that would allow individuals to sue for damages in the case of a data breach, if the entity negligently failed to implement &#8220;reasonable security practices and procedures&#8221; to protect personal data. 

&#8226; 

Hong Kong: Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance (&#8220;PDPO&#8221;) and The Code of Practice on Consumer Credit Data (&#8220;COPCCD&#8221;) - The PDPO and the COPCCD regulate the operation of consumer credit reference agencies. They prescribe the methods and security controls under which credit providers and credit reference agencies may collect, access and manage credit data. In April 2011, the COPCCD was amended to permit credit providers to share limited positive mortgage payment data. In June 2012, the PDPO was amended to increase penalties and create criminal liabilities for repeat contravention of PDPO under which enforcement notices have been served. 

We are also subject to various laws and regulations generally applicable to all businesses in the other countries where we operate.
