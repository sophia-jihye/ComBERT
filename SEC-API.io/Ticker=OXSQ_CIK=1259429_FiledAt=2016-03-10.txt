 Item 1. Business TICC Capital Corp. (&#147;TICC,&#148; &#147;Company,&#148; &#147;we,&#148; &#147;us,&#148; or &#147;our&#148;) is a closed-end, non-diversified management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a business development company (&#147;BDC&#148;) under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the &#147;1940 Act&#148;). Our investment objective is to maximize our portfolio&#146;s total return. Our primary focus is to seek current income by investing primarily in corporate debt securities. Our debt investments may include bilateral loans (loans where we hold the entirety of a particular loan) and syndicated loans (those where multiple investors hold portions of that loan). We have and may continue to invest in structured finance investments, including collateralized loan obligation (&#147;CLO&#148;) investment vehicles that own debt securities. CLO investments may also include warehouse facilities, which are financing structures intended to aggregate loans that may be used to form the basis of a CLO vehicle. We may also invest in publicly traded debt and/or equity securities. As a BDC, we may not acquire any asset other than &#147;qualifying assets&#148; unless, at the time we make the acquisition, the value of our qualifying assets represents at least 70% of the value of our total assets. 

Our capital is generally used by corporate borrowers to finance organic growth, acquisitions, recapitalizations and working capital. Our investment decisions are based on extensive analysis of potential portfolio companies&#146; business operations supported by an in-depth understanding of the quality of their recurring revenues and cash flow, variability of costs and the inherent value of their assets, including proprietary intangible assets and intellectual property. In making our CLO investments, we consider the indenture structure for that vehicle, its operating characteristics and compliance with its various indenture provisions, as well as its corporate loan-based collateral pool. 

We generally expect to invest between $5.0 million and $50.0 million in each of our portfolio investments, although this investment size may vary as the size of our capital base changes and market conditions warrant, and to accrue interest at fixed or variable rates. We expect that our investment portfolio will be diversified among a large number of investments with few investments, if any, exceeding 5% of the total portfolio. 

The structures of our investments will vary and we seek invest across a wide range of different industries. We seek to invest in entities that, as a general matter, have been operating for at least one year prior to the date of our investment and that will, at the time of our investment, have employees and revenues, and which are cash flow positive. Many of these companies are expected to have financial backing provided by other financial or strategic sponsors at the time we make an investment. The portfolio companies in which we invest, however, will generally be considered below investment grade, and their debt securities may in turn be referred to as &#147;junk.&#148; A portion of our investment portfolio may consist of debt investments for which issuers are not required to make significant principal payments until the maturity of the senior loans, which could result in a substantial loss to us if such issuers are unable to refinance or repay their debt at maturity. In addition, many of the debt securities we hold typically contain interest reset provisions that may make it more difficult for a borrower to repay the loan, heightening the risk that we may lose all or part of our investment. 

We also purchase portions of equity and junior debt tranches of CLO vehicles. Substantially all of the CLO vehicles in which we may invest would be deemed to be investment companies under the 1940 Act but for the exceptions set forth in section 3(c)(1) or section 3(c)(7). Structurally, CLO vehicles are entities that are formed to originate and manage a portfolio of loans. The loans within the CLO vehicle are limited to loans which meet established credit criteria and are subject to concentration limitations in order to limit a CLO vehicle&#146;s exposure to a single credit. A CLO vehicle is formed by raising various classes or &#147;tranches&#148; of debt (with the most senior tranches being rated &#147;AAA&#148; to the most junior tranches typically being rated &#147;BB&#148; or &#147;B&#148;) and equity. The CLO vehicles which we focus on are collateralized primarily by senior secured loans made to companies whose debt is unrated or is rated below investment grade, and generally have very little or no direct exposure to real estate, mortgage loans or to pools of consumer-based debt, such as credit card receivables or auto loans. Our investment strategy may also include warehouse facilities, which are financing structures intended to aggregate loans that may be used to form the basis of a CLO vehicle. 

&#160;

&#160;

We have historically borrowed funds to make investments and may continue to do so. As a result, we are exposed to the risks of leverage, which may be considered a speculative investment technique. Borrowings, also known as leverage, magnify the potential for gain and loss on amounts invested and therefore increase the risks associated with investing in our securities. In addition, the costs associated with our borrowings, including any increase in the management fee payable to our investment adviser, TICC Management, LLC (&#147;TICC Management&#148;), will be borne by our common stockholders. 

Securitization Vehicle On August 23, 2012, the Company completed a $160.0 million debt securitization financing transaction, consisting of $120.0 million in secured notes and $40.0 million of subordinated notes. The secured and subordinated notes were issued by TICC CLO 2012-1 LLC (&#147;2012 Securitization Issuer&#148; or &#147;TICC CLO 2012-1&#148;), which is a special purpose vehicle that is a wholly-owned subsidiary of TICC. TICC presently owns all of the subordinated notes (the &#147;2012 Subordinated Notes&#148;) issued in the CLO transaction. On February 25, 2013 and May 28, 2013, TICC CLO 2012-1 LLC issued additional secured notes totaling an aggregate of $120.0 million and subordinated notes totaling an aggregate of $40.0 million, which subordinated notes were purchased by the Company, under the &#147;accordion&#148; feature of the debt securitization which allowed, under certain circumstances and subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, for an increase in the amount of secured and subordinated notes. It is not necessary that the Company own all or any of the notes permitted by this feature, which may affect the accounting treatment of the debt securitization financing transaction. 

As of December 31, 2015 the secured notes of the 2012 Securitization Issuer have an aggregate face amount of $240.0 million and were issued in four classes. The class A-1 notes have a current face amount of $176.0 million, are rated AAA(sf)/Aaa(sf) by S&#38;P and Moody&#146;s, respectively, and bear interest at three-month LIBOR plus 1.75%. The class B-1 notes have a current face amount of $20.0 million, are rated AA(sf)/Aa1(sf) by S&#38;P and Moody&#146;s, respectively, and bear interest at three-month LIBOR plus 3.50%. The class C-1 notes have a current initial face amount of $23.0 million, are rated A(sf)/A1(sf) by S&#38;P and Moody&#146;s, respectively, and bear interest at three-month LIBOR plus 4.75%. The class D-1 notes have a current face amount of $21.0 million, are rated BBB(sf)/Baa1(sf) by S&#38;P and Moody&#146;s, respectively, and bear interest at three-month LIBOR plus 5.75%. The LIBOR rate which is the basis of the total interest rate on the secured notes that were issued by the 2012 Securitization Issuer was measured on a six-month basis until February 2013. The secured notes of the 2012 Securitization Issuer have a stated maturity date of August 25, 2023 and are subject to a two year non-call period, during which the notes may not be repaid. This CLO has a four year reinvestment period, during which the proceeds from the repayment of its underlying investments may be reinvested in new portfolio securities. 

The 2012 Securitization Issuer was formed to provide us with access to additional capital for investment by permitting us to issue debt securities to securitize a portion of our existing portfolio investments, selected by us, that were originated using our typical investment process. The debt securities were issued by the 2012 Securitization Issuer in connection with its formation in a private placement transaction exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the &#147;1933 Act&#148;). In addition, because the 2012 Securitization Issuer is a consolidated subsidiary, we did not recognize any gain or loss on the transfer of any of our portfolio assets to it. However, while not expressly named, TICC Management, our investment adviser, and BDC Partners, LLC (&#147;BDC Partners&#148;), our administrator, may be entitled to indemnification under certain agreements we entered into to serve as collateral manager for the 2012 Securitization Issuer as a result of their affiliation with us. Although we have no present plans to do so, we may elect to securitize additional portfolio investments in the future. 

Convertible Notes On September 26, 2012, we completed a private placement of 5-year unsecured 7.50% Senior Convertible Notes Due 2017 (the &#147;Convertible Notes&#148;). A total of $105.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Convertible Notes were issued at the closing. An additional $10.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Convertible Notes were issued on October 22, 2012 pursuant to the exercise of the initial purchasers&#146; option to purchase additional Convertible Notes. The Convertible Notes are convertible into shares of our common stock based on an initial conversion rate of 87.2448 shares of our common stock per $1,000 

&#160;

&#160;

principal amount of Convertible Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $11.46 per share of common stock. The conversion price for the Convertible Notes will be reduced for quarterly cash dividends paid to common shares to the extent that the quarterly dividend exceeds $0.29 cents per share, subject to adjustment. The Convertible Notes mature on November 1, 2017, unless previously converted in accordance with their terms. The Company does not have the right to redeem the Convertible notes prior to maturity. The Convertible Notes are our general unsecured obligations, rank equally in right of payment with our future senior unsecured debt, and rank senior in right of payment to any potential subordinated debt, should any be issued in the future. 

Credit Facility TICC Funding LLC (&#147;TICC Funding&#148;), a special purpose vehicle and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, which previously entered into a revolving credit facility (the &#147;Facility) with Citibank, N.A., had repaid in full its $150.0 million of outstanding borrowing under the Facility and had unilaterally terminated the Facility as of December 31, 2015 in accordance with its terms. The Facility had been scheduled to mature on October 27, 2017. 

Pricing under the Facility was based on the London interbank offered rate (&#147;LIBOR&#148;) for an interest period equal to three months plus a spread of 1.50% per annum and was secured by a pool of loans initially consisting of loans sold by TICC CLO LLC to TICC Funding, loans sold and contributed by the Company to TICC Funding, and loans purchased by TICC Funding from unaffiliated third parties. The Company was the collateral manager of the loans owned by TICC Funding, and retained the residual economic interest through its ownership of TICC Funding. 

Organizational and Regulatory Structure Our investment activities are managed by TICC Management. TICC Management is an investment adviser registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the &#147;Advisers Act&#148;). TICC Management is owned by BDC Partners, its managing member, and Charles M. Royce (directly or indirectly), a member of our Board of Directors who holds a minority, non-controlling interest in TICC Management. Jonathan H. Cohen, our Chief Executive Officer, and Saul B. Rosenthal, our President and Chief Operating Officer, directly or indirectly, own or control all of the outstanding equity interests of BDC Partners. Under our investment advisory agreement with TICC Management (the &#147;Investment Advisory Agreement&#148;), we have agreed to pay TICC Management an annual base management fee based on our gross assets as well as an incentive fee based on our performance. 

We were founded in July 2003 and completed an initial public offering of shares of our common stock in November 2003. We are a Maryland corporation and a closed-end, non-diversified management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. As a BDC, we are required to meet certain regulatory tests, including the requirement to invest at least 70% of our total assets in eligible portfolio companies. In addition, we have elected to be treated for federal income tax purposes as a regulated investment company (&#147;RIC&#148;) under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#147;Code&#148;). 

Each of TICC CLO 2012-1 and TICC Funding are consolidated subsidiaries of TICC. The Company consolidates the results of its wholly-owned subsidiaries in its consolidated financial statements as the subsidiaries are operated solely for investment activities of the Company, and the Company has substantial equity at risk. The creditors of TICC CLO 2012-1 and TICC Funding have received security interests in the assets owned by TICC CLO 2012-1 and TICC Funding, respectively, and such assets are not intended to be available to the creditors of TICC (or any other affiliate of TICC).

MARKET OPPORTUNITY Over the past several years, the market for CLO, debt and credit-related investments has become more competitive and yields have generally decreased. However, during the second half of 2015 price declines persisted in the CLO and syndicated corporate loan market resulting in higher yields. The continued weakness across the commodities sector coupled with credit issues in other sectors continued to weigh on market sentiment. Against this backdrop, we continued to see a meaningful bifurcation in the loan market as stressed names, particularly in the oil and gas sector, fell further as oil prices continued to fall during the quarter ending in December 2015. We believe that the continued dislocation in the CLO and syndicated corporate loan market presents us with a more compelling investment opportunity set, especially if market prices continue to decrease. 

The syndicated leveraged corporate loan market is relatively large and remains largely inaccessible, on a direct basis, to a significant portion of investors that are not lenders or approved institutions. The CLO market also permits exposure to syndicated senior loans, but this market is almost exclusively private and predominantly institutional. 

&#160;

&#160;

The senior loan market is characterized by various factors, including:

&#149; Seniority. A senior loan typically ranks senior in a company&#146;s capital structure to all other forms of debt or equity. As such, that loan maintains the senior-most claim on the company&#146;s assets and cash flow, and, we believe should, all other things being equal, offer the prospect of a relatively more stable and lower-risk holding. &#149; Floating rate instruments. A senior loan typically contains a floating versus a fixed interest rate, which we believe provides some measure of protection against the risk of interest rate fluctuation. &#149; Frequency of interest payments. A senior loan typically provides for scheduled interest payments no less frequently than quarterly. In the current environment, we believe the above attributes seem particularly desirable. 

COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES We believe that we are well positioned to provide financing to corporate borrowers and structured finance vehicles that, in turn, provide capital to corporate borrowers for the following reasons:

&#149; Expertise in credit analysis and monitoring investments; and &#149; Established transaction sourcing network. Expertise in credit analysis and monitoring investments While our investment focus is on middle-market companies, we have invested, and in the future will likely continue to invest, in larger and smaller companies and in other investment structures on an opportunistic basis including CLO investment vehicles. We believe our experience in analyzing middle-market companies and CLO investment structures, as detailed in the biographies of TICC Management&#146;s senior investment professionals, affords us a sustainable competitive advantage over lenders with limited experience in investing in these markets. In particular, we have expertise in evaluating the investment merits of middle-market companies as well as the structural features of CLO investments, and monitoring the credit risk of such investments after closing until full repayment.

INVESTMENT PROCESS Identification We identify opportunities in the CLO market through our network of brokers, dealers, agent banks, collateral mangers and sponsors that we have worked with for several years. The CLO vehicles which we focus on are collateralized primarily by senior secured loans made to companies whose debt is unrated or is rated below investment grade, and generally have very little or no direct exposure to real estate, mortgage loans or to pools of consumer-based debt, such as credit card receivables or auto loans. 

We identify and source new prospective corporate debt investments through a network of funds, investment banks, accounting and law firms and direct company relationships. We have identified several criteria that we believe are important in seeking our investment objective. These criteria provide general guidelines for our investment decisions; however, we do not require each prospective investment to meet all or any specific number of these criteria.

&#149; Experienced management . We generally require that our portfolio companies have an experienced management team. We also prefer the portfolio companies to have in place proper incentives to induce management to succeed and to act in concert with our interests as investors, including having significant equity interests. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#149; Significant financial or strategic sponsor and/or strategic partner . We prefer to invest in companies in which established private equity or venture capital funds or other financial or strategic sponsors have previously invested and are willing to make an ongoing contribution to the management of the business, including participation as board members or as business advisers. &#149; Strong competitive position in industry . We seek to invest in companies that have developed a competitive position within their respective sector or niche of a specific industry. &#149; Profitable on a cash flow basis . We focus on companies that are profitable or nearly profitable on an operating cash flow basis. Typically, we would not expect to invest in start-up companies. &#149; Clearly defined exit strategy . Prior to making a direct corporate equity investment and/or an investment in a debt security that is accompanied by an equity-based security in a portfolio company, we analyze the potential for that company to increase the liquidity of its common equity through a future event that would enable us to realize appreciation, if any, in the value of our equity interest. Liquidity events may include an initial public offering, a merger or an acquisition of the company, a private sale of our equity interest to a third party, or a purchase of our equity position by the company or one of its stockholders. &#149; Liquidation value of assets . Although we do not operate as an asset-based lender, the prospective liquidation value of the assets, if any, collateralizing the debt securities that we hold is a consideration in our credit analysis. We consider both tangible assets, such as accounts receivable, inventory and equipment, and intangible assets, such as intellectual property, software code, customer lists, networks and databases. Due diligence Our due diligence process generally includes some or all of the following elements: 

Corporate Loans Management team and financial sponsor &#149; management assessment including a review of management&#146;s track record with respect to product development, sales and marketing, mergers and acquisitions, alliances, collaborations, research and development outsourcing and other strategic activities; and &#149; financial sponsor reputation, track record, experience and knowledge (where a financial sponsor is present in a transaction). Business &#149; industry and competitive analysis; &#149; customer and vendor interviews to assess both business prospects and standard practices of the company; &#149; assessment of likely exit strategies; and &#149; potential regulatory/legal issues. Financial condition &#149; detailed review of the historical financial performance and the quality of earnings; &#149; development of detailed pro forma financial projections; &#149; review of internal controls and accounting systems; and &#149; review of assets and liabilities, including contingent liabilities. Structured Finance Vehicles &#149; review of indenture structures; &#149; review of underlying collateral loans; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#149; analysis of projected future cash flows; and &#149; analysis of compliance with covenants. Contemporaneous with our due diligence process, the investment team prepares a detailed credit memorandum for presentation to our Investment Committee, which currently consists of Messrs. Cohen, Rosenthal and Monasebian. Our Investment Committee reviews and approves each of our portfolio investments. 

Investment Characteristics In identifying corporate debt investments, we seek to ascertain the asset quality as well as the earnings quality of our prospective portfolio companies. Frequently, we obtain a senior secured position and thus receive a perfected, first or second priority security interest in substantially all of our portfolio companies&#146; assets, which entitles us to a preferred position on payments in the event of liquidation, and in many cases a pledge of the equity by the equity owners. It should be noted, however, that because we are not primarily an asset-based lender, in the current economic environment, the value of collateral and security interests may dissipate rapidly. In addition, in certain investments we seek loan covenants or to participate in syndicated loans that incorporate loan covenants that assist in the early identification of risk. Our loan documents may include affirmative covenants that require the portfolio company to take specific actions such as periodic financial reporting, notification of material events and compliance with laws, restrictive covenants that prevent portfolio companies from taking a range of significant actions such as incurring additional indebtedness or making acquisitions without our consent, covenants requiring the portfolio company to maintain or achieve specified financial ratios such as debt to cash flow and interest coverage, and operating covenants requiring them to maintain certain operational benchmarks such as minimum revenue or minimum cash flow. Our loan documents also provide protection against customary events of default such as non-payment, breach of covenant, insolvency and change of control. 

MONITORING RELATIONSHIPS WITH PORTFOLIO COMPANIES Monitoring We monitor the financial trends of each portfolio company to assess the appropriate course of action for each investment and to evaluate overall portfolio quality. We closely monitor the status and performance of each individual company on at least a quarterly and, in some cases, a monthly basis. 

We have several methods of evaluating and monitoring the performance of our investments, including but not limited to the following:

&#149; assessment of business development success, and the portfolio company&#146;s overall adherence to its business plan; and &#149; review of monthly and/or quarterly financial statements and financial projections for portfolio companies. In addition, we may from time to time identify investments that require closer monitoring or become workout assets. In such cases, we will develop a strategy for workout assets and periodically gauge our progress against that strategy. As a private equity holder, we may incur losses from our investing activities from time to time; however, we attempt where possible to work with troubled portfolio companies in order to recover as much of our investments as is practicable. 

&#160;

&#160;

Portfolio Grading We have developed a credit grading system to monitor the quality of our debt investment portfolio. We use an investment rating scale of 1 to 5. The following table provides a description of the conditions associated with each debt investment. Equity securities are not graded. 

&#160; Grade &#160; Summary Description 1 &#160; Company is ahead of expectations and/or outperforming financial covenant requirements and such trend is expected to continue. 2 &#160; Full repayment of the outstanding amount of TICC&#146;s cost basis and interest is expected for the specific tranche. 3 &#160; Closer monitoring is required. Full repayment of the outstanding amount of TICC&#146;s cost basis and interest is expected for the specific tranche. 4 &#160; A loss of interest income has occurred or is expected to occur and, in most cases, the investment is placed on non-accrual status. Full repayment of the outstanding amount of TICC&#146;s cost basis is expected for the specific tranche. 5 &#160; Full repayment of the outstanding amount of TICC&#146;s cost basis is not expected for the specific tranche and the investment is placed on non-accrual status. 

Managerial Assistance As a BDC, we are required to offer managerial assistance to portfolio companies. This assistance, were it to be accepted, would typically involves monitoring the operations of portfolio companies, participating in their board and management meetings, consulting with and advising their officers and providing other organizational and financial guidance. 

Portfolio Overview We seek to create a portfolio that includes primarily CLO investments, senior secured loans, senior subordinated and junior subordinated debt investments, as well as warrants and other equity instruments we may receive in connection with such debt investments. We generally expect to invest between $5 million and $50 million in each of our portfolio companies. We expect that our investment portfolio will be diversified among a large number of investments with few investments, if any, exceeding 5% of the total portfolio. 

The following is a representative list of the industries in which we have invested:

&#149; Structured finance &#149; Telecommunication services &#149; Business services &#149; Financial intermediaries &#149; Software &#149; Healthcare 

&#160;

&#149; Printing and publishing &#149; Consumer services &#149; Enterprise software &#149; Utilities &#149; Diversified insurance &#149; Logistics 

During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, we invested approximately $234.8 million comprised of approximately 72.0% in senior secured notes, 26.0% in CLO equity, 1.8% in equity, and 0.2% in subordinated debt. At December 31, 2015, our portfolio was invested in approximately 71.0% in senior secured notes, 27.3% in CLO equity, 0.3% in CLO debt, 1.3% in equity, and 0.1% in subordinated debt. 

&#160;

INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT Management Services TICC Management serves as our investment adviser. TICC Management is registered as our investment adviser under the Advisers Act. Subject to the overall supervision of our Board of Directors, TICC Management manages our day-to-day operations of, and provides investment advisory services to us. Under the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement, TICC Management:

&#149; determines the composition of our portfolio, the nature and timing of the changes to our portfolio and the manner of implementing such changes; &#149; identifies, evaluates and negotiates the structure of the investments we make; &#149; closes, monitors and services the investments we make; and &#149; determines what securities we will purchase, retain or sell. TICC Management&#146;s services under the Investment Advisory Agreement are not exclusive, and it is free to furnish similar services to other entities so long as its services to us are not impaired. TICC Management has agreed that, during the term of its Investment Advisory Agreement with us, it will not serve as investment adviser to any other public or private entity that utilizes a principal investment strategy of providing debt financing to middle-market companies similar to those we target. 

Management Fee We pay TICC Management a fee for its services under the Investment Advisory Agreement consisting of two components &#151; a base management fee and an incentive fee. The cost of both the base management fee payable to TICC Management and any incentive fees earned by TICC Management are ultimately borne by our common stockholders. 

For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, the base management fee (the &#147;Base Fee&#148;) was calculated at an annual rate of 2.00% of our gross assets. For services rendered under the Investment Advisory Agreement, the Base Fee is payable quarterly in arrears, and is calculated based on the average value of our gross assets at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters, and appropriately adjusted for any equity or debt capital raises, repurchases or redemptions during the current calendar quarter. The Base Fee for any partial quarter will be appropriately pro rated. 

The incentive fee has two parts. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, the first part is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears based on our &#147;Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income&#148; for the 

&#160;

&#160;

immediately preceding calendar quarter. For this purpose, &#147;Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income&#148; means interest income, dividend income and any other income (including any other fees, such as commitment, origination, structuring, diligence and consulting fees or other fees that we receive from portfolio companies) accrued during the calendar quarter minus our operating expenses for the quarter (including the Base Fee, expenses payable under our administration agreement with BDC Partners (the &#147;Administration Agreement&#148;), and any interest expense and dividends paid on any issued and outstanding preferred stock, but excluding the incentive fee). Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income includes, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as original issue discount, debt instruments with PIK interest and zero coupon securities), accrued income that we have not yet received in cash. Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income does not include any realized capital gains, realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, expressed as a rate of return on the value of our net assets at the end of the immediately preceding calendar quarter, is compared to one-fourth of an annual &#147;hurdle rate.&#148; 

For each year commencing on or after January 1, 2005, the annual hurdle rate has been determined as of the immediately preceding December 31 st by adding 5.0% to the interest rate then payable on the most recently issued five-year U.S. Treasury Notes, up to a maximum annual hurdle rate of 10.0%. The annual hurdle rate for the 2014 calendar year was 6.75% and the annual hurdle rate for the 2015 calendar year was 6.65%. The current hurdle rate for the 2016 calendar year, calculated as of December 31, 2015, is 6.76%. Our net investment income (to the extent not distributed to our shareholders) used to calculate this part of the incentive fee is also included in the amount of our gross assets used to calculate the 2% base management fee. In addition, in the event we recognize PIK loan interest in excess of our available capital, we may be required to liquidate assets in order to pay a portion of the incentive fee. TICC Management, however, is not required to reimburse us for the portion of any fees attributable to accrued deferred loan interest in the event of a default by the obligor. The operation of the incentive fee with respect to our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income for each quarter is as follows:

&#149; no incentive fee is payable to TICC Management in any calendar quarter in which our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income does not exceed one fourth of the annual hurdle rate (currently 6.76% for the 2016 calendar year). &#149; 20% of the amount of our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, if any, that exceeds one-fourth of the annual hurdle rate (currently 6.76% for the 2016 calendar year) in any calendar quarter is payable to TICC Management (i.e., once the hurdle rate is reached, 20% of all Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income thereafter is allocated to TICC Management). For example, for the quarter ended December 31, 2015, pre-incentive fee net investment income of $4.5 million did not exceed the hurdle of $7.8 million (based upon net assets of $468.6 million at September 30, 2015 and the quarterly hurdle rate of 1.6625%) and, therefore, no incentive fee was earned for the quarter. 

The second part of the incentive fee is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of the Investment Advisory Agreement, as of the termination date), and equals 20% of our &#147;Incentive Fee Capital Gains,&#148; which consist of our realized capital gains for each calendar year, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation for that calendar year. For accounting purposes only, in order to reflect the theoretical capital gains incentive fee that would be payable for a given period as if all unrealized gains were realized, we will accrue a capital gains incentive fee based upon net realized capital gains and unrealized capital depreciation for that calendar year (in accordance with the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement), plus unrealized capital appreciation on investments held at the end of the period. It should be noted that a fee so calculated and accrued would not necessarily be payable under the Investment Advisory Agreement, and may never be paid based upon the computation of capital gains incentive fees in subsequent periods. Amounts paid under the Investment Advisory Agreement will be consistent with the formula reflected in the Investment Advisory Agreement. 

&#160;

&#160;

Example 1: Income Related Portion of Incentive Fee for Each Calendar Quarter (*) Alternative 1 Assumptions Investment income (including interest, dividends, fees, etc.) = 1.25% 

Quarterly Hurdle rate (1) = 1.690% 

Management fee (2) = 0.5% 

Other expenses (legal, accounting, custodian, transfer agent, etc.) = 0.2% 

Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income 

(investment income &#150; (management fee + other expenses)) = 0.55% 

Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income does not exceed the hurdle rate, therefore there is no income-related incentive fee. 

Alternative 2 Assumptions Investment income (including interest, dividends, fees, etc.) = 4.0% 

Quarterly Hurdle rate (1) = 1.690% 

Management fee (2) = 0.5% 

Other expenses (legal, accounting, custodian, transfer agent, etc.) = 0.2% 

Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income 

(investment income &#150; (management fee + other expenses)) = 3.3% 

&#160; Incentive fee &#160; = 20% x Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income in excess of the hurdle rate &#160; &#160; = 20% x (3.3% &#150; 1.690%) &#160; &#160; = 20% x 1.610% &#160; &#160; = 0.3220% 

Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income exceeds hurdle rate, therefore the income-related incentive fee is 0.3275% 

(1) Represents 6.76% annualized hurdle rate for 2016 calendar year. (2) Represents 2% annualized management fee. Example 2: Capital Gains Portion of Incentive Fee (*) Capital Gains Incentive Fee = 20% x Incentive Fee Capital Gains (i.e., our realized capital gains for each calendar year, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation for that calendar year) 

Assumptions: Year 1 = no realized capital gains or losses 

Year 2 = 9% realized capital gains, 0% realized capital losses, 1% unrealized depreciation and 0% unrealized appreciation 

&#160;

&#160;

Year 3 = 12% realized capital gains, 0% realized capital losses, 2% unrealized depreciation and 2% unrealized appreciation 

&#160; Year 1 incentive fee &#160; &#149; Total Incentive Fee Capital Gains = 0 &#160; &#160; &#149; No capital gains incentive fee paid to TICC Management in Year 1 Year 2 incentive fee &#160; &#149; Total Incentive Fee Capital Gains = 8% &#160; &#160; (9% realized capital gains less 1% unrealized depreciation) &#160; &#160; &#149; Total capital gains incentive fee paid to TICC Management in Year 2 &#160; &#160; = 20% x 8% &#160; &#160; = 1.6% Year 3 incentive fee &#160; &#149; Total Incentive Fee Capital Gains = 10% &#160; &#160; (12% realized capital gains less 2% unrealized depreciation; unrealized appreciation has no effect) &#160; &#160; &#149; Total capital gains incentive fee paid to TICC Management in Year 3 &#160; &#160; = 20% x 10% &#160; &#160; = 2% 

(*) The hypothetical amount of returns shown are based on a percentage of our total net assets and assumes no leverage. There is no guarantee that positive returns will be realized and actual returns may vary from those shown in this example. Fee Waivers On March 9, 2016, TICC Management, in consultation with the Special Committee of the Board of Directors, has agreed to a series of ongoing fee waivers with respect to its management fee and income incentive fee. 

Under the terms of the fee waiver, which will take effect on April 1, 2016:

&#149; The base management fee will be reduced from 2.00% to 1.50%; &#149; TICC Management has agreed to forgo the payment of any base management fees on funds received in connection with any capital raises until the funds are invested; &#149; The calculation of the Company&#146;s income incentive fee will be revised to include a total return requirement that will limit TICC&#146;s obligation to pay TICC Management an income incentive fee if TICC has generated cumulative net decreases in net assets resulting from operations during the calendar quarter for which such fees are being calculated and the eleven preceding quarters (or if shorter, the number of quarters since April 1, 2016) due to unrealized or realized net losses on investments and even in the event TICC&#146;s net investment income exceeds the minimum return to TICC&#146;s stockholders required to be achieved before TICC Management is entitled to receive an income incentive fee (which minimum return is commonly referred to as the preferred return or the hurdle rate); &#149; The income incentive fee will incorporate a &#147;catch-up&#148; provision which will provide that TICC Management will receive 100% of TICC&#146;s net investment income with respect to that portion of such net investment income, if any, that exceeds the preferred return but is less than 2.1875% quarterly (8.75% annualized) and 20% of any net investment income thereafter; and &#149; The hurdle rate used to calculate the income incentive fee will change from a variable rate based on the five-year U.S. Treasury note plus 5.00% (with a maximum of 10%) to a fixed rate of 7.00%. After these changes take effect, under no circumstances will the aggregate fees earned from April 1, 2016 by TICC Management in any quarterly period be higher than those aggregate fees would have been prior to the adoption of these changes.

COMPETITION Our primary competitors to provide financing to primarily non-public small- and medium-sized companies include private equity and venture capital funds, other equity and non-equity based investment funds, including other BDCs, and investment banks and other sources of financing, including traditional financial services companies such as commercial banks and specialty finance companies. Many of these types of firms compete with us when we are investing in CLO vehicles. Many of these entities have greater financial and managerial resources than we will have. For additional information concerning the competitive risks we face, see &#147;Item 1A. Risk Factors &#151; Risks Relating to Our Business and Structure &#151; We operate in a highly competitive market for investment opportunities.&#148;

CERTAIN U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS As a BDC, we have elected to be treated, and intend to qualify annually, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code, beginning with our 2003 taxable year. As a RIC, we generally will not have to pay corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes on any ordinary income or capital gains that we distribute to our stockholders as dividends. To continue to qualify as a RIC, we must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements (as described below). In addition, to qualify for RIC tax treatment we must distribute to our stockholders, for each taxable year, at least 90% of our &#147;investment company taxable income,&#148; which is generally our ordinary income plus the excess of our realized net short-term capital gains over our realized net long-term capital losses (the &#147;Annual Distribution Requirement&#148;). 

Taxation as a RIC If we:

&#149; qualify as a RIC; and &#149; satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement, then we will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the portion of our investment company taxable income and net capital gain (i.e., realized net long-term capital gains in excess of realized net short-term capital losses) we distribute to stockholders. We will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at the regular corporate rates on any income or capital gains not distributed (or deemed distributed) to our stockholders. 

We will be subject to a 4% nondeductible U.S. federal excise tax on certain undistributed income unless we distribute in a timely manner an amount at least equal to the sum of (1) 98% of our net ordinary income for each calendar year, (2) 98.2% of our capital gain net income for the one-year period ending October 31 in that calendar year and (3) any income realized, but not distributed, and on which we paid no U.S. federal income tax, in preceding years (the &#147;Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement&#148;). We generally will endeavor in each taxable year to make sufficient distributions to our stockholders to satisfy the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement. 

In order to qualify as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we must, among other things:

&#149; continue to qualify as a BDC under the 1940 Act at all times during each taxable year; &#149; derive in each taxable year at least 90% of our gross income from dividends, interest, payments with respect to loans of certain securities, gains from the sale of stock or other securities, net income from certain &#147;qualified publicly traded partnerships,&#148; or other income derived with respect to our business of investing in such stock or securities (the &#147;90% Income Test&#148;); and 

&#160;

&#160;

&#149; diversify our holdings so that at the end of each quarter of the taxable year: &#149; at least 50% of the value of our assets consists of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities, securities of other RICs, and other securities if such other securities of any one issuer do not represent more than 5% of the value of our assets or more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of the issuer; and &#149; no more than 25% of the value of our assets is invested in the securities, other than U.S. government securities or securities of other RICs, of one issuer, of two or more issuers that are controlled, as determined under applicable Code rules, by us and that are engaged in the same or similar or related trades or businesses or of certain &#147;qualified publicly traded partnerships&#148; (the &#147;Diversification Tests&#148;). We may be required to recognize taxable income in circumstances in which we do not receive cash. For example, if we hold debt obligations that are treated under applicable tax rules as having original issue discount (such as debt instruments with PIK interest or, in certain cases, increasing interest rates or issued with warrants), we must include in income each year a portion of the original issue discount that accrues over the life of the obligation, regardless of whether cash representing such income is received by us in the same taxable year. We may also have to include in income other amounts that we have not yet received in cash, such as PIK interest and deferred loan origination fees that are paid after origination of the loan or are paid in non-cash compensation such as warrants or stock. Because any original issue discount or other amounts accrued will be included in our investment company taxable income for the year of accrual, we may be required to make a distribution to our stockholders in order to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement, even though we will not have received any corresponding cash amount. In addition, we may be required to accrue for U.S. federal income tax purposes amounts attributable to our investment in CLOs that may differ from the distributions received in respect of such investments. Although we do not presently expect to do so, we are authorized to borrow funds, to sell assets and to make taxable distributions of our stock and debt securities in order to satisfy distribution requirements. Our ability to dispose of assets to meet our distribution requirements may be limited by (1) the illiquid nature of our portfolio and/or (2) other requirements relating to our status as a RIC, including the Diversification Tests. If we dispose of assets in order to meet the Annual Distribution Requirement or the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement, we may make such dispositions at times that, from an investment standpoint, are not advantageous. If we are unable to obtain cash from other sources to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement, we may fail to qualify as a RIC and become subject to tax as an ordinary corporation. 

Under the 1940 Act, we are not permitted to make distributions to our stockholders while our debt obligations and other senior securities are outstanding unless certain &#147;asset coverage&#148; tests are met. If we are prohibited to make distributions, we may fail to qualify as a RIC and become subject to tax as an ordinary corporation. 

We have purchased and may in the future purchase residual or subordinated interests in CLOs that are treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as shares in a &#147;passive foreign investment company&#148; (a &#147;PFIC&#148;). We may be subject to U.S. federal income tax on our allocable share of a portion of any &#147;excess distribution&#148; received on, or any gain from the disposition of, such shares even if our allocable share of such income is distributed as a taxable dividend to the PFIC&#146;s stockholders. Additional charges, in the nature of interest, generally will be imposed on us in respect of deferred taxes arising from any such excess distribution or gain. If we elect to treat a PFIC as a &#147;qualified electing fund&#148; under the Code (a &#147;QEF&#148;), in lieu of the foregoing requirements, we will be required to include in income each year our proportionate share of the ordinary earnings and net capital gain of the QEF, even if such income is not distributed by the QEF. Alternatively, we may be able to elect to mark-to-market at the end of each taxable year our shares in a PFIC; in this case, we will recognize as ordinary income our allocable share of any increase in the value of such shares, and as ordinary loss our allocable share of any decrease in such value to the extent that any such decrease does not exceed prior increases included in our income. Under either election, we may be required to recognize in a year income in excess of distributions from PFICs and proceeds from dispositions of PFIC shares during that year, and such income will nevertheless be subject to the Annual Distribution Requirement and will be taken into account for purposes of the 4% excise tax. 

&#160;

&#160;

Under certain circumstances, a CLO may be treated as a controlled foreign corporation (&#147;CFC&#148;) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If a CLO is treated as a CFC, and we are considered to own 10% or more of total voting power in such CLO, we would be required to include in income each year any &#147;subpart F income&#148; generated by such CLO, which would generally include its net investment income, regardless of whether we received any distributions with respect to such income. 

Although the Code generally provides that income inclusions from a QEF and subpart F income will be &#147;good income&#148; for purposes of the 90% Income Test to the extent it is distributed to a RIC in the year it is included in the RIC&#146;s income, the Code does not specifically provide whether income inclusions from a QEF and subpart F income for which no distribution is received during the RIC&#146;s taxable year would be &#147;good income&#148; for the 90% Income Test. The IRS has issued a series of private rulings in which it has concluded that all income inclusions from a QEF and subpart F income included in a RIC&#146;s income would constitute &#147;good income&#148; for purposes of the 90% Income Test. Such rulings are not binding on the IRS except with respect to the taxpayer to whom such rulings were issued. Accordingly, although we believe that the income inclusions from a QEF and subpart F income of a CLO that we are required to include in our taxable income would be &#147;good income&#148; for purposes of the 90% Income Test, no guaranty can be made that the IRS would not assert that such income would not be &#147;good income&#148; for purposes of the 90% Income Test. If such income were not considered &#147;good income&#148; for purposes of the 90% Income Test, we may fail to qualify as a RIC. 

Failure to Qualify as a Regulated Investment Company If we were unable to qualify for treatment as a RIC, we would be subject to tax on all of our taxable income at regular corporate rates, regardless of whether we make any distributions to our stockholders. Distributions would not be required, and any distributions made would be taxable to our stockholders as ordinary dividend income that, subject to certain limitations, may be eligible for the 20.0% maximum rate to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits. Subject to certain limitations under the Code, corporate distributees would be eligible for the dividends-received deduction. Distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits would be treated first as a return of capital to the extent of the stockholder&#146;s tax basis, and any remaining distributions would be treated as a capital gain. 

REGULATION AS A BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT COMPANY General A BDC is regulated by the 1940 Act. A BDC must be organized in the United States for the purpose of investing in or lending to primarily private companies and making managerial assistance available to them. A BDC may use capital provided by public stockholders and from other sources to invest in long-term, private investments in businesses. A BDC provides stockholders the ability to retain the liquidity of a publicly traded stock, while sharing in the possible benefits, if any, of investing in primarily privately owned companies. 

We may not change the nature of our business so as to cease to be, or withdraw our election as, a BDC unless authorized by vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities, as required by the 1940 Act. A majority of the outstanding voting securities of a company is defined under the 1940 Act as the lesser of: (i) 67% or more of such company&#146;s voting securities present at a meeting if more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of such company are present or represented by proxy, or (ii) more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of such company. We do not anticipate any substantial change in the nature of our business. 

As with other companies regulated by the 1940 Act, a BDC must adhere to certain substantive regulatory requirements. A majority of our directors must be persons who are not interested persons, as that term is defined in the 1940 Act. Additionally, we are required to provide and maintain a bond issued by a reputable fidelity insurance company to protect the BDC. Furthermore, as a BDC, we are prohibited from protecting any director or officer against any liability to the company or our stockholders arising from willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of such person&#146;s office. 

As a BDC, we are required to meet a coverage ratio of the value of total assets to total senior securities, which include all of our borrowings and any preferred stock we may issue in the future, of at least 200%. We 

&#160;

&#160;

may also be prohibited under the 1940 Act from knowingly participating in certain transactions with our affiliates without the prior approval of our directors who are not interested persons and, in some cases, prior approval by the SEC. 

We are not generally able to sell our common stock at a price below net asset value per share. See &#147;Risk Factors &#151; Risks Relating to our Business and Structure &#151; Regulations governing our operation as a BDC affect our ability to, and the way in which we raise additional capital which may expose us to risks, including the typical risks associated with leverage.&#148; We may, however, sell our common stock at a price below net asset value per share (i) in connection with a rights offering to our existing stockholders, (ii) with the consent of the majority of our common stockholders, or (iii) under such other circumstances as the SEC may permit. For example, we may sell our common stock, or warrants, options or rights to acquire our common stock, at a price below the then current net asset value of our common stock if our Board of Directors determines that such sale is in our best interests and the best interests of our stockholders, and our stockholders approve our policy and practice of making such sales. In any such case, under such circumstances, the price at which our common stock to be issued and sold may not be less than a price which, in the determination of our Board of Directors, closely approximates the market value of such common stock. In addition, we may generally issue new shares of our common stock at a price below net asset value in rights offerings to existing stockholders, in payment of dividends and in certain other limited circumstances. 

We may be examined by the SEC for compliance with the 1940 Act. 

As a BDC, we are subject to certain risks and uncertainties. See &#147;Item 1A. Risk Factors &#151; Risks Relating to our Business and Structure.&#148; 

Qualifying Assets As a BDC, we may not acquire any asset other than &#147;qualifying assets&#148; unless, at the time we make the acquisition, the value of our qualifying assets represent at least 70% of the value of our total assets. The principal categories of qualifying assets relevant to our business are:

&#149; Securities purchased in transactions not involving any public offering, the issuer of which is an eligible portfolio company; &#149; Securities received in exchange for or distributed with respect to securities described in the bullet above or pursuant to the exercise of options, warrants or rights relating to such securities; and &#149; Cash, cash items, government securities or high quality debt securities (within the meaning of the 1940 Act), maturing in one year or less from the time of investment. An eligible portfolio company is generally a domestic company that is not an investment company (other than a small business investment company wholly owned by a BDC) and that:

&#149; does not have a class of securities with respect to which a broker may extend margin credit at the time the acquisition is made; &#149; is controlled by the BDC and has an affiliate of the BDC on its board of directors; &#149; does not have any class of securities listed on a national securities exchange; &#149; is a public company that lists its securities on a national securities exchange with a market capitalization of less than $250 million; or &#149; meets such other criteria as may be established by the SEC. Control, as defined by the 1940 Act, is presumed to exist where a BDC beneficially owns more than 25% of the outstanding voting securities of the portfolio company. 

In addition, a BDC must have been organized and have its principal place of business in the United States and must be operated for the purpose of making investments in eligible portfolio companies, or in other securities that are consistent with its purpose as a BDC. 

&#160;

&#160;

Significant Managerial Assistance BDCs generally must offer to make available to the issuer of the securities significant managerial assistance, except in circumstances where either (i) the BDC controls such issuer of securities or (ii) the BDC purchases such securities in conjunction with one or more other persons acting together and one of the other persons in the group makes available such managerial assistance. We offer to provide managerial assistance to our portfolio companies. 

Code of Ethics As required by the 1940 Act, we maintain a Code of Ethics that establishes procedures for personal investments and restricts certain transactions by our personnel. See &#147;Item 1A. Risk Factors &#151; Risks Relating to our Business and Structure &#151; There are significant potential conflicts of interest.&#148; Our Code of Ethics generally does not permit investments by our employees in securities that may be purchased or held by us. You may read and copy the Code of Ethics at the SEC&#146;s Public Reference Room in Washington, D.C. You may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. In addition, the Code of Ethics is available on the EDGAR Database on the SEC&#146;s Internet site at http://www.sec.gov . You may obtain copies of the Code of Ethics, after paying a duplicating fee, by electronic request at the following Email address: publicinfo@sec.gov, or by writing the SEC&#146;s Public Reference Section, 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549. Our Code of Ethics is also available on our website at http://www.ticc.com . 

Compliance Policies and Procedures We and our investment adviser have adopted and implemented written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violation of the federal securities laws, and are required to review these compliance policies and procedures annually for their adequacy and the effectiveness of their implementation, and to designate a Chief Compliance Officer to be responsible for administering the policies and procedures. 

Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the &#147;Sarbanes-Oxley Act&#148;) imposes a wide variety of new regulatory requirements on publicly-held companies and their insiders. Many of these requirements affect us. For example:

&#149; Pursuant to Rule 13a-14 of the 1934 Act, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer must certify the accuracy of the consolidated financial statements contained in our periodic reports; &#149; Pursuant to Item 307 of Regulation S-K, our periodic reports must disclose our conclusions about the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures; &#149; Pursuant to Rule 13a-15 of the 1934 Act, our management must prepare a report regarding its assessment of our internal control over financial reporting; and &#149; Pursuant to Item 308 of Regulation S-K and Rule 13a-15 of the 1934 Act, our periodic reports must disclose whether there were significant changes in our internal controls or in other factors that could significantly affect these controls subsequent to the date of their evaluation, including any corrective actions with regard to significant deficiencies and material weaknesses. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires us to review our current policies and procedures to determine whether we comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder. We will continue to monitor our compliance with all regulations that are adopted under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and will take actions necessary to ensure that we are in compliance therewith. 

Fundamental Investment Policies The restrictions identified as fundamental below, along with our investment objective of seeking to maximize total return, are our only fundamental policies. Fundamental policies may not be changed without the approval of the holders of a majority of our outstanding voting securities, as defined in the 1940 Act. The percentage restrictions set forth below, apply at the time a transaction is effected, and a subsequent change in a percentage resulting from market fluctuations or any cause will not require us to dispose of portfolio securities or to take other action to satisfy the percentage restriction. 

&#160;

&#160;

As a matter of fundamental policy, we will not: (1) act as an underwriter of securities of other issuers (except to the extent that we may be deemed an &#147;underwriter&#148; of securities we purchase that must be registered under the 1933 Act before they may be offered or sold to the public); (2) purchase or sell real estate or interests in real estate or real estate investment trusts (except that we may (A) purchase and sell real estate or interests in real estate in connection with the orderly liquidation of investments, or in connection with foreclosure on collateral, (B) own the securities of companies that are in the business of buying, selling or developing real estate or (C) finance the purchase of real estate by our portfolio companies); (3) sell securities short (except with regard to managing the risks associated with publicly-traded securities issued by our portfolio companies); (4) purchase securities on margin (except to the extent that we may purchase securities with borrowed money); or (5) engage in the purchase or sale of commodities or commodity contracts, including futures contracts (except where necessary in working out distressed loan or investment situations or in hedging the risks associated with interest rate fluctuations), and, in such cases, only after all necessary registrations (or exemptions from registration) with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission have been obtained. 

We may invest up to 100% of our assets in securities acquired directly from issuers in privately negotiated transactions. With respect to such securities, we may, for the purpose of public resale, be deemed an &#147;underwriter&#148; as that term is defined in the 1933 Act. Our intention is to not write (sell) or buy put or call options to manage risks associated with the publicly-traded securities of our portfolio companies, except that we may enter into hedging transactions to manage the risks associated with interest rate fluctuations, and, in such cases, only after all necessary registrations (or exemptions from registration) with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission have been obtained. However, we may purchase or otherwise receive warrants to purchase the common stock or other equity securities of our portfolio companies in connection with acquisition financing or other investment. Similarly, in connection with an acquisition, we may acquire rights to require the issuers of acquired securities or their affiliates to repurchase them under certain circumstances. We also do not intend to acquire securities issued by any investment company that exceed the limits imposed by the 1940 Act. Under these limits, unless otherwise permitted by the 1940 Act, we currently cannot acquire more than 3% of the voting securities of any registered investment company, invest more than 5% of the value of our total assets in the securities of one investment company or invest, in the aggregate, in excess of 10% of the value of our total assets in the securities of one or more investment companies. With regard to that portion of our portfolio invested in securities issued by investment companies, it should be noted that such investments might subject our stockholders to additional expenses. 

Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures We have delegated our proxy voting responsibility to TICC Management. The Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures of TICC Management are set forth below. The guidelines are reviewed periodically by TICC Management and, accordingly, are subject to change. 

Introduction As an investment adviser registered under the Advisers Act, TICC Management has a fiduciary duty to act solely in the best interests of its clients. As part of this duty, TICC Management recognizes that it must vote client securities in a timely manner free of conflicts of interest and in the best interests of its clients. 

These policies and procedures for voting proxies for TICC Management&#146;s investment advisory clients are intended to comply with Section 206 of, and Rule 206(4)-6 under, the Advisers Act. 

Proxy Policies TICC Management votes proxies relating to the Company&#146;s portfolio securities in the best interests of the Corporation&#146;s shareholders. TICC Management will review on a case-by-case basis each proposal submitted for a shareholder vote to determine its impact on the portfolio securities held by the Company. Although TICC Management generally votes against proposals that may have a negative impact on the Company&#146;s portfolio securities, TICC Management may vote for such a proposal if there exist compelling long-term reasons to do so. TICC Management will abstain from voting only in unusual circumstances and where there is a compelling reason to do so. 

The proxy voting decisions of TICC Management are made by the senior officers of TICC Management who are responsible for monitoring each of the Company&#146;s investments. To ensure that its vote is not the 

&#160;

&#160;

product of a conflict of interest, TICC Management requires that: (i) anyone involved in the decision making process disclose to TICC Management&#146;s Chief Compliance Officer any potential conflict that he or she is aware of and any contact that he or she has had with any interested party regarding a proxy vote; and (ii) employees involved in the decision making process or vote administration are prohibited from revealing how TICC Management intends to vote on a proposal without the prior approval of TICC Management&#146;s Chief Compliance Officer and senior management in order to reduce any attempted influence from interested parties. 

Proxy Voting Records You may obtain information about how TICC Management voted proxies with respect to the Company&#146;s portfolio securities by making a written request for proxy voting information to: Chief Compliance Officer, TICC Management, LLC, 8 Sound Shore Drive, Suite 255, Greenwich, CT 06830. 

Periodic Reporting and Audited Financial Statements We have registered our common stock under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and have reporting obligations thereunder, including the requirement that we file annual and quarterly reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, this annual report contains consolidated financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accounting firm. You may obtain our annual reports on Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and our current reports on Form 8-K on our website at http://www.ticc.com free of charge as soon as reasonably practicable after we file such reports electronically with the SEC. 

NASDAQ Global Select Market Requirements We have adopted certain policies and procedures intended to comply with the NASDAQ Global Select Market&#146;s corporate governance rules. We will continue to monitor our compliance with all future listing standards that are approved by the SEC and will take actions necessary to ensure that we are in compliance therewith.
