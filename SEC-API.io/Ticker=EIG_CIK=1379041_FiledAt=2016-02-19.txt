Strategy 

Business Strategy 

Our strategy is to pursue profitable growth opportunities across market cycles and maximize total investment returns within the constraints of prudent portfolio management. We pursue profitable growth opportunities by focusing on disciplined underwriting and claims management, utilizing medical provider networks designed to produce superior medical and indemnity outcomes, establishing and maintaining strong, long-term relationships with independent insurance agencies, and developing important alternative distribution channels. We continue to execute a number of strategic initiatives, including: focusing on internal and customer facing business process excellence; emphasizing the settlement of open claims; diversifying our risk exposure across our markets; utilizing a three-company pricing platform; utilizing territorial multipliers in California; non-renewing under-performing business; and targeting profitable classes of business across all of our markets. 

Capital Strategy 

We believe that we have a strong capital position. We periodically reassess our capital needs to ensure an optimal use of capital consistent with our goal to create shareholder value over the long-term. Our capital strategy is focused on supporting our business operations by maintaining capital levels commensurate with our desired ratings from independent rating agencies, satisfying regulatory constraints and legal requirements, and sustaining a level of financial flexibility to prudently manage our business through insurance and economic cycles while allowing us to take advantage of investment opportunities, including mergers and acquisitions and related financings, as and when they arise. 

We expect to return capital not needed for these purposes to our common stockholders in the form of dividends and common stock repurchases. We believe that, generally over time, the combination of dividends to common stockholders and common stock repurchases will not exceed operating income. The timing and actual numbers of shares that may be repurchased in the future will depend on a variety of factors, including our financial position, earnings, share price, corporate and regulatory requirements, and other market and economic conditions. Additional information regarding our capital is set forth under &#8220;Part II, Item 7&#8211;Liquidity and Capital Resources.&#8221; 

Description of Business 

We are a specialty provider of workers' compensation insurance focused on select small businesses in low to medium hazard industries. We employ a disciplined, conservative underwriting approach designed to individually select specific types of businesses, predominantly those in the lowest four of the seven workers' compensation insurance industry defined hazard groups, that we believe will have fewer and less costly claims relative to other businesses in the same hazard groups. Workers' compensation is provided for under a statutory system wherein most employers are required to provide coverage for their employees' medical, disability, vocational rehabilitation, and/or death benefit costs for work-related injuries or illnesses. We operate as a single reportable segment and conduct operations in 33 &#32;states and the District of Columbia, with a concentration in California, where over one-half of our business is generated. We had total assets of $3.8 billion &#32;at December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 . The following table highlights key results of our operations for the last three years.

(1) 

The combined ratio, a key measurement of underwriting profitability, is the sum of the loss and loss adjustment expenses (LAE), commission expenses, and underwriting and other operating expenses, measured as a percentage of earned premium. 

(2) 

The impact of the LPT Agreement includes: (a) amortization of Deferred reinsurance gain&#8211;LPT Agreement (Deferred Gain); (b) adjustments to LPT Agreement ceded reserves; and (c) adjustments to Contingent commission receivable&#8211;LPT Agreement. Deferred Gain reflects the unamortized gain from our LPT Agreement. Under GAAP, this gain is deferred and is being amortized using the recovery method. Amortization is determined by the proportion of actual reinsurance recoveries to total estimated recoveries over the life of the LPT Agreement, except for the contingent profit commission, which is amortized through June 30, 2024. The amortization is reflected in losses and LAE. We periodically reevaluate the remaining direct reserves subject to the LPT Agreement and the expected losses and LAE subject to the contingent profit commission under the LPT Agreement. Our reevaluation results in corresponding adjustments, if needed, to reserves, ceded reserves, contingent commission receivable, and the Deferred Gain, with the net effect being an increase or decrease, as the case may be, to net income. Combined ratio before impact of the LPT Agreement is not a measurement of financial performance under GAAP, but rather reflects the difference in accounting treatment between statutory accounting principles and GAAP, and should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to the combined ratio or any other measure of performance derived in accordance with GAAP.

Products and Services 

Workers' compensation provides insurance coverage for the statutorily prescribed benefits that employers are required to provide to their employees who may be injured or suffer illness in the course of employment. The level of benefits varies by state, the nature and severity of the injury or disease, and the wages of the injured worker. Each state has a statutory, regulatory, and adjudicatory system that sets the amount of wage replacement to be paid, determines the level of medical care required to be provided, establishes the degree of permanent impairment, and specifies the options in selecting healthcare providers. These state laws generally require two types of benefits for injured employees: (a) medical benefits, including expenses related to the diagnosis and treatment of an injury, disease, or both, as well as any required rehabilitation, and (b) indemnity payments, which consist of temporary wage replacement, permanent disability payments, and death benefits to surviving family members. 

Disciplined Underwriting 

Our strategy is to focus on disciplined underwriting and continue to pursue profitable growth opportunities across market cycles. We carefully monitor market trends to assess new business opportunities that we expect will meet our pricing and risk standards. We price our policies based on the specific risks associated with each potential insured rather than solely on the industry class in which a potential insured is classified. Our disciplined underwriting approach is a critical element of our culture and we believe that it has allowed us to offer competitive prices, diversify our risks, and out-perform the industry. 

We execute our underwriting processes through automated systems and experienced underwriters with specific knowledge of local markets. We have developed automated underwriting templates for specific classes of business that produce faster quotes when certain underwriting criteria are met. Our underwriting guidelines consider many factors, such as type of business, nature of operations, and risk exposures, and are designed to minimize or prevent underwriting of certain classes of business. 

Loss Control 

Our loss control professionals provide consultation to policyholders to assist them in preventing losses and containing costs once claims occur. They also assist our underwriting personnel in evaluating potential and current policyholders and are an important part of our underwriting discipline. 

Premium Audit 

We conduct premium audits on substantially all of our policyholders annually upon the policy expiration. Premium audits allow us to comply with applicable state and reporting bureau requirements and to verify that policyholders have accurately reported their payroll and employee job classifications. We also selectively perform interim audits on certain classes of business or if unusual claims are filed or concerns are raised regarding projected annual payrolls, which could result in substantial variances at final audit. 

Claims and Medical Case Management 

The role of our claims department is to actively and efficiently investigate, evaluate, and pay claims, and to aid injured workers in returning to work in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. We have implemented rigorous claims guidelines and control procedures in our claims units and have claims operations throughout the markets we serve. We also provide medical case management services for those claims that we determine will benefit from such involvement. 

We utilize an outcome-based medical network that incorporates predictive analytics to identify medical providers who achieve superior clinical outcomes for our injured workers that allows us to optimize our provider network and enhance the quality of care. We have also implemented a proactive pharmacy benefit management program that, along with our outcome based medical network, focuses on reducing claims costs and accelerating injured workers' return to work. 

In addition to our medical networks, we work closely with local vendors, including attorneys, medical professionals, pharmacy benefits managers, and investigators, to bring local expertise to our reported claims. We pay special attention to reducing costs and have established discounting arrangements with the aforementioned service providers. We use preferred provider organizations, bill review services, and utilization management to closely monitor medical costs. We actively pursue fraud and subrogation recoveries to mitigate claims costs. Subrogation rights are based upon state and federal laws, as well as the insurance policies we issue. Our fraud and subrogation efforts are handled through dedicated units. 

Our claims department also provides claims management services for those claims incurred by the Nevada State Industrial Insurance System (the Fund) and assumed by EICN and subject to a 100% retroactive reinsurance agreement (the LPT Agreement) with dates of injury prior to July 1, 1995. Additional information regarding the LPT Agreement is set forth under &#8220;&#8211;Reinsurance&#8211;LPT Agreement.&#8221; We receive a management fee from the third party reinsurers equal to 7% of the loss payments on these claims. 

Information Technology 

Core Operating Systems 

We have an efficient, cost-effective and scalable infrastructure that complements our geographic reach and business model and have developed a highly automated underwriting system. This technology applies our underwriting standards and guidelines and allows for the electronic submission, review, and quoting of insurance applications. This policy administration system reduces transaction costs and provides for more efficient and timely processing of applications for small policies that meet our underwriting standards. We believe this approach saves our independent agents and brokers considerable time in processing customer applications and maintains our competitiveness in our target markets. We will continue to invest in technology and systems across our business to maximize efficiency, facilitate customer self-service, and create increased capacity that will allow us to lower our expense ratios while growing premiums. 

Business Continuity/Disaster Recovery 

We maintain business continuity and disaster recovery plans for our critical business functions, including the restoration of information technology infrastructure and applications. We have two data centers that act as production facilities and as disaster recovery sites for each other. In addition, we utilize an off-site data storage facility for critical customer and systems data. 

Customers and Workers' Compensation Premiums 

The workers' compensation insurance industry classifies risks into seven hazard groups, as defined by the National Council on Compensation Insurance (NCCI), based on severity of claims, with businesses in the first or lowest group having the lowest claims costs. 

We target select small businesses engaged in low to medium hazard industries. Our historical loss experience has been more favorable for lower industry defined hazard groups than for higher hazard groups. Further, we believe it is generally less costly to service and manage the risks associated with these lower hazard groups. Our underwriters use their local market expertise and disciplined underwriting to select specific types of businesses and risks within the classes of business we underwrite that allow us to generate loss ratios that are better than the industry average.

We currently write business in 33 &#32;states and the District of Columbia. Our business is concentrated in California, which makes the results of our operations more dependent on the trends that are unique to that state and that may differ from national trends. State legislation, local competition, economic and employment trends, and workers' compensation medical costs trends can be material to our financial results. 

As of December 31, 2015 , our policyholders had average annual in-force premiums of $7,332 . We are not dependent on any single policyholder and the loss of any single policyholder would not have a material adverse effect on our business. 

Our in-force premiums and number of policies in-force were as follows as of December 31:

From 2013 &#32;through 2015 , our total in-force premiums and number of policies in-force have remained relatively flat, while in-force premiums and policy count in California decreased 4.2% and 8.2%, respectively, reflecting our efforts to continue to diversify and grow our business in profitable markets. We cannot be certain how these trends will ultimately impact our consolidated financial position and results of operations. 

Our premiums are generally a function of the applicable premium rate, the amount of the insured's payroll, and if applicable, a factor reflecting the insured's historical loss experience (experience modification factor). Premium rates vary by state according to the nature of the employees' duties and the business of the employer. The premium is computed by applying the applicable premium rate to each class of the insured's payroll after it has been appropriately classified. Total policy premium is determined 

after applying an experience modification factor and a further adjustment, known as a schedule rating adjustment, and other adjustments, which may be made in certain circumstances, to increase or decrease the policy premium. Schedule rating adjustments are made based on individual risk characteristics of the insured and subject to maximum amounts as established in our premium rate filings. 

Our premium rates are based upon actuarial analyses for each state in which we do business, except in &#8220;administered pricing&#8221; states, primarily Florida and Wisconsin, where premium rates are set by state insurance regulators. 

Our net rate (total in-force premiums divided by total insured payroll exposure) increased 0.7% , 11.2% , and 12.9% &#32;in California during the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 , respectively. Net rate is a function of a variety of factors, including rate changes, underwriting risk profiles and pricing, and changes in business mix related to economic and competitive pressures. Pricing in California reflects changes to schedule rating, filed rates, and experience modifiers. We began leveraging territorial multipliers and multiple insurance subsidiaries, each with different rate filings, to provide additional pricing options in California for policies incepting on or after June 1, 2014. 

Losses and LAE Reserves and Loss Development 

We are directly liable for losses and LAE under the terms of the insurance policies our insurance subsidiaries write. Significant periods of time can elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss, the reporting of the loss to us, and our payment of that loss. Loss reserves are reflected on our consolidated balance sheets under the line item caption &#8220;Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses.&#8221; Estimating reserves is a complex process that involves a considerable degree of judgment by management and is inherently uncertain. Loss reserve estimates represent a significant risk to our business, which we attempt to mitigate by frequently and routinely reviewing loss cost trends. 

For a detailed description of our reserves, the judgments, key assumptions and actuarial methodologies that we use to estimate our reserves, and the role of our consulting actuary, see &#8220;Item 7 &#8211;Management's Discussion and Analysis of Consolidated Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8211;Critical Accounting Policies &#8211;Reserves for Losses and LAE&#8221; and Note 9 &#32;in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 

The following tables show changes in the historical loss reserves, on a gross basis and net of reinsurance, at December 31 for each of the 10 years prior to 2015 &#32;for EICN and ECIC, and for each of the years ended December 31, 2008 through December 31, 2014 &#32;for EPIC and EAC. This information is presented on a GAAP basis and the paid and reserve data is presented on a calendar year basis. 

The top line of each table shows the net and gross reserves for unpaid losses and LAE recorded at each year-end. Such amounts represent an estimate of unpaid losses and LAE occurring in that year as well as future payments on claims occurring in prior years. The upper portion of these tables (net and gross cumulative amounts paid, respectively) presents the cumulative amounts paid during subsequent years on those losses for which reserves were carried as of each specific year. The lower portions (net and gross reserves re-estimated, respectively) show the re-estimated amounts of the previously recorded reserves based on experience as of the end of each succeeding year. The re-estimated amounts change as more information becomes known about the actual losses for which the initial reserve was carried. An adjustment to the carrying value of unpaid losses for a prior year will also be reflected in the adjustments for each subsequent year. The net and gross cumulative redundancy (deficiency) line represents the cumulative change in estimates since the initial reserve was established. It is equal to the difference between the initial reserve and the latest re-estimated reserve amount. A redundancy means that the original estimate was higher than the current estimate. A deficiency means that the current estimate is higher than the original estimate.

Reinsurance 

Reinsurance is a transaction between insurance companies in which an original insurer, or ceding company, remits a portion of its premiums to a reinsurer, or assuming company, as payment for the reinsurer assuming a portion of the risk. Excess of loss reinsurance may be written in layers, in which a reinsurer or group of reinsurers accepts a band of coverage in excess of a specified amount, or retention, and up to a specified amount. Any liability exceeding the coverage limits of the reinsurance program is retained by the ceding company. The ceding company also bears the credit risk of a reinsurer's insolvency. Consistent with general industry practices, we purchase excess of loss reinsurance to protect against the impact of large individual, irregularly-occurring losses, and aggregate catastrophic losses from natural perils and terrorism, excluding nuclear, biological, chemical, and radiological events. Such reinsurance reduces the magnitude of such losses on our net income and the capital of our insurance subsidiaries. 

Excess of Loss Reinsurance 

Our current reinsurance program applies to all covered losses occurring between 12:01 a.m. July 1, 2015 &#32;and 12:01 a.m. July 1, 2016 . The reinsurance program consists of one treaty covering excess of loss and catastrophic loss events in five layers of coverage. Our reinsurance coverage is $193.0 million &#32;in excess of our $7.0 million &#32;retention on a per occurrence basis, subject to certain exclusions. We are solely responsible for any losses we suffer above $200.0 million &#32;except those covered by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2015 (TRIPRA of 2015). See "&#8212;Terrorism Risk Insurance Program." Covered losses which occur prior to expiration or cancellation of the agreement continue to be obligations of the subscribing reinsurers, subject to the other conditions in the agreement. The subscribing reinsurers may terminate the agreement only for our breach of the obligations of the agreement. We are responsible for the losses if the subscribing reinsurer cannot or refuses to pay. 

The agreement includes certain exclusions for which our subscribing reinsurers are not liable for losses, including but not limited to losses arising from the following: reinsurance assumed by us under pooling arrangements; financial guarantee and insolvency; certain nuclear risks; liability as a member, subscriber, or reinsurer of any pool, syndicate, or association, but not assigned risk plans; liability arising from participation or membership in any insolvency fund; loss or damage caused by war other than acts of terrorism or civil commotion; workers' compensation business covering persons employed in Minnesota; and any loss or damage caused by any act of terrorism involving biological, chemical, nuclear, or radioactive pollution or contamination. Our underwriting guidelines generally require that insured risks fall within the coverage provided in the reinsurance program. Executive review and approval would be required if we were to write risks outside the reinsurance program. 

The agreement provides that we, or any subscribing reinsurer, may request commutation of any outstanding claim or claims 10 years after the effective date of termination or expiration of the agreements and provides a mechanism for the parties to achieve valuation for commutation. We may require a special commutation of the percentage share of any loss in the reinsurance program of any subscribing reinsurer that is in runoff. 

LPT Agreement 

In 1999, the Fund entered into a retroactive 100% quota share reinsurance agreement through a loss portfolio transfer transaction with third party reinsurers. The LPT Agreement commenced on June 30, 1999 and will remain in effect until all claims under the covered policies have closed, the agreement is commuted, or terminated, upon the mutual agreement of the parties, or the reinsurers' aggregate maximum limit of liability is exhausted, whichever occurs earlier. The LPT Agreement does not provide for any additional termination terms. On January 1, 2000, EICN assumed all of the assets, liabilities and operations of the Fund, including the Fund's rights and obligations associated with the LPT Agreement. 

Under the LPT Agreement, the Fund initially ceded $1.5 billion &#32;in liabilities for the incurred but unpaid losses and LAE related to claims incurred prior to July 1, 1995, for consideration of $775.0 million &#32;in cash. The LPT Agreement, which ceded to the reinsurers substantially all of the Fund's outstanding losses as of June 30, 1999 for claims with original dates of injury prior to July 1, 1995, provides coverage for losses up to $2.0 billion , excluding losses for burial and transportation expenses. The estimated remaining liabilities subject to the LPT Agreement were approximately $498.0 million &#32;and $534.8 million , as of December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively (See Note 10 &#32;in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements). Losses and LAE paid with respect to the LPT Agreement totaled approximately $695.2 million &#32;and $668.4 million &#32;through December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively. 

The reinsurers agreed to assume responsibilities for the claims at the benefit levels which existed in June 1999. The LPT Agreement required each reinsurer to place assets supporting the payment of claims by them in a trust that requires collateral be held at a specified level. The level must not be less than the outstanding reserve for losses and a loss expense allowance equal to 7% of estimated paid losses discounted at a rate of 6%. If the assets held in trust fall below this threshold, we may require the reinsurers to contribute additional assets to maintain the required minimum level of collateral. The value of these assets as of December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 &#32;was $1.4 billion &#32;and $1.5 billion , respectively. 

The reinsurers currently party to the LPT Agreement are ACE Bermuda Insurance Limited, XL Re Limited, and National Indemnity Company. The contract provides that during the term of the agreement all reinsurers need to maintain a rating of not less than 

&#8220;A-&#8221; (Excellent) as determined by A.M. Best. Currently, each of the reinsurers party to the LPT Agreement has a rating that satisfies this requirement. 

We account for the LPT Agreement as retroactive reinsurance. Upon entry into the LPT Agreement, an initial deferred reinsurance gain was recorded as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet as Deferred Gain. We are also entitled to receive a contingent profit commission under the LPT Agreement. The contingent profit commission is estimated based on both actual paid results to date and projections of expected paid losses under the LPT Agreement. As of December 31, 2015 , our estimate of ultimate expected contingent profit commission was $65.6 million , of which $36.4 million has been settled as of December 31, 2015 . 

Recoverability of Reinsurance 

Reinsurance makes the assuming reinsurer liable to the ceding company to the extent of the reinsurance; however, it does not discharge the ceding company from its primary liability to its policyholders in the event the reinsurer cannot or refuses to pay its obligations under such reinsurance. We monitor the financial strength of our reinsurers and do not believe that we are currently exposed to any material credit risk through our reinsurance arrangements because our reinsurance is recoverable from large, well-capitalized reinsurance companies. At December 31, 2015 , $1.4 billion &#32;was in trust accounts for reinsurance related to the LPT Agreement and an additional $3.7 million , not related to the LPT Agreement, was collateralized by cash or letters of credit. 

The following table provides certain information regarding our ceded reinsurance recoverables for losses and LAE as of December 31, 2015 .

A.M. Best's highest financial strength ratings for insurance companies are &#8220;A++&#8221; and &#8220; A+&#8221; (Superior), &#8220;A&#8221; and &#8220;A-&#8221; (Excellent), 

and "B++" and "B+" (Good). 

We review the aging of our reinsurance recoverables on a quarterly basis. At December 31, 2015 , 0.1% &#32;of our reinsurance recoverables on paid losses were greater than 90 days overdue. 

Terrorism Risk Insurance Program 

The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 (2002 Act) was initially enacted in November 2002, modified and extended in 2005, again in 2007, and most recently in 2015. Now known as the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2015 (TRIPRA of 2015), the program is designed to allow the insurance industry and the federal government to share losses from declared terrorist events according to a specific formula, and is in effect until December 31, 2020. 

The workers' compensation laws of the various states generally do not permit the exclusion of coverage for losses arising from terrorism or nuclear, biological, chemical, or radiological attacks. In addition, we are not able to limit our losses arising from any one catastrophe or from any one claimant. Our reinsurance policies exclude coverage for losses arising out of nuclear, biological, 

chemical, or radiological attacks. Under TRIPRA of 2015, federal protection may be provided to the insurance industry for certain acts of foreign and domestic terrorism, including nuclear, biological, chemical, or radiological attacks. 

The impacts of any future terrorist acts are unpredictable, and the ultimate impact on our insurance subsidiaries, if any, of losses from any future terrorist acts will depend upon their nature, extent, location, and timing. We monitor the geographic concentration of our policyholders to help mitigate the risk of loss from terrorist acts. 

Investments 

As of December 31, 2015 , the total amortized cost of our investment portfolio was $2.4 billion &#32;and the fair value of the portfolio was $2.5 billion . These investments provide a source of income, which may fluctuate with changes in interest rates and our current investment strategies that may also impact the fair value of our portfolio. Our investment strategy balances consideration of duration, yield, and credit risk. 

We seek to maximize total investment returns within the constraints of prudent portfolio management. The asset allocation is reevaluated by management and reviewed by the Finance Committee of the Board of Directors on a quarterly basis. We employ Conning Inc. (Conning) as our independent investment manager. Conning follows our written investment guidelines based upon strategies approved by our Board of Directors. We also utilize Conning's investment advisory services. These services include investment accounting and portfolio modeling using Dynamic Financial Analysis (DFA). The DFA tool is utilized in developing a tailored set of portfolio targets and objectives, which in turn, are considered when constructing an optimal portfolio. 

Additional information regarding our investment portfolio, including our approach to managing investment risk, is set forth under &#8220;Item 7 &#8211;Management's Discussion and Analysis of Consolidated Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8211;Liquidity and Capital Resources &#8211;Investments&#8221; and &#8220;Item 7A &#8211;Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.&#8221; 

Marketing and Distribution 

We market our workers' compensation insurance products through independent local, regional, and national agents and brokers and through alternative distribution channels, including our partner ADP, Inc. (ADP) and national, regional, and local trade groups and associations. 

Independent Insurance Agents and Brokers 

We establish and maintain strong, long-term relationships with independent insurance agencies that actively market our products and services. We offer ease of doing business, provide responsive service, and pay competitive commissions. Our sales representatives and underwriters work closely with independent agencies to market and underwrite our business. This results in enhanced understanding of the businesses and risks we underwrite and the needs of prospective customers. We do not delegate underwriting authority to agents or brokers. We are not dependent on any one agency and the loss of any one agency would not be material. 

We had 5,123 &#32;independent agencies that marketed and sold our insurance products at December 31, 2015 . Independent agencies generated 75.8% , 76.2% , and 76.7% &#32;of in-force premiums at December 31, 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 , respectively, and our largest agency generated 1.0% &#32;of in-force premiums at each of December 31, 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 . 

Alternative Distribution Channels 

We have developed and continue to add to important distribution channels for our products and services that serve as an alternative to our strong independent agency distribution channel. These alternative distribution channels utilize partnerships and alliances with entities such as payroll companies and health care and property and casualty insurers for which we provide workers&#8217; compensation insurance coverage. Our small business, low to medium hazard workers&#8217; compensation insurance products are jointly offered and marketed with and through our partners and alliances. 

Alternative distribution channels generated 23.9% , 23.6% , and 23.0% &#32;of our in-force premiums as of December 31, 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 , respectively. 

In 2015 , a concentration of our business was generated by ADP. ADP is the largest payroll services provider in the United States servicing small and medium-sized businesses. As part of its services, ADP sells our workers' compensation insurance product along with its payroll and accounting services through its insurance agency and field sales staff primarily to small businesses. ADP generated 11.5% , 11.3% , and 10.7% &#32;of our in-force premiums as of December 31, 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 , respectively. The majority of this business is written through ADP's small business unit, which has accounts of 1 to 50 employees. We pay ADP fees that are a percentage of premiums received for services provided through the ADP program. 

Our relationship with ADP is non-exclusive; however, we believe we are a key partner of ADP for our selected markets and classes of business. Our agreement with ADP may be terminated at any time by either party without cause upon 120 days notice. 

Competition and Market Conditions 

The insurance industry is highly competitive, and there is significant competition in the national workers' compensation industry that is based on price and quality of services. We compete with other specialty workers' compensation carriers, state agencies, multi-line insurance companies, professional employer organizations, self-insurance funds, and state insurance pools. Many of our competitors are significantly larger, are more widely known, and/or possess considerably greater financial resources. Our primary competitors in California are AmTrust Financial Services, Inc., Berkshire Hathaway Homestate Companies, California State Compensation Insurance Fund, The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc., ICW Group, and Travelers Insurance Group Holdings, Inc. 

The workers' compensation sector continued to see average medical and indemnity claims costs increase, while the industry overall saw a decline in claim frequency in 2014, the most recent year for which industry data is available. We continue to have concerns related to the volatility and uncertainty in the financial markets and economic conditions generally. 

In California, the Workers' Compensation Insurance Rating Bureau (WCIRB) reported indemnity claim frequency for accident years 2013 and 2014 continued to increase, contrary to the trends observed in other states. The WCIRB attributed the elevated claim frequency in 2013 and 2014 to late reported claims, cumulative trauma injuries, and claims from the Los Angeles Basin. 

Regulation 

State Insurance Regulation 

Insurance companies are subject to regulation and supervision by the insurance regulator in the state in which they are domiciled and, to a lesser extent, other states in which they conduct business. Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the states in which our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled or transact business. These state agencies have broad regulatory, supervisory, and administrative powers, including among other things, the power to grant and revoke licenses to transact business, license agencies, set the standards of solvency to be met and maintained, determine the nature of, and limitations on, investments and dividends, approve policy forms and rates in some states, periodically examine financial statements, determine the form and content of required financial statements, set the rates that we may charge in some states, and periodically examine market conduct. 

Detailed annual and quarterly financial statements, prepared in accordance with statutory accounting principles (SAP), and other reports are required to be filed with the insurance regulator in each of the states in which we are licensed to transact business. The California Department of Insurance (California DOI), Florida Office of Insurance Regulation (Florida OIR), and Nevada Division of Insurance (Nevada DOI) periodically examine the statutory financial statements of their respective domiciliary insurance companies. In 2015, the California DOI and Nevada DOI completed financial examinations for ECIC and EICN, respectively. There were no material findings. The Florida OIR is in the process of completing its regularly scheduled exams of EPIC and EAC. 

Many states have laws and regulations that limit an insurer's ability to withdraw from a particular market. For example, states may limit an insurer's ability to cancel or not renew policies. Furthermore, certain states prohibit an insurer from withdrawing one or more lines of business from the state, except pursuant to a plan that is approved by the state insurance regulator. The state insurance regulator may disapprove a plan that may lead to market disruption. We are subject to laws and regulations of this type, and these laws and regulations may restrict our ability to exit unprofitable markets. 

Holding Company Regulation. &#32;&#32;Nearly all states have enacted legislation that regulates insurance holding company systems. Each insurance company in a holding company system is required to register with the insurance regulator of its state of domicile and furnish information concerning the operations of companies within the holding company system that may materially affect the operations, management or financial condition of the insurers within the system. All transactions within a holding company system affecting an insurer must have fair and reasonable terms, the charges or fees for services performed must be reasonable, the insurer's total statutory surplus following any transaction must be both reasonable in relation to its outstanding liabilities and adequate for its needs, and are subject to other standards and requirements established by law and regulation. Notice to state insurance regulators is required prior to the consummation of certain affiliated and other transactions involving our insurance subsidiaries and such transactions may be disapproved by the state insurance regulators. 

Pursuant to applicable insurance holding company laws, EICN is required to register with the Nevada DOI, ECIC is required to register with the California DOI, and EPIC and EAC are required to register with the Florida OIR. Under these laws, the respective state insurance departments may examine us at any time, require disclosure of material transactions and require prior notice for, or approval of, certain transactions. 

Change of Control. &#32;&#32;Our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled in Florida, California and Nevada. The insurance laws of these states generally require that any person seeking to acquire control of a domestic insurance company obtain the prior approval of the state's insurance commissioner. In Florida, "control" is generally presumed to exist through the direct or indirect ownership of 5% or more of the voting securities of a domestic insurance company or of any entity that controls a domestic insurance company. In California and Nevada, "control" is presumed to exist through the direct or indirect ownership of 10% or more of the voting 

securities of a domestic insurance company or of any entity that controls a domestic insurance company. In addition, insurance laws in many states in which we are licensed require pre-notification to the state's insurance commissioner of a change in control of a non-domestic insurance company licensed in those states. 

Statutory Accounting and Solvency Regulations. State insurance regulators closely monitor the financial condition of insurance companies reflected in financial statements based on SAP and can impose significant financial and operating restrictions on an insurance company that becomes financially impaired under SAP guidelines. State insurance regulators can generally impose restrictions or conditions on the activities of a financially impaired insurance company, including: the transfer or disposition of assets; the withdrawal of funds from bank accounts; payment of dividends or other distributions; the extension of credit or the advancement of loans; and investments of funds, including business acquisitions or combinations. 

Financial, Dividend, and Investment Restrictions. State laws require insurance companies to maintain minimum levels of surplus and place limits on the amount of premiums a company may write based on the amount of that company's surplus. These limitations may restrict the rate at which our insurance operations can grow. 

State laws also require insurance companies to establish reserves for payments of policyholder liabilities and impose restrictions on the kinds of assets in which insurance companies may invest. These restrictions may require us to invest in assets more conservatively than we would if we were not subject to state law restrictions and may prevent us from obtaining as high a return on our assets as we might otherwise be able to realize absent the restrictions. 

The ability of EHI to pay dividends on our common stock and to pay other expenses will be dependent to a significant extent upon the ability of EICN and EPIC to pay dividends to their immediate holding company, Employers Group, Inc. (EGI) and, in turn, the ability of EGI to pay dividends to EHI. Additional information regarding financial, dividend, and investment restrictions is set forth in Note 15 &#32;in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Insurance Assessments. All of the states where our insurance subsidiaries are licensed to transact business require property and casualty insurers doing business within the state to pay various insurance assessments. We accrue a liability for estimated insurance assessments as direct premiums are written, losses are recorded, or as other events occur in accordance with various states' laws and regulations, and defer these costs and recognize them as an expense as the related premiums are earned. Various mechanisms exist in some of these states for assessed insurance companies to recover certain assessments. Additional information regarding insurance assessments is set forth in Note 12 &#32;in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Pooling Arrangements. As a condition to conduct business in some states, insurance companies are required to participate in mandatory workers' compensation shared market mechanisms, or pooling arrangements, which provide workers' compensation insurance coverage to private businesses that are otherwise unable to obtain coverage due, for example, to their prior loss experiences. 

The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC). The NAIC is a group formed by state insurance regulators to discuss issues and formulate policy with respect to regulation, reporting, and accounting of and by U.S. insurance companies. Although the NAIC has no legislative authority and insurance companies are at all times subject to the laws of their respective domiciliary states and, to a lesser extent, other states in which they conduct business, the NAIC is influential in determining the form in which insurance laws are enacted. Model Insurance Laws, Regulations, and Guidelines (Model Laws) have been promulgated by the NAIC as a minimum standard by which state regulatory systems and regulations are measured. Adoption of state laws that provide for substantially similar regulations to those described in the Model Laws is a requirement for accreditation of state insurance regulatory agencies by the NAIC. 

Under the Model Laws, insurers are required to maintain minimum levels of capital based on their investments and operations. These risk-based capital (RBC) requirements provide a standard by which regulators can assess the adequacy of an insurance company's capital and surplus relative to its operations. An insurance company must maintain capital and surplus of at least 200% of the RBC computed by the NAIC's RBC model, known as the &#8220;Authorized Control Level&#8221; of RBC. At December 31, 2015 , each of our insurance subsidiaries had total adjusted capital in excess of the minimum RBC requirements. 

The key financial ratios of the NAIC's Insurance Regulatory Information System (IRIS) were developed to assist state regulators in overseeing the financial condition of insurance companies. These ratios are reviewed by financial examiners of the NAIC and state insurance regulators for the purposes of detecting financial distress and preventing insolvency and to select those companies that merit highest priority in the allocation of the regulators' resources. IRIS identifies 13 key financial ratios and specifies a &#8220;usual range&#8221; for each. Departure from the usual ranges on four or more of the ratios can lead to inquiries from individual state insurance regulators as to certain aspects of an insurer's business. None of our insurance subsidiaries are currently subject to any action by any state regulator with respect to IRIS ratios.
