 Item 1. Business 

General 

Group 1 Automotive, Inc., a Delaware corporation organized in 1995, is a leading operator in the automotive retail industry. As of December 31, 2015 , we owned and operated 199 franchises, representing 32 brands of automobiles, at 152 dealership locations and 35 collision centers worldwide. We own 151 &#32;franchises at 116 &#32;dealership locations and 28 collision service centers in the United States of America (&#8220;U.S.&#8221;), 25 &#32;franchises at 17 &#32;dealership locations and six &#32;collision centers in the United Kingdom (&#8220;U.K.&#8221;) and 23 &#32;franchises at 19 &#32;dealership locations and one &#32;collision center in Brazil. Through our dealerships, we sell new and used cars and light trucks; arrange related vehicle financing; sell service and insurance contracts; provide automotive maintenance and repair services; and sell vehicle parts. Our operations are primarily located in major metropolitan areas in Alabama, California, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Mississippi, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Oklahoma, South Carolina, and Texas in the U.S., in 15 &#32;towns in the U.K., and in key metropolitan markets in the states of Sao Paulo, Parana and Mato Grosso do Sul in Brazil. 

As of December 31, 2015 , our U.S. retail network consisted of the following two regions (with the number of dealerships they comprised): (a) the East ( 39 &#32;dealerships in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Mississippi, New Hampshire, New Jersey, and South Carolina) and (b) the West ( 77 dealerships in California, Kansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Texas). Each U.S. region is managed by a regional vice president who reports directly to our Chief Executive Officer and is responsible for the overall performance of their region. The financial matters of each U.S. region are managed by a regional chief financial officer who reports directly to our Chief Financial Officer. In addition, as of December 31, 2015 , we had two international regions, one of which consisted of the 17 &#32;dealerships in the U.K. and the other of which consisted of the 19 &#32;dealerships in Brazil. Our international regions are also managed locally with direct reporting responsibilities to our corporate management team. 

As discussed in more detail in Note 2 of our Consolidated Financial Statements, &#8220;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates,&#8221; all of our operating subsidiaries are aligned into one of four operating segments. Our financial information, including our revenues from external customers, a measure of profit or loss, and total assets, is included in our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes beginning on page F-1. 

Business Strategy 

Our business strategy is to leverage what we believe to be one of our key strengths &#8212; the talent of our people to: (a) sell new and used cars and light trucks; (b) arrange related vehicle financing, service and insurance contracts; (c) provide automotive maintenance and repair services; and (d) sell vehicle parts via an expanding network of franchised dealerships located primarily in growing regions of the U.S., the U.K. and Brazil. We believe that we have developed a distinguished management team with substantial industry expertise. With our management structure and level of executive talent, we plan to continue empowering the operators of our dealerships to make appropriate decisions to grow their respective dealership operations and to control fixed and variable costs. We believe this approach allows us to provide the best possible service to our customers, as well as attract and retain talented employees. 

We continue to primarily focus on the performance of our existing dealerships to achieve growth, capture market share, and maximize the investment return to our stockholders. For 2016 , we will primarily focus on five key areas as we continue to become a best-in-class automotive retailer. These areas are: 

&#8226; 

sustained growth of our higher margin parts and service business; 

&#8226; 

capture of additional new and used vehicle retail market share; 

&#8226; 

promotion of the customer experience and customer satisfaction; 

&#8226; 

improvement of operating efficiencies through further development of our operating model that promotes commonality of processes, systems and training and further leveraging of our cost base; and 

&#8226; 

enhancement of our current dealership portfolio by strategic acquisitions and improving or disposing of underperforming dealerships in the U.S., the U.K. and Brazil. 

Our focus on growth in our parts and service operations continues to hinge on targeted marketing efforts, strategic selling and operational efficiencies, as well as capital investments designed to support our growth targets. In our new and used retail vehicle operations, our efforts are centered on the efficient and effective use of technology and advertising to enhance our sales efforts. We intend to make resource investments that are focused on the customer experience and customer satisfaction in all areas of our business. We made significant changes in our operating model during the last five &#32;years, which were designed to 

reduce variable and fixed expenses, appropriately leverage our scale and generate operating efficiencies. As our business grows in 2016 &#32;and beyond, we intend to manage our costs carefully and to look for opportunities to improve our operating efficiencies. We continue to look for opportunities to improve our processes and disseminate best practices. We believe that our management structure supports more rapid decision making and facilitates an efficient and effective roll-out of new processes. We continue our efforts to fully leverage our scale, reduce costs, enhance internal controls, and enable further growth and, as such, we are taking steps to standardize key operating processes. We are constantly evaluating opportunities to improve the profitability of our dealerships. 

In 2015 , we completed three &#32;dealership acquisitions in the U.S., which had an aggregate of $340.0 million &#32;in expected annualized revenues estimated at the time of acquisition. We believe that substantial opportunities for growth through acquisitions remain in our industry. An absolute acquisition target has not been established for 2016 , but we expect to acquire dealerships that provide attractive returns on investment. We believe that as of December 31, 2015 , we have sufficient financial resources to support additional acquisitions. We plan to focus our growth in geographically diverse areas with positive economic outlooks over the longer-term. Further, we intend to critically evaluate our return on invested capital in our current dealership portfolio for disposition opportunities. In 2015, we disposed of two &#32;dealerships and one &#32;franchise in the U.S. and terminated two &#32;franchises in Brazil, with aggregate annual revenues of approximately $115.0 million . For more information on our acquisitions and dispositions, including those occurring in 2015 , see &#8220;Acquisition and Divestiture Program&#8221; below. 

Dealership Operations 

Our operations are located in geographically diverse markets that extend domestically across 14 &#32;states and internationally in the U.K. and Brazil.

Each of our local operations has a management structure designed to promote and reward entrepreneurial spirit and the achievement of team goals. The general manager of each dealership, with assistance from the managers of new vehicle sales, used vehicle sales, parts, service, and finance and insurance, is ultimately responsible for the operation, personnel and financial performance of the dealership. Our dealerships are operated as distinct profit centers, and our general managers have a reasonable degree of empowerment within our organization. In the U.S., each general manager reports to one of our market directors or one of two regional vice presidents. Our U.S. regional vice presidents report directly to our Chief Executive Officer and are responsible for the overall performance of their regions, as well as for overseeing the market directors and dealership general managers that report to them. Our U.K. and Brazil operations are structured similarly, with a regional vice president reporting directly to our Chief Executive Officer. 

New Vehicle Retail Sales 

In 2015 , we sold or leased 174,614 &#32;new vehicles in retail transactions at our dealerships, representing 32 &#32;brands. Our retail sales of new vehicles accounted for 19.9% &#32;of our gross profit in 2015 . In addition to the profit related to the transactions, a typical new vehicle retail sale or lease may create the following additional profit opportunities for our dealerships: 

&#8226; 

manufacturer dealer incentives; 

&#8226; 

the resale of any used vehicle trade-in purchased by the dealership; 

&#8226; 

the sale of third-party finance, vehicle service and insurance contracts in connection with the retail sale; 

&#8226; 

the sale of accessories or after-market products; and 

&#8226; 

the service and repair of the vehicle both during and after the warranty period. 

We consider brand diversity to be one of our strengths. The following table sets forth new vehicle sales revenue by brand and the number of new vehicle retail units sold in the year ended, and the number of franchises we owned, as of December 31, 2015 : &#160;

Our new vehicle unit sales mix was affected by our acquisitions and dispositions during 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 . 

Some new vehicles we sell are purchased by customers under lease or lease-type financing arrangements with third-party lenders. New vehicle leases generally have shorter terms, bringing the customer back to the vehicle market, and our dealerships specifically, sooner than if the vehicle purchase was debt financed. In addition, leasing provides our dealerships with a steady supply of late-model, off-lease vehicles to be sold as used vehicles. Generally, leased vehicles remain under factory warranty, allowing the dealerships to provide repair services for the contract term. However, the penetration of finance and insurance product sales on leases tends to be less than in other financing arrangements (such as debt financed vehicles). We typically do not guarantee residual values on lease transactions. Lease vehicle unit sales represented 16.5%, 15.1% and 16.8% of our total new vehicle retail unit sales for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively. 

Used Vehicle Sales, Retail and Wholesale 

We sell used vehicles at each of our franchised dealerships. In 2015 , we sold or leased 124,153 &#32;used vehicles at our dealerships, and sold 57,226 &#32;used vehicles in wholesale markets. Our retail sales of used vehicles accounted for 11.7% &#32;of our gross profit in 2015 . Used vehicles sold at retail typically generate higher gross margins on a percentage basis than new vehicles primarily because of their relatively limited comparability, which is dependent on a vehicle&#8217;s age, mileage and condition, among other things. 

Valuations of used vehicles vary based on supply and demand factors, the level of new vehicle incentives, and the availability of retail financing and general economic conditions. Profit from the sale of used vehicles depends primarily on a dealership&#8217;s ability to obtain a high-quality supply of used vehicles at reasonable prices and to effectively manage that inventory. Our new vehicle operations provide our used vehicle operations with a large supply of generally high-quality trade-ins and off-lease vehicles, and are the best source of high-quality used vehicles. Our dealerships supplement their used vehicle inventory with purchases at auctions, including manufacturer-sponsored auctions available only to franchised dealers. We continue to extensively utilize a common used vehicle management software tool in all of our U.S. dealerships with the goal to enhance the management of used vehicle inventory, focusing on the more profitable retail used vehicle business and reducing our wholesale used vehicle business. This internet-based software tool is an integral part of our used vehicle process, enabling our managers to make used vehicle inventory decisions based on real time market valuation data. It also allows us to leverage our size and local market presence by expanding the pool from which used vehicles can be sold within a given market or region within the U.S., effectively broadening the demand for our used vehicle inventory. In addition, this software supports increased oversight of our assets in inventory, allowing us to better control our exposure to used vehicles, the values of which typically decline over time. 

In addition to active management of the quality and age of our used vehicle inventory, we are focused on increasing the total lifecycle profitability of our used vehicle operations by participating in manufacturer certification programs where available. Manufacturer certified pre-owned (&#8220;CPO&#8221;) vehicles offer customers in the U.S. and U.K. the opportunity to purchase a used vehicle that has passed a rigorous array of manufacturer-defined tests, and as a result, come with a manufacturer&#8217;s extended service warranty and potentially other benefits. With the extended service warranty, the sale of CPO vehicles tends to 

generate better service loyalty for the selling dealership. CPO vehicles typically cost more to recondition, but sell at a premium compared to other used vehicles and are available only from franchised new vehicle dealerships. In some cases, CPO vehicles are eligible for manufacturer support, such as subsidized finance rates and extension of the manufacturer warranty. Our CPO vehicle sales in the U.S. and U.K. represented 26.4% of total U.S and U.K. used retail sales in 2015 . CPO vehicles are not yet available in Brazil. 

Parts and Service Sales 

We sell replacement parts and provide maintenance and repair services at each of our franchised dealerships and provide collision restoration services at the 35 &#32;collision centers that we operate. Our parts and service business accounted for 41.9% &#32;of our gross profit in 2015 . We perform both warranty and non-warranty service work at our dealerships, primarily for the vehicle brand(s) sold at a particular location. Warranty, customer pay, collision and wholesale accounted for 20.4%, 44.5%, 14.0% and 21.1%, respectively, of the revenues from our parts and service business in 2015 . Our parts and service departments also perform used vehicle reconditioning and new vehicle enhancement services for which they realize a profit. However, the revenue for that internal work is eliminated from our parts and service revenue in the consolidation of our financial statements. 

The automotive repair industry is highly fragmented, with a significant number of independent maintenance and repair facilities in addition to those of the franchised dealerships. We believe, however, that the increasing complexity of new vehicles, especially in the area of electronics, has made it difficult for many independent repair shops to retain the expertise necessary to perform major or technical repairs. We have made investments in obtaining, training, and retaining qualified technicians to work in our service and repair facilities and in state of the art diagnostic and repair equipment to be utilized by these technicians. Additionally, manufacturers only permit warranty and recall work to be performed at franchised dealerships. Currently, a trend exists in the automobile industry towards longer new vehicle warranty periods and more diligence with manufacturer recalls. As a result, we believe that over time an increasing percentage of all repair work will be performed at franchised dealerships that have the sophisticated equipment and skilled personnel necessary to perform repairs and warranty work on today&#8217;s complex vehicles. 

Our strategy to capture an increasing share of the parts and service work performed by franchised dealerships and enhance profitability includes the following elements: 

&#8226; 

Focus on Customer Relationships; Emphasize Preventative Maintenance. Our dealerships seek to retain purchasers of new and used vehicle as customers of our parts and service departments. To accomplish this goal, we use computer systems that track the vehicle owners&#8217; maintenance records and provide advance notice to them when their vehicles are due for periodic service. Our use of computer-based customer relationship management tools increases the reach and effectiveness of our marketing efforts, allowing us to target our promotional offerings to areas in which service capacity is under-utilized or profit margins are greatest. We continue to train our service personnel to establish relationships with their service clients to promote a long-term business relationship. And, we are focused on enhancing access to our service facilities by providing patrons with readily-accessible means to schedule service appointments. We believe our parts and service activities are an integral part of the customer service experience, allowing us to maintain ongoing relationships with our dealerships&#8217; clients thereby deepening customer loyalty to the dealership as a whole. 

&#8226; 

Sell Vehicle Service Contracts in Conjunction with Vehicle Sales. Our finance and insurance sales departments attempt to connect new and used vehicle customers with vehicle service contracts, and thereby secure repeat customer business for our parts and service departments. 

&#8226; 

Efficient Management of Parts Inventory. Our dealerships&#8217; parts departments support their sales and service departments, selling factory-approved parts for the vehicle makes and models sold by a particular dealership. Parts are either used in repairs made in the service department, sold at retail to customers, or sold at wholesale to independent repair shops and other franchised dealerships. Our dealerships also frequently share parts with each other. Our dealerships employ parts managers who oversee parts inventories and sales. Software programs are used to monitor parts inventory, maximize sales, avoid obsolete and unused parts, and take advantage of manufacturer return procedures. 

&#8226; 

Expansion of Collision Center Operations . We plan to continue to grow our collision center operations. Expansion in this segment of the business is not restricted by franchise agreements or manufacturer relationships. We believe that our concentration of dealership operations in certain of the markets in which we operate significantly enhances the profit model. 

Finance and Insurance Sales 

Revenues from our finance and insurance operations consist primarily of fees for arranging financing, and vehicle service and insurance contracts in connection with the retail purchase of a new or used vehicle. Our finance and insurance business 

accounted for 26.6% &#32;of our gross profit in 2015 . We offer a wide variety of third-party finance, vehicle service and insurance products in a convenient manner and at competitive prices. To increase transparency to our customers, we offer all of our products on menus that display pricing and other information, allowing customers to choose the products that suit their needs. 

Financing. We arrange third-party purchase and lease financing for our customers. In return, we receive a fee from the third-party finance company upon completion of the financing. These third-party finance companies include manufacturers&#8217; captive finance subsidiaries, selected commercial banks and a variety of other third-parties, including credit unions and regional auto finance companies. Generally, we do not retain substantial credit risk after a customer has received financing, though we do retain limited credit risk in some circumstances. The fees we receive from the third-party finance companies are subject to chargeback, or repayment, to the finance company, if a customer defaults or prepays the retail installment contract, typically during some limited time period at the beginning of the contract term. We have negotiated incentive programs with some finance companies pursuant to which we receive additional fees upon reaching a certain volume of business. 

Extended Warranty, Vehicle Service and Insurance Products. We offer our customers a variety of vehicle warranty and extended protection products in connection with purchases of new and used vehicles, including: 

&#8226; 

extended warranties; 

&#8226; 

maintenance, or vehicle service, products and programs; 

&#8226; 

guaranteed asset protection insurance, which covers the shortfall between a customer&#8217;s contract balance and insurance payoff in the event of a total vehicle loss; and 

&#8226; 

lease &#8220;wear and tear&#8221; insurance. 

The products our dealerships offer are generally underwritten and administered by independent third parties, including the vehicle manufacturers&#8217; captive finance subsidiaries. Under our arrangements with the providers of these products, we either sell these products on a straight commission basis, or we sell the product, recognize commission and participate in future underwriting profit, if any, pursuant to a retrospective commission arrangement. These commissions may be subject to chargeback, in full or in part, if the contract is terminated prior to its scheduled maturity. 

New and Used Vehicle Inventory Financing 

Our dealerships finance their inventory purchases through the floorplan portion of our revolving credit facility and three separate floorplan credit facility arrangements with manufacturers that we represent, BMW, Volkswagen, and Ford, in addition to credit facilities we have with financial institutions in Brazil. Our revolving syndicated credit facility matures in June 2018 &#32;and provides a total borrowing capacity of $1.7 billion , (the &#8220;Revolving Credit Facility&#8221;). We utilize our Floorplan Line (as defined below) to finance up to 80% of the value of our used vehicle inventory in the U.S., and up to 100% of the value of all new vehicle inventory in the U.S., other than new vehicles purchased from Ford. We can expand the Revolving Credit Facility to its maximum commitment of $1.95 billion , subject to participating lender approval. The Revolving Credit Facility consists of two tranches: a maximum of $1.6 billion &#32;for vehicle inventory financing (&#8220;Floorplan Line&#8221;), as well as a maximum of $320.0 million &#32;and a minimum of $100.0 million &#32;for working capital and general corporate purposes, including acquisitions (&#8220;Acquisition Line&#8221;). The capacity under these two tranches can be re-designated within the overall $1.7 billion &#32;commitment, subject to the aforementioned limits. However, the amount of available borrowing capacity under the Acquisition Line may be limited from time to time based upon the available borrowing base calculation within the debt covenants under the Revolving Credit Facility. 

We have a floorplan arrangement with Ford Motor Credit Company (&#8220;FMCC&#8221;) that provides $300.0 million &#32;of floorplan financing capacity (&#8220;FMCC Facility&#8221;). We use the funds available under this arrangement to exclusively finance our U.S. inventories of new Ford vehicles sold by the lender&#8217;s manufacturer affiliate. The FMCC Facility is an evergreen arrangement that may be canceled with 30 days notice by either party. Should the FMCC Facility no longer be available to us for financing of our new U.S. Ford inventory, we could utilize the available capacity under our Floorplan Line to finance our new Ford vehicle inventory. 

We also finance certain rental vehicles in the U.S. through separate arrangements with the respective automobile manufacturers. In addition, we utilize credit facilities with BMW Financial Services, Volkswagen Finance, and FMCC for the financing of new, used, and rental vehicle inventories associated with our U.K. operations. 

In addition, we have credit facilities with financial institutions in Brazil, most of which are affiliated with the manufacturers, for the financing of new, used and rental vehicle inventories related to our Brazil operations. These facilities may be canceled with notice by either party and bear interest at a benchmark rate, plus a surcharge that varies based upon the type of vehicle being financed. 

Acquisition and Divestiture Program 

We pursue an acquisition and divestiture program focused on the following objectives: 

&#8226; 

enhancing brand and geographic diversity with a primary focus on import and luxury brands; 

&#8226; 

creating economies of scale; 

&#8226; 

delivering an attractive return on investment; and 

&#8226; 

eliminating underperforming dealerships. 

Since our inception, we have grown our business primarily through acquisitions. Over the five-year period from January 1, 2011 &#32;through December 31, 2015 , we: 

&#8226; 

purchased 87 franchises with expected annual revenues, estimated at the time of acquisition, of $3.7 billion; 

&#8226; 

disposed of or terminated 32 franchises with annual revenues of approximately $1.0 billion; and 

&#8226; 

were granted five new franchises by vehicle manufacturers with expected annual revenues, estimated at the time of grant, of $118.0 million. 

Acquisition Strategy . We seek to acquire large, profitable, well-established dealerships and franchises that are leaders in their markets to: 

&#8226; 

expand into geographic areas we currently do not serve; 

&#8226; 

expand our brand, product, and service offerings in our existing markets; 

&#8226; 

capitalize on economies of scale in our existing markets; and/or 

&#8226; 

increase operating efficiency and cost savings in areas such as used vehicle sourcing, advertising, purchasing, data processing, personnel utilization, and the cost of floorplan financing. 

We typically pursue dealerships with superior operational management, whom we seek to retain. By retaining existing personnel who have experience and in-depth knowledge of their local market, we believe that we can mitigate the risks involved with employing and training new and untested personnel. In addition, our acquisition strategy targets the purchase of the related real estate to provide maximum operating flexibility. 

We focus on the acquisition of dealerships or groups of dealerships that we believe offer opportunities for higher returns, and particularly on brands which provide growth opportunities for our parts and service operations and strengthen our operations in geographic regions in which we currently operate with attractive long-term economic prospects. 

Recent Acquisitions. In 2015 , we acquired three &#32;dealerships, representing five franchises, in the U.S. with expected annualized revenues, estimated at the time of acquisition, of $340.0 million . 

Divestiture Strategy. We continually review the investments in our dealership portfolio for disposition opportunities, based upon a number of criteria, including: 

&#8226; 

the rate of return on our capital investment over a period of time; 

&#8226; 

location of the dealership in relation to existing markets and our ability to leverage our cost structure; 

&#8226; 

potential future capital investment requirements; 

&#8226; 

the brand; and 

&#8226; 

existing real estate obligations, coupled with our ability to exit those obligations or identify an alternate use. 

While it is our desire to only acquire profitable, well-established dealerships, at times we have been requested, in connection with the acquisition of a particular dealership group, to acquire dealerships that do not fit our acquisition strategy. We acquire such dealerships with the understanding that we may need to divest some or all of them at some future time. The costs associated with such potential divestitures are included in our analysis of whether we acquire all dealerships in the same acquisition. Additionally, we may acquire a dealership whose profitability is marginal, but which we believe can be increased through various factors, such as: (a) change in management, (b) increase or improvement in facility operations, (c) relocation of facility based on demographic changes, (d) reduction in costs, and/or (e) sales training. If, after a period of time, a dealership&#8217;s profitability does not positively respond, we will seek to sell the dealership to a third party, or, in a rare case, surrender the franchise back to the manufacturer. In conjunction with the disposition of certain of our dealerships, we may also dispose of the associated real estate. Management constantly monitors the performance of all of our dealerships, and routinely assesses the need for divestiture. In connection with divestitures, we are sometimes required to incur additional charges associated with 

lease terminations or the impairment of long-lived assets. We continue to rationalize our dealership portfolio and focus on increasing the overall profitability of our operations. 

Recent Dispositions. During 2015 , we disposed of two &#32;dealerships and one &#32;franchise in the U.S. and terminated two &#32;franchises in Brazil with annualized revenues of approximately $115.0 million . 

Competition 

We operate in a highly competitive industry. In each of our markets, consumers have a number of choices in deciding where to purchase a new or used vehicle and how the purchase will be financed. Consumers also have options for the purchase of related parts and accessories, as well as the service and repair of vehicles. 

In the U.S., according to The National Automobile Dealers Association, there were approximately 16,396 franchised automobile dealerships as of January 1, 2015 , which was down from 17,665 as of January 1, 2014 . 

In the U.K., according to the National Franchised Dealers Association, there were approximately 4,127 franchised dealerships as of January 1, 2015, which was down from 4,377 as of January 1, 2014. 

In Brazil, according to The National Association of Automobile Manufacturers, there were approximately 4,364 franchised automobile dealerships as of January 1, 2014, which was up from 4,249 as of January 1, 2013. 

Our competitive success depends, in part, on national and regional automobile-buying trends, local and regional economic factors, and other regional competitive pressures. Conditions and competitive pressures affecting the markets in which we operate, or in any new markets we enter, could adversely affect us, although the retail automobile industry as a whole might not be affected. Some of our competitors may have greater financial, marketing and personnel resources, and lower overhead and sales costs than we do. We cannot guarantee that our operating performance and our acquisition or disposition strategies will be more effective than the strategies of our competitors. 

New and Used Vehicles. We believe the principal competitive factors in the automotive retailing business are location, suitability of the facility, on-site management, the acceptance of a franchise to the market in which it is located, service, price, and selection. In the new vehicle market, our dealerships compete with other franchised dealerships in their market areas, as well as auto brokers, leasing companies, and internet companies that provide referrals to, or broker vehicle sales with, other dealerships or customers. We are subject to competition from dealers that sell the same brands of new vehicles that we sell and from dealers that sell other brands of new vehicles that we do not sell in a particular market. Our new vehicle dealer competitors also have franchise agreements with the various vehicle manufacturers and, as such, generally have access to new vehicles on the same terms as we do. We do not have any cost advantage in purchasing new vehicles from vehicle manufacturers, and our franchise agreements do not grant us the exclusive right to sell a manufacturer&#8217;s product within a given geographic area. 

In the used vehicle market, our dealerships compete both in their local market and nationally, including over the internet, with other franchised dealers, large multi-location used vehicle retailers, local independent used vehicle dealers, automobile rental agencies, and private parties for the supply and resale of used vehicles. 

Parts, Service and Collision. We believe the principal competitive factors in the parts and service business are the quality of customer service, the use of factory-approved replacement parts, familiarity with a manufacturer&#8217;s brands and models, convenience, access to technology required for certain repairs and services (e.g., software patches, diagnostic equipment, etc.), location, price, the competence of technicians, and the availability of training programs to enhance such expertise. In the parts and service market, our dealerships compete with other franchised dealers to perform warranty repairs and sell factory replacement parts. Our dealerships also compete with other automobile dealers, franchised and independent service center chains, and independent repair shops for non-warranty repair and maintenance business. In addition, our dealerships sell replacement and aftermarket parts both locally and nationally over the internet in competition with franchised and independent retail and wholesale parts outlets. A number of regional or national chains offer selected parts and services at prices that may be lower than ours. Our collision centers compete with other large, multi-location companies, as well as local, independent, collision service operations. 

Finance and Insurance. We face competition in arranging financing for our customers&#8217; vehicle purchases from a broad range of financial institutions. We believe the principal competitive factors in the finance and insurance business are convenience, interest rates, product availability, product knowledge and flexibility in contract length. Many financial institutions now offer finance and insurance products over the internet, which may reduce our profits from the sale of these products. We may be charged back for unearned financing, insurance contracts or vehicle service contract fees in the event of early termination of the contracts by customers. 

Acquisitions. We compete with other national dealer groups and individual investors for acquisitions. Increased competition, especially for certain luxury and import brands, may raise the cost of acquisitions. We cannot guarantee that there 

will be sufficient opportunities to complete desired acquisitions, nor are we able to guarantee that we will be able to complete acquisitions on terms acceptable to us. 

Financing Arrangements and Indebtedness 

As of December 31, 2015 , our outstanding indebtedness, coupled with lease and other obligations totaled $3,637.2 million , including the following: 

&#8226; 

$1,150.8 million &#32;under the Floorplan Line of our Revolving Credit Facility; 

&#8226; 

$318.2 million &#32;of future commitments under various operating leases; 

&#8226; 

$541.3 million &#32;in carrying value of 5.00% senior notes due 2022 (&#8220;5.00% Notes&#8221;); 

&#8226; 

$296.3 million &#32;in carrying value of 5.25% senior notes due 2023 (&#8220;5.25% Notes&#8221;); 

&#8226; 

$241.8 million &#32;of term loans, entered into independently with three of our manufacturer-affiliated finance partners, Toyota Motor Credit Corporation (&#8220;TMCC&#8221;), BMW Financial Services NA, LLC (&#8220;BMWFS&#8221;), and FMCC, as well as other third-party financial institutions, primarily to finance the purchase of real estate; 

&#8226; 

$171.3 million &#32;under our FMCC Facility; 

&#8226; 

$196.4 million &#32;under floorplan notes payable to various manufacturer affiliates and third-party financial institutions for foreign and rental vehicles; 

&#8226; 

$54.7 million &#32;under our real estate credit facility (&#8220;Real Estate Credit Facility&#8221;); 

&#8226; 

$51.9 million &#32;of capital lease obligations related to real estate, as well as $35.6 million &#32;of estimated interest; 

&#8226; 

$72.6 million &#32;of various other debt and other capital lease obligations; 

&#8226; 

$45.8 million &#32;of estimated future net obligations from interest rate risk management activities; as of December 31, 2015, the estimated fair value of such obligations was $31.2 million ; 

&#8226; 

$374.4 million &#32;of estimated interest payments on floorplan notes payable and other long-term debt obligations; 

&#8226; 

$41.9 million &#32;of letters of credit, to collateralize certain obligations, issued under the Acquisition Line; and 

&#8226; 

$44.2 million &#32;of other short and long-term purchase commitments. 

As of December 31, 2015 , we had the following amounts available for additional borrowings under our various credit facilities: 

&#8226; 

$229.2 million &#32;under the Floorplan Line of our Revolving Credit Facility, including $110.8 million &#32;of immediately available funds; 

&#8226; 

$278.2 million &#32;under the Acquisition Line of our Revolving Credit Facility, which is limited based upon a borrowing base calculation within certain debt covenants under the Revolving Credit Facility; and 

&#8226; 

$128.7 million &#32;under our FMCC Facility, including $25.5 million &#32;of immediately available funds. 

In addition, the indentures relating to our other debt instruments allow us to incur additional indebtedness and enter into additional operating leases, subject to certain conditions. 

For additional information regarding our financing arrangements and indebtedness, please read Part II, &#8220;Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources.&#8221; 

Stock Repurchase Program 

From time to time, our Board of Directors gives authorization to repurchase shares of our common stock, subject to the restrictions of various debt agreements and our judgment. We are limited under the terms of the Revolving Credit Facility, Real Estate Credit Facility, 5.00% Senior Notes and 5.25% Senior Notes in our ability to, among other things, repurchase shares of our outstanding common stock and make payments of cash dividends to our stockholders. As of December 31, 2015 , the most stringent of the restricted payment baskets was under our Revolving Credit Facility and Real Estate Credit Facility (the &#8220;Restricted Payment Basket&#8221;), limiting us to $144.7 million &#32;in restricted payments. The Restricted Payment Basket will increase in the future periods by 50.0% of our future cumulative net income, adjusted to exclude the Company&#8217;s foreign operations, non-cash interest expense, non-cash asset impairment charges, and non-cash stock-based compensation, plus the net proceeds received from the sale of our capital stock, and decrease by the amount of future payments for cash dividends and share repurchases . 

As of December 31, 2014, $99.4 million of share repurchases remained available, under the then-current authorization. In November 2015, a new authorization of $100.0 million was approved by the Board of Directors, replacing the prior authorization that had $23.8 million remaining. During 2015, we repurchased 1,176,908 shares at an average price of $82.82 per share, for a total of $97.5 million, leaving $78.2 million available for future repurchases under the Board of Director&#8217;s November 2015 authorization. In February 2016, the Board of Directors approved a new authorization of $150.0 million, replacing the authorization remaining at that time. Future repurchases are subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors after considering our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, capital requirements, existing debt covenants, outlook for our business, general business conditions and other factors. 

Dividends 

During 2015 , our Board of Directors approved four quarterly cash dividends. The first two dividends were approved and paid at $0.20 per share, the third was increased to $0.21 per share and the fourth one was increased to $0.22 per share for a total of $0.83 &#32;per share, or $19.9 million , for the year ending December 31, 2015 . The payment of dividends in the future is subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors, after considering our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, capital requirements, outlook for our business, general business conditions, the political and legislative environments, and other factors. As noted above, we are also limited in our ability to make cash dividend payments to our stockholders under the terms of several of our debt financing arrangements, the most restrictive of which is the Restricted Payment Basket. 

Relationships and Agreements with our Manufacturers 

Each of our U.S. dealerships operates under one or more franchise agreements with vehicle manufacturers (or authorized distributors). The franchise agreements grant the franchised automobile dealership a non-exclusive right to sell the manufacturer&#8217;s or distributor&#8217;s brand of vehicles and offer related parts and service within a specified market area. These franchise agreements grant our dealerships the right to use the manufacturer&#8217;s or distributor&#8217;s trademarks in connection with their operations, and impose numerous operational requirements and restrictions relating to, among other things: 

&#8226; 

inventory levels; 

&#8226; 

working capital levels; 

&#8226; 

the sales process; 

&#8226; 

minimum sales performance requirements; 

&#8226; 

customer satisfaction standards; 

&#8226; 

marketing and branding; 

&#8226; 

facility standards and signage; 

&#8226; 

personnel; 

&#8226; 

changes in management; 

&#8226; 

change in control; and 

&#8226; 

monthly financial reporting. 

Our dealerships&#8217; franchise agreements are for various terms, ranging from one year to indefinite. Each of our franchise agreements may be terminated or not renewed by the manufacturer for a variety of reasons, including unapproved changes of ownership or management and performance deficiencies in such areas as sales volume, sales effectiveness, and customer satisfaction. In most cases, manufacturers have renewed the franchises upon expiration so long as the dealership is in compliance with the terms of the agreement. From time to time, certain manufacturers may assert sales and customer satisfaction performance deficiencies under the terms of our framework and franchise agreements. We work with these manufacturers to address any performance issues. 

In general, the U.S. jurisdictions in which we operate have automotive dealership franchise laws that provide that, notwithstanding the terms of any franchise agreement, it is unlawful for a manufacturer to terminate or not renew a franchise unless &#8220;good cause&#8221; exists. It generally is difficult for a manufacturer to terminate, or not renew, a franchise under these laws, which were designed to protect dealers. Though unsuccessful to date, manufacturers&#8217; lobbying efforts may lead to the repeal or revision of dealer laws. If dealer laws are repealed in the U.S. states in which we operate, manufacturers may be able to terminate our franchises without providing advance notice, an opportunity to cure or showing of good cause. Without the protection of dealer laws, it may also be more difficult for our dealers to renew their franchise agreements upon expiration. Further, U.S. federal law, including any federal bankruptcy law, may preempt U.S. state law and allow manufacturers greater freedom to terminate or not renew franchises. 

The U.K. generally does not have automotive dealership franchise laws and, as a result, our U.K. dealerships operate without these types of specific protections. However, similar protections may be available as a matter of general U.K. contractual law. In addition, our U.K. dealerships are subject to European Union (&#8220;EU&#8221;) and U.K. antitrust rules prohibiting certain restrictions on the sale of new vehicles and spare parts and on the provision of repairs and maintenance across the EU. For example, authorized dealers are generally able to, subject to manufacturer facility requirements, relocate or add additional facilities throughout the EU, offer multiple brands in the same facility, allow the operation of service facilities independent of new car sales facilities and ease restrictions on cross supplies (including on transfers of dealerships) between existing authorized dealers within the EU. However, certain restrictions on dealerships may be permissible provided the conditions set out in the relevant EU Block Exemption Regulations are met. 

The sale of vehicles in Brazil is regulated by federal law, commonly referred to in Brazil as the Ferrari Law. Such law sets forth the terms and conditions of distribution agreements executed among manufacturers and dealerships, specifically with regard to the distribution of cars, trucks, buses, tractors, motorbikes and similar vehicles. In addition, the Ferrari Law establishes the geographical area of a dealership, termination of distribution agreements and their consequences, among other things. Any contractual provision that conflicts with the Ferrari Law is considered void in Brazil. The distribution agreements contemplate the commercialization of vehicles and components fabricated by the manufacturer, the rendering of technical assistance relating to such products and the usage by the dealerships of the manufacturers&#8217; brand. According to the Ferrari Law, distribution agreements may be executed for either a determined or an undetermined term. In the case of a distribution agreement executed for a determined term, its initial term may not be less than 5 years. At the end of this initial 5 years term, such distribution agreement will be automatically converted into an undetermined term distribution agreement, unless any of the parties thereto expressly waives such right with a 180 days prior notice. In the case of an early termination of a distribution agreement other than as a result of a persistent breach or force majeure, the Ferrari law entitles the non-breaching party to, among other things, certain termination payments. 

The U.S. economic recession, that began in 2008, caused domestic manufacturers to critically evaluate their respective dealer networks and terminate certain brands, and, as a result, the respective franchises. For example, General Motors chose to discontinue the Pontiac brand and, as a result, both of our Pontiac franchises were terminated. In addition, Ford chose to discontinue the Mercury brand and, as a result, all four of our Mercury franchises were terminated. Subject to similar future economic factors and material changes to the regulations discussed above, we generally expect our franchise agreements to survive for the foreseeable future and, when the agreements do not have indefinite terms, anticipate routine renewals of the agreements without substantial cost or modification. 

Our dealership service departments perform vehicle repairs and service for customers under manufacturer warranties. We are reimbursed for the repairs and service directly from the manufacturer. Some manufacturers offer rebates to new vehicle customers that we are required, under specific program rules, to adequately document, support, and typically are responsible for collecting. In addition, some manufacturers provide us with incentives to order and/or sell certain models and/or volumes of inventory over designated periods of time. Under the terms of our dealership franchise agreements, the respective manufacturers are able to perform warranty, incentive, and rebate audits and charge us back for unsupported or non-qualifying warranty repairs, rebates or incentives. 

In addition to the individual dealership franchise agreements discussed above, we have entered into framework agreements in the U.S. with most major vehicle manufacturers and distributors. These agreements impose a number of restrictions on our operations, including our ability to make acquisitions and obtain financing, and on our management. These agreements also impose change of control provisions related to the ownership of our common stock. For a discussion of these restrictions and the risks related to our relationships with vehicle manufacturers, please read &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors.&#8221;

Governmental Regulations 

Automotive and Other Laws and Regulations 

We operate in a highly regulated industry. A number of U.S. state and federal laws and regulations affect our business and the business of our manufacturers. In every U.S. state in which we operate, we must obtain various licenses in order to operate our businesses, including dealer, sales and finance, and insurance licenses issued by state regulatory authorities. Numerous laws and regulations govern our conduct of business, including those relating to our sales, operations, financing, insurance, advertising and employment practices. These laws and regulations include franchise laws and regulations, consumer protection laws, and other extensive laws and regulations applicable to new and used motor vehicle dealers, as well as a variety of other laws and regulations. These laws also include U.S. federal and U.S. state wage-hour, anti-discrimination and other employment practices laws. 

Our financing activities with customers are subject to U.S. federal truth-in-lending, consumer leasing, and equal credit opportunity laws and regulations, as well as state and local motor vehicle finance laws, installment finance laws, usury laws, and other installment sales laws and regulations. Some U.S. states regulate finance fees and charges that may be paid as a result of vehicle sales. Claims arising out of actual or alleged violations of law may be asserted against us, or our dealerships, by individuals or governmental entities and may expose us to significant damages or other penalties, including revocation or suspension of our licenses to conduct dealership operations and fines. 

Our U.S. operations are subject to the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act, Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards promulgated by the United States Department of Transportation and the rules and regulations of various state motor vehicle regulatory agencies. The imported automobiles we purchase in the U.S. are subject to United States customs duties, and in the ordinary course of our business we may, from time to time, be subject to claims for duties, penalties, liquidated damages or other charges. 

Our U.S. operations are subject to consumer protection laws known as Lemon Laws. These laws typically require a manufacturer or dealer to replace a new vehicle or accept it for a full refund within one year after initial purchase if the vehicle does not conform to the manufacturer&#8217;s express warranties and the dealer or manufacturer, after a reasonable number of attempts, is unable to correct or repair the defect. U.S. federal laws require various written disclosures to be provided on new vehicles, including mileage and pricing information. We are aware that several U.S. states are considering enacting consumer &#8220;bill-of-rights&#8221; statutes to provide further protection to the consumer which could affect our profitability in such states. 

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the &#8220;CFPB&#8221;) with broad regulatory powers. Although automotive dealers are generally excluded from the CFPB&#8217;s regulatory authority, we are required to comply with regulations applicable to privacy notices, and the CFPB has announced its intention to regulate automotive financing activities through its regulation of automotive finance companies and other financial institutions that service the automotive industry. The CFPB has issued regulatory guidance instructing financial institutions to monitor dealer loans for potential discrimination resulting from the system used to compensate dealers for assisting in the customer financing transaction. The CFPB has instructed lenders that, if discrimination is found, the lender would be required to change dealer compensation practices. In addition, the CFPB has announced its intention to regulate the sale of other finance and insurance products. If the result of either of these initiatives is to substantially restrict our ability to generate revenue from arranging financing for our customers for the purchase of vehicles and associated products and services, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 

Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety Laws and Regulations 

Our operations involve the use, handling and storage for recycling and/or disposal of materials such as motor oil and filters, transmission fluids, antifreeze, refrigerants, paints, thinners, batteries, cleaning products, lubricants, degreasing agents, tires, and fuel. We contract for recycling and/or dispose of used fluids, filters and other waste materials generated by our operations. Consequently, our business is subject to a complex variety of stringent laws and regulations governing management and disposal of materials and wastes, protection of the environment and occupational health and safety. These laws and regulations affect many aspects of our operations, such as requiring the acquisition of permits or other governmental approvals to conduct regulated activities, restricting the manner in which we handle, recycle and dispose of our wastes, incurring capital and operating expenditures to construct, maintain and upgrade pollution control and containment equipment and facilities, imposing specific health and safety criteria addressing worker protection, and imposing substantial liabilities for pollution caused by our operations or attributable to former operations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil and criminal penalties, imposition of investigatory, remedial and corrective action obligations, delays in permitting or in the performance of projects, and issuance of injunctions delaying, restricting or prohibiting some or all of our operations in affected areas. We may not be able to recover some or any of these costs from insurance. 

Most of our dealerships utilize above-ground storage tanks, primarily for storing and dispensing petroleum-based products, and above-ground lifts used to raise vehicles. To a lesser extent, our dealerships use underground storage tanks and in-ground lifts. Storage tanks in the U.S. are subject to testing, containment, upgrading and removal requirements under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, or RCRA, and its state law counterparts. Similarly, below ground lifts may contain fluid reservoirs that may leak. RCRA imposes requirements relating to the handling and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes and requires us to comply with stringent and costly requirements in connection with our storage and recycling or disposal of the various used fluids, paints, batteries, tires, and fuels generated by our operations. Clean-up or other remedial action may be necessary in the event of leaks or other unauthorized discharges from storage tanks or other equipment operated by us. In addition, water quality protection programs under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (commonly known as the Clean Water Act) and comparable U.S. state and local programs govern certain wastewater and storm water discharges from our operations, which discharges may require permitting. Similarly, certain sources of air emissions from our operations including, for example, paint booths, may be subject to permitting, monitoring and reporting requirements, pursuant to the federal Clean Air Act and related state and local laws. Certain health and safety standards imposed under the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Act or otherwise promulgated by the Occupational Safety and Health administration of the United States Department of Labor and related state agencies are also applicable to protection of the health and safety of our employees. 

We generally conduct environmental studies on dealerships to be acquired regardless of whether we are leasing or acquiring in fee the underlying real property, and as necessary, implement environmental management practices or remedial or corrective actions to reduce the risk of noncompliance with environmental laws and regulations. Nevertheless, we currently own or lease, and in connection with our acquisition program anticipate in the future owning or leasing, properties that in some instances have been used for auto retailing and servicing for many years. Laws regarding the prevention of pollution or remediation of environmental contamination generally apply regardless of whether we lease or purchase the land and facilities. Although we, or our predecessors, may have utilized operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, a risk exists that petroleum products and wastes such as new and used motor oil, transmission fluids, antifreeze, lubricants, solvents and motor fuels could have been spilled or released on or under the properties owned or leased by us or on or under other locations where such materials were taken for recycling or disposal. Further, we believe that structures found on some of these properties may contain asbestos-containing materials, although in an undisturbed condition that does not require removal or other corrective action under applicable regulations. In addition, many of these properties have been operated by third parties whose use, handling and disposal of such petroleum products or wastes were not under our control. These properties and the materials transported and disposed from, or released on, them may be subject to the U.S. federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (also known as the Superfund law), RCRA and analogous U.S. state laws, pursuant to which we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes or property contamination or to perform remedial activities to prevent future contamination. 

The trend in environmental regulation is to often place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment. Consequently, any changes in environmental laws and regulations or re-interpretations of enforcement policies that result in more stringent and costly vehicular pollution control equipment or waste handling, storage, transport, disposal or remediation requirements, or delays or restrictions in permitting or performance of projects could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. For example, U.S vehicle manufacturers are subject to regulations adopted by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (&#8220;EPA&#8221;) and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration that establish greenhouse gas (&#8220;GHG&#8221;) and corporate average fuel economy (&#8220;CAF&#201;&#8221;) standards applicable to light-duty vehicles through model year 2025, with these standards imposing more stringent requirements through model year 2025. Whereas the CAF&#201; standards are designed to improve vehicle fuel economy, the GHG standards are based on determinations made by the U.S. EPA, that emissions of carbon dioxide and certain other gases, comprising GHGs, present an endangerment to public health and the environment because emissions of such gases are, according to the EPA, contributing to warming of the Earth&#8217;s atmosphere and other climatic changes. Moreover, climate-change legislation and regulatory changes have been made or are being considered at state and federal levels and, on an international level, the United States is one of almost 200 nations that agreed in December 2015 to an international climate change agreement in Paris, France that calls for countries to set their own GHG emissions targets and be transparent about the measures each country will use to achieve its GHG emissions targets. Although it is not possible at this time to predict how or when the United States might impose restrictions on GHGs as a result of the international agreement made in Paris, the adoption of any laws or regulations requiring significant increases in fuel economy requirements or new federal or state restrictions on emissions of GHGs on vehicles and automotive fuels in the United States could adversely affect prices of and demand for the vehicles we sell. 

Insurance and Bonding 

Our operations expose us to the risk of various liabilities, including: 

&#8226; 

claims by employees, customers or other third parties for personal injury or property damage resulting from our operations; and 

&#8226; 

fines and civil and criminal penalties resulting from alleged violations of federal and state laws or regulatory requirements. 

The automotive retailing business is also subject to substantial risk of real and personal property loss as a result of the significant concentration of real and personal property values at dealership locations. Under self-insurance programs, we retain various levels of aggregate loss limits, per claim deductibles and claims handling expenses, including property and casualty, automobile physical damage, and employee medical benefits. In certain cases, we insure costs in excess of our retained risk under various contracts with third-party insurance carriers. Actuarial estimates for the portion of claims not covered by insurance are based on historical claims experience, adjusted for current trends and changes in claims-handling procedures. Risk retention levels may change in the future as a result of changes in the insurance market or other factors affecting the economics of our insurance programs. Although we believe our insurance coverage is adequate, we cannot assure that we will not be exposed to uninsured or underinsured losses that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 

We make provisions for retained losses and deductibles by reflecting charges to expense based upon periodic evaluations of the estimated ultimate liabilities on reported and unreported claims. The insurance companies that underwrite our insurance require that we secure certain of our obligations for self-insured exposures with collateral. Our collateral requirements are set by the insurance companies and, to date, have been satisfied by posting surety bonds, letters of credit and/or cash deposits. Our collateral requirements may change from time to time based on, among other things, our total insured exposure and the related self-insured retention assumed under the policies. We are subject to potential premium cost fluctuations with the annual renewal of these programs. 

Employees 

We believe our relationship with our employees is favorable. As of December 31, 2015 , we employed 12,886 (full-time, part-time and temporary) people, of whom: 

&#8226; 

1,697 were employed in managerial positions; 

&#8226; 

2,902 were employed in non-managerial vehicle sales department positions; 

&#8226; 

6,231 were employed in non-managerial parts and service department positions; and 

&#8226; 

2,056 were employed in administrative support positions. 

In Brazil, all employees are represented by a local union. 

Because of our dependence on vehicle manufacturers, we may be affected by labor strikes, work slowdowns and walkouts at vehicle manufacturing facilities and/or their suppliers. Additionally, labor strikes, work slowdowns and walkouts at businesses participating in the distribution of manufacturers&#8217; products may also affect us. 

For further discussion, please read &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors.&#8221; 

Seasonality 

We generally experience higher volumes of vehicle sales and service in the second and third calendar quarters of each year in the U.S., in the first and third quarters in the U.K. and during the third and fourth quarters in Brazil. This seasonality is generally attributable to consumer buying trends and the timing of manufacturer new vehicle model introductions. The first quarter is generally the weakest in Brazil, driven by heavy consumer vacations and activities associated with Carnival. In addition, in some regions of the U.S., vehicle purchases decline during the winter months due to inclement weather. For the U.K., the first and third calendar quarters tend to be stronger, driven by plate change months of March and September. As a result, our consolidated revenues and operating income are typically lower in the first and fourth quarters and higher in the second and third quarters. Other factors unrelated to seasonality, such as changes in economic condition, inventory availability, manufacturer incentive programs or shifts in governmental taxes or regulations may exaggerate seasonal or cause counter-seasonal fluctuations in our revenues and operating income.
