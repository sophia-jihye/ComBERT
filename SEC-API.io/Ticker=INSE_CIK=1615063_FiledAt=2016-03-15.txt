 Item 1. Business &#160; 

Introduction 

&#160;

We are a blank check company incorporated on May 30, 2014 as a Delaware corporation formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization, recapitalization or other similar business combination with one or more businesses. We intend to effectuate our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of our initial public offering and a sale of warrants in a private placement that occurred simultaneously with the completion of our initial public offering, our capital stock, debt or a combination of cash, stock and debt.

&#160;

While we may pursue an acquisition opportunity in any industry sector, or geographical location, we are focused on businesses that complement our management team&#8217;s background, and capitalize on our management team&#8217;s track record to identify, acquire, operate and develop businesses.

&#160; 

Business Opportunity Overview 

&#160;

Our acquisition and value creation strategy is to identify, acquire and, after our initial business combination, to build on, a business through follow-on mergers and acquisitions and business development initiatives. We are looking to pursue a scalable business as our initial acquisition candidate. Our strategy is based on our management&#8217;s belief that our initial business combination will serve as a platform to create value over time. This is very similar to how our management team built Scientific Games Corporation (NASDAQ: SGMS), or Scientific Games, for nearly 25 years.

&#160;

Specifically, we are focused on finding acquisition targets that enjoy some combination of the following characteristics where the management team has significant operating expertise:

&#160;

&#160; &#8226; Application of specific technologies; &#160;

&#160; &#8226; Businesses where secure data or secure printing are a critical component to the execution of the operation; &#160;

&#160; &#8226; Logistics or logistical services; &#160;

&#160; &#8226; Potential for international expansion; &#160;

&#160; &#8226; Domestic or foreign government procurement or privatization; &#160;

&#160; &#8226; Complicated regulatory requirements; and &#160;

&#160; &#8226; Synergistic M&#38;A/joint venture opportunities. &#160;

Over the course of their careers, the members of our management team and board of directors have developed a broad network of contacts and relationships that we believe are useful for sourcing investment opportunities. This network has provided our management team with leads and referrals that resulted in numerous acquisitions in the past. We believe our management team is well positioned to create value for our stockholders, and that our contacts and relationships, ranging from owners of private and public companies, private equity funds, hedge funds, distressed debt funds, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and business brokers allows us to generate attractive acquisition opportunities.

&#160;

Throughout this Report, we refer to our sponsors individually as our Hydra sponsor and our Macquarie sponsor. Our Macquarie sponsor, MIHI LLC, is a wholly owned subsidiary of Macquarie Holdings (U.S.A.) Inc., which, in turn, is a wholly owned subsidiary of Macquarie Group Limited (ASX: MQG), or Macquarie. Macquarie is a global provider of banking, financial, advisory, investment, and funds management services. Macquarie&#8217;s main business focus is generating returns to investors and stockholders by providing a diversified range of services to clients. Macquarie acts on behalf of institutional, corporate, and retail clients and counterparties around the world. Founded in 1969, Macquarie operates in 65 office locations in 28 countries, employs approximately 14,200 people and has assets under management of over $383 billion (as of December 31, 2015).

&#160;

Macquarie&#8217;s advisory, capital raising and principal investing capabilities is conducted through its Macquarie Capital business. The firm provides varied services to corporate, financial sponsor and government clients involved in mergers and acquisitions, debt and equity fund raising, corporate restructuring, project finance and public private partnerships. In the U.S., operating through Macquarie Capital (USA) Inc., a whole owned subsidiary of Macquarie, Macquarie Capital has deep specialist sector expertise and a comprehensive advisory and capital markets platform. Macquarie Capital&#8217;s expertise spans a variety of industry sectors including:

&#160;

&#160; &#8226; Industrials; &#160;

&#160; &#8226; Telecommunications, Media, Entertainment and Gaming; &#160;

&#160; &#8226; Financial Institutions; &#160;

&#160; &#8226; Real Estate; &#160;

&#160; &#8226; Resources; &#160;

&#160; 2 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#8226; Infrastructure; and &#160;

&#160; &#8226; Power, Utilities and Renewables. &#160;

We intend to capitalize on the substantial resources and the global infrastructure of our Macquarie sponsor. Macquarie Capital has significant investing experience in the United States and has leveraged its relationships to source and execute potential deals.

&#160;

We intend to capitalize on the experience and capabilities of our management team to identify prospective target businesses. Our management team has worked together at Scientific Games, where they have proven their ability to identify, acquire and operate a number of businesses in a manner similar to the process anticipated for our initial target business. Our management team is a very hands on, entrepreneurial and growth oriented team with highly complementary and relevant skill sets. Management&#8217;s professional experience spans operations, strategy, mergers and acquisitions, capital raising, corporate finance, accounting, compliance/regulatory matters and law. During 2009 to 2014, members of our management team were the primary drivers of, and successfully completed, nine strategic mergers and acquisitions transactions, ranging in value from $4 million to $1.5 billion, while at Scientific Games, including the acquisition of WMS Industries in October 2013. Members of our management team were also the primary drivers of, and successfully completed, five key joint ventures and alliances, including the privatization of four lotteries, while at Scientific Games. Together, these business development activities have facilitated significant growth for Scientific Games during this time period.

&#160;

Past performance by Mr. Weil or Macquarie is not a guarantee either of success with respect to any business combination we may consummate or that we will be able to locate a suitable candidate for our initial business combination.

&#160; 

Significant Activities Since Inception 

&#160;

On October 29, 2014, we consummated our initial public offering of 8,000,000 units, each unit consisting of one share of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, one right to receive one-tenth of one share of common stock upon the completion of our business combination, and one warrant to purchase one-half of one share of common stock at an exercise price of $5.75 per half share ($11.50 per whole share), pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-198236). The units were sold in our initial public offering at an offering price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of $80,000,000 (before underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses). Simultaneously with the consummation of our initial public offering, we completed a private placement of an aggregate of 7,500,000 warrants, issued to Mr. Weil, MIHI LLC and Martin E. Schloss, our Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary, generating gross proceeds of $3,750,000. A total of $80,000,000 from the net proceeds from our initial public offering and the private placement were placed in a trust account established for the benefit of our public stockholders.

&#160;

The units began trading on October 24, 2014 on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol &#8220;HDRAU&#8221;. Commencing December 11, 2014, the securities comprising the units began to trade separately. The units, common stock, warrants and rights are trading on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbols &#8220;HDRAU,&#8221; &#8220;HDRA,&#8221; &#8220;HDRAW&#8221; and &#8220;HDRAR,&#8221; respectively.

&#160; 

Initial Business Combination 

&#160;

NASDAQ rules require that our initial business combination must be with one or more target businesses that together have a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the balance in the trust account (less any deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on interest earned) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. If our board is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from a qualified independent accounting firm or an independent investment banking firm that is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or FINRA, with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. Subject to this requirement, our management will have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting one or more prospective target businesses, although we will not be permitted to effectuate our initial business combination with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations.

&#160;

We anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post-transaction company in which our public stockholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or stockholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of net assets test. If the business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses.

&#160;

We have identified the following general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses. We use these criteria and guidelines in evaluating acquisition opportunities, but we may decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet these criteria and guidelines.

&#160;

&#160; 3 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#8226; Middle-Market Businesses . We seek to acquire one or more businesses with an aggregate enterprise value of approximately $250 million to $500 million, determined according to reasonably accepted valuation standards and methodologies. We believe that the middle market segment provides the greatest number of opportunities for investment and is the market most consistent with our management team&#8217;s previous investment history. This segment is where we believe we have the strongest network to identify opportunities and where our experience in developing companies will be useful. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#8226; Businesses with Proven Track Records and Strong Free Cash Flow Generation . We seek to acquire one or more businesses that already have consistent, stable and increasing free cash flow. We focus on one or more businesses that have a history of strong operating and financial results, strong fundamentals, and predictable revenue streams. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#8226; Businesses that Will Benefit from Being a Public Company . We intend to acquire one or more businesses that will benefit from being publicly traded and can effectively utilize the broader access to capital and the public profile that are associated with being a publicly traded company. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#8226; Experienced Management Team . We seek to acquire one or more businesses with an experienced management team that provides a platform for us to further develop the management capabilities of the acquired business. We seek to partner with a potential target&#8217;s management team and expect that the operating and financial abilities of our executive team and board will complement their own capabilities. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#8226; Businesses with a Catalyst that Will Significantly Improve Financial Performance . We seek to acquire one or more established businesses where we believe that our operating expertise will serve as a catalyst for near term improvement in the business performance or to help to develop the acquired business as a platform for long term growth. Our operating expertise comes from our experience at Scientific Games for nearly 25 years. We believe that our operating expertise is highly transferable. &#160; 

Status as a Public Company 

&#160;

We believe our structure makes us an attractive business combination partner to target businesses. As an existing public company, we offer a target business an alternative to the traditional initial public offering through a merger or other business combination. In this situation, the owners of the target business would exchange their shares of stock in the target business for shares of our stock or for a combination of shares of our stock and cash, allowing us to tailor the consideration to the specific needs of the sellers. Although there are various costs and obligations associated with being a public company, we believe target businesses will find this process a more certain and cost effective method to becoming a public company than the typical initial public offering. In a typical initial public offering, there are additional expenses incurred in marketing, road show efforts and the filing of a registration statement that may not be present to the same extent in connection with a business combination with us.

&#160;

Furthermore, once a proposed business combination is completed, the target business will have effectively become public, whereas an initial public offering is always subject to the underwriters&#8217; ability to complete the offering, as well as general market conditions, which could prevent the offering from occurring. Once public, we believe the target business would then have greater access to capital and an additional means of providing management incentives consistent with stockholders&#8217; interests. It can offer further benefits by augmenting a company&#8217;s profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented employees.

&#160; 

Financial Position 

&#160;

Our Macquarie sponsor has entered into a contingent forward purchase contract with us to purchase, in a private placement for gross proceeds of approximately $20,000,000 to occur concurrently with the consummation of our initial business combination, 2,000,000 units (which includes 2,000,000 rights which will be exchanged for 200,000 shares of common stock) on substantially the same terms as the sale of units in our initial public offering at $10.00 per unit, and 500,000 shares of common stock on the same terms as the sale of shares of common stock to our sponsors prior to our initial public offering. The funds from the sale of the private placement units may be used as part of the consideration to the sellers in the initial business combination; any excess funds from this private placement may be used for working capital in the post-transaction company. This commitment is independent of the percentage of stockholders electing to redeem their public shares and provides us with an increased minimum funding level for the initial business combination.

&#160;

The contingent forward purchase contract is subject to the following closing conditions:

&#160;

&#160; &#8226; the representations and warranties made by us in the contingent forward purchase contract shall be true and correct in all material respects; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#8226; all covenants, agreements and conditions contained in the contingent forward purchase contract shall have been performed by us; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#8226; we have obtained all blue sky law permits and qualifications required by any state for the offer and sale of the private placement securities; and &#160;

&#160; 4 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#8226; our Macquarie sponsor has provided its consent to the business combination, which consent can be withheld for any reason; provided, that if our Macquarie sponsor does not consent because of regulatory reasons or because the business combination involves a competitor to our Macquarie sponsor, its affiliates, or an entity in which our Macquarie sponsor or an affiliate has an equity interest, then we may proceed with such business combination but our Macquarie sponsor will not be obligated to settle the purchase of securities under the contingent forward purchase contract. &#160;

If we fail to consummate a business combination within the required time period, and our board of directors (other than our Macquarie sponsor designee) unanimously votes in favor of a proposed business combination and our Macquarie sponsor decides to withhold its vote on such business combination (for reasons other than regulatory reasons or because the business combination involves a competitor to our Macquarie sponsor, its affiliates, or an entity in which our Macquarie sponsor or an affiliate has an equity interest), our Macquarie sponsor will be, subject to certain conditions, obligated to pay a $740,000 fee to our Hydra sponsor and the private placement warrants purchased by our Macquarie sponsor, Mr. Weil and another member of our management will expire worthless.

&#160;

We expect to have funds available for a business combination initially in the amount of $97,200,000, including the proceeds from the $20,000,000 contingent forward purchase contract to purchase 2,000,000 units by our Macquarie sponsor and proceeds from the private placement warrants. This amount assumes no redemptions, and payment of up to $2,800,000 of deferred underwriting fees. Consequently, we offer a target business a variety of options such as creating a liquidity event for its owners, providing capital for the potential growth and expansion of its operations or strengthening its balance sheet by reducing its debt burden. Because we are able to complete our business combination using our cash, debt or equity securities, or a combination of the foregoing, we have the flexibility to use the most efficient combination that will allow us to tailor the consideration to be paid to the target business to fit its needs and desires. However, there can be no assurance that third party financing will be available to us.

&#160; 

Effecting our Initial Business Combination 

&#160; 

General 

&#160;

We intend to effectuate our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of our initial public offering, from the private placement of the private placement warrants, and, in the event that our Macquarie sponsor votes in favor of our initial business combination, from the $20,000,000 contingent forward purchase contract to purchase securities by an affiliate of our Macquarie sponsor. In addition to the $20,000,000 private placement described above, we may seek to raise additional funds through an offering of debt or equity securities in connection with the completion of our initial business combination, and we may effectuate our initial business combination using the proceeds of such offering rather than using the amounts held in the trust account. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, we would complete such financing only simultaneously with the completion of our business combination. In the case of an initial business combination funded with assets other than the trust account assets, our tender offer documents or proxy materials disclosing the business combination would disclose the terms of the financing and, only if required by law, we would seek stockholder approval of such financing. There are no prohibitions on our ability to raise funds in connection with our initial business combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using stock or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our business combination or used for redemptions of purchases of our common stock, we may apply the balance of the cash released to us from the trust account, as well as the $20,000,000 private placement described above, for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital.

&#160;

We may seek to complete our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses. Although our management will assess the risks inherent in a particular target business with which we may combine, we cannot assure you that this assessment will result in our identifying all risks that a target business may encounter. Furthermore, some of those risks may be outside of our control. 

&#160; 

Origination, Sourcing and Evaluating of Target Business Opportunities 

&#160;

We believe our management team&#8217;s extensive operating and transaction experience, along with relationships with intermediaries and companies, provides us with a substantial number of potential business combination targets. Over the course of their careers, the members of our board and management team have developed a broad network of contacts and relationships.

&#160;

We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsors, executive officers or directors, or making the acquisition through a joint venture or other form of shared ownership with our sponsors, executive officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete an initial business combination with a target that is affiliated with our sponsors, executive officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, would obtain an opinion from a qualified independent accounting firm or independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA that such an initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. We are not required to obtain such an opinion in any other context.

&#160;

If any of our executive officers becomes aware of a business combination opportunity that falls within the line of business of any entity to which he or she has pre-existing fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she may be required to present such business combination opportunity to such entity prior to presenting such business combination opportunity to us. Certain of our executive officers currently have certain relevant fiduciary duties or contractual obligations that may take priority over their duties to us.

&#160;

&#160; 5 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Target business candidates are brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment bankers, private investment funds and other intermediaries. Target businesses may be brought to our attention by such unaffiliated sources as a result of being solicited by us. These sources may also introduce us to target businesses in which they think we may be interested on an unsolicited basis, since many of these sources will have read the prospectus relating to our initial public offering and know what types of businesses we are targeting. Our officers and directors, as well as their affiliates, may also bring to our attention target business candidates that they become aware of through their business contacts as a result of formal or informal inquiries or discussions they may have, as well as attending trade shows or conventions. In addition, we expect to receive a number of proprietary deal flow opportunities that would not otherwise necessarily be available to us as a result of the track record and business relationships of our officers and directors.

&#160;

In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct a thorough due diligence review which will encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, customers, document reviews, inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial and other information which will be made available to us.

&#160;

The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial business combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which our business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we used cash of $866,930 in operating activities. As of December 31, 2015, we had current liabilities of $2,645,838, primarily representing amounts owed to lawyers, accountants and consultants who have advised us on matters related to a potential business combination. Funds in the trust account are not available for this purpose absent an initial business combination. If a business combination is not consummated, we would lack the resources to pay all of the non-contingent liabilities that have been incurred by us to date and we may lack the resources needed to consummate another business combination. Effective October 26, 2015, all efforts related to such potential business combination were terminated and, accordingly, all contingent fees that had been previously incurred are no longer due or payable. There can be no assurances that we will complete a business combination.

&#160; 

Lack of Business Diversification 

&#160;

For an indefinite period of time after the completion of our initial business combination, the prospects for our success may depend entirely on the future performance of a single business. Unlike other entities that have the resources to complete business combinations with multiple entities in one or several industries, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations and mitigate the risks of being in a single line of business. By completing our business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may:

&#160;

&#160; &#8226; subject us to negative economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact on the particular industry in which we operate after our initial business combination, and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#8226; cause us to depend on the marketing and sale of a single product or limited number of products or services. &#160; 

Stockholders May Not Have the Ability to Approve our Initial Business Combination 

&#160;

We may conduct redemptions without a stockholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC. However, we will seek stockholder approval if it is required by law or applicable stock exchange rules, or we may decide to seek stockholder approval for business, legal or other reasons. Presented in the table below is a graphic explanation of the types of initial business combinations we may consider and whether stockholder approval is currently required under Delaware law for each such transaction.

&#160;

Type of Transaction &#160; Whether Stockholder 

Approval is Required 

Purchase of assets &#160; No Purchase of stock of target not involving a merger with the company &#160; No Merger of target into a subsidiary of the company &#160; No Merger of the company with a target &#160; Yes &#160;

Under NASDAQ&#8217;s listing rules, stockholder approval would be required for our initial business combination if, for example:

&#160;

&#160; &#8226; we issue common stock that will be equal to or in excess of 20% of the number of shares of our common stock then outstanding; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#8226; any of our directors, officers or substantial stockholders (as defined by NASDAQ rules) has a 5% or greater interest (or such persons collectively have a 10% or greater interest), directly or indirectly, in the target business or assets to be acquired or otherwise and the present or potential issuance of common stock could result in an increase in outstanding common shares or voting power of 5% or more; or &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#8226; the issuance or potential issuance of common stock will result in our undergoing a change of control. &#160;

&#160; 6 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Permitted Purchases of our Securities 

&#160;

In the event we seek stockholder approval of our business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our sponsors, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination. However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. None of the funds in the trust account will be used to purchase shares in such transactions. They will not make any such purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act. Such a purchase may include a contractual acknowledgement that such stockholder, although still the record holder of our shares is no longer the beneficial owner thereof and therefore agrees not to exercise its redemption rights. We have adopted an insider trading policy which requires insiders to: refrain from purchasing shares during certain blackout periods and when they are in possession of any material nonpublic information and to clear all trades with our legal counsel prior to execution. We cannot currently determine whether our insiders will make such purchases pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan, as it will be dependent upon several factors, including but not limited to, the timing and size of such purchases. Depending on such circumstances, our insiders may either make such purchases pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan or determine that such a plan is not necessary.

&#160;

In the event that our sponsors, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions from public stockholders who have already elected to exercise their redemption rights, such selling stockholders would be required to revoke their prior elections to redeem their shares. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such rules.

&#160;

The purpose of such purchases would be to vote such shares in favor of the business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining stockholder approval of the business combination or to satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our business combination, where it appears that such requirement would not otherwise be met. This may result in the completion of our business combination that may not otherwise have been possible.

&#160;

In addition, if such purchases are made, the public &#8220;float&#8221; of our common stock may be reduced and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange.

&#160;

Our sponsors, officers, directors and/or their affiliates anticipate that they may identify the stockholders with whom our sponsors, officers, directors or their affiliates may pursue privately negotiated purchases by either the stockholders contacting us directly or by our receipt of redemption requests submitted by stockholders following our mailing of proxy materials in connection with our initial business combination. To the extent that our sponsors, officers, directors, advisors or their affiliates enter into a private purchase, they would identify and contact only potential selling stockholders who have expressed their election to redeem their shares for a pro rata share of the trust account or vote against the business combination. Our sponsors, officers, directors, advisors or their affiliates will only purchase shares if such purchases comply with Regulation M and the other federal securities laws.

&#160;

Any purchases by our sponsors, officers, directors and/or their affiliates who are affiliated purchasers under Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act will only be made to the extent such purchases are able to be made in compliance with Rule 10b-18, which is a safe harbor from liability for manipulation under Section 9(a)(2) and Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act. Rule 10b-18 has certain technical requirements that must be complied with in order for the safe harbor to be available to the purchaser. Our sponsors, officers, directors and/or their affiliates will not make purchases of common stock if the purchases would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act.

&#160; 

Redemption Rights for Public Stockholders Upon Completion of our Initial Business Combination 

&#160;

We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their shares of common stock upon the completion of our initial business combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination, including interest income (net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein. The amount in the trust account is initially anticipated to be approximately $10.00 per public share. The per-share amount we will distribute to public stockholders who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriters. Our initial stockholders have entered into letter agreements with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and any public shares they may hold in connection with the completion of our business combination.

&#160; 

Manner of Conducting Redemptions 

&#160;

We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their shares of common stock upon the completion of our initial business combination either in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the business combination or by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed business combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would require us to seek stockholder approval under the law or stock exchange listing requirements. Asset acquisitions and stock purchases would not typically require stockholder approval while direct mergers with our company where we do not survive and any transactions where we issue more than 20% of our outstanding common stock or seek to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation would require stockholder approval. We intend to conduct redemptions without a stockholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC unless stockholder approval is required by law or stock exchange listing requirements or we choose to seek stockholder approval for business, legal or other reasons.

&#160;

&#160; 7 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

If a stockholder vote is not required and we do not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business, legal or other reasons, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation:

&#160;

&#160; &#8226; conduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E under the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers, and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#8226; file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A under the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies. &#160;

Upon the public announcement of our business combination, we or our sponsors will terminate any plan established in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 to purchase shares of our common stock in the open market if we elect to redeem our public shares through a tender offer, to comply with Rule 14e-5 under the Exchange Act.

&#160;

In the event we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, our offer to redeem will remain open for at least 20 business days, in accordance with Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act, and we will not be permitted to complete our initial business combination until the expiration of the tender offer period. In addition, the tender offer will be conditioned on public stockholders not tendering more than a specified number of public shares which are not purchased by our sponsors, which number will be based on the requirement that we may not redeem public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we are not subject to the SEC&#8217;s &#8220;penny stock&#8221; rules) or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement which may be contained in the agreement relating to our initial business combination. If public stockholders tender more shares than we have offered to purchase, we will withdraw the tender offer and not complete the initial business combination.

&#160;

If, however, stockholder approval of the transaction is required by law or stock exchange listing requirement, or we decide to obtain stockholder approval for business, legal or other reasons, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation:

&#160;

&#160; &#8226; conduct the redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies, and not pursuant to the tender offer rules, and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#8226; file proxy materials with the SEC. &#160; &#160;

In the event that we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination, we will distribute proxy materials and, in connection therewith, provide our public stockholders with the redemption rights described above upon completion of the initial business combination.

&#160;

If we seek stockholder approval, we will complete our initial business combination only if a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the business combination. In such case, after approval of our board and our Macquarie sponsor, our initial stockholders have agreed to vote their founder shares and any public shares purchased during or after our initial public offering in favor of our initial business combination. Each public stockholder may elect to redeem their public shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction. In addition, our initial stockholders have entered into letter agreements with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and public shares in connection with the completion of a business combination.

&#160;

Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001. Redemptions of our public shares may also be subject to a higher net tangible asset test or cash requirement pursuant to an agreement relating to our initial business combination. For example, the proposed business combination may require cash consideration to be paid to the target or its owners, cash to be transferred to the target for working capital or other general corporate purposes or the retention of cash to satisfy other conditions in accordance with the terms of the proposed business combination. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all shares of common stock that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed business combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the business combination or redeem any shares, and all shares of common stock submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof.

&#160; 

Limitation on Redemption Upon Completion of our Initial Business Combination if We Seek Stockholder Approval 

&#160;

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a &#8220;group&#8221; (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to 25% or more of the shares sold in our initial public offering. We believe this restriction will discourage stockholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights against a proposed business combination as a means to force us or our management to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public stockholder holding an aggregate of 25% or more of the shares sold in our initial public offering could threaten to exercise its redemption rights if such holder&#8217;s shares are not purchased by us or our management at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our stockholders&#8217; ability to redeem no more than 25% (less one share) of the shares sold in our initial public offering, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of stockholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our business combination, particularly in connection with a business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. However, we would not be restricting our stockholders&#8217; ability to vote all of their shares (including 25% or more of the shares sold in our initial public offering) for or against our business combination.

&#160; 

Tendering Stock Certificates in Connection with a Tender Offer or Redemption Rights 

&#160;

We may require our public stockholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in &#8220;street name,&#8221; to either tender their certificates to our transfer agent prior to the date set forth in the tender offer documents or proxy materials mailed to such holders, or up to two business days prior to the vote on the proposal to approve the business combination in the event we distribute proxy materials, or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using Depository Trust Company&#8217;s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, at the holder&#8217;s option. The tender offer or proxy materials, as applicable, that we will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with our initial business combination will indicate whether we are requiring public stockholders to satisfy such delivery requirements. Accordingly, a public stockholder would have from the time we send out our tender offer materials until the close of the tender offer period, or up to two days prior to the vote on the business combination if we distribute proxy materials, as applicable, to tender its shares if it wishes to seek to exercise its redemption rights. Given the relatively short exercise period, it is advisable for stockholders to use electronic delivery of their public shares.

&#160;

There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker $35.00 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise redemption rights to tender their shares. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising redemption rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated.

&#160;

The foregoing is different from the procedures used by many blank check companies. In order to perfect redemption rights in connection with their business combinations, many blank check companies would distribute proxy materials for the stockholders&#8217; vote on an initial business combination, and a holder could simply vote against a proposed business combination and check a box on the proxy card indicating such holder was seeking to exercise his or her redemption rights. After the business combination was approved, the company would contact such stockholder to arrange for him or her to deliver his or her certificate to verify ownership. As a result, the stockholder then had an &#8220;option window&#8221; after the completion of the business combination during which he or she could monitor the price of the company&#8217;s stock in the market. If the price rose above the redemption price, he or she could sell his or her shares in the open market before actually delivering his or her shares to the company for cancellation. As a result, the redemption rights, to which stockholders were aware they needed to commit before the stockholder meeting, would become &#8220;option&#8221; rights surviving past the completion of the business combination until the redeeming holder delivered its certificate. The requirement for physical or electronic delivery prior to the meeting ensures that a redeeming holder&#8217;s election to redeem is irrevocable once the business combination is approved.

&#160;

Any request to redeem such shares, once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the date set forth in the tender offer materials or the date of the stockholder meeting set forth in our proxy materials, as applicable. Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivered its certificate in connection with an election of redemption rights and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights, such holder may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically). It is anticipated that the funds to be distributed to holders of our public shares electing to redeem their shares will be distributed promptly after the completion of our business combination.

&#160;

If our initial business combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public stockholders who elected to exercise their redemption rights would not be entitled to redeem their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account. In such case, we will promptly return any certificates delivered by public stockholders who elected to redeem their shares.

&#160;

If our initial proposed business combination is not completed, we may continue to try to complete a business combination with a different target until 24 months from the closing of our initial public offering.

&#160; 

Redemption of Public Shares and Liquidation if No Initial Business Combination 

&#160;

Our sponsors, executive officers, directors and director nominees have agreed that we will have only 24 months from the closing of our initial public offering to complete our initial business combination. If we are unable to complete our business combination within such 24-month period, we will cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest income (net of taxes payable, and less up to $50,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders&#8217; rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law.

&#160;

There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our rights and warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our business combination within the 24-month time period.

&#160;

&#160; 9 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Our initial stockholders have entered into letter agreements with us, pursuant to which they have waived their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to their founder shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of our initial public offering. However, if our initial stockholders acquire public shares in or after our initial public offering, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the allotted 24-month time period.

&#160;

Our sponsors, executive officers, directors and director nominees have agreed, pursuant to a written letter agreement with us, that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation that would affect the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of our initial public offering, unless we provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their shares of common stock upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest income (net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares. However, we may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001.

&#160;

We expect that all costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, as well as payments to any creditors, will be funded from amounts remaining out of the approximately $256,239 of proceeds held outside the trust account (as of December 31, 2015), the $500,000 in loans committed by our sponsors in the aggregate, or provided through additional working capital loans from our sponsors, although we cannot assure you that there will be sufficient funds for such purpose. However, if those funds are not sufficient to cover the costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, to the extent that there is any interest accrued in the trust account not required to pay taxes, we may request the trustee to release to us an additional amount of up to $50,000 of such accrued interest to pay those costs and expenses.

&#160;

If we were to expend all of the net proceeds of our initial public offering, other than the proceeds deposited in the trust account, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the trust account, the per-share redemption amount received by stockholders upon our dissolution would be approximately $10.00. The proceeds deposited in the trust account could, however, become subject to the claims of our creditors which would have higher priority than the claims of our public stockholders. We cannot assure you that the actual per-share redemption amount received by stockholders will not be substantially less than $10.00. Under Section 281(b) of the DGCL, our plan of dissolution must provide for all claims against us to be paid in full or make provision for payments to be made in full, as applicable, if there are sufficient assets. These claims must be paid or provided for before we make any distribution of our remaining assets to our stockholders. While we intend to pay such amounts, if any, we cannot assure you that we will have funds sufficient to pay or provide for all creditors&#8217; claims.

&#160;

Although we will seek to have all vendors, service providers (other than our independent auditors), prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public stockholders, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account including but not limited to fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the trust account. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third party that has not executed a waiver if management believes that such third party&#8217;s engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason. In order to protect the amounts held in the trust account, Mr. Weil, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the managing member of our Hydra sponsor, has agreed that he will be liable to us, and our Macquarie sponsor has agreed to indemnify Mr. Weil for 50% of any such liability, if and to the extent any claims by a vendor for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the trust account to below $10.00 per public share or such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets other than due to the failure to obtain such waiver, in each case net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes, except as to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the trust account and except as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, then Mr. Weil will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. We cannot assure you, however, that Mr. Weil would be able to satisfy those obligations. None of our other officers will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses.

&#160;

In the event that the proceeds in the trust account are reduced below $10.00 per public share or such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets other than due to the failure to obtain such waiver, in each case net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes, and Mr. Weil asserts that he is unable to satisfy his indemnification obligations or that he has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against Mr. Weil to enforce his indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against Mr. Weil to enforce his indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so in any particular instance. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that due to claims of creditors the actual value of the per-share redemption price will not be substantially less than $10.00 per share.

&#160;

&#160; 10 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

We will seek to reduce the possibility that Mr. Weil will have to indemnify the trust account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers (other than our independent auditors), prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the trust account. Mr. Weil will also not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. We have access to up to approximately $256,239 from the proceeds of our initial public offering (as of December 31, 2015) and the $500,000 in loans committed to us by our sponsors in the aggregate with which to pay any such potential claims (including costs and expenses incurred in connection with our liquidation, currently estimated to be no more than approximately $50,000). In the event that we liquidate and it is subsequently determined that the reserve for claims and liabilities is insufficient, stockholders who received funds from our trust account could be liable for claims made by creditors.

&#160;

Under the DGCL, stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against a corporation to the extent of distributions received by them in a dissolution. The pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event we do not complete our business combination within 24 months from the closing of our initial public offering may be considered a liquidation distribution under Delaware law. If the corporation elects to comply with certain procedures set forth in Section 280 of the DGCL intended to ensure that it makes reasonable provision for all claims against it, including a 60-day notice period during which any third-party claims can be brought against the corporation, a 90-day period during which the corporation may reject any claims brought, and an additional 150-day waiting period before any liquidating distributions are made to stockholders, any liability of stockholders with respect to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholder&#8217;s pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution.

&#160;

Furthermore, if the pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event we do not complete our business combination within 24 months from the closing of our initial public offering, is not considered a liquidation distribution under Delaware law and such redemption distribution is deemed to be unlawful, then pursuant to Section 174 of the DGCL, the statute of limitations for claims of creditors could then be six years after the unlawful redemption distribution, instead of three years, as in the case of a liquidation distribution. If we are unable to complete our business combination within 24 months from the closing of our initial public offering, we will cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest income (net of taxes payable, and less up to $50,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders&#8217; rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. Accordingly, it is our intention to redeem our public shares as soon as reasonably possible following our 24 th month and, therefore, we do not intend to comply with those procedures. As such, our stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them (but no more) and any liability of our stockholders may extend well beyond the third anniversary of such date.

&#160;

Because we will not follow the provisions of Section 280, Section 281(b) of the DGCL requires us to adopt a plan, based on facts known to us at such time that will provide for our payment of all existing and pending claims or claims that may be potentially brought against us within the subsequent 10 years. However, because we are a blank check company, rather than an operating company, and our operations will be limited to searching for prospective target businesses to acquire, the only likely claims to arise would be from our vendors (such as lawyers, investment bankers, etc.) or prospective target businesses. As described above, pursuant to the obligation contained in our underwriting agreement, we will seek to have all vendors, service providers (other than our independent auditors), prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account.

&#160;

As a result of this obligation, the claims that could be made against us are significantly limited and the likelihood that any claim that would result in any liability extending to the trust account is remote. Further, Mr. Weil may be liable only to the extent necessary to ensure that the amounts in the trust account are not reduced below $10.00 per public share or such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets other than due to the failure to obtain such waiver, in each case net of the amount of interest withdrawn to pay taxes and less any per-share amounts distributed from our trust account to our public stockholders in the event we are unable to complete our business combination within 24 months from the closing of our initial public offering and will not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, Mr. Weil will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims.

&#160;

If we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our stockholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, we cannot assure you we will be able to return $10.00 per share to our public stockholders. Additionally, if we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by stockholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a &#8220;preferential transfer&#8221; or a &#8220;fraudulent conveyance.&#8221; As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover all amounts received by our stockholders. Furthermore, our board may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, and thereby exposing itself and our company to claims of punitive damages, by paying public stockholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons.

&#160;

&#160; 11 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Our public stockholders will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only in the event of the redemption of our public shares if we do not complete our business combination within 24 months from the closing of our initial public offering or if they redeem their respective shares for cash upon the completion of the initial business combination. In no other circumstances will a stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account. In the event we seek stockholder approval in connection with our initial business combination, a stockholder&#8217;s voting in connection with the business combination alone will not result in a stockholder&#8217;s redeeming its shares to us for an applicable pro rata share of the trust account. Such stockholder must have also exercised its redemption rights described above.

&#160; 

Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation 

&#160;

Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation contains certain requirements and restrictions relating to our initial public offering that will apply to us until the consummation of our initial business combination. If we seek to amend any provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation relating to stockholders&#8217; rights or pre-business combination activity, we will provide dissenting public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares in connection with any such vote. Our initial stockholders have agreed to waive any redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and public shares in connection with the completion of our initial business combination. Specifically, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides, among other things, that:

&#160;

&#160; &#8226; prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, we shall either (1) seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which stockholders may seek to redeem their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (net of taxes payable and up to $50,000 to pay dissolution expenses) or (2) provide our stockholders with the opportunity to tender their shares to us by means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a stockholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest income (net of taxes payable) in each case subject to the limitations described herein; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#8226; we will consummate our initial business combination only if we have net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 upon such consummation and, solely if we seek stockholder approval, a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the business combination; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#8226; if our initial business combination is not consummated within 24 months from the closing of our initial public offering, then our existence will terminate and we will distribute all amounts in the trust account; and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#8226; prior to our initial business combination, we may not issue additional shares of capital stock that would entitle the holders thereof to receive funds from the trust account or vote on any initial business combination. &#160;

These provisions cannot be amended without the approval of holders of 65% of our common stock. In the event we seek stockholder approval in connection with our initial business combination, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we may consummate our initial business combination only if approved by a majority of the shares of common stock voted by our stockholders at a duly held stockholders&#8217; meeting.

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160;

In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our business combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination.

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160;

We currently have three executive officers. Members of our management team are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs. The amount of time that Messrs. Weil, Peng and Schloss or any other members of our management devotes in any time period varies based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the current stage of the business combination process.

&#160; 

&#160; 12 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Periodic Reporting and Financial Information 

&#160;

We will provide stockholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of the tender offer materials or proxy solicitation materials sent to stockholders to assist them in assessing the target business. In all likelihood, these financial statements will need to be prepared in accordance with GAAP. We cannot assure you that any particular target business identified by us as a potential acquisition candidate will have financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP or that the potential target business will be able to prepare its financial statements in accordance with GAAP. To the extent that this requirement cannot be met, we may not be able to acquire the proposed target business. While this may limit the pool of potential acquisition candidates, we do not believe that this limitation will be material.

&#160;

We are required to evaluate our internal control procedures for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2015 as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Only in the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer that is not an &#8220;emerging growth company&#8221; as described below will we be required to have our internal control procedures audited. A target company may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition.

We are an &#8220;emerging growth company,&#8221; as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not &#8220;emerging growth companies&#8221; including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor internal controls attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.

&#160;

In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an &#8220;emerging growth company&#8221; can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an &#8220;emerging growth company&#8221; can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.

&#160;

We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.0 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30 th , and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period. References herein to &#8220;emerging growth company&#8221; shall have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act.
