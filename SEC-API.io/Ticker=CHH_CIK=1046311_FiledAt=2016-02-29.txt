Business. 

Overview 

We are one of the largest hotel franchisors in the world with 6,423 &#32;hotels open and 720 &#32;hotels under construction, awaiting conversion or approved for development as of December 31, 2015 &#32;representing 507,483 &#32;rooms open and 58,130 &#32;rooms under construction, awaiting conversion or approved for development in 50 &#32;states, the District of Columbia and over 35 &#32;countries and territories outside the United States. Choice franchises lodging properties under the following proprietary brand names: Comfort Inn &#174; , Comfort Suites &#174; , Quality &#174; , Clarion &#174; , Sleep Inn &#174; , Econo Lodge &#174; , Rodeway Inn &#174; , MainStay Suites &#174; , Suburban Extended Stay Hotel &#174; , Cambria &#174; &#32;hotels &#38; suites, and Ascend Hotel Collection &#174; &#32;(collectively, the "Choice brands"). &#32; 

We operate in two reportable segments encompassing our hotel franchising business and our SkyTouch Technology ("SkyTouch") division. SkyTouch is a division of the Company that develops and markets cloud-based technology products, including inventory management, pricing and connectivity to third party channels, to hoteliers not under franchise agreements with the Company. SkyTouch's technology products are based on the Company's choiceAdvantage property management system which is utilized by over 5,900 of the Company's franchised hotels. SkyTouch was announced to the public in March 2013 and represents less than 1% and 5% of the Company's total revenues and operating expenses, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2015 . 

The Company's domestic franchising operations are conducted through direct franchising relationships while its international franchise operations are conducted through a combination of direct franchising and master franchising 

relationships. With a focus on hotel franchising instead of ownership, we benefit from the economies of scale inherent in the franchising business. The fee and cost structure of our business provides opportunities to improve operating results by increasing the number of franchised hotel rooms and effective royalty rates of our franchise contracts resulting in increased initial and relicensing fee revenue, ongoing royalty fees and procurement services revenues. In addition to these revenues, we also collect marketing and reservation system fees to provide support activities for the franchise system. Our operating results can also be improved through our company-wide efforts related to improving property level performance. The Company's hotel franchising business currently has relatively low capital expenditure requirements. 

The principal factors that affect the Company&#8217;s franchising results are: the number and mix of franchised hotel rooms in the various hotel lodging price categories; growth in the number of hotel rooms under franchise; occupancy and room rates achieved by the hotels under franchise; the effective royalty rate achieved; the level of franchise sales and relicensing activity; and our ability to manage costs. The number of rooms at franchised properties and occupancy and room rates at those properties significantly affect the Company&#8217;s results because our royalty and marketing and reservation system fees are primarily based upon room revenues or the number of rooms at franchised hotels. The key industry standard for measuring hotel-operating performance is revenue per available room ("RevPAR"), which is calculated by multiplying the percentage of occupied rooms by the average daily room rate realized. Our variable overhead costs associated with franchise system growth of our established brands have historically been less than incremental royalty fees generated from new franchises. Accordingly, continued growth of our franchise business should enable us to realize benefits from the operating leverage in place and improve operating results. 

We are contractually required by our franchise agreements to use the marketing and reservation system fees we collect for system-wide support activities. These expenditures help to enhance awareness and increase consumer preference for our brands. Greater awareness and preference promotes long-term growth in business delivery to our franchisees and increases the desirability of our brands to hotel owners and developers, which ultimately increases franchise fees earned by the Company. 

Our Company articulates its mission as a commitment to our franchisees&#8217; profitability by providing them with hotel franchises that strive to generate the highest return on investment of any hotel franchise. We have developed an operating system dedicated to our franchisees&#8217; success that focuses on delivering guests to our franchised hotels and reducing costs for our hotel owners. 

Our capital allocation decisions, including capital structure and uses of capital, are intended to maximize our return on invested capital and create value for our shareholders. We believe our strong and predictable cash flows create a strong financial position that provides us a competitive advantage. We maintain a capital structure that generates high financial returns and use our excess cash flow to provide returns to our shareholders primarily through share repurchases, dividends or investing in growth opportunities. 

Historically, we have returned value to our shareholders in two primary ways: share repurchases and dividends. In 1998, we instituted a share repurchase program which has generated substantial value for our shareholders. Since the program's inception through December 31, 2015 , we have repurchased 48.1 million &#32;shares (including 33.0 million million prior to the two-for-one stock split effected in October 2005) of common stock at a total cost of $1.2 billion . Considering the effect of the two-for-one stock split, the Company has repurchased 81.1 million &#32;shares at an average price of $15.13 &#32;per share. At December 31, 2015 , the Company had 1.7 million &#32;shares remaining under the current share repurchase authorization. We currently believe that our cash flows from operations will support our ability to complete the current board of directors repurchase authorization and upon completion of the current authorization, our board of directors will evaluate the advisability of additional share repurchases. 

The Company commenced paying quarterly dividends in 2004 and in 2012 the Company elected to pay a special cash dividend totaling approximately $600 million. The Company currently maintains the payment of a quarterly dividend on its common shares outstanding; however the declaration of future dividends is subject to the discretion of the board of directors. With the exception of the 2012 special cash dividend, quarterly cash dividends paid on common shares outstanding was $0.185 per share for each quarter for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2014. In the fourth quarter of 2014, the board of directors increased the quarterly cash dividend from $0.185 per share to $0.195 per share, beginning with the dividend payable in the first quarter of 2015. In the fourth quarter of 2015, the board of directors agreed to increase the quarterly cash dividend from $0.195 per share to $0.205 per share, beginning with the dividend payable in the first quarter of 2016. The projected annual dividend in 2016 &#32;is $0.82 per annum. We expect to continue to pay dividends in the future, subject to quarterly declaration by our board of directors as well as future business performance, economic conditions, changes in income tax regulations and other factors. 

The Company also allocates capital to exploring growth opportunities in business areas that are adjacent or complementary to our core hotel franchising business, which leverage our core competencies and are additive to our franchising business model. The timing and amount of these investments are subject to market and other conditions. 

Our direct lodging property real estate exposure is limited to activity in the United States and consists of three parcels of real estate that the Company has acquired and intends to resell to incent franchise development in strategic markets or to pursue hotel development through joint ventures. In addition, our development activities that involve financing, equity investments and guaranty support to hotel developers create limited additional exposure to the real estate markets. 

The Lodging Industry 

Companies participating in the lodging industry primarily do so through a combination of one or more of the three primary lodging industry activities: ownership, franchising and management. A company&#8217;s relative reliance on each of these activities determines which drivers most influence its profitability. 

&#8226; 

Ownership requires a substantial capital commitment and involves the most risk but offers high returns due to the owner&#8217;s ability to influence margins by driving RevPAR, managing operating expenses and financial leverage. The ownership model has a high fixed-cost structure that results in a high degree of operating leverage relative to RevPAR performance. As a result, profits escalate rapidly in a lodging up-cycle but erode quickly in a downturn as costs rarely decline as fast as revenue. Profits from an ownership model increase at a greater rate from RevPAR growth attributable to average daily rate ("ADR") growth, than from occupancy gains since there are more incremental costs associated with higher guest volumes compared to higher pricing. 

&#8226; 

Franchisors license their brands to a hotel owner, giving the hotel owner the right to use the brand name, logo, operating practices, and reservations systems in exchange for a fee and an agreement to operate the hotel in accordance with the franchisor&#8217;s brand standards. Under a typical franchise agreement, the hotel owner pays the franchisor an initial fee, a percentage-of-revenue royalty fee and a marketing/reservation fee. A franchisor&#8217;s revenues are dependent on the number of rooms in its system and the top-line performance of those hotels. Earnings drivers include RevPAR increases, unit growth and effective royalty rate improvement. Franchisors enjoy significant operating leverage in their business model since it typically costs little to add a new hotel franchise to an existing system. Franchisors normally benefit from higher industry supply growth, because unit growth usually outpaces lower RevPAR resulting from excess supply. As a result, franchisors benefit from both RevPAR growth and supply increases which aids in reducing the impact of lodging industry economic cycles. 

&#8226; 

Management companies operate hotels for owners that do not have the expertise and/or the desire to self-manage. These companies collect management fees predominately based on revenues earned and/or profits generated. Similar to franchising activities, the key drivers of revenue based management fees are RevPAR and unit growth and similar to ownership activities, profit based fees are driven by improved hotel margins and RevPAR growth. 

Similarly to other industries, lodging experiences both positive and negative operating cycles. Positive cycles are characterized as periods of sustained occupancy growth, increasing room rates and hotel development. These cycles usually continue until either the economy sustains a prolonged downturn, excess supply conditions exist or some external factor occurs such as war, terrorism or natural resource shortages. Negative cycles are characterized by hoteliers reducing room rates to stimulate occupancy and a reduction of hotel development. Industry recovery usually begins with an increase in occupancy followed by hoteliers increasing room rates. As demand begins to exceed room supply, occupancies and rates continue to improve. These factors result in increased hotel development. 

Hotel room supply growth is cyclical as hotel construction responds to interest rates, construction and material supply conditions, capital availability and industry fundamentals. Historically, the industry has added hotel rooms to its inventory through new construction due largely to favorable lending environments that encouraged hotel development. Typically, hotel development continues during favorable lending environments until the increase in room supply outpaces demand. The excess supply eventually results in lower occupancies, which results in hoteliers reducing room rates to stimulate demand, and reduced hotel development. Over time, the slow growth in hotel supply results in increased occupancy rates and allows hotels to again raise room rates. The increase in occupancy and room rates serves as a catalyst for increased hotel development.

As a franchisor, we believe we are well positioned in any stage of the lodging cycle as our fee-for-service business model has historically delivered predictable, profitable, long-term growth in a variety of lodging and economic environments. We have historically benefited from both the RevPAR gains typically experienced in the early stages of recovery, as our revenues are based on our franchisees&#8217; gross room revenues, and the supply growth normally occurring in the later stages as we increase our portfolio size. 

The Company&#8217;s portfolio of brands offers both new construction and conversion opportunities. Our new construction brands typically benefit from periods of supply growth and favorable capital availability and pricing. Our conversion brands also benefit from periods of supply growth as the construction of hotels increases the need for existing hotels to seek new brand affiliations as their product moves through the hotel life cycle. Furthermore, the Company's conversion brands benefit from lodging cycle downturns as our unit growth has been historically driven from the conversion of independent and other hotel chain affiliates into our system as these hotels endeavor to improve their performance. 

The lodging industry can be divided into chain scale categories or groupings of generally competitive brands as follows:

According to Smith Travel Research, the lodging industry consisted of approximately 54,000 hotels representing approximately 5.0 million rooms open and operating in the United States at December 31, 2015 . During the year ended December 31, 2015 , the industry added approximately 60,000 gross rooms to the industry supply and net room growth was approximately 1.2%. Approximately, 46% of the new rooms opened during the year were positioned in the Upper Midscale, Midscale and Economy chain scale segments in which we primarily operate. 

The lodging industry consists of independent operators of hotels and those that have joined national hotel franchise chains. Independent operators of hotels not owned or managed by major lodging companies have increasingly joined national hotel franchise chains as a means of remaining competitive with hotels owned by or affiliated with national lodging companies. Over the years, the industry has seen a significant movement of hotels from independent to chain affiliation, with affiliated hotels increasing from 46% of the rooms in the market in 1990 to 70% of the market in 2015 . However, the pace of this increase has moderated over the last several years and in 2015 &#32;the percentage of rooms in the market affiliated with a chain increased by approximately 50 basis points from 69.1% to 69.6%. 

Due to the fact that a significant portion of the costs of owning and operating a hotel are generally fixed, increases in revenues generated by affiliation with a franchise lodging chain can improve a hotel&#8217;s financial performance. The large franchise lodging chains, including us, generally provide a number of support services to hotel operators designed to improve the financial performance of their properties including central reservation and property management systems, marketing and advertising programs, training and education programs, revenue enhancement services and relationships with qualified vendors to streamline purchasing processes and make lower cost products available. We believe that national franchise chains with a large number of hotels enjoy greater brand awareness among potential guests than those with fewer hotels, and that greater brand awareness can increase the desirability of a hotel to its potential guests. Furthermore, we believe that hotel operators choose lodging franchisors based primarily on the perceived value and quality of each franchisor&#8217;s brand and its services, and the extent to which affiliation with that franchisor may increase the hotel operator profitability. 

Choice&#8217;s Franchising Business 

Choice operates primarily as a hotel franchisor offering 11 brands. This family of well-known and diversified new construction and conversion brands competes at various hotel consumer and developer price points. 

Economics of Franchising Business . The fee and cost structure of our business provides opportunities for us to improve operating results by increasing the number of franchised hotel rooms, improving RevPAR performance and increasing the effective royalty rates of our franchise contracts. As a hotel franchisor, we derive our revenue primarily from various franchise fees. Our franchise fees consist primarily of an initial fee and ongoing royalty, marketing and reservation system fees that are typically based on a percentage of the franchised hotel&#8217;s gross room revenues. The initial fee and on-going royalty portion of the franchise fees are intended to cover our operating expenses, such as expenses incurred in business development, quality assurance, administrative support, certain franchise services and to provide us with operating profits. The marketing and 

reservation system fees are used for the expenses associated with marketing, media, advertising, providing a central reservation system, property management systems, e-commerce initiatives and certain franchise services. 

Our fee stream depends on the number of rooms in our system, the gross room revenues generated by our franchisees and effective royalty rates under our franchise contracts. We enjoy significant operating leverage since the variable operating costs associated with the franchise system growth of our established brands have historically been less than incremental royalty fees generated from new franchises. We believe that our business is well positioned in the lodging industry since we benefit from both increases in RevPAR and unit growth from new hotel construction or conversion of existing hotel assets into our system. 

Our family of well-known and diversified brand offerings positions us well within the lodging industry. Our Cambria hotel and suites, Comfort Inn, Comfort Suites, Sleep Inn, Suburban Extended Stay Hotel and MainStay Suites are primarily new build brands which offer hotel developers an array of choices at various price points for transient and extended stay business during periods of supply growth. Our Ascend Hotel Collection, Clarion, Quality, Econo Lodge and Rodeway Inn brands offer conversion opportunities during both industry contraction and growth cycles to independent operators and non-Choice affiliated hotels who desire to affiliate with our brands and take advantage of the services we have to offer. 

Strategy. &#32;Our mission is a commitment to franchisee profitability by providing our franchisees with hotel franchises that strive to generate the highest return on investment of any hotel franchise. Our business strategy is to create franchise system growth by leveraging Choice&#8217;s large and well-known hotel brands, franchise sales capabilities, effective marketing and reservation delivery efforts, training and education programs, RevPAR enhancing services and technologies and financial strength created by our significant free cash flow. We believe our brands&#8217; growth will be driven by our ability to create a compelling return on investment for franchisees. Our strategic objective is to improve profitability of our franchisees by providing services which increase business delivery, enhance RevPAR, reduce hotel operating and development costs, and/or improve guest satisfaction. Specific elements of our strategy include: building strong brands, delivering exceptional services, reaching more consumers and leveraging our size, scale and distribution to reduce costs for hotel owners. We believe that by focusing on these elements we can increase the gross room revenues generated by our franchisees by increasing the business delivered to existing franchisees and expanding our market share of franchised hotels in the chain scale segments in which we operate or seek to operate. Improving the desirability of our brands should also allow us to continue to improve the effective royalty rate of our contracts. 

Building Strong Brands . Each of our brands has particular attributes and strengths, including awareness with both consumers and developers. Our strategy is to utilize the strengths of each brand for room growth, RevPAR gains and royalty rate improvement that create revenue growth. We believe brand consistency, brand quality and guest satisfaction are critical in improving brand performance and building strong brands. 

We have multiple brands that are positioned to meet the needs of many types of guests. These brands can be developed at various price points and are suitable for both new construction properties and existing hotels. This flexibility ensures that we have brands suitable for creating room growth in various types of markets, with various types of customers, and during both industry contraction and growth cycles. During times of lower industry supply growth and tighter capital markets, we can target conversions of existing non-Choice affiliated hotels seeking the awareness and proven performance provided by our brands. During periods of strong industry supply growth, we expect a greater portion of our room growth to come from our new construction brands. We believe that a large number of markets can still support our hotel brands and that the growth potential for our brands remains strong. 

We strive to maintain the strength of our brands by enhancing product consistency and quality. We attempt to achieve consistency and quality for new entrants into the franchise system by placing prospective hotels in the appropriate brand based on the physical characteristics, performance and amenities of the hotel and by requiring property improvement plans, when necessary, to ensure the new hotel meets the quality standards of the brand. Furthermore, we may require hotels currently in our franchise system to execute property improvement plans at specified contractual windows to ensure that they continue to maintain the product consistency and quality standards of the brand. 

We believe each of our brands appeals to targeted hotel owners and guests because of unique brand standards, marketing campaigns, loyalty programs, reservation delivery, service levels and pricing. 

Delivering Exceptional Services. &#32;We provide a combination of services and technology based offerings to help our franchisees improve performance. We have field services staff members located nationwide that help franchisees improve RevPAR performance and guest satisfaction. In addition, we provide our franchisees with education and training programs as well as revenue management technology and services designed to improve property level performance. These services and products promote revenue gains for franchisees and improve guest satisfaction which translate into both higher royalties for the Company and improved returns for owners, leading to further room growth by making our brands even more attractive to 

prospective franchisees. We develop our services based on customer needs and focus on activities that generate high return on investment for our franchisees. 

Reaching More Consumers . We believe hotel owners value and benefit from the large volume of guests we deliver through a mix of activities including brand marketing, reservation systems, key account sales, and the Company&#8217;s loyalty program, Choice Privileges &#174; . Our strategy is to maximize the effectiveness of these activities in delivering both leisure and business travelers to Choice-branded hotels. 

The Company intends to continue to increase awareness of its brands through its national marketing campaigns and its Choice Privileges loyalty program promotions. These campaigns are intended to generate a compelling message to consumers to create even greater awareness for our brands with the ultimate goal of driving business through our central reservation system. Local and regional co-op marketing campaigns will continue to be utilized to leverage the national marketing programs to drive business to our franchised properties at a local level. We expect our efforts at marketing directly to individual guests and corporate customers will continue to be enhanced through the use of our customer relationship management technology and programs; as well as, our field based sales agents that are focused on increasing our share of business travelers. Our continued focus on overall brand quality coupled with our marketing initiatives is designed to stimulate room demand for our franchised hotels through improved guest awareness and satisfaction. 

Our central reservations system is a critical technology used to deliver guests to our franchisees through multiple channels, including our call centers, proprietary web and mobile sites, global distribution systems (e.g., SABRE and Amadeus), on-line travel agents ("OTAs") (e.g. Expedia and Bookings.com) and internet referral or booking services (e.g., Kayak and Trip Advisor). We believe our well-known brands, combined with our relationships with many internet distribution web sites benefits our franchisees, by facilitating increased rate and reservations delivery, and reducing costs and operational complexity. 

Leveraging Size, Scale and Distribution . We continually focus on identifying methods for utilizing the significant number of hotels in our system to reduce costs and increase returns for our franchisees. For example, we create relationships with qualified vendors to: (i) make low-cost products available to our franchisees; (ii) streamline the purchasing process; and (iii) maintain brand standards and consistency. We plan to expand these relationships and identify new methods for decreasing hotel-operating costs by increasing penetration within our existing franchise system and enhancing our existing vendor relationships and/or creating new vendor relationships. We believe our efforts to leverage the Company&#8217;s size, scale and distribution benefit the Company by enhancing brand quality and consistency, improving our franchisees returns and satisfaction, and creating procurement services revenues.

Revenues from our domestic operations comprised 94% &#32;and 92% &#32;of our total revenues in 2015 and 2014 , respectively. As a result, our description of the franchise system is primarily focused on the domestic operations. 

Our standard domestic franchise agreements grant franchisees the non-exclusive right to use certain of our trademarks and receive other benefits of our franchise system to facilitate the operation of their franchised hotel at a specified location. The majority of our standard domestic franchise agreements are 10 to 20 years in duration with certain rights for each of the franchisor and franchisee to terminate their franchise agreement, such as upon designated anniversaries of the agreement, before the 20 th &#32;(or 10 th , as applicable) year. Our franchisees operate domestically under one of eleven Choice brand names: Comfort Inn, Comfort Suites, Cambria hotels and suites, Quality, Clarion, Ascend Hotel Collection, Sleep Inn, Econo Lodge, Rodeway Inn, MainStay Suites and Suburban Extended Stay Hotel. 

The following table presents key statistics related to our domestic franchise system over the five years ended December 31, 2015 .

International Franchise Operations 

The Company conducts its international franchise operations through a combination of direct franchising and master franchising relationships. Master franchising relationships are governed by master franchising agreements that generally provide the master franchisee with the right to use and sub-license the use of our brands in a specific geographic region, usually for a fee. 

Our business philosophy has been to conduct direct franchising in those international markets where both franchising is an accepted business model and we believe our brands can achieve significant distribution. We typically elect to enter into master franchise agreements in those markets where direct franchising is currently not a prevalent or viable business model. When entering into master franchising relationships, we strive to select partners that have professional hotel and asset management capabilities together with the financial capacity to invest in building the Choice brands in their respective markets. Master franchising relationships typically provide lower revenues to the Company as the master franchisees are responsible for managing certain necessary services (such as training, quality assurance, reservations and marketing) to support the franchised hotels in the master franchise area and therefore retain a larger percentage of the hotel franchise fees to cover their expenses. In certain circumstances, the Company has and may continue to make equity investments in our master franchisees. 

As a result of our use of master franchising relationships and international market conditions, revenues from international franchising operations comprised 6% &#32;and 8% &#32;of our total revenues in 2015 and 2014 , respectively, while representing approximately 18% &#32;of our franchise system hotels open as of December 31 st &#32;of the same periods. 

In some territories outside the United States hotel franchising is less prevalent, and many markets are served primarily by independent operators. We believe that chain and franchise affiliation will increase in certain international markets as local economies grow and hotel owners seek the economies of centralized reservations systems and marketing programs. We believe that international franchise operations will provide a significant long-term growth opportunity for the Company and as a result we have embarked on a multi-year investment in information technology and marketing which is expected to enhance the value proposition for prospective international franchisees. 

As of December 31, 2015 , we had 1,147 &#32;franchise hotels open and operating in 30 countries and territories outside of the United States. The following chart summarizes our franchise system outside of the United States.

Franchise Sales 

Brand growth is important to our business model. We have identified key market areas for hotel development based on supply/demand relationships and our strategic objectives. Development opportunities are typically offered to: (i) existing franchisees; (ii) developers of hotels; (iii) owners of independent hotels and motels; (iv) owners of hotels leaving other franchisors&#8217; brands; and, (v) franchisees of non-hotel related products such as restaurants. 

Our franchise sales organization is structured to support the Company&#8217;s efforts to leverage its core strengths in order to take advantage of opportunities for further growth. The franchise sales organization employs both sales managers as well as franchise sales directors. This organization emphasizes the benefits of affiliating with the Choice system, our commitment to improving hotel profitability, our central reservation delivery services, our marketing and customer loyalty programs, our training and support systems (including our proprietary property management systems) and our Company&#8217;s track record of growth and profitability to potential franchisees. Franchise sales directors are assigned to specific brands to leverage their brand expertise to enhance product consistency and deal flow. Our sales managers ensure each prospective hotel is placed in the appropriate brand, facilitate teamwork and information sharing amongst the sales directors and provide better service to our potential franchisees. The structure of this organization supports the Company&#8217;s efforts to leverage its core strengths in order to take advantage of opportunities for further growth. Integrating our brands and strategies allow our brand teams to focus on understanding, anticipating and meeting the unique needs of our customers. 

Our objective is to continue to grow our portfolio by continuing to sell our existing brands, creating extensions of our existing brands and introducing new brands, either organically or via acquisition, within the various lodging chain categories. Based on market conditions and other circumstances, we may offer certain incentives to developers to increase development of our brands such as discounting various fees such as the initial franchise fee, royalty rates and marketing and reservation system rates as well as provide financing for property improvements and other purposes. 

Because retention of existing franchisees is important to our growth strategy, we have a formal impact policy. For most of our brands, this policy offers existing franchisees protection from the opening of a same-brand property within a specified distance, depending upon the market in which the property is located. 

Investment, Financing and Guaranty Franchisee Support 

Our board of directors authorized a program which permits us to offer financing, investment, and guaranty support to qualified franchisees as well as allows us to acquire and resell real estate to incent franchise development for certain brands in strategic markets. We expect to deploy capital pursuant to this program opportunistically to promote growth of our emerging brands. The amount and timing of the investment in this program will be dependent on market and other conditions and we generally expect to recycle these investments within a five year period. 

Franchise Agreements 

Our standard domestic franchise agreements grant franchisees the non-exclusive right to use certain of our trademarks and receive other benefits of our franchise system to facilitate the operation of their franchised hotel at a specified location. Our standard domestic franchise agreements generally have terms ranging between 10 and 30 years, with certain rights for each of the franchisor and franchisee to terminate their franchise agreement, such as upon designated anniversaries of the agreement, before the end of the agreement term. 

Generally, either party to our standard domestic franchise agreement can terminate the agreement prior to the conclusion of the agreement&#8217;s term under certain circumstances, such as upon designated anniversaries of the agreement, subject to applicable law. Early termination options give us flexibility in eliminating or re-branding properties for reasons other than contractual failure by the franchisee. This allows us the opportunity to strengthen our brand portfolio in various markets by replacing weaker performing hotels. We also have the right to terminate a franchise agreement if a franchisee fails to bring the property into compliance with contractual or quality standards within specified periods of time. The franchise agreements also typically contain liquidated damages provisions which represent a fair measure of damages that our franchisee and we agree should be paid to us upon an early termination of the franchise agreement. 

When the responsibility for development is transferred to an international master franchisee, that party has the responsibility to develop and grow our brands in the master franchise area. Additionally, the master franchisee generally must manage the delivery of certain necessary services (such as quality assurance, reservations and marketing) to support the franchised hotels in the master franchise area. The master franchisee collects the fees paid by the local franchisee and remits an agreed upon share to us. Master franchise agreements generally have a term of at least 10 years. We have only entered into master franchise agreements with respect to franchised hotels outside the United States. 

Franchise agreements are individually negotiated and vary among the different Choice brands and franchises, but generally are competitive with the industry standard within their market group. Franchise fees usually have three primary components: an initial, one-time affiliation fee; a royalty fee; and a marketing and reservation system fee. 

Our standard franchise fees are as follows:

Royalty rate is $33.00 per room per month or 4% of gross room revenue. 

(2) 

Marketing and reservation system fees are $13.00 per room per month or 2.5% of gross room revenue.

As previously noted, the Company&#8217;s franchise agreements are individually negotiated and therefore actual fees may differ from those noted above. From time to time, the Company may discount the standard royalty fees and/or marketing and reservation system fees in the initial years of the agreement as a franchisee acquisition strategy. Typically, these discounts expire as the contract matures until the contractual fees reach the standard franchise fees in effect at the time the agreement was executed. 

Franchise Operations 

Our operations are designed to help our franchisees, improve RevPAR and lower operating and development costs, as these are the measures of performance that most directly impact franchisee profitability. We believe that by helping our franchisees become more profitable we will enhance our ability to both retain our existing franchisees and attract new franchisees. The key aspects of our franchise operations are: 

Brand Name Marketing and Advertising . Our hotels are typically located in areas conveniently accessible to business and leisure travelers and therefore approximately 57% of our hotel room nights are sold to guests who either walk-in or contact the hotel directly. As a result, we believe that brand name recognition and the strength of the brand reputation are important factors in influencing business and leisure traveler hotel accommodation choices. 

Our marketing and advertising programs are designed to heighten consumer awareness and preference for our brands as offering the greatest value and convenience in the lodging categories in which we compete. Marketing and advertising efforts include national television, internet and radio advertising, on-line advertising, social media/digital advertising, print advertising in consumer and trade media and promotional events, including joint marketing promotions with qualified vendors and corporate partners. We also actively seek to maximize our presence on the internet by purchasing key search related terms from the various search engine providers to ensure that our hotels are prominently displayed to all potential guests. 

We conduct numerous marketing and sales programs and deploy field based sales agents which target specific groups, including business travelers, senior citizens, automobile club members, families, government and military employees, educational organizations and meeting planners. Other marketing efforts include domestic and international trade show programs, publication of group and tour rate directories, direct-mail programs, electronic direct marketing e-mail programs, centralized commissions for travel agents, fly-drive programs in conjunction with major airlines, and the publication of electronic travel and vacation directories. 

We operate a loyalty program, Choice Privileges, for all of the Choice brands to attract and retain travelers by rewarding frequent stays with points towards free hotel nights and other rewards. Choice Privileges participants can earn points redeemable for free nights in Choice brand properties. The Company also offers guests the ability to earn airline miles for qualifying stays redeemable for flights with various airline partners as well as redeem points for gift certificates at participating retailers. These programs allow us to conduct lower cost, more targeted marketing campaigns to our consumers, deliver incremental business to our franchised hotels and are an important selling point for our franchise sales personnel. Choice Privileges members contribute approximately a third of the Company&#8217;s domestic gross room revenues and the program had approximately 25 million members worldwide as of December 31, 2015 . Growing the membership of the Choice Privileges program as well as increasing the number of room nights consumed by existing members will continue to be a focus of the Company. 

Marketing and advertising programs are directed by our marketing department, which utilizes the services of independent advertising agencies. We also employ home-based sales personnel geographically located across the United States using personal sales calls, telemarketing and other techniques to target specific customer groups, such as potential corporate clients in areas where our franchised hotels are located, the group travel market, and meeting planners. 

Our field based franchise services area directors work with franchisees to help them maximize RevPAR. These consultants advise franchisees on topics such as marketing their hotels, improving quality and maximizing the benefits offered by the Choice reservations system. Our proprietary property management system includes a rate and selling management tool to help our franchisees better manage rates and inventory which are designed to help them improve RevPAR by optimizing ADR and occupancy. In addition, we have recently added revenue management services to our service offerings to assist franchisees in maximizing their room rates. 

Central Reservation System ("CRS") . On average, 43% of the gross room revenue booked at domestic franchised properties is reserved through our central reservation system, which consists of our toll-free telephone reservation system, our proprietary internet site, mobile phone and tablet reservation applications, interfaces with global distribution systems, and other internet reservations sites. We strive to improve the percentage of business delivered by our CRS as room nights reserved through these channels are typically at higher average daily rates than reservations booked directly through the property. In addition, increasing the percentage of business delivered through the CRS improves our value proposition to a hotel owner and therefore assists in retention of existing and acquisition of new franchisees. 

&#32;Our CRS provides a data link to our franchised properties as well as to travel reservation systems such as Amadeus, Galileo, SABRE and Worldspan that facilitate the reservation process for travel agents and corporate travelers. We also offer 

rooms for sale on our own proprietary internet site (www.choicehotels.com) and mobile applications as well as those of online travel agents ("OTA's") and other third-party internet referral or booking services. 

Our toll-free telephone reservation system primarily utilizes third party call center service providers. Reservation agents trained on the reservation system can match each caller with a Choice-branded hotel meeting the caller&#8217;s needs. We also operate a call forwarding program through which our franchisees can leverage our central reservation system capabilities by forwarding reservation calls received directly by the property to one of our reservation centers. Typically, this reduces the hotel&#8217;s front desk staffing needs, improves customer service and results in a higher average daily rate than reservations booked directly through the property. 

We continue to implement our integrated reservation and distribution strategy to improve reservations delivery, reduce franchisee costs and improve franchisee satisfaction by enhancing our website, choicehotels.com. We also design our marketing campaigns to drive reservation traffic directly to our proprietary channels to minimize the impact that third party reservation sites may have on the pricing of our franchisees' inventory. In addition, we have introduced programs such as our Best Internet Rate Guarantee program which has greatly reduced the ability of the travel intermediaries to undercut the published rates at our franchisees' hotels. In addition, we selectively distribute franchisees' inventory to key third party travel intermediaries that we have established agreements with to drive additional business to our franchisees' hotels. These agreements typically offer our brands preferred placement on these third party sites at reduced transaction fees. We also continue to educate our individual franchisees about the unfavorable impact to their business of contracting with sites with which we do not have preferred agreements. We currently have agreements with many but not all major online third party booking sites. 

Property Management Systems . Our proprietary property and yield management system, choiceADVANTAGE, is designed to help franchisees maximize profitability and compete more effectively by assisting them in managing their room inventory, rates and reservations. choiceADVANTAGE synchronizes each hotel&#8217;s inventory with our central reservation system, giving our reservation sales agents last room sell capabilities at every hotel. Our property management system also includes a revenue management feature that calculates and suggests optimum rates based on each hotel&#8217;s past performance and projected occupancy. These tools are critical to business delivery and yield improvement as they facilitate a franchisees&#8217; ability to effectively manage hotel operations, determine appropriate rates, drive occupancy and participate in our marketing programs. As a cloud based solution, the choiceADVANTAGE system reduces each hotel&#8217;s investment in on-site computer equipment typically resulting in a lower total cost of ownership for property management systems than traditional on-site solutions. 

Quality Assurance Programs . Consistent quality standards are critical to the success of a hotel franchise. We have established quality standards for all of our franchised brands that cover housekeeping, maintenance, brand identification and minimum service offerings. We inspect properties for compliance with our quality standards when application is made for admission to the franchise system. The compliance of existing franchisees with quality standards is monitored through scheduled and unannounced quality assurance reviews conducted periodically at the property and through the use of guest surveys. Properties that fail to maintain a minimum score are reinspected on a more frequent basis until deficiencies are cured, or until such properties are terminated. To encourage compliance with quality standards, various brand-specific incentives and awards are used to reward franchisees that maintain consistent quality standards. We identify franchisees whose properties operate below minimum quality standards and assist them to comply with brand specifications. Franchisees who fail to improve on identified quality matters may be subject to consequences ranging from written warnings, the payment of re-inspection, non-compliance and guest satisfaction fees, attendance at mandatory training programs and ultimately to the termination of the franchise agreement. Actual consequences, if any, are determined in the Company&#8217;s discretion on a case-by-case basis and may take into account a variety of factors apart from a franchisee&#8217;s level of compliance with our quality standards and brand specifications. 

Training . We maintain a training department that conducts mandatory and voluntary training programs for all franchisees and general managers. Regularly scheduled regional and national training meetings are also conducted for owners and general managers. We offer an interactive computer and mobile-based training system to help train hotel employees in real-time as well as at their own pace. Additional training is conducted through a variety of methods, including group instruction seminars and live on-line instructor-led programs. 

Opening Services . We maintain an opening services department that ensures incoming hotels meet or exceed brand standards and are properly displayed in our various reservation distribution systems to help ensure that each incoming hotel opens successfully. We also maintain a design and construction department to assist franchisees in refurbishing, renovating, or constructing their properties prior to or after joining the system. Department personnel assist franchisees in meeting our brand specifications by providing technical expertise and cost-savings suggestions. 

Competition 

Competition among franchise lodging chains is intense in attracting potential franchisees, retaining existing franchisees and generating reservations for franchisees. Franchise contracts are typically long-term in nature, but most allow the hotel owner to opt-out of the agreement at mutually agreed upon anniversary dates. 

We believe that hotel operators choose lodging franchisors based primarily on the value and quality of each franchisor&#8217;s brand(s) and services and the extent to which affiliation with that franchisor may increase the franchisee&#8217;s reservations and profits. We also believe that hotel operators select a franchisor in part based on the franchisor&#8217;s reputation among other franchisees and the success of its existing franchisees. 

Since our franchising revenues are based on franchisees&#8217; gross room revenues, our prospects for growth are largely dependent upon the ability of our franchisees to compete in the lodging market, our ability to convert competitor franchises and independent hotels to our brands and the ability of existing and potential franchisees to obtain financing to construct new hotels. 

The ability of a hotel to compete may be affected by a number of factors, including the location and quality of the property, the abilities of the franchisee, the number and quality of competing lodging facilities nearby, its affiliation with a recognized name brand and general regional and local economic conditions. We believe the effect of local economic conditions on our results is substantially reduced by our range of products and room rates and the geographic diversity of our franchised properties, which are open and operating in 50 &#32;states, the District of Columbia and over 35 &#32;countries and territories outside the United States. 

We believe that our focus on core business strategies, combined with our financial strength and size, geographic diversity, scale and distribution will enable us to remain competitive. 

Service Marks and Other Intellectual Property 

The service marks Choice Hotels International, Comfort Inn, Comfort Suites, Quality, Clarion, Sleep Inn, Econo Lodge, Rodeway Inn, MainStay Suites, Cambria hotels &#38; suites, Suburban Extended Stay Hotel, Ascend Hotel Collection, Choice Privileges, SkyTouch Technology and related marks and logos are material to our business. We, directly and through our franchisees, actively use these marks. All of the material marks are registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. In addition, we have registered certain of our marks with the appropriate governmental agencies in the countries where we are doing business or anticipate doing business in the foreseeable future. We seek to protect our brands and marks throughout the world, although the strength of legal protection available varies from country to country. Depending on the jurisdiction, trademarks and other registered marks are valid as long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained and they have not been found to have become generic. 

Seasonality 

The hotel industry is seasonal in nature. For most hotels, demand is lower in November through February than during the remainder of the year. Our principal source of revenues is franchise fees based on the gross room revenues of our franchised properties. The Company's franchise fee revenues reflect the industry's seasonality and historically have been lower in the first and fourth quarters than in the second and third quarters. 

Regulation 

The Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC"), various states and certain other foreign jurisdictions (including Australia, France, Canada, and Mexico) regulate the sale of franchises. The FTC requires franchisors to make extensive disclosure to prospective franchisees but does not require registration. A number of states in which our franchisees operate require registration and disclosure in connection with franchise offers and sales. In addition, several states have "franchise relationship laws" that, among other things, limit the ability of the franchisor to terminate franchise agreements or to withhold consent to the renewal or transfer of these agreements. While our franchising operations have not been materially adversely affected by such regulations, we cannot predict the effect of future regulation or legislation. 

Our franchisees are responsible for compliance with all laws and government regulations applicable to the hotels they own or operate. The lodging industry is subject to numerous federal, state and local government regulations, including those relating to the preparation and sale of food and beverage (such as health and liquor license laws), building and zoning requirements and laws governing employee relations, including minimum wage requirements, overtime, working conditions and work permit requirements. 

Impact of Inflation and Other External Factors 

Franchise fees can be impacted by external factors including, in particular, the supply of hotel rooms within the lodging industry relative to the demand for rooms by travelers and inflation. 

We expect to benefit in the form of increased franchise fees from future growth in consumer demand for hotel rooms as well as growth in the supply of hotel rooms, to the extent it does not result in excess lodging industry capacity. However, a prolonged decline in demand for hotel rooms would negatively impact our business. 

Although we believe that increases in the rate of inflation will generally result in comparable increases in hotel room rates, severe inflation could contribute to a slowing of the economies in which we operate. Such a slowdown could result in reduced travel by both business and leisure travelers, potentially resulting in less demand for hotel rooms, which could result in a reduction in room rates and fewer room reservations, negatively impacting our revenues. A weak economy could also reduce demand for new hotels, negatively impacting the franchise fees received by us. 

Among other unpredictable external factors, which may negatively impact us, are wars, acts of terrorism, airline strikes, gasoline shortages, severe weather and the risks described below under the Item 1A. Risk Factors. 

SkyTouch Technology 

&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;SkyTouch Technology ("SkyTouch") is a division of the Company that develops and markets cloud-based technology products to the hotel industry. SkyTouch sells, manages, and supports a large, widely distributed cloud-based property management system to branded chains and independent hoteliers, helping them to achieve growth, to advance operating performance, and to improve the guest experience - all while evolving with changing customer needs. The SkyTouch Hotel OS &#174; &#32;solution is based on the Company&#8217;s award-winning, proprietary technology platform, choiceADVANTAGE, that was first introduced over a decade ago to meet the needs of its franchisees. The SkyTouch Hotel OS solution offers many of the same functions of the choiceADVANTAGE property and rate management platform, including managing reservations, guest stays, and rates on any device with an internet connection as well as the ability to connect seamlessly with other systems used by chain and independent hotels. The system has been enhanced to add distribution management services, and offers central reservation system interfaces utilizing hotel technology next generation specifications for ease of deployment and partnership with other technology providers. 

The SkyTouch platform also includes a mobile-native interface that offers fast and secure mobile functionality to the major elements of property management and housekeeping. The interface includes quick, mobile-friendly views of key operational data such as ADR, Occupancy, Availability for Tonight, helping improve management efficiency. Housekeeping functionality allows real-time, two-way communication between staff that helps improve the guest experience. Developed with a responsive design and an adaptable mobile support strategy, the interface is optimized as a true cloud-based application for smart phones and tablets, while still accessible from desktops. 

SkyTouch also provides onsite and remote installation and training, and 24/7 phone support to our clients. SkyTouch&#8217;s online training includes simulation-based, highly interactive e-Learning modules with the option to modify and create additional content to meet the needs of hoteliers. 

The hotel property management system market is highly competitive and SkyTouch competes on various bases, including product functionality, service capabilities, price, and geography. SkyTouch competes with companies that have several hotel related software products, as well as companies that offer a single product or service aimed at a particular niche. In addition, SkyTouch products and services compete with room reservation systems developed and marketed by major hotel chains for their corporate-owned operations and franchisees. 

&#160;
