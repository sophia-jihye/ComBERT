Our Company 

&#160;

We are a technology company that produces a plasma based system for the gasification and sterilization of liquid waste. A byproduct of our process is a hydrogen based fuel that we sell for metal cutting as an alternative to acetylene (&#8220;MagneGas2&#174;&#8221;). In addition, we are developing the use of our fuel for co-combustion with hydrocarbon fuels to reduce emissions. We also market, for sale or licensure, our proprietary plasma arc technology for the processing of liquid waste (the &#8220;Plasma Arc Flow&#174; System&#8221;). Through the course of our business development, we have established a retail and distribution platform to sell our fuel for use in the metalworking industries; we have developed a global network of brokers to sell our system for processing liquid waste and we are testing our fuel through a third party laboratory for use in the reduction of coal emissions. Additionally, we intend to acquire other gas distribution businesses in order to become a larger distributor of MagneGas2&#174;, other industrial gases and related equipment.

&#160;

MagneGas Corporation was organized in the state of Delaware on December 9, 2005. We were originally organized under the name 4307, Inc., for the purpose of locating and negotiating with a business entity for a combination. On April 2, 2007 all the issued and outstanding shares of 4307, Inc. were purchased by Clean Energies Tech Co., a private company owned by Dr. Ruggero Santilli, the inventor of the Plasma Arc Flow&#174; technology. Following this stock purchase, our name was changed to MagneGas Corporation.

&#160;

Our Products 

&#160;

We currently have three products: the fuel called MagneGas2&#174; for the metal working industry, the equipment primarily known in the firefighting industry, known as MagneTote, and the machines that produce MagneGas2&#174;, known as Plasma Arc Flow&#174; refineries. In addition, the Company sells metal cutting fuels and ancillary products through its wholly owned subsidiary, Equipment Sales and Service, Inc. (&#8220;ESSI&#8221;), a Florida corporation.

&#160;

While our original fuel for the metal working industry was known as MagneGas&#174;, we started selling MagneGas2&#174; in July 2014 and stopped selling MagneGas&#174; in March 2015.

&#160;

Fuel 

&#160;

In the United States, we currently produce MagneGas2&#174;, which is comprised primarily of hydrogen. The fuel can be used as an alternative to natural gas to power industrial equipment, automobiles and for metal cutting. The fuel is stored in hydrogen cylinders which are then sold to market on a rotating basis. Independent tests have confirmed that it cuts 38% faster than acetylene. The fuel has similar properties as acetylene making it easier for end users to adopt with limited training.

&#160;

MagneTote is a storage and transport system that can be used by firefighters, military and first responders which allows quicker access to fuel. The system has been designed to be used in emergency extraction situations.

&#160;

Equipment 

&#160;

The Plasma Arc Flow&#174; System can gasify many forms of liquids and liquid waste such as used vegetable oils, ethylene glycol and sewage and sludge. Plasma Arc Flow&#174; refineries have been configured in various sizes ranging from 50kw to 500kw depending on the application. Plasma Arc Flow&#174; refineries range in price from $500,000 to $5 Million.

&#160;

The Company is pursuing three major market segments:

&#160;

&#183; Industrial Gas Sales &#160;

&#183; Equipment Sales for Liquid Waste Processing &#160;

&#183; Use of MagneGas2&#174; for the Co-Combustion of Hydro-Carbon Fuels to Reduce Emissions &#160;

The Company&#8217;s Research and Development focuses on the following:

&#160;

&#183; High volume processing of oil &#160;

&#183; Combustion of MagneGas2&#174; with hydrocarbon fuels, such as coal, to reduce emission &#160;

&#183; Third party verification of fuel and equipment safety and performance results

Sales 

&#160;

Industrial Gas Sales 

&#160;

ESSI is being used as a launching platform to accelerate MagneGas2&#174; fuel sales into the Florida market by allowing the Company access to a variety of goods and services for the metal working market and access to acetylene customers for potential conversion into MagneGas2&#174;. In 2015, ESSI had sales of $2,383,981 which includes MagneGas2&#174; fuel sales.

&#160;

ESSI operates a business of sales and distribution of industrial gases and related equipment from its headquarters in Pinellas Park, Florida.

&#160;

Additionally, we intend to acquire other gas distribution businesses in order to become a larger distributor of MagneGas2&#174;, other industrial gases and related equipment.

&#160;

The Company has a strategy of selling fuel to the military, the first responder market and major marquee customers in the electric utility and waste to energy industry. The fuel is sourced through ESSI or through local distributor relationships in various states. To that end it has received initial fuel orders from several major customers including utility companies, a transportation company, the U.S. Navy, the Fire Department of New York and several others. All of these sales have long sales cycles as initial orders have been received and filled and the Company is in various stages of the procurement process for additional penetration and recurring orders. The ramp of period for these customers can range from several weeks to several months. In addition, the Company has signed an exclusive distribution agreement with a Florida company to distribute fuel and MagneTote to the first responder market throughout the Southeastern United States.

&#160;

Equipment Sales 

&#160;

The Company is pursuing international equipment sales in strategic areas of the world through social media, industry events and a network of independent brokers. The Company also retained two experienced consultants for this market, one with substantial experience in waste-water and hazardous waste remediation and the other with international access to funding and partners through the United Nations.

&#160;

On November 11, 2015, the Company executed agreements with Green Arc Supply of Louisiana for the sale of a MagneGas2&#174; gasification system for $765,000. A deposit of $382,500 was received at the execution of the agreements with $191,500 due and payable when the system construction is 75% complete, balance due and payable upon the completion of the system construction. The Company has until August 2016 to complete the manufacture of the system.

&#160;

MagneGas2 &#174; for the Co-Combustion of Hydro-Carbon Fuels to Reduce Emissions 

&#160;

The Company has completed internal testing both in the United States and Australia of the effect of combusting MagneGas2&#174; with hydrocarbon fuel exhaust and has demonstrated reduced hydrocarbon emission and increased heat with the co-combustion of coal and other hydrocarbon fuels and MagneGas2&#174;.

&#160;

On September 13, 2014 the Company and FuturEnergy PTY, LTD of Australia signed a term sheet in order to form a Joint Venture (&#8220;JV LLC Australia&#8221;) for the purposes of pursuing the co-combustion of MagneGas2&#174; fuel with hydrocarbon fuels to reduce emissions. Under the terms of the agreement, each owner of JV LLC Australia controls 50% of the rights to all hydrocarbon fuel emission reductions through co-combustion of MagneGas2&#174; fuel including diesel, gasoline and coal.

&#160;

On March 20, 2015, the Company and FuturEnergy PTY, LTD finalized a term sheet (the &#8220;March 2015 Term Sheet&#8221;) with a confidential party from Michigan for a tri-party joint venture implemented through a Delaware limited liability company (the &#8220;JV LLC&#8221;). Each party owns one-third of the JV LLC which is engaged in the worldwide testing, development, and pursuit of the co-combustion of MagneGas2&#174; with coal and coal by-products in the electric power plant industry. The March 2015 Term Sheet was due to expire on December 31, 2015 unless the three parties agreed to extend the term. During the week of December 14, 2015, the JV LLC successfully tested the co-combustion technology internally. On December 26, 2015, the parties agreed to extend the March 2015 Term Sheet until December 31, 2016. The extension allows the parties to attain verification by an independent agency of the co-combustion technology by December 31, 2016.

&#160;

A major research center in the United States associated with a large utility company is currently conducting third party testing and validation. The accident at the Company headquarters on April 16, 2015 (please see below under the heading &#8220;Accident at Company Facility&#8221;) has delayed the supply of fuel for this testing. In late 2015 we began production again of the fuel needed for the co-combustion testing. It is now anticipated that this validation report will be received by June 30, 2016. There are, however, many variables associated with the timing of this report. In late 2015, the Company identified the specific fuel characteristics needed to optimize combustion, which is a significant development for this project.

&#160;

Research and Development 

&#160;

High Volume Processing of Oil 

&#160;

The Company has historically processed oil through the addition of water or other dilution, which limits the volume of oil processed and decreases the flame temperature. There are several customers that have requested larger volume processing of oil based waste. The Company has spent considerable effort to achieve lower dilution levels and higher volume processing and has made significant progress to date. This research resulted in an entirely new family of MagneGas2&#174; gasifiers based on the Venturi&#174; system for which MagneGas filed a definitive patent and for which a prototype system was completed in 2014. In late 2015, the Company achieved continually processing of oil at a commercial level and is now utilizing the Venturi&#174; system to produce MagneGas2&#174; fuel for the metal working market from oil liquids.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Sterilization System for Agricultural Use 

&#160;

In early 2015, the Company completed a new generation of mobile systems for use with the sterilization of manures and sewage waste. It has developed a new 50kw Venturi System which was tested at a major hog farm in Indiana. The Company has conducted multiple successful tests at the farm with increasing flow and efficiency rates. The pilot plant achieved what was expected, namely it achieved full sterilization of manures processed through the 50kw pilot system. The Company made a presentation to officials at the United States Department of Agriculture in early 2016. The officials indicated that there are grant programs available for these types of projects and the Company has retained a consultant to assist through the grant application process which is expected to be completed by June 30, 2016.

&#160; 

Manufacturing 

&#160;

Equipment 

&#160;

MagneGas2&#174; systems are assembled by us at our facility in Tarpon Springs, Florida. The proprietary components of the system are manufactured on location, while commercially available components such as generators and compressors are purchased from existing suppliers and assembled in Tarpon Springs. The Company purchased a new facility in Clearwater, Florida in September 2014 and the Company plans to relocate its headquarters to this new location in April of 2016.

&#160;

Fuel 

&#160;

MagneGas currently has the ability to produce fuel in Florida and ship the fuel to its various distributors. The fuel is compressed into standard industrial gas cylinders and delivered directly to local retail customers and distributors.

&#160;

Current MagneGas2&#174; production is from a feedstock of vegetable oil or other proprietary feedstock blends. We are currently working to enhance our ability to process and compress fuels from waste oils on a high volume basis.

&#160;

Customers 

&#160;

We distribute products through several industrial gas companies in California, Michigan, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, and Pennsylvania. In addition, we have direct retail customers in Florida and New York.

&#160;

In October of 2014 the Company purchased ESSI. ESSI is the distribution arm for MagneGas2&#174; fuel on a retail level in central Florida.

&#160;

On May 28, 2015, the Company announced that it formed a subsidiary Joint Venture &#8220;Kickin Gas Partners&#8221; to distribute MagneGas2&#174; fuel, welding gas and supplies into North Florida. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company will own 50% of the new Joint Venture which will establish a new location in North Florida for distribution and retail sales. The new location was established in December 2015 and is actively selling fuel and hard goods.

&#160;

International Expansion 

&#160; 

The Company is working with several potential private and public partners in Europe, Sierra Leone, Haiti, Trinidad, Mexico, South Africa, and others for various initiatives surrounding the sale of MagneGas2&#174; equipment and fuel for metal cutting and cooking alternatives. Several grant applications have been submitted to support these relationships and fuel demonstrations have been completed. The Company is in various stages of negotiation with potential partners from these regions.

&#160;

Navy 

&#160; 

The U. S. Navy has been working with us to explore both the use of MagneGas2&#174; for metal working and the use of the Plasma Arc Flow&#174; System for liquid waste processing. The National Center for Manufacturing Sciences, a testing contractor for the U. S. Navy, completed testing of MagneGas&#174; as an environmentally-friendly alternative for major metal cutting projects, particularly to reduce emissions during the breakup and recycling of retiring vessels. The final written report compared seven methods and gases for metal cutting to find the lowest opacity and showed MagneGas&#174; as one of the only two methods with positive results. An independent laboratory tested MagneGas2&#174; vs acetylene on 2 inch plate and found that it cut 38% faster and consumed 30% less oxygen. A test conducted at a Naval facility concluded that MagneGas2&#174; cut 100% faster than acetylene. The Company announced on May 15, 2015 that the Navy placed their first order of MagneGas2&#174; fuel. The Company is working through the procurement process with the Navy to place additional recurring orders. This procurement process can be lengthy and the Company does not know the timing of this process.

Facilities 

&#160;

We presently lease 5,000 square feet for our principal offices at 150 Rainville Road, Tarpon Springs, FL 34689 on a month-to-month basis. The Company owns property at 1440 Rainville Road for expansion and further manufacturing capability. The Company purchased a new facility in Clearwater, Florida in September 2014 and the Company plans to relocate its headquarters to this new location in April of 2016.

&#160; 

Intellectual Property 

&#160;

The Plasma Arc Flow&#174; refinery forces a high volume flow of liquid waste through an electric arc between carbon electrodes. The benefit of this from a competitive perspective is that it sterilizes the bio-contaminants within the waste without the need to add any chemical disinfecting agents. In addition, while sterilizing the liquid, a clean burning fuel is produced. In addition to the patents list below, the Company has several patents pending.

&#160;

MagneGas Corporation has patent ownership on the technology in the United States and is exploring filing patents under the Patent Cooperation Treaty in other areas of the world as needed. MagneGas Corporation has a 20% ownership interest in MagneGas entities that control the intellectual property in Europe, Africa and China. MagneGas Corporation owns the following U. S. patents:

Accident at Company Facility 

&#160;

On April 16, 2015, there was an accident at the Company&#8217;s facilities which occurred during the gas filling process. As a result of the accident, one employee was killed and one was injured but has recovered and has returned to work. Although the Company has Workers Compensation Insurance and General Liability Insurance, the financial impact of the accident is unknown at this time. No customers have terminated their relationship with the Company as a result of the accident. On October 14, 2015 the Company received their final report from the Occupational and Safety Hazard Administration (&#8220;OSHA&#8221;) related to the accident at the Company headquarters on April 16, 2015. The OSHA report included findings, many of which were already resolved and a proposed citation. The Company was not cited for any willful misconduct and no final determination was made as to the cause of the accident. The Company received citations related to various operational with a total fine of $52,000. The Company has also been informed by the U.S. Department of Transportation that it has closed its preliminary investigation with no findings or citations to the Company. The U.S. Department of Transportation has the right to re-open the investigation should new information become available.

&#160;

The Company is still investigating the cause of the accident and there have been no conclusive findings as of this time. It is unknown whether the final cause of the accident will be determined and whether those findings will negatively impact Company operations or sales. The Company continues to be fully operational and transparent with all regulatory agencies.

&#160;
