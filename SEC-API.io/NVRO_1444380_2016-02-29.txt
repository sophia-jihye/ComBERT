 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

Overview 

We are a medical device company that has developed and commercialized an innovative neuromodulation platform for the treatment of chronic pain. Our Senza system is the only spinal cord stimulation, or SCS, system that delivers our proprietary HF10 therapy. Our SENZA-RCT U.S. pivotal study, a non-inferiority study, met its primary and secondary endpoints, and our statistical analysis demonstrates the superiority of HF10 therapy over traditional SCS therapies for treating both leg and back pain. While SCS devices are indicated and reimbursed for treating back and leg pain, traditional SCS therapy has limited efficacy in treating back pain and is used primarily for treating leg pain, limiting its market adoption. In our pivotal study, HF10 therapy was demonstrated to provide significant and sustained back pain relief in addition to leg pain relief. Additionally, HF10 therapy was demonstrated to provide pain relief without paresthesia, a constant tingling sensation that is the basis of traditional SCS therapy. HF10 therapy is also designed to reduce variability in the operating procedure, providing meaningful benefits to both patients and physicians. We believe we are positioned to transform and grow the approximately $1.7 billion existing global SCS market under current reimbursement by treating back pain in addition to leg pain and by eliminating paresthesia. 

In June 2014, we submitted our premarket approval, or PMA, application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for our Senza SCS system, or Senza. In May 2015, the FDA approved our PMA to market Senza in the United States. Senza is indicated for the treatment of chronic intractable pain of the trunk and/or limbs, is reimbursed under existing SCS codes, and has been commercially available in certain European markets since November 2010 and in Australia since August 2011. 

In the second quarter of 2015, we recorded our first commercial sales of Senza in the United States. During 2015, sales in the United States increased from $53,000 in the second quarter to $4.5 million in the third quarter and $19.8 million in the fourth quarter. Revenue from international sales was $9.7 million, $11.3 million, $10.9 million and $13.3 million for the first, second, third and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2015, respectively. Our total revenue was $9.7 million, $11.4 million, $15.4 million and $33.1 million for the first, second, third and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2015, respectively. Total combined revenue from U.S. and international sales was $23.5 million, $32.6 million and $69.6 million for fiscal years 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively. Due to market penetration in Europe and Australia, we expect that our future revenue growth, if any, will be largely from sales in the U.S. market. 

We completed our SENZA-RCT pivotal study in March 2014, which was the first prospective randomized controlled pivotal study in the history of SCS and the first to directly demonstrate comparative effectiveness between SCS therapies. The SENZA-RCT study was designed as a non-inferiority trial comparing HF10 therapy to traditional commercially available SCS therapy and met its primary and secondary endpoints. Statistical analyses also demonstrate the superiority of HF10 therapy to traditional SCS therapy for all primary and secondary endpoints. 

Key highlights of our SENZA-RCT pivotal study are as follows: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; The SENZA-RCT study results demonstrated the superiority of HF10 therapy to traditional SCS therapy on all primary and secondary endpoints. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; HF10 therapy was nearly twice as successful in treating back pain as traditional SCS therapy, with 84.3% of patients receiving HF10 therapy, as compared to 43.8% of patients receiving traditional SCS therapy, reporting 50% or more pain relief at three months, results that were superior. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; HF10 therapy was 1.5 times as successful in treating leg pain as traditional SCS therapy, with 83.1% of patients receiving HF10 therapy, as compared to 55.5% of patients receiving traditional SCS therapy, reporting 50% or more pain relief at three months, results that were superior. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; HF10 therapy provided a 69.2% reduction in back pain as measured by the Visual Analog Scale, or VAS, versus 44.2% for traditional SCS therapy, at three months, results that were superior. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; HF10 therapy provided a 72.8% reduction in leg pain as measured by VAS, versus 51.5% for traditional SCS therapy, at three months, results that were superior. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Superiority of HF10 therapy to traditional SCS therapy demonstrated for both back and leg pain at each designated study endpoint throughout 12 months. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Patients receiving HF10 therapy did not report paresthesia or uncomfortable stimulation at three months. In comparison, 46.5% of patients receiving traditional SCS therapy reported uncomfortable stimulation at three months. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Two-thirds of HF10 therapy patients had a VAS pain score of less than or equal to 2.5 on a scale of 0 to 10 for back pain at three months (which we define as achieving remitter status), twice the number of traditional SCS therapy patients, results that were statistically superior. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Three-fourths of HF10 therapy patients had a VAS pain score of less than or equal to 2.5 on a scale of 0 to 10 for leg pain at three months, twice the number of traditional SCS therapy patients, results that were statistically superior. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Safety outcomes were consistent across the control and test groups. The outcomes for HF10 therapy in our pivotal study were published in Anesthesiology and are consistent with the outcomes from our European clinical study, the two year results of which have been published in the Pain Medicine journal of the American Academy of Pain Medicine. The 24-month SENZA-RCT results were presented in December 2015 at the annual meeting of the North American Neuromodulation Society, showing sustained superiority of HF10 therapy compared with traditional SCS in treating both back and leg pain over the 24-month follow-up period. 

Patients with chronic pain are generally classified by physicians based on the location of their pain, for example whether their worst pain is predominant back, predominant leg, mixed back and leg, upper limb, neck or other. The adoption of SCS to date has been driven primarily by the treatment of patients whose worst pain is in their legs and for whom other treatment approaches have failed. We believe that broader utilization of traditional SCS therapy has been restrained by the lack of prospective randomized clinical evidence supporting SCS broadly and, in particular, demonstrating an ability to treat back pain. 

Traditional SCS therapy utilizes low frequency stimulation, typically between 40 Hz and 60 Hz, to generate paresthesia, a constant tingling sensation that overlaps the pain area. Paresthesia is often considered unpleasant or uncomfortable, sometimes causes a shocking or jolting sensation with changes in posture and is a continuous reminder of the patient&#146;s chronic condition. Compared to traditional SCS therapy, HF10 therapy delivers spinal cord stimulation at a lower amplitude and a higher frequency waveform of 10,000 Hz. HF10 therapy relies on consistent anatomical placement of the stimulation leads across patients, thus reducing procedure variability relative to traditional SCS therapy. Comparatively, traditional SCS therapy requires individualized lead placement by the physician during the implant procedure utilizing paresthesia mapping, an often time-consuming portion of the procedure in which the patient is awakened and queried by the physician as to whether they feel the paresthesia over the site of their pain. Paresthesia mapping is an often cumbersome and variable process, which creates variability in the implant procedure and can greatly impact a physician&#146;s schedule. In contrast, HF10 therapy is intended to relieve pain without causing paresthesia, while increasing the predictability of the procedure. We believe the ability of HF10 therapy to deliver pain relief without paresthesia provides a substantial benefit over traditional SCS therapy to patients and physicians. 

We believe our proprietary HF10 therapy has distinct advantages over traditional SCS therapy, including: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Compelling efficacy data for both leg and back pain. We believe that the results of our pivotal clinical trial provide compelling efficacy data in back and leg pain that may enable us to gain significant market share in the approximately $1.7 billion existing global SCS market, which is 

&#160;

&#160; primarily based on treating leg pain. In addition, we believe our efficacy data in back pain will allow us to expand the SCS market under current reimbursement by meeting demand from back pain patients who are largely untreated by traditional SCS therapies. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Strong global clinical evidence. We believe the strength of our clinical evidence base supporting HF10 therapy differentiates it from traditional SCS therapies and we expect it to drive adoption among patients, providers and payors through increased referrals and utilization. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Paresthesia free pain relief for patients. HF10 therapy does not induce or require paresthesia to provide pain relief. By delivering pain relief without paresthesia, HF10 therapy removes a major barrier for many patients who would otherwise benefit from SCS. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Anatomical lead placement for physicians. Since HF10 therapy relies on anatomical lead placement, it removes the cumbersome process of paresthesia mapping that is required by traditional SCS therapy, reducing variability in the operating procedure and offering a significant benefit to both physicians and hospitals by reducing variability of procedures. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Ability to treat a broader group of chronic pain patients. We are currently investigating the use of HF10 therapy to treat pre-spinal surgery patients, chronic intractable neck and upper extremity pain and refractory chronic migraine. We believe we have built competitive advantages through our proprietary technology, clinical evidence base, strong track record of execution including over 6,000 patients implanted with Senza, and proven management team with a substantial amount of neuromodulation experience. With what we believe are compelling efficacy data for both leg and back pain compared to traditional SCS therapy, we aim to continue to drive adoption in the U.S. market, which represents the largest opportunity in SCS, and expand patient access to HF10 therapy by investing in the development of Senza for new indications. 

Market Overview 

Chronic Pain 

Chronic pain has been defined by the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) as pain that lasts longer than the time required for tissues to heal, which is often defined to be three months. According to a report by the Institute of Medicine, chronic pain is widespread and has seen an increase in prevalence due to aging populations, progress in saving lives after suffering catastrophic injuries, increases in failed surgeries, and greater public understanding of pain. About 1.5 billion people suffer from chronic pain worldwide, including approximately 100 million Americans, which is greater than the sum of patients with heart disease, diabetes and cancer combined. Approximately 10% of chronic pain sufferers have severe disabling pain, which significantly affects their daily activities and quality of life, and is often linked to suicide. 

The back is the most common location of chronic pain, with an estimated 84 million patients in the United States experiencing chronic back pain. Among U.S. adults reporting pain, low back pain was the highest reported location at 28%, followed by knee pain at 20% and severe headache/migraine at 16%. In a study conducted by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and published in 2009, the prevalence of low back pain more than doubled from 1992 to 2006. According to data from users of the Department of Veterans Affairs health system, the annualized increase in prevalence of low back pain is larger than increases in the three other conditions studied, which were depression, diabetes and hypertension. In terms of impact, the annual cost of back pain in the United States is estimated to be $34 billion for treatment, with another $100 billion in lost productivity. 

Existing Treatments for Chronic Pain and Limitations 

Patients who present with chronic pain are typically placed on a treatment progression plan. Initial medical management typically includes behavioral modification, exercise, physical therapy, and over-the-counter analgesics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. When early stage medical management is not sufficient for 

&#160;

the treatment of chronic leg and back pain, patients may progress to interventional techniques including steroid injections or nerve blocks. Patients who do not respond to these more conservative treatments are considered candidates for more advanced therapies. 

Spine Surgery 

Spine surgery is a common invasive surgical procedure for the treatment of pain and typically precedes traditional SCS therapy. Despite the possibility of surgical complications, recent data suggests that over 500,000 spinal procedures are performed in the United States every year. Common surgeries include spinal fusion, which involves joining spinal bones to limit movement, and laminectomy, which entails removing part of the bone or ligaments in the back. These surgical procedures often fail to treat certain difficult types of chronic pain, such as severe neuropathic and intractable back pain. Failed Back Surgery Syndrome, or FBSS, is a common outcome of spine surgery where chronic back and/or leg pain continues to persist and affects an estimated 10% to 40% of patients receiving spine surgery. Given the failure rate for spine surgery, FBSS patients make up a significant portion of the addressable patient population for SCS. 

Oral Opioids 

Oral opioids are prescription pain medications that suppress the patient&#146;s acute perception of pain but lack clinical evidence supporting their long-term use to treat chronic pain including back pain. Oral opioids can significantly compromise the patient&#146;s quality of life, with patients often reporting being in a &#147;fog&#148; and commonly experiencing side effects such as nausea, vomiting, constipation and dizziness. Less common side effects can include immunologic dysfunction, hormonal dysfunction and muscle rigidity. Oral opioids are also known to present a high risk of addiction. Abuse and accidental overdoses have led to dramatic increases in deaths over the past two decades. 

Traditional Spinal Cord Stimulation 

SCS is a type of neuromodulation technology that utilizes an implantable pacemaker-like device to deliver electrical impulses to the spinal cord. Traditional SCS therapy is a long-established pain treatment designed to induce paresthesia, a tingling sensation that overlaps the distribution of pain with the intent of masking pain perception. The electrical pulses are delivered by small electrodes on leads that are placed near the spinal cord and are connected to a compact, battery-powered generator implanted under the skin. Traditional SCS therapy is currently indicated as a treatment for chronic pain of the trunk and limbs in patients who failed conventional medical management. Traditional SCS therapy is considered to be a minimally invasive, reversible therapy that may provide greater long-term benefits over more invasive surgical approaches or opioids. The most common use for traditional SCS therapy is for neuropathic pain conditions such as FBSS. 

With a primary focus on treating leg pain, the global market for traditional SCS therapy has grown from approximately $300 million in 2001 to approximately $1.4 billion in 2012, a compound annual growth rate of approximately 8%. The global SCS market was estimated to be approximately $1.7 billion in 2015 and is expected to grow to approximately $2.5 billion per year by 2018. The United States represents approximately 80% of this global market due in part to governmental reimbursement restraints in international markets. In addition, the addressable market in the United States for potential SCS candidates is estimated to be 1 million patients. We believe that due to factors such as an aging population, and an increasing number of failed back surgeries, the number of candidates for SCS will continue to grow. 

Despite the sizeable potential market, according to 2012 IMS data, only approximately 40,000 SCS systems are implanted each year in the United States, representing less than 10% of the addressable U.S. market at a cost of approximately $25,000 per procedure. IMS data from 2012 additionally shows that there are approximately 4,400 facilities in the United States where SCS systems are implanted by a variety of physicians, including neurosurgeons, physiatrists, interventional pain specialists and orthopedic spine surgeons. However, only approximately half of chronic pain patients are considered candidates for traditional SCS therapy. A key reason 

&#160;

for this may be the limited evidence supporting efficacy of traditional SCS therapy for back pain. We believe there is an additional opportunity for an SCS therapy that effectively treats back pain that is approximately the size of the existing global SCS market. 

Traditional SCS therapy generally consists of two phases, an evaluation period, also called the trial period, which typically lasts several days, and a permanent implant for those patients who experience a successful trial. The trial period involves a percutaneously placed insulated wire, called a lead, that a physician implants near the spinal cord using a needle. During the trial period, a temporary external system is used by patients and physicians for evaluating whether traditional SCS therapy is effective for the patient. The patient is able to control their stimulation during the trial period by utilizing the patient remote control, which resembles a small television remote control. The remote control allows a patient to turn the therapy on and off, in addition to other functions. If the trial period is successful, a permanent system is implanted in the patient. The success criterion is typically at least 50% reduction in pain during the evaluation period. 

A key part of the permanent system is the implantable pulse generator, or IPG, which is a miniaturized version of the external stimulator. The implant procedure involves connecting the leads to the IPG that is implanted under the skin. The IPG should provide the patient with multiple years of use and can be either rechargeable or non-rechargeable. Primary cell IPGs, or non-rechargeable IPGs, are used in cases where the patient requires a lower level of stimulation and such systems have a limited life. Rechargeable IPGs, a more recent innovation, are more expensive but allow for higher levels of stimulation and can last 10 years or more. Due to payor constraints in certain European countries, the transition from primary cell IPGs to rechargeable IPGs has been slow. In the United States and Australia, most IPGs implanted are rechargeable. 

Traditional SCS products have required paresthesia to provide pain relief, and have focused on ancillary features with incremental benefits. Paresthesia coverage has been used as a surrogate metric for successful pain relief. As such, innovation in the SCS market has historically focused on technologies that optimize traditional SCS therapy&#146;s ability to create more precise paresthesia fields or different changes that include smaller IPGs and improved compatibility with magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI. Even with successful paresthesia coverage, patients still may not receive pain relief or often lose pain relief after a period of time. 

Limitations of Traditional SCS Therapy 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Limited clinical evidence: To date, we believe there are only two published prospective randomized SCS studies that provide long-term (at least 12 months) data, both of which focused on leg pain. Neither of these studies was done to support initial regulatory approval of an SCS system. We believe this limited clinical evidence has inhibited market adoption of traditional SCS therapy. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Lack of evidence supporting efficacy in back pain: We believe predominant back pain is more difficult to treat with traditional SCS therapy than leg pain due to the reduced ability to achieve and maintain pain coverage in the back. We are not aware of a prospective, randomized clinical trial supporting the efficacy of traditional SCS therapy in treating back pain. The Kumar study is a widely cited study on SCS and focused on patients with predominant leg pain. The study demonstrated a reduction in leg pain over the 24 month study period, while reductions in back pain at six, 12, and 24 month follow-up were not significant when compared to baseline. The average back pain reduction was 13% at 24 months. As a result, back pain patients are usually not recommended for treatment with traditional SCS therapy. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Paresthesia: Traditional SCS therapy relies on paresthesia to mask pain with a constant tingling sensation. Paresthesia is often considered unpleasant or uncomfortable, sometimes made worse by a shocking or jolting sensation with changes in posture. Unpleasant sensations can be caused by lead movement closer to the spinal cord or away from it as the patient moves, resulting in variation in paresthesia intensity. Paresthesia is also a constant reminder of the patient&#146;s chronic condition. Due to the distraction of paresthesia, patients with traditional SCS devices are instructed not to drive or operate machinery when the device is activated. Medtronic, the current leader in neuromodulation, has released a survey showing that 71% of patients find paresthesia uncomfortable at times. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Paresthesia mapping: A crucial part of the traditional SCS procedure is called paresthesia mapping. This mapping process requires a patient to be sedated for the lead placement, then awakened and repeatedly questioned in order for the physician to assess paresthesia coverage over the patient&#146;s area of pain and reposition and reprogram the leads to redirect the paresthesia. This process creates variability in the procedure and a complicated anesthesia management process, impacting the physician&#146;s schedule and patient comfort. The primary objective of traditional SCS therapy is to create a stimulation program that covers the areas of pain without creating paresthesia beyond the pain areas, given that this can be uncomfortable and difficult to tolerate. In the operating room, the surgical procedure is as follows: 1. The patient is sedated and leads are inserted into the epidural space along the spine with the guidance of fluoroscopy; 

2. Sedation is reduced and the patient is awakened; 

3. The patient is queried by the physician and verbal feedback is gathered on paresthesia distribution over the pain site. This process can complicate anesthesia management as patients need to be sedated enough to tolerate the manipulation of the leads in the epidural space, but kept conscious enough to be able to interact with the physician to respond to questions about their sensations of pain and paresthesia. Patients are often groggy from the anesthesia and can have difficulty accurately confirming the overlap of the paresthesia with their pain. 

4. The leads are repositioned or reprogrammed to redirect paresthesia. This is often a cumbersome and variable process as steps 3 and 4 are repeated as required. Multiple iterations are often required, impacting operating room scheduling efficiency. 

Our Solution for Chronic Pain 

HF10 Therapy 

Our HF10 therapy is designed to deliver innovative neuromodulation solutions for treating chronic pain based on what we believe to be the best clinical evidence available, which we refer to as evidence-based. By overcoming many of the limitations of traditional SCS therapy, HF10 therapy offers benefits to patients, physicians and hospitals. We believe the advantages of our proprietary HF10 therapy over traditional SCS include: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Compelling efficacy data for both leg and back pain: In our SENZA-RCT pivotal study, HF10 therapy was demonstrated to provide significant and sustained back pain relief in addition to leg pain relief. HF10 therapy was shown to be nearly twice as successful in treating back pain and 1.5 times as successful in treating leg pain relative to traditional SCS therapy. We believe that the results of our pivotal clinical trial provide compelling efficacy data in leg and back pain that may enable us to gain significant market share in the approximately $1.7 billion existing global SCS market, which is primarily based on treating leg pain. In addition, we believe our efficacy data in back pain will allow us to expand the SCS market under current reimbursement by meeting demand from back pain patients who are largely untreated by traditional SCS therapies. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Strong global clinical evidence: We believe the strength of our clinical evidence base supporting HF10 therapy differentiates it from traditional SCS therapies and we expect it to drive adoption among patients, providers and payors through increased referrals and utilization. Our SENZA-RCT pivotal study included 198 patients across 11 U.S. clinical trial sites and was the first randomized controlled prospective pivotal study in SCS. We believe the results of the SENZA-RCT study, which met all its primary and secondary endpoints, are consistent with and confirmatory of the results from our European Long Term Clinical Study that included 83 patients. Both of these studies follow patients through 24 months. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Paresthesia free pain relief for patients: HF10 therapy does not induce or require paresthesia to provide pain relief. By delivering pain relief without paresthesia, HF10 therapy removes a major 

&#160;

&#160; barrier for many patients who would otherwise benefit from SCS therapy. HF10 therapy offers the notable benefit to patients of achieving significant and sustained pain relief without requiring them to endure the uncomfortable shocking or jolting sensations commonly associated with paresthesia. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Anatomical lead placement for physicians. Since HF10 therapy relies on anatomical lead placement, it removes the cumbersome process of paresthesia mapping that is required by traditional SCS therapy, reducing variability in the operating procedure and offering a significant benefit to both physicians and hospitals by reducing variability of procedures. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Ability to treat a broader group of chronic pain patients: Our HF10 therapy is a platform technology that we believe can provide treatment benefits for a broader group of chronic pain indications. We are currently investigating the use of HF10 therapy to treat pre-spinal surgery patients, chronic intractable neck and upper extremity pain and refractory chronic migraine. Based on analysis from our SENZA-RCT and European studies, we believe HF10 therapy may be an attractive treatment option for some pre-spinal surgery patients without mechanical instability due to its cost, reversibility and initial trial period. Due to the removal of paresthesia, HF10 therapy may overcome the intense discomfort that traditional SCS generates for patients with neck pain when leads are placed in the cervical spine. For chronic migraine patients, HF10 therapy&#146;s ability to treat without paresthesia enables cervical lead placement, rather than occipital nerve stimulation which requires lead insertion at the base of the skull under traditional SCS therapy. Our Growth Strategy 

Our mission is to be the neuromodulation leader in the treatment of chronic pain by developing innovative, evidence-based solutions. To accomplish this objective we intend to: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Communicate what we believe is the compelling clinical efficacy of HF10 therapy to patients, physicians and payors globally: Given our clinical evidence, we believe we will be able to position our therapy with patients, providers and payors in a differentiated way. Based on clinical data from the SENZA-RCT, the FDA approved HF10 therapy with superiority labeling relative to traditional SCS for the treatment of both back pain and leg pain. To date, we believe there have been only two other randomized, controlled SCS clinical studies comparing pain treatments with long-term follow-up that have been peer reviewed and published. However, these studies only focused on leg pain. Given that our pivotal study has demonstrated superiority for both back and leg pain in a head-to-head comparison with traditional SCS, we anticipate being able to differentiate HF10 therapy by communicating its clinical benefits and advantages to patients, physicians and payors. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Drive adoption of HF10 therapy through a world-class sales and marketing organization: We will continue to build our worldwide sales organization consisting of direct sales representatives and a network of distributors and sales agents. We are continuing to make significant investments in building our U.S. commercial infrastructure and sales force and in recruiting and training our sales representatives for U.S. expansion. This is a lengthy process that requires recruiting appropriate sales representatives, growing a commercial infrastructure in the United States and training our sales representatives, and will continue to require significant investment by us. Following initial training for Senza, our sales representatives typically require lead time in the field to grow their network of accounts and produce sales results. Successfully recruiting and training a sufficient number of productive sales representatives is required to achieve growth at the rate we expect. As of December 31, 2015, we have 100 hired and trained sales representatives in the field in the United States. Our sales representatives target physician specialties involved in SCS treatment decisions, including neurosurgeons, physiatrists, interventional pain specialists and orthopedic spine surgeons. We expect that our direct sales force will target the approximately 2,400 hospitals and outpatient surgery centers, at which we believe an estimated 90% of SCS procedures in the United States are performed. Our marketing and reimbursement teams intend to drive HF10 therapy adoption through creating awareness and demand among additional stakeholders involved in the SCS treatment decision, including third-party payors, hospital administrators and patients and their families. We do not believe 

&#160;

&#160; that any changes will be required to existing patient referral flows or existing coverage and reimbursement policies in order to facilitate adoption in the approximately $1.4 billion existing U.S. SCS market. Internationally, we plan to increase coverage of our target markets by expanding our existing direct sales force or our network of distributors and sales agents. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Expand the existing SCS market by treating back pain: We believe we are expanding the existing SCS market by delivering a system that provides meaningful treatment for the chronic back pain patient population. We believe the incremental opportunity for an SCS therapy that effectively treats back pain is significant when compared to the size of the existing global SCS market. With traditional SCS therapy, patients who experience predominant back pain are associated with lower levels of treatment success. Consequently, predominant back pain patients are typically not recommended for treatment with traditional SCS therapy due to the difficulty of achieving and maintaining pain coverage. We believe HF10 therapy is positioned to expand the existing SCS market by effectively treating back pain in addition to leg pain. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Develop HF10 therapy for use in other chronic pain indications: We plan to use our platform technology to develop HF10 therapy for use in other chronic pain indications with significant unmet medical need, including chronic intractable neck and upper extremity pain, refractory chronic migraine and pre-spinal surgery patients. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in developing HF10 therapy for use in other chronic pain indications or in receiving required regulatory approvals to market Senza and HF10 therapy for use in other chronic pain indications. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Invest in research and development to drive innovation: We are extending our novel and proprietary technologies into a series of product enhancements with the goal of improving the treatment of chronic pain. Product enhancements in development include a next-generation IPG, full body MRI compatibility and paddle leads. We believe these innovative enhancements will drive continued adoption of our technology platform and further validate the advantages and benefits of our HF10 therapy. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Scale our business to achieve cost and production efficiencies: We plan to improve the efficiency of our third-party manufacturing process, which we believe will lower our per unit manufacturing cost. We expect to continue to scale our manufacturing operations as we expand Senza sales volumes in the United States. Our Senza System 

Senza is designed to create electrical impulses from 2 Hz to 10 kHz, including our proprietary HF10 therapy, which allows for pain relief without paresthesia. HF10 therapy delivers proprietary waveforms at 10 kHz pulse rate with a statistically driven and clinically verified programming algorithm. 

Senza, similar to other commercially available SCS systems, consists of leads, a trial stimulator, an implantable pulse generator, or IPG, surgical tools, a clinician laptop programmer, a patient remote control, and a mobile charger. These components enable physicians to implant the leads and the IPG, and patients to operate the system. 

&#160;

&#160;

Leads: The leads are thin, insulated medical wires that conduct electrical pulses from the IPG to near the spinal cord. Senza uses percutaneous leads, which can be inserted to the epidural space minimally invasively through a needle. The leads are cylindrical, flexible and steerable, and are offered in different lengths. 

Trial Stimulator: The trial stimulator contains electronics that deliver electrical pulses to the lead. It is an external device that is worn around the waist during the evaluation period that typically lasts several days. It is powered by batteries. 

Implantable Pulse Generator (IPG): The IPG contains a rechargeable battery and electronics that deliver electrical pulses to the lead. It has 16 output channels and can connect to one or two leads. It is a programmable device and can deliver customized programs for each patient. The IPG is rechargeable and is placed surgically under the skin, usually above the buttock or the abdomen. The Senza SCS system is CE Marked and FDA-approved with labeling for &#147;at least 10 year battery life&#148;. 

Surgical Tools: Surgical tools include percutaneous insertion needles that are used to introduce the lead into the epidural space, a variety of stylets that give physicians the ability to steer and deliver the lead to the desired location, anchors to secure the leads, and tunneling tools that provide access from the lead insertion site to the location of the IPG. 

Programmer: The clinician laptop programmer contains proprietary software that allows customized programming of the IPG. It can non-invasively interrogate the IPG and transmit programming information and download diagnostic information. 

Patient Remote Control: The patient remote control is a handheld device that allows patients to turn their stimulation on and off and change programs. 

Charger: The charger recharges the IPG from outside the body. To charge, the charging coil of the charger is placed over the location of the IPG and then initiated by pushing a button on the charger. The charger is mobile and can be worn around the waist using a belt when charging is needed, so that the patient can perform various tasks while charging. Charging sessions are usually performed daily and are expected to average approximately 45 minutes a day. 

Growth Opportunities 

Senza is a platform technology. We believe that our platform will have applications in other pain indications, and we are actively investigating some of these opportunities. 

Refractory Non-Surgical Chronic Low Back Pain (Pre-Spinal Surgery) 

One of the most common uses for SCS is for neuropathic pain conditions such as FBSS. The incidence of patients that will develop FBSS following lumbar spinal surgery is estimated to be within the range of 10% to 40%. With the increasing number of spinal surgeries in the United States, FBSS is also increasing. While there is a clear need for spinal surgery in many patients, given the high rate of FBSS there is a potential for SCS to move up the treatment progression ahead of spinal surgery for some patients without mechanical instability. HF10 therapy could provide an attractive treatment option for these patients due to its cost, reversibility and initial trial period. In subset analysis of pre-spinal surgery patients from our SENZA-RCT and European studies, respectively, we found a decrease in back pain VAS scores from 7.2 to 2.5 (12 months, n=11) and 8.1 to 3.4 (24 months, n=14), respectively, as well as a decrease in leg pain VAS scores from 7.1 to 2.3 (12 months, n=11) and 5.9 to 2.8 (24 months, n=14) respectively. 

&#160;

Chronic Intractable Neck and Upper Extremity Pain 

Chronic neck pain with or without upper extremity pain is prevalent in 48% of women and 38% of men in the general adult population, with persistent complaints in 22% of women and 16% of men. Multiple treatments currently exist in the market today, such as epidural injections, but there is a lack of clinically efficacious treatments. In addition, there has been a very small body of evidence published on the application of SCS in chronic neck pain and upper extremity pain by placing the leads in the cervical spine. The evidence has suggested promising therapeutic response when traditional SCS therapy is used, but the paresthesia in the cervical spine associated with traditional SCS therapy can create intolerable discomfort, limiting its viability. We believe Senza can overcome this barrier due to its ability to deliver pain relief without paresthesia. We have an ongoing feasibility study in this indication. 

Refractory Chronic Migraine 

Chronic migraine is a widespread and debilitating disorder affecting 2% of the general population. Chronic migraine patients have greater than 15 headache-days per four week period lasting more than 3 months. Conventional treatments often include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, triptans, ergots, acetaminophens, opioids and botox as well as other therapies. Despite all of these pharmacologics, many patients do not respond to these therapies. Recognizing the opportunity and the potential for HF10 therapy to address this unmet need, we have begun to investigate this indication through feasibility studies. The benefit of HF10 therapy in this indication as opposed to traditional SCS therapy in chronic migraine is the treatment of patients without paresthesia through cervical lead placement, rather than occipital nerve stimulation which requires lead insertion at the base of the skull. 

Clinical Data 

To support development of our proprietary HF10 therapy, the technology was evaluated in preclinical studies and further studied in prospective clinical trials, all of which have now been published or are pending publication in peer-reviewed journals. The results from the clinical studies have been consistent across studies and across outcome measures. The following table summarizes key outcomes for implanted subjects in our prospective multicenter European clinical study (EU) and our prospective, comparative, randomized, controlled U.S. pivotal study, called SENZA-RCT (RCT), which was used to support approval of our PMA for Senza.

U.S. Pivotal Clinical Study (SENZA-RCT) 

Our pivotal study was a prospective, randomized, multi-center study, conducted across 11 U.S. clinical trial sites, comparing the safety and effectiveness of Senza delivering HF10 therapy, which we refer to as the test to Boston Scientific&#146;s FDA-approved Precision Plus system, delivering traditional SCS therapy, which we refer to as the control. Each included patient was required to have a leg and back pain VAS score of at least 5. Among the 198 chronic pain patients who were randomized for treatments, 171 had a successful therapy evaluation phase, or trial phase, and were implanted with an SCS system. The study was designed as a non-inferiority trial and met its primary and secondary endpoints. Statistical analysis also demonstrates the superior efficacy of HF10 therapy over traditional SCS therapy for all primary and secondary endpoints. 

Safety Results 

Safety results were consistent between the test and control groups. Study-related serious adverse events, or SAEs, occurred in 4.0% of HF10 therapy subjects (n=4) compared with 7.2% of traditional SCS therapy subjects (n=7; p = 0.37). In addition to the SAEs described above, there were two deaths, one of which was study-related and resulted from a myocardial infarction of a subject randomized to traditional SCS therapy that occurred during the implant procedure. The other death occurred outside the study period in the test group and resulted from a malignant hepatic neoplasm. The most common study-related AEs were implant site pain (in 11.9% of HF10 therapy and 10.3% of traditional SCS therapy subjects) and uncomfortable paresthesia (in 11.3% of traditional SCS therapy participants). Lead migration leading to revision occurred in 3.0% of HF10 therapy and 5.2% of traditional SCS therapy participants. Importantly, neurological assessment revealed no stimulation-related neurological deficits in either treatment group. Also, there were no stimulation-related SAEs in either arm. 

European Long-Term Clinical Study 

The two-year follow up of the European long-term clinical study was completed in 2013. The open label, prospective study was conducted at two sites in Belgium and the United Kingdom. 82 chronic pain patients completed the therapy evaluation phase, or trial phase, for HF10 therapy and 72 were permanently implanted as a result of successful evaluation phase. 65 of these patients were followed to two years. 

Among the patients who went through the evaluation phase, 87% enrolled had predominant back pain, 17% had failed traditional SCS therapy previously, and 19% of the patients did not have prior back surgery. These are difficult-to-treat patients that have been excluded from traditional SCS therapy studies in the past. 

Key safety results: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; No evidence of neurologic deficit or dysfunction attributable to prolonged delivery of HF10 therapy was observed. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Investigators reported that adverse events were similar in nature and frequency to those seen with traditional SCS therapy. The most common adverse events were implant site pain, infection and lead migration. Key efficacy results: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Average back pain VAS was reduced from 8.4 at baseline to 2.8 at 12 months to 3.3 at 24 months. Average leg pain was reduced from 5.4 VAS pain level at baseline to 2.0 at 12 months to 2.3 at 24 months. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; For responder rates, 60% of the implanted patients had at least 50% back pain relief and 71% had at least 50% leg pain relief. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Disability as measured by Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) improved by an average of 15 points at 24 months, a clinically and statistically significant improvement. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Opioid intake decreased, with 86% of patients taking some form of opioid at baseline, and to 57% at 24 months. The mean dosage of oral morphine equivalents per patient decreased from 84 milligrams per day, or mg/day, at baseline to 27 mg/day at 24 months. Other results: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; HF10 therapy did not produce paresthesia. Third-Party Coverage and Reimbursement 

In the United States, the primary purchasers of Senza are hospitals and outpatient surgery centers. These purchasers bill various third-party payors, such as Medicare, Medicaid and private health insurance plans for the healthcare services associated with the SCS procedure. Government agencies and private payors determine whether to provide coverage for specific procedures. We believe that SCS procedures using Senza are adequately described by existing CPT, HCPCS II, and ICD-10-CM codes for the implantation of spinal cord stimulators and related leads performed in various sites of care. Medicare reimbursement rates for the same or similar procedures vary due to geographic location, nature of facility in which the procedure is performed (i.e., hospital outpatient department or outpatient surgery centers) and other factors. In the United States, the Centers for Medicare &#38; Medicaid Services (CMS) have approved a transitional pass-through payment for High Frequency Stimulation under the Medicare hospital outpatient prospective payment system effective beginning January 1, 2016. This pass-through payment for HF10 therapy will be in addition to the established reimbursement for spinal cord stimulation devices. CMS determined that the Senza SCS System delivering HF10 therapy met the criteria for a new device category based on the published randomized control trial (RCT) evidence submitted. Although private payors&#146; coverage policies and reimbursement rates tend to vary, the Medicare program is increasingly used as a model for how private payors and other governmental payors develop their coverage and reimbursement policies for healthcare items and services, including SCS procedures. Outside the United States, reimbursement levels vary significantly by country, and by region within some countries. Reimbursement is obtained from a variety of sources, including government-sponsored and private health insurance plans, and combinations of both. Some countries will require us to gather additional clinical data before recognizing granting broader coverage and reimbursement for our products. It is our intent to complete the requisite clinical studies and obtain coverage and reimbursement approval beyond what we have today in countries where it makes economic sense to do so. 

Product Development and Research Development 

Our objective is to continue to improve patient outcomes and further expand patient access to HF10 therapy through enhancements to Senza and the development of new indications. Research and development expenses were $20.3 million, $19.8 million and $21.4 million, for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively. 

Since the launch of the initial Senza system, we have introduced a number of product enhancements. These include a short-tip version of the lead, new lengths of the lead, an active anchor with improved performance over silicon anchors, a second generation active anchor with smaller volume, lead adaptors that allow use of competitor leads already implanted in patients, second generation clinician programmer software, a second generation IPG with improved shape and compatibility for scans of the head and extremities with both 1.5 and 3 Tesla (T) MRI machines. We also expect to continue developing enhancements to Senza to further increase performance and introduce new benefits including next generation IPGs, paddle leads and full body MRI compatibility. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in these efforts or in receiving any required regulatory approvals. 

&#160;

Sales and Marketing 

United States 

We continue to hire and train a direct sales organization in the United States. As of December 31, 2015, we have 100 hired and trained sales representatives in the field in the U.S. Our sales representatives target physician specialties involved in SCS treatment decisions, including neurosurgeons, physiatrists, interventional pain specialists and orthopedic spine surgeons. We plan to ultimately target approximately 2,400 hospitals and outpatient surgery centers at which we believe an estimated 90% of SCS procedures are performed in the United States. In addition, our commercial team plans to continue to create awareness and demand for Senza among additional stakeholders involved in the SCS treatment decision, including third-party payors, hospitals administrators and SCS patients and their families. We have also developed a product support team in order to provide ongoing support to physicians for the use of Senza. 

International 

We sell Senza in Europe and Australia through a combination of our direct sales force and a network of sales agents and independent distributors. We began our direct sales operations in the United Kingdom in 2010 and to date have expanded our direct sales operations to Austria, Australia, Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland. We utilize sales agents and independent distributors to sell in an additional seven countries. 

Competition 

We compete in the SCS market for chronic pain. We also compete with spine surgeries, in particular re-surgeries. Currently, our major competitors are Medtronic, Boston Scientific and St. Jude Medical, who have obtained regulatory approval for SCS systems. We believe that the primary competitive factors in the market are: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Sales force experience and access &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Published clinical efficacy data &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Product support and service &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Effective marketing and education &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Company brand recognition &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Clinical research leadership &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Technological innovation, product enhancements and speed of innovation &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Pricing and reimbursement &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Product reliability, safety and durability &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Ease of use Many of our competitors have greater capital resources, more established operations, longer commercial histories and more extensive relationships with physicians. They also have wider product offerings within neuromodulation and in other product categories, providing them with greater supplier power and with more opportunities to interact with stakeholders involved in purchasing decisions. We also face competition to recruit and retain qualified sales and other personnel. 

We expect our competitors to launch new products and release additional clinical evidence within the next few years. For example, St. Jude Medical is currently working to gain FDA approval for a SCS system that offers an alternate waveform, and in February 2016, the company gained approval for a neuromodulation system that stimulates the dorsal root ganglion for treatment of focal pain and complex regional pain syndrome, or CRPS. 

&#160;

St. Jude Medical has run pivotal studies for each therapy as part of the FDA approval process. Medtronic is performing studies to collect data on existing SCS products for back pain. Additionally, Boston Scientific has commenced a randomized clinical trial of a high-frequency SCS therapy. Boston Scientific is also expected to introduce incremental product enhancements such as a reduction in the size of their IPG, new accessories and improved MRI compatibility labeling. Additionally, there are a number of emerging competitors that have recently received FDA approval. Stimwave has developed and is starting to commercialize a minimally invasive stimulation system that employs an externally worn power source and radio frequency transmitter. Nuvectra is a proposed spinoff company from Greatbatch, an original equipment manufacturer of SCS systems that many large SCS companies, as well as Nevro, use for manufacturing. In November 2015, Nuvectra received FDA approval for its SCS system, which is similar to many of the other traditional SCS systems currently on the market. 

Intellectual Property 

We actively seek to protect the intellectual property and proprietary technology that we believe is important to our business, which includes seeking and maintaining patents covering our technology and products, proprietary processes and any other inventions that are commercially or strategically important to the development of our business. We also rely upon trademarks to build and maintain the integrity of our brand, and we seek to protect the confidentiality of trade secrets that may be important to the development of our business. For more information, please see &#147;Risk factors&#151;Risks Related to Intellectual Property.&#148; 

Patents, Trademarks and Proprietary Technology 

As of December 31, 2015, we owned 87 issued patents globally, of which 57 were issued U.S. patents, 17 were issued Australian patents, 7 were issued European patents, two were German Utility Models, two were Japanese patents, one was an issued Chinese utility patent and one was an issued Chinese design patent. In general, our patents cover SCS systems that are configured to generate non-paresthesia producing therapy signals at frequencies between 1,500 Hz to 100,000 Hz, as well as additional aspects, algorithms and components of the Senza system and HF10 therapy. As of December 31, 2015, we held 101 patent applications pending globally, of which 54 were patent applications pending in the United States, and 47 were patent applications pending across Europe, Australia, Canada, Japan, China, and Korea. We also have an exclusive license from the Mayo Foundation to two U.S. issued patents and two U.S. pending patent applications. All of our current issued patents are projected to expire between 2028 and 2032. 

As of December 31, 2015, our trademark portfolio contained 15 trademark registrations, of which there were 4 U.S. trademark registrations, 4 Australian trademark registrations, 4 European trademark registrations, 2 Japanese trademark registrations and one Swiss trademark registration. Our trademark portfolio also contained 6 pending U.S. trademark applications and 5 pending foreign trademark applications. 

The term of individual patents depends on the legal term for patents in the countries in which they are granted. In most countries, including the United States, the patent term is generally 20 years from the earliest claimed filing date of a non-provisional patent application in the applicable country. We cannot assure that patents will be issued from any of our pending applications or that, if patents are issued, they will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection for our technology. Notwithstanding the scope of the patent protection available to us, a competitor could develop treatment methods or devices that are not covered by our patents. Furthermore, numerous U.S. and foreign issued patents and patent applications owned by third parties exist in the fields in which we are developing products. Because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be applications unknown to us, which applications may later result in issued patents that our existing or future products or proprietary technologies may be alleged to infringe. 

There has been substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical device industry. In the future, we may need to engage in litigation to enforce patents issued or licensed to us, to protect our trade secrets or know-how, to defend against claims of infringement of the rights of others or to 

&#160;

determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others. Litigation could be costly and could divert our attention from other functions and responsibilities. Adverse determinations in litigation could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties, could require us to seek licenses from third parties and could prevent us from manufacturing, selling or using Senza, any of which could severely harm our business. 

We also rely upon trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological innovation, and may rely upon licensing opportunities in the future, to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary rights through a variety of methods, including confidentiality agreements and proprietary information agreements with suppliers, employees, consultants and others who may have access to proprietary information, under which they are bound to assign to us inventions made during the term of their employment. 

The Mayo License 

In October 2006, we entered into a license agreement, or the Mayo License, with the Venturi Group, LLC, or VGL, and the Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research, or the Mayo Foundation, pursuant to which the Mayo Foundation committed to confer with us exclusively to develop products for the treatment of autonomic and peripheral nervous system disorders, including pain, using devices to modulate nerve signaling, and non-exclusively to test such devices, and VGL committed to confer with us non-exclusively to develop such devices, and exclusively to test such devices. These commitments to confer expired in January 2011. We were granted a worldwide license to make, use, sell, offer for sale, and import products incorporating or using the know-how developed for and provided to us by the Mayo Foundation or VGL in the course of such development and testing activities, exclusively for product development and non-exclusively for product testing. We were also granted an exclusive worldwide license under certain patents and patent applications, including any patent applications or issued patents claiming inventions that arose out of the device development and testing activities conducted on our behalf by the Mayo Foundation or VGL pursuant to the agreement, to develop, make, use, sell, offer for sale, and import products covered by the licensed patents or patent applications. As of December 31, 2015, two issued patents were covered by the Mayo License. These two patents expire in 2027 and 2028, respectively. 

Pursuant to the Mayo License, we are obligated to pay royalties in the low single digits to the Mayo Foundation, on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis, based on a percentage of net sales of licensed products, subject to reduction under certain circumstances. Our obligation to pay royalties commences upon the first commercial sale of a licensed product in a particular country and expires, on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis, in the case of products covered by a licensed patent or patent application upon the expiration of the last valid claim covering such product in such country, and in the case of any other licensed product, upon the fifth anniversary of the first commercial sale of such product in such country. We are obligated to pay Mayo a double-digit percentage of any sublicensing revenue we receive from any sublicensees during the term of the Mayo License. In addition, in connection with the consummation of our IPO in November 2014, we issued the Mayo Foundation 20,833 shares of our common stock pursuant to the terms of the Mayo License. We are also required under the Mayo License to use commercially reasonable efforts to research, develop and commercialize licensed products. 

The Mayo License terminates upon the expiration of (1) the last to expire of the licensed patents or (2) our obligation to pay royalties, whichever is later. We, the Mayo Foundation or VGL may terminate the Mayo License upon 60 days&#146; notice of a party&#146;s material breach if such breach remains uncured after such 60-day period. In the event of termination as a result of our material breach, all licenses to the licensed patents will terminate, and our licenses to the know-how provided to us by the Mayo Foundation or VGL in the course of the development and testing activities will become non-exclusive. We do not believe a termination of the Mayo License would have a material adverse impact on our ability to develop, market and sell Senza. In the event that we terminate the Mayo License for breach by either the Mayo Foundation or VGL, all licenses to licensed patents continue, our license to the licensed know-how shall become non-exclusive and our obligation to pay royalties on net sales of licensed products shall be reduced by half. The Mayo Foundation or VGL may also terminate in the event of our insolvency. 

&#160;

Manufacturing and Supply 

We rely upon third-party suppliers for the manufacture and assembly of our Senza SCS system and its components, some of which are single- or sole-sources of the relevant product component. We have not yet identified and qualified second-source replacements for several of our critical single-source suppliers. Thus, in the event that our relationship with any of our single- or sole-source suppliers terminates in the future, we may have difficulty maintaining sufficient production of our products at the standards we require. Where practicable, we are currently seeking, or intending to seek, second-source manufacturers for our single-source components. We believe that existing third-party facilities will be adequate to meet our current and anticipated manufacturing needs. We do not currently plan to manufacture the Senza SCS system components ourselves. 

We believe our manufacturing operations, and those of our suppliers, are in compliance with regulations mandated by the FDA. Manufacturing facilities that produce medical devices or their component parts intended for distribution world-wide are subject to regulation and periodic unannounced inspection by the FDA and other domestic and international regulatory agencies. In the United States, we are required to manufacture any products that we sell in compliance with the FDA&#146;s Quality System Regulation, or QSR, which covers the methods used in, and the facilities used for, the design, testing, control, manufacturing, labeling, quality assurance, packaging, storage and shipping of our products. In international markets, we are required to obtain and maintain various quality assurance and quality management certifications. We have obtained the following international certifications: Quality Management System ISO13485, Full Quality Assurance Certification for the design and manufacture of spinal cord stimulator systems and accessories and a Design Examination certificate for Implantable Pulse Generator and Accessories. We are required to demonstrate continuing compliance with applicable regulatory requirements to maintain these certifications and will continue to be periodically inspected by international regulatory authorities for certification purposes. 

We believe that our most significant supply contracts are as follows: 

Pro-Tech Design and Manufacturing 

In July 2014, we entered into a new supply agreement with Pro-Tech Design and Manufacturing, Inc., or Pro-Tech, pursuant to which Pro-Tech, as a single-source supplier, conducts the inspection, labeling, packaging and sterilization of our Senza SCS system. Our supply agreement is scheduled to expire in July 2019, unless terminated earlier. We may terminate the agreement without cause upon six months&#146; prior written notice, and Pro-Tech may terminate without cause upon 18 months&#146; prior written notice. In addition, we and Pro-Tech have the right to terminate the agreement upon 30 days&#146; prior written notice in the event of the other party&#146;s material breach that remains uncured at the end of such 30-day period. 

Stellar Technologies 

On July 1, 2009, we entered into a manufacturing agreement with Stellar Technologies, Inc., or Stellar, our single-source supplier of our percutaneous leads and percutaneous lead extenders for our neurological stimulator products. On June 30, 2014, the agreement&#146;s initial term expired, and the agreement automatically renewed for the first time. On July 1, 2014, we entered into a first amendment to the manufacturing agreement with Stellar, which provides for an additional five year term commencing from the date of the amendment, after which the agreement automatically renews for successive one-year terms unless either party provides written notice of intent not to renew at least 30 days before the expiration of the then-current term. On January 28, 2016, we entered into a second amendment to this agreement, which provides for the purchase of certain supplementary products pursuant to the agreement. We refer to the manufacturing agreement as amended by the first and second amendments as the Stellar Agreement. 

Either we or Stellar may terminate the Stellar Agreement at will upon one years&#146; advance notice, subject to certain remaining rights and payment obligations, including an early cancellation fee payable by us to Stellar. We may also terminate the Stellar Agreement if Stellar is unable to perform its obligations under the Stellar 

&#160;

Agreement for 60 days or more, or if Stellar is unwilling to perform its obligations under the Stellar Agreement and does not cure such defect within 60 days&#146; of our providing written notice to cure. Stellar may terminate the Stellar Agreement in the event of our default of certain specified obligations, including our payment obligations, material violation of a warranty or law, our material breach, and our insolvency. 

CCC Supply Agreement 

We rely upon C.C.C. Del Uruguay S.A., or CCC, a subsidiary of Greatbatch Ltd., as our single-source manufacturer of our implantable pulse generator (IPG). In April 2012, we entered into our original supply agreement with CCC, which we later amended in March 2013 and June 2014. In connection with entry into our new supply agreement, our existing supply agreement with CCC (described below), which was to expire by its terms on March 31, 2015, was terminated. 

On March 13, 2015, we entered into a new multi-year supply agreement with CCC, pursuant to which CCC has agreed to manufacture and supply IPGs, chargers, trial simulators and programmer wands (collectively, the &#147;Products&#148;). We are obligated to purchase from CCC specified minimum purchase quantities of IPGs during the first two years of the supply agreement and thereafter specified increasing percentages of IPGs, unless CCC is unable to manufacture such IPGs, at similar quantities to those contemplated in the agreement. In addition, if we seek to have a third-party manufacture any products, components and materials not currently produced by CCC as of the effective date of this supply agreement, we are obligated to provide CCC with the opportunity to bid for the supply of such products, components and materials. 

The supply agreement continues for ten years unless terminated earlier. The term of the supply agreement automatically renews for additional two-year terms unless one party provides the other party with written notice of termination at least one year prior to the end of the applicable renewal period. In the event of a change in control, the supply agreement may be terminated by us or the applicable acquirer, subject to payment of a termination fee of between $50.0 million and $75.0 million and other conditions, upon no earlier than six years after the effective date of the supply agreement. The supply agreement may also be terminated by us, subject to payment of a termination fee of $50.0 million, upon six months&#146; prior written notice if we determine that we will discontinue the sale of the IPG; provided, that the effective date of any such termination may not occur prior to the date that is 5 years after the effective date of the supply agreement. In addition, the supply agreement may be terminated by mutual agreement of the parties, or by either party, with written notice, upon the other party&#146;s cessation of business or other termination of its business operations, uncured material breach or insolvency of the other party. 

EaglePicher Medical Power Supply Agreement 

In April 2009, we entered into a product supply and development agreement with EaglePicher Medical Power LLC, or EaglePicher, our single-source supplier of the batteries and related products for our IPG. Pursuant to the agreement, EaglePicher must use its best efforts to supply these batteries and related products in sufficient quantity to meet our demand. The agreement also provides that, upon our written request, EaglePicher will conduct development of a modified version of these products to our specifications, if we so desire. The initial term of our supply agreement with EaglePicher expired in November 2010, and the term has been automatically renewing for successive one-year periods. 

In March 2015, we entered into a first amendment to the product supply and development agreement with EaglePicher. The amendment commits us to specified minimum purchase amounts over the course of the term of the agreement and adjusts EaglePicher&#146;s production capacity and facilities commitments under the agreement as well as certain pricing, purchasing, delivery and cancellation terms. The amendment also extends the term of the agreement to December 31, 2019, with an additional two-year automatic renewal period unless we or EaglePicher provides notice of its intent not to renew prior to the commencement of such renewal term. We have also agreed, subject to certain conditions, to purchase minimum quantities of product. The amendment further provides us with the right to place a final order with EaglePicher following termination of the agreement, as amended and modifies certain warranty and assignment terms and the parties&#146; limitations of liability. 

&#160;

In November 2015, we entered into a second amendment to the agreement, which increased our pre-existing specified minimum purchase amounts and increased EaglePicher&#146;s production capacity commitments under the agreement, as well as specifying certain purchasing and purchase order protocols. The amendment obligated EaglePicher to establish and qualify an additional battery production operation and commits us to fund approximately $1.0 million of such production operation paid in three milestone installments. The amendment also establishes EaglePicher as our exclusive battery supplier through the initial five year term of the agreement, ending December 31, 2019. 

Vention Supply Agreement 

In December 2015, we entered into a Manufacturing and Supply Agreement with Vention Medical Design and Development, Inc. (Vention), pursuant to which Vention agreed to manufacture and supply our IPG. We are obligated to purchase from Vention specified minimum purchase quantities of IPGs for the duration of the Vention agreement. 

The agreement continues for five years unless terminated earlier. The term of the agreement automatically renews for additional one-year terms unless one party provides the other party with written notice of termination at least one year prior to the end of the applicable renewal period. The agreement may be terminated by the Company for any reason upon 180 days&#146; written notice to Vention. In addition, the agreement may be terminated by mutual agreement of the parties, or by either party, with written notice, upon uncured material breach or insolvency of the other party. Upon termination of the agreement, Vention shall, upon our request, manufacture an additional 24 months of continuous supply of IPGs based on the preceding forecast average or such other amount as agreed upon by the parties. 

Other Suppliers 

We also have other suppliers, including some sole-source suppliers, for certain of our components, with whom we do not have agreements. 

Product Liability and Insurance 

The manufacture and sale of our products subjects us to the risk of financial exposure to product liability claims. Our products are used in situations in which there is a risk of serious injury or death. We carry insurance policies which we believe to be customary for similar companies in our industry. We cannot assure you that these policies will be sufficient to cover all or substantially all losses that we experience. 

We endeavor to maintain executive and organization liability insurance in a form and with aggregate coverage limits that we believe are adequate for our business purposes, but our coverage limits may prove not to be adequate in some circumstances. 

Government Regulations 

United States 

Our products and operations are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FFDCA, and its implementing regulations, guidances, and standards. The FDA regulates the research, testing, manufacturing, safety, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, promotion, distribution, and production of medical devices in the United States to ensure that medical products distributed domestically are safe and effective for their intended uses. The FDA also regulates the export of medical devices manufactured in the United States to international markets. Any violations of these laws and regulations could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if there is a change in law, regulation or judicial interpretation, we may be required to change our business practices, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

&#160;

Under the FFDCA, medical devices are classified into one of three classes&#151;Class I, Class II or Class III&#151;depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of control needed to ensure safety and effectiveness. 

Class I devices are those for which safety and effectiveness can be assured by adherence to FDA&#146;s &#147;general controls&#148; for medical devices, which include compliance with the applicable portions of the FDA&#146;s Quality System Regulation, or QSR, facility registration and product listing, reporting of adverse medical events, and appropriate, truthful and non-misleading labeling, advertising, and promotional materials. Some Class I devices also require premarket clearance by the FDA through the 510(k) premarket notification process described below. 

Class II devices are subject to FDA&#146;s general controls, and any other &#147;special controls&#148; deemed necessary by FDA to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device. Premarket review and clearance by the FDA for Class II devices is accomplished through the 510(k) premarket notification procedure, though certain Class II devices are exempt from this premarket review process. When a 510(k) is required, the manufacturer must submit to the FDA a premarket notification submission demonstrating that the device is &#147;substantially equivalent&#148; to a legally marketed device, which in some cases may require submission of clinical data. Unless a specific exemption applies, 510(k) premarket notification submissions are subject to user fees. If the FDA determines that the device, or its intended use, is not substantially equivalent to a legally marketed device, the FDA will place the device, or the particular use of the device, into Class III, and the device sponsor must then fulfill much more rigorous premarketing requirements. 

A Class III product is a product which has a new intended use or utilizes advanced technology that is not substantially equivalent to that of a legally marketed device. The safety and effectiveness of Class III devices cannot be assured solely by general or special controls. These devices almost always require formal clinical studies to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. 

Submission and FDA approval of a premarket approval, or PMA, application is required before marketing of a Class III device can proceed. As with 510(k) submissions, unless subject to an exemption, PMA submissions are subject to user fees. The PMA process is much more demanding than the 510(k) premarket notification process. A PMA application, which is intended to demonstrate that the device is safe and effective, must be supported by extensive data, including data from preclinical studies and human clinical trials. The PMA must also contain a full description of the device and its components, a full description of the methods, facilities, and controls used for manufacturing, and proposed labeling. Following receipt of a PMA application, once the FDA determines that the application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review, the FDA will formally accept the application for review. The FDA, by statute and by regulation, has 180-days to review an &#147;accepted&#148; PMA application, although the review of an application more often occurs over a significantly longer period of time, and can take up to several years. In approving a PMA application or clearing a 510(k) application, the FDA may also require some form of post-market surveillance when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device. In such cases, the manufacturer might be required to follow certain patient groups for a number of years and makes periodic reports to the FDA on the clinical status of those patients. 

PMA Approval 

The Senza SCS system is a Class III device subject to review and approval through the PMA pathway. PMA applications must be supported by, among other things, valid scientific evidence, which typically requires extensive data, including technical, preclinical, clinical and manufacturing data, to demonstrate to the FDA&#146;s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the device. A PMA application must also include, among other things, a complete description of the device and its components, a detailed description of the methods, facilities and controls used to manufacture the device, and proposed labeling. 

The FDA has 45 days from its receipt of a PMA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency&#146;s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. During this review period, the 

&#160;

FDA may request additional information or clarification of information already provided. In addition, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the applicant and/or its third-party manufacturers&#146; or suppliers&#146; manufacturing facility or facilities to ensure compliance with the QSR, which requires manufacturers to follow design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures. 

The timing of FDA review of an initial PMA application can vary substantially and, in some cases, require several years to complete. The FDA can delay, limit, or deny approval of a PMA application for many reasons, including: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; it is not demonstrated that there is reasonable assurance that the device is safe or effective under the conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the proposed labeling; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; the data from preclinical studies and clinical trials may be insufficient; and &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; the manufacturing process, methods, controls, or facilities used for the manufacture, processing, packing, or installation of the device do not meet applicable requirements. If the FDA evaluations of both the PMA application and the manufacturing facilities are favorable, the FDA will either issue an approval letter or an approvable letter, which usually contains a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the PMA. If the FDA&#146;s evaluation of the PMA or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, the FDA will deny approval of the PMA or issue a not approvable letter. A not approvable letter will outline the deficiencies in the application and, where practical, will identify what is necessary to make the PMA approvable. The FDA may also determine that additional clinical trials are necessary, in which case the PMA approval may be delayed for several months or years while the trials are conducted and the data is then submitted in an amendment to the PMA. Once granted, PMA approval may be withdrawn by the FDA if compliance with post approval requirements, conditions of approval or other regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing. In May 2015, we received approval for our PMA application. 

Approval by the FDA of new PMA applications or PMA supplements may be required for modifications to the manufacturing process, labeling, device specifications, materials or design of a device that is approved through the PMA process. PMA supplements often require submission of the same type of information as an initial PMA application, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the original PMA application and may not require as extensive clinical data. For example, if we seek approval to expand the label of Senza to include additional pain indications, we anticipate that we will be required to submit and receive approval for a PMA supplement. 

Clinical Studies 

When FDA approval of a Class I, Class II or Class III device requires human clinical trials, and if the device presents a &#147;significant risk&#148; to human health, the device sponsor is required to file an investigational device exemption, or IDE, application with the FDA and obtain IDE approval prior to commencing the human clinical trial. If the device is considered a &#147;non-significant risk,&#148; IDE submission to FDA is not required. Instead, only approval from the Institutional Review Board, or IRB, overseeing the investigation at each clinical trial site is required. Human clinical studies are generally required in connection with approval of Class III devices and may be required for Class I and II devices. The FDA or the IRB at each institution at which a clinical trial is being performed may suspend a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. 

Continuing Regulation 

After FDA permits a device to enter commercial distribution, numerous regulatory requirements apply. These include: compliance with the QSR, which requires manufacturers to follow elaborate design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during the manufacturing process; labeling regulations; the FDA&#146;s general prohibition against promoting products for unapproved or &#147;off-label&#148; uses; the 

&#160;

reports of Corrections and Removals regulation, which requires manufacturers to report recalls and field actions to the FDA if initiated to reduce a risk of health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDC Act; and the Medical Device Reporting, or MDR, regulation, which requires that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to reoccur. Manufacturers are also required to register and list their devices with the FDA, based on which the FDA will conduct inspections to ensure continued compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. 

The FDA has broad post-market and regulatory and enforcement powers. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. medical device regulatory requirements could result in, among other things, warning letters; fines; injunctions; consent decrees; civil penalties; repairs replacements or refunds; recalls, corrections or seizures of products; total or partial suspension of production; the FDA&#146;s refusal to grant future premarket clearances or approvals; withdrawals or suspensions of current product applications; and criminal prosecution. If any of these events were to occur, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

International 

Our international sales are subject to regulatory requirements in the countries in which our products are sold. The regulatory review process varies from country to country and may in some cases require the submission of clinical data. In addition, the FDA must be notified of, or approve the export to certain countries of devices that require a PMA, and not yet approved in the United States. 

In the European Economic Area, or EEA (which is comprised of the 28 Member States of the EU plus Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland), we need to comply with the requirements of the EU Active Implantable Medical Devices Directive or AIMDD, and appropriately affix the CE Mark on our products to attest to such compliance. To achieve compliance, our products must meet the &#147;Essential Requirements&#148; laid down in Annex I of the AIMDD relating to safety and performance. To demonstrate compliance with the Essential Requirements and obtain the right to affix the CE mark we must undergo a conformity assessment procedure, which varies according to the type of medical device and its classification. Except for low risk medical devices (Class I with no measuring function and which are not sterile), where the manufacturer can issue an EC Declaration of Conformity based on a self-assessment of the conformity of its products with the Essential Requirements, a conformity assessment procedure requires the intervention of a Notified Body, which is an organization designated by a competent authority of an EEA country to conduct conformity assessments. Depending on the relevant conformity assessment procedure, the Notified Body would audit and examine the Technical File and the quality system for the manufacture, design and final inspection of our devices. The Notified Body issues a CE Certificate of Conformity following successful completion of a conformity assessment procedure conducted in relation to the medical device and its manufacturer and their conformity with the Essential Requirements. This 

Certificate entitles the manufacturer to affix the CE mark to its medical devices after having prepared and signed a related EC Declaration of Conformity. The assessment of the conformity of Senza has been certified by our Notified Body (the British Standards Institution or (BSI)). 

As a general rule, demonstration of conformity of medical devices and their manufacturers with the Essential Requirements must be based, among other things, on the evaluation of clinical data supporting the safety and performance of the products during normal conditions of use. Specifically, a manufacturer must demonstrate that the device achieves its intended performance during normal conditions of use and that the known and foreseeable risks, and that any adverse events, are minimized and acceptable when weighed against the benefits of its intended performance, and that any claims made about the performance and safety of the device (e.g., product labeling and instructions for use) are supported by suitable evidence. This assessment must be based on clinical data, which can be obtained from (1) clinical studies conducted on the devices being assessed, (2) scientific literature from similar devices whose equivalence with the assessed device can be demonstrated or (3) both clinical studies and scientific literature. With respect to active implantable medical 

&#160;

devices or Class III devices, the manufacturer must conduct clinical studies to obtain the required clinical data, unless reliance on existing clinical data from equivalent devices can be justified. The conduct of clinical studies in the EEA is governed by detailed regulatory obligations. These may include the requirement of prior authorization by the competent authorities of the country in which the study takes place and the requirement to obtain a positive opinion from a competent Ethics Committee. This process can be expensive and time-consuming. Additionally, Senza must continue to comply with the requirements of certain EU Directives. 

We are subject to continued surveillance by our Notified Body and will be required to report any serious adverse incidents to the appropriate authorities. We also must comply with additional requirements of individual countries in which our products are marketed. 

The assessment of the conformity of Senza with the AIMDD and the R&#38;TTE (Radio and Telecommunications Terminal) Directive has been certified by the BSI. 

In September 2012, the European Commission published proposals for the revision of the EU regulatory framework for medical devices. The proposal would replace the Medical Devices Directive and the Active Implantable Medical Devices Directive with a new regulation (the Medical Devices Regulation). Unlike the Directives that must be implemented into national laws, the Regulation would be directly applicable in all EEA Member States and so is intended to eliminate current national differences in regulation of medical devices. 

In October 2013, the European Parliament approved a package of reforms to the European Commission&#146;s proposals. Under the revised proposals, only designated &#147;special notified bodies&#148; would be entitled to conduct conformity assessments of high-risk devices, such as active implantable devices. These special notified bodies will need to notify the European Commission when they receive an application for a conformity assessment for a new high-risk device. The European Commission will then forward the notification and the accompanying documents on the device to the Medical Devices Coordination Group, or MDCG, (a new, yet to be created, body chaired by the European Commission, and representatives of Member States) for an opinion. These new procedures may result in the re-assessment of our existing medical devices, or a longer or more burdensome assessment of our new products. 

If adopted, the Medical Devices Regulation is expected to enter into force in 2016 and become applicable three years thereafter. In its current form it would, among other things, also impose additional reporting requirements on manufacturers of high risk medical devices, impose an obligation on manufacturers to appoint a &#147;qualified person&#148; responsible for regulatory compliance, and provide for more strict clinical evidence requirements. 

Other Regulations 

We are also subject to healthcare fraud and abuse regulation in the jurisdictions in which we will conduct our business. These laws include, without limitation, applicable anti-kickback, false claims, physician sunshine and patient privacy and security laws and regulations. 

Anti-Kickback Statute: The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, persons or entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or paying any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, lease, order or recommendation of, any good, facility, item or service for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and prohibits many arrangements and practices that are lawful in businesses outside of the healthcare industry. The term &#147;remuneration&#148; includes kickbacks, bribes, or rebates and also has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including for example, gifts, discounts, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, credit arrangements, payments of cash, waivers of payments, ownership interests and providing anything at less than its fair market value. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors 

&#160;

protecting certain business arrangements from prosecution under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. These statutory exceptions and safe harbors set forth provisions that, if all their applicable requirements are met, will assure healthcare providers and other parties that they may not be prosecuted under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. The failure of a transaction or arrangement to fit precisely within one or more applicable statutory exceptions or safe harbors does not necessarily mean that it is illegal or that prosecution will be pursued. However, conduct and business arrangements that do not fully satisfy all requirements of an applicable safe harbor may result in increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities and will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. Further, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act which is discussed below. Penalties for violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute include, but are not limited to, criminal, civil and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, possible exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, and the curtailment or restructuring of operations. 

Federal Civil False Claims Act: The federal civil False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, persons or entities from knowingly presenting or causing to be presented a false or fraudulent claim to, or the knowing use of false statements to obtain payment from or approval by, the federal government. In addition, private individuals have the ability to bring actions under the civil False Claims Act in the name of the government alleging false and fraudulent claims presented to or paid by the government (or other violations of the statutes) and to share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement. Such suits, known as qui tam actions, have increased significantly in the healthcare industry in recent years. Manufacturers can be held liable under these laws if they are deemed to &#147;cause&#148; the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product off-label. Penalties for a federal civil False Claims Act violation include three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties of between $5,500 and $11,000 for each separate false claim, the potential for exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs and criminal liability. The majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal Anti-Kickback and False Claims Act, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. 

Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996: The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, created several new federal crimes, including healthcare fraud and false statements relating to healthcare matters. The healthcare fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. 

In addition, HIPAA and its implementing regulations established uniform standards for certain covered entities, which are healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses, as well as their business associates, governing the conduct of specified electronic healthcare transactions and protecting the security and privacy of protected health information. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys&#146; fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. Additionally, certain states have adopted comparable privacy and security laws and regulations, some of which may be more stringent than HIPAA and HITECH. 

EU Data Protection Directive: We are subject to laws and regulations in non-U.S. countries covering data privacy and the protection of health-related and other personal information. EU member states and other jurisdictions have adopted data protection laws and regulations, which impose significant compliance 

&#160;

obligations. For example, the EU Data Protection Directive, as implemented into national laws by the EU member states, imposes strict obligations and restrictions on the ability to collect, analyze and transfer personal data, including health data from clinical trials and adverse event reporting. Failing to comply with these laws could lead to government enforcement actions and significant penalties against us, and adversely impact our operating results. A proposal for an EU Data Protection Regulation, intended to replace the current EU Data Protection Directive, is currently under consideration and, if adopted, could lead to additional and stricter requirements and penalties in the event of non-compliance. 

The Federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act: The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children&#146;s Health Insurance Program, with certain exceptions, to report annually to CMS information related to &#147;payments or other transfers of value&#148; made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, and to report annually to CMS certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Certain states also require device manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures, require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the industry&#146;s voluntary compliance guidelines and the applicable compliance guidance promulgated by the U.S. federal government, or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources. 

Healthcare Reform: In March 2010 the Affordable Care Act (the ACA) was signed into law, which has the potential to substantially change healthcare financing and delivery by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impact the medical device industry. The Affordable Care Act impacted existing government healthcare programs and resulted in the development of new programs. The Affordable Care Act&#146;s provisions of importance include, but are not limited to, a deductible 2.3% excise tax on any entity that manufactures or imports medical devices offered for sale in the United States, with limited exceptions, effective January 1, 2013. Subsequently, this excise tax was eliminated effective January 1, 2016. 

The full impact of the ACA, as well as other laws and reform measures that may be proposed and adopted in the future, remains uncertain, but may continue the downward pressure on medical device pricing, especially under the Medicare program, and may also increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business operations. 

The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act: The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring the company to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations. 

The UK Bribery Act. The UK Bribery Act prohibits giving, offering, or promising bribes to any person, including non-UK government officials and private persons, as well as requesting, agreeing to receive, or accepting bribes from any person. In addition, under the UK Bribery Act, companies which carry on a business or part of a business in the UK, as we do, may be held liable for bribes given, offered or promised to any person, including non-UK government officials and private persons, by employees and persons associated with the company in order to obtain or retain business or a business advantage for the company. Liability is strict, with no element of a corrupt state of mind, but a defense of having in place adequate procedures designed to prevent bribery is available. Furthermore, under the UK Bribery Act there is no exception for facilitation payments. 

&#160;

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015, we had 308 employees globally. We believe the success of our business will depend, in part, on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel.
