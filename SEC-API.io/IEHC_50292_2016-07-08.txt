Business New Product Development 

&#160; 

The Company is sought after by many of its customers to design and manufacture custom connectors. This has created many new products that are innovative designs and employ new technologies. The Company continues to be successful because of its ability to assist its customers and create a new design, including engineering drawing packages, in a relatively short period of time. We will continue to support our customers to the best of our ability.

&#160;

The circular product line of connectors introduced several years ago for the medical industry continues to be very rewarding for the Company. The line has been expanded to include connector cable assemblies utilizing the circular connectors.

&#160;

A new product line featuring high density connectors has been added to the Company&#8217;s product offering. The Company expects the new product line to bring additional revenue.

&#160;

The standard printed circuit board connectors we produce are continually being expanded and utilized in many of the military programs being built today. We have recently received approval for additional products that we can offer under the Military Qualified Product Listing &#8220;QPL.&#8221;

&#160;

Commitments 

&#160;

The Company has a collective bargaining multi-employer pension plan (&#8220;Multi-Employer Plan&#8221;) with the United Auto Workers of America, Local 259 (the &#8220;Union&#8221;). Contributions are made in accordance with a negotiated labor contract and are based on the number of covered employees employed per month. With the passage of the Multi-Employer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1990 (the &#8220;1990 Act&#8221;), the Company may become subject to liabilities in excess of contributions made under the collective bargaining agreement. Generally, these liabilities are contingent upon the termination, withdrawal, or partial withdrawal from the Multi-Employer Plan. The Company has not taken any action to terminate, withdraw or partially withdraw from the Multi-Employer Plan nor does it intend to do so in the future. Under the 1990 Act, liabilities would be based upon the Company&#8217;s proportional share of the Multi-Employer Plan&#8217;s unfunded vested benefits, which is currently not available. The amount of accumulated benefits and net assets of such Plan also is not currently available to the Company. The total contributions charged to operations under such Plan were $134,036 for the year ended March 25, 2016 and $122,668 for the year ended March 27, 2015.

Marketing and Sales

&#160;

The market for connectors and interconnect devices, domestic and worldwide, is highly fragmented as a result of the manufacture by many companies of a multitude of different types and varieties of connectors and interconnects. For example, connectors include: printed wiring board, rectangular I/O, circular, planar (IOC) RF coaxial, IC socket and fiber optic. The Company has been servicing a niche in the market by manufacturing connectors containing HYPERBOLOID contact designs in the printed wiring board style of connectors.

&#160;

The Company is continuously experimenting with innovative connection designs, which may cause it to alter its marketing plans in the future if a market should develop for any of its current or future innovative designs. The Company is continually reviewing product lines being sold in the connector and interconnector marketplace. We are committed to expanding our product offering and we consider that many of our current or future custom designs will become product lines.

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s products are marketed to OEM&#8217;s (original equipment manufacturers) directly and through authorized representatives and distributors serving primarily the Government, Military, Aerospace, Medical, Automotive, Industrial, Test Equipment and Commercial Electronics markets. The Company is also involved in developing new connectors for specific uses, which result from changes in technology. The Company assists customers in the development and design of connectors for specific customer applications. This service is marketed to customers who require the development of connectors and interconnection devices specially designed to accommodate the customers&#8217; own products.

&#160;

The Company is primarily a manufacturer and its products are essentially basic components of larger assemblies of finished goods. Approximately 96% of the Company&#8217;s net sales for the years ended March 25, 2016 and March 27, 2015, respectively, were made directly to manufacturers of finished products with the balance of the Company&#8217;s products sold to distributors. Distributors often purchase connectors for customers who do not require large quantities of connectors over a short period of time but rather require small allotments of connectors over an extended period of time.

&#160;

In the fiscal year ended March 25, 2016, five customers of the Company accounted for $5,569,000 constituting approximately 29% of the Company&#8217;s net sales. Two of those customers accounted for 16% of the Company&#8217;s net sales. In the fiscal year ended March 27, 2015, five customers of the Company accounted for $5,082,035 constituting approximately 31% of the Company&#8217;s net sales. Two of those customers accounted for 16% of the Company&#8217;s net sales.

&#160;

The Company currently employs 16 independent sales representatives to market its products in all regions in the United States as well as in Canada, Israel, India, various Pacific Rim countries, South Korea and the European Union (EU). These independent sales representatives also promote the product lines of other electronics manufacturers; however, they do not promote the product lines of manufacturers which compete directly with the Company&#8217;s products. These sales representatives accounted for approximately 95% of Company net sales for the year ended March 25, 2016 (with the balance of Company net sales being generated via direct customer contact).

&#160;

International sales accounted for approximately 8% of net sales for the years ended March 25, 2016 and March 27, 2015, respectively.

Backlog of Orders/Capital Requirements 

&#160;

The backlog of orders for the Company&#8217;s products amounted to approximately $7,000,000 at March 25, 2016 as compared to $8,674,000 at March 27, 2015. A portion of these orders are subject to cancellation or postponement of delivery dates and, therefore, no assurance can be given that actual sales will result from these orders. The Company does not foresee any problems which would prevent it from fulfilling its orders. 

&#160;

Competition

&#160;

The design, development, manufacture and distribution of electrical connectors and interconnection devices is a highly competitive field. The Company principally competes with companies who produce high performance connectors in printed circuits and wireboards for high technology application. The Company competes by adapting certain technologies to meet specific product applications, producing connectors cost-effectively, and through its production capabilities. In addition, there are many companies who offer connectors with designs similar to those utilized by the Company and are direct competitors of the Company.

&#160;

The primary basis upon which the Company competes is product performance and production capabilities. The Company usually receives job orders after submitting bids pursuant to customer-issued specifications for connectors and interconnectors. The Company&#8217;s bid can be for a new item that requires the item to perform under harsh environment requirements or it can be for a standard catalog item. The Company also offers engineering services to its customers in designing and developing connectors for specialized products and specific customer applications. This enables the Company to receive a competitive advantage over those companies who basically manufacture connectors based solely or primarily on cataloged specifications.

&#160;

Many of the Company&#8217;s competitors have greater financial resources than the Company and no assurances can be given that the Company will be able to compete effectively with these companies in the future.

&#160;

Suppliers of Raw Materials and Component Parts

&#160; 

The Company utilizes a variety of raw materials and manufactured component parts, which it purchases from various suppliers. These materials and components are available from numerous sources and the Company does not believe that it will have a problem obtaining such materials and parts in the future.

&#160;

However, any delay in the Company&#8217;s ability to obtain necessary raw materials and component parts may affect its ability to meet customer production needs. In anticipation of such delays, the Company carries an inventory of raw materials and component parts to avoid shortages and to insure continued production.

&#160;

Research &#38; Development

&#160;

The Company provides personalized engineering services to its customers by designing connectors for specific customer applications. The employment of electromechanical engineers is the anticipated cornerstone of the Company&#8217;s future growth. The Company maintains a testing laboratory where its engineers experiment with

new connector designs based on changes in technology and in an attempt to create innovative, more efficient connector designs.

&#160; 

The Company did not expend any funds on, nor receive any revenues related to, customer sponsored research and development activities relating to the development of new designs, techniques and the improvement of existing designs during the years ended March 25, 2016 and March 27, 2015.

&#160;

Employees

&#160;

The Company presently employs approximately 160 people, two (2) of whom are executive officers; three (3) are engaged in management activities; nine (9) provide general and administrative services; and approximately 146 are employed in manufacturing and testing activities. The employees engaged in manufacturing and testing activities are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with the Union, which will expire on March 31, 2018. The Company believes that it has a good relationship with its employees and the Union.

&#160;

Governmental Regulations 

&#160;

The Company is subject to federal regulations under the Occupational Safety and Health Act (&#8220;OSHA&#8221;) and the Defense Supply Command Columbus (&#8220;DSCC&#8221;).

&#160;

OSHA provides federal guidelines and specifications to companies in order to insure the health and safety of employees. DSCC oversees the quality and specifications of products and components manufactured and sold to the government and the defense industry. DSCC&#8217;s primary customer is the U.S. military. Many of our products appear on the DSCC Qualified Products Listing (&#8220;QPL&#8221;). To remain qualified, the Company submits its products to an outside testing laboratory which performs all required testing. After review by the Company of the testing results the data is then submitted to the DSCC. The Company and its products are only approved and remain on the QPL if the Company has passed all testing requirements. Although DSCC continuously requires suppliers to meet changing specifications, the Company has not encountered any significant problems meeting such specifications and its products have, in the past, been approved. The Company is unaware of any changes in the Government&#8217;s regulations which are expected to materially affect the Company&#8217;s business.
