Divisions 

&#160;

Bisco Industries 

&#160; 

Bisco sells the full spectrum of products that it offers to many markets, but primarily sells to original equipment manufacturers (&#8220;OEMs&#8221;). While historically, the substantial majority of Bisco&#8217;s revenues have been derived from the Bisco Industries division, Bisco has also established additional divisions that specialize in specific industries and products. Bisco believes that the focus by industry and/or product enhances Bisco&#8217;s ability to provide superior service and devise tailored solutions for its customers.

&#160;

National-Precision 

&#160; 

The National-Precision division primarily sells electronic hardware and commercial fasteners to OEMs in the aerospace, fabrication and industrial equipment industries. National-Precision seeks to be the leading global distributor of mil-spec and commercial fasteners, hardware and distribution services used in production.

Fast-Cor 

&#160;

The Fast-Cor division was established to be a distributor&#8217;s source for a broad range of components and fasteners. Fast-Cor has access to the entire inventory of products that Bisco offers but primarily focuses on selling to other distributors, not manufacturers.

&#160; 

Customers and Sales 

&#160;

Bisco&#8217;s customers operate in a wide variety of industries and range from large, global companies to small local businesses. Bisco strives to provide exceptional service to all customers, including smaller businesses, and continues to focus on growing its share of that market. As of August 31, 2016, Bisco had more than 6,000 active customers; however, no single customer accounted for more than 10% of Bisco&#8217;s revenues for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016 (&#8220;fiscal 2016&#8221;). For each of the fiscal years ended August 31, 2016 and 2015, Bisco&#8217;s top 20 customers represented in the aggregate approximately 14% and 11% of Bisco&#8217;s distribution sales, respectively.

Bisco currently maintains seven distribution centers located in Anaheim and San Jose, California; Dallas, Texas; Chicago, Illinois; Boston, Massachusetts, Atlanta, Georgia; and Toronto, Canada. Each of Bisco&#8217;s selling facilities and distribution centers are linked to Bisco&#8217;s central computer system, which provides Bisco&#8217;s salespersons with online, real-time data regarding inventory levels throughout Bisco and facilitates control of purchasing, shipping and billing. Bisco generally ships products to customers from one of its seven distribution centers, based on the geographic proximity and the availability of the ordered products.

Although Bisco sells more products of certain brands, Bisco believes that most of the products it sells are available from other sources at competitive prices. No single supplier accounted for more than 10% of Bisco&#8217;s purchases in fiscal 2016.
