 Item 1. 

Business. 

&#160; 

Background&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

The Providence Service Corporation (the &#8220;Company&#8221; or &#8220;Providence&#8221;), a Delaware corporation formed in 1996, is a holding company, whose subsidiaries provide critical healthcare and workforce development services. The Company operates within two key industry sectors-US healthcare and global workforce development-through its three operating segments: Non-Emergency Transportation Services (&#8220;NET Services&#8221;), Workforce Development Services (&#8220;WD Services&#8221;) and Health Assessment Services (&#8220;HA Services&#8221;). NET Services coordinates non-emergency transportation for individuals whose limited mobility and/or financial resources would otherwise hinder them from accessing necessary healthcare and social services. WD Services primarily provides employability and offender rehabilitation services to eligible participants of government sponsored programs. HA Services, provides care optimization and delivery solutions, including comprehensive health assessments (&#8220;CHAs&#8221;) for health plans as well as in-home care management offerings. 

&#160; 

Ingeus Proprietary Limited and its wholly and partly-owned subsidiaries and associates (collectively, &#8220;Ingeus&#8221;) was acquired on May 30, 2014, and is included in WD Services. CCHN Group Holdings, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries and affiliates operating under the tradename Matrix (&#8220;Matrix&#8221;) was acquired on October 23, 2014, and is included in HA Services . On November 1, 2015, we completed the sale of the Human Services segment, which is accounted for as a discontinued operation. 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, we operated in 44 states and the District of Columbia in the United States (&#8220;US&#8221;), and in 11 countries outside of the US. 

&#160; 

Holding Company Strategy 

&#160; 

Our holding company strategy is designed to increase shareholder value through positive returns on invested capital and free cash flow generation, which in turn is predicated upon the continued development and efficient delivery of critical and high quality services. Our current service offerings are based upon a common purpose of delivering exceptional value in the healthcare and workforce development service industries, primarily in a community or home setting. 

&#160; 

In order to meet our goal of increasing shareholder value, we have established certain priorities at both the holding company and segment leadership levels. T he priorities of our leadership at the holding company level include: 1) pursuing the highest standards of governance, values and compliance, 2) ensuring operating excellence by attracting, developing, and retaining empowered and accountable segment level leadership with deep industry experience, and 3) allocating capital opportunistically in markets that may be inefficient or where we have an ability to invest at a discount to intrinsic value, particularly where our experience, analysis, and long-term perspective can provide an advantage over competitors. As demonstrated in 2015 with the divestiture of our Human Services segment, we also may dispose of current or future investments based on a variety of factors, including availability of alternative opportunities to deploy capital or otherwise maximize shareholder value as well as other strategic considerations. 

&#160; 

Within our current segments, we seek to leverage our market reputation, customer relationships, and core competencies to capture growth opportunities within our current markets and service lines. We also intend to utilize these assets to expand organically and through acquisitions into adjacent markets and complementary service lines. Our core competencies include developing and managing large provider networks, tailoring healthcare and workforce development service offerings to the unique needs of diverse communities and populations, and designing service delivery models to achieve superior outcomes in low cost settings. We also continuously strive to capture service delivery efficiencies while also improving the quality of our offerings. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Holding Company Competition&#160; 

&#160; 

In identifying, evaluating and selecting strategic opportunities, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having similar business objectives, such as strategic investors, private equity groups and special purpose acquisition corporations. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting transactions directly or through affiliates. These competitors may possess greater human and other resources than us, and our financial resources may be relatively limited in comparison. Any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in contrast to our competitors. 

&#160; 

Holding Company Employees 

&#160; 

In the execution of our holding company strategy, our 30 person holding company staff utilizes their investment experience in both public and private markets, previous operational leadership in a variety of industries, as well as other typical public holding company capabilities, including competencies in the areas of accounting, tax, human resource, information technology and legal. Our colleagues may also supplement our segment leadership teams in the areas of strategic development, operational and financial improvement, and cross segment sales or operational synergies on a selective basis. During 2016, we intend to relocate our executive offices to700 Canal St., Stamford, CT, 06901. 

&#160; 

Financial information about our segments 

&#160; 

The Company operates in three segments, NET Services, WD Services and HA Services. Financial information about segments and geographic areas, including revenues, operating income (loss), and long-lived assets of each segment and geographic information is included in Note 23, Segments, of our consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere in this report and is incorporated herein by reference. Additionally, see Item 1A, Risk Factors , for a discussion of risks related to our operations . 

&#160; 

Effective November 1, 2015, we sold our Human Services segment. The operating results of the Human Services segment have been reclassified into discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements in all periods presented. 

&#160; 

Our Operating Segments 

&#160; 

NET Services 

&#160; 

Services offered. &#160; NET Services provides non-emergency transportation solutions to clients in 39 states and the District of Columbia. As of December 31, 2015, approximately 24.8 million individuals were eligible to receive our transportation services. For 2015, 2014 and 2013, NET Services accounted for 63.9%, 77.8% and 96.4%, respectively, of our consolidated revenue. 

&#160; 

NET Services contracts with state and regional Medicaid programs, local government agencies, hospital systems, and managed care organizations (&#8220;MCOs&#8221; and collectively &#8220;NET payers&#8221;) for the coordination of their members&#8217; (&#8220;NET end-users&#8221;) non-emergency transportation needs. NET end-users are typically Medicaid or Medicare eligible members, whose limited mobility and/or financial resources would otherwise hinder their ability to access necessary healthcare and social services. We believe our transportation services not only improve the quality of life and health of the populations we serve, but also keep individuals in their homes and out of more expensive institutional care settings. 

&#160; 

To fulfill the transportation needs of NET end-users, we have established a contracted network of approximately 5,000 independent transportation providers, including operators of wheelchair equipped vehicles, multi-passenger vans, taxis, and ambulances. To ensure the safety, quality, and compliance of our network, each of our transportation providers undergoes an in-depth credentialing process, including: (i) criminal background checks, driving record checks, and drug testing of drivers; (ii) driver training on first aid, patient sensitivity, and cultural diversity; (iii) inspections of vehicles and communication systems; and (iv) demonstration of adequate insurance coverage. We receive transportation requests directly from NET end-users or their representatives, such as social workers, through our call/support centers and utilize a proprietary technology platform to coordinate trips in an efficient and user friendly manner. A significant percentage of our transports are standing orders, mostly for patients who require frequent, recurring services such as dialysis treatment, mental health services, physical therapy, or adult day care services. Non-standing orders include more ad hoc needs for transportation including doctor visits, dental appointments, and hospital discharges. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Revenue and payers. &#160; We contract primarily with state and local government entities and MCOs. Contracts with state Medicaid agencies represent the largest source of our revenue. State payer contracts are typically for three to five years with renewal options. NET Services derived approximately 15.0%, 17.0% and 15.3% of revenue from a single state payer for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The next four largest NET payers in the aggregate comprised approximately 24.2%, 26.2% and 28.4% of NET Services&#8217; revenue for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. 

&#160; 

Approximately 83.6% of NET Services&#8217; revenue in 2015 was generated under capitated contracts where we assume the responsibility of meeting the covered healthcare related transportation requirements of a specific population. Capitated contracts are generally structured with fixed per member, per month payment rates based upon the defined scope of work, actual historical transportation data for the defined population and geographical region to be served, future assumptions on key costs which includes the purchase price of various levels of transport as well as the program population&#8217;s future behavior and the necessity of the program. Historically, under a majority of the contracts, we received payment at the outset of the contract month. However, recently certain states have introduced reconciliation contracts, whereby payment is received after the contract month, based upon a reconciliation of the member count. Approximately 14.0% of NET Services&#8217; revenue in 2015 was derived from fee for service and flat fee contracts, under which fees are generated based upon billing rates for specific services or defined membership populations. 

&#160; 

Seasonality. The quarterly operating income and cash flows of NET Services normally fluctuate as a result of seasonal variations in the business, principally due to lower NET end-user demand during the holiday and winter seasons. While revenue is generally fixed, primarily as a result of the capitated nature of the majority of our contracts, service expense varies based on NET end-user utilization of our services. Thus, we experience quarterly fluctuations in operating income as a result of this seasonal demand. 

&#160; 

Competition. We compete with a variety of organizations that provide similar healthcare and social services related transportation , such as American Medical Response, Inc., Medical Transportation Management Inc., and SoutheasTrans, Inc. as well as local and regional providers. Most local competitors seek to win contracts for specific counties or small geographic territories whereas we and other larger competitors seek to win contracts for an entire state or large regional area. Historically, we have been successful in competitively bidding for state-wide or other large Medicaid population programs. We compete based on our technical expertise and experience, which is delivered in a high service, competitive price environment, although we are not necessarily the lowest priced provider in many instances. 

&#160; 

Business development . &#160; In states where we have regional contracts, we generally seek to expand our services to additional regions in these states and in contiguous states, in order to improve operating efficiencies and opportunities for our existing operational network. We make decisions about which RFPs to consider centrally, selectively targeting contracts based on our profitability goals and service capabilities. 

&#160; &#160; &#160; 

HA Services 

&#160; &#160; 

Services offered. &#160; HA Services provides care optimization and delivery solutions, which primarily includes comprehensive health assessments (&#8220;CHAs&#8221;), but also includes in-home and community-based care management offerings. HA Services utilizes a national network of approximately 800 nurse practitioners (&#8220;NPs&#8221;), located across 35 states, to provide its services primarily to members of Medicare Advantage (&#8220;MA&#8221;) health plans. For 2015 and 2014, HA Services accounted for 12.8% and 3.8%, respectively, of our consolidated revenue. The increase in revenue is due to the acquisition of Matrix in October 2014. 

&#160; 

HA Services primarily generates revenue from CHAs, which capture a health plan members&#8217; health, social, environment and medication risks. Our services typically commence with a member analysis that utilizes client data, such as medical claims data, to maximize our ability to improve client and member outcomes as a result of the assessment process. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#160; 

Through our contact centers, which include almost 165 colleagues, we pursue additional data collection and schedule assessments. Our NPs then spend up to 60 minutes in the member&#8217;s home conducting a comprehensive CHA, which is comprised of a number of distinct components. In addition to checking vital signs and performing a physical examination, our NPs review the member&#8217;s health history and medical prescriptions, conduct a depression screening, evaluate the immediate residential setting for any physical safety issues, review recommended screening tests, and conduct a series of geriatric screens for fall risks, nutrition, and cognitive function. As the evaluation is intended to provide a complete clinical assessment, our NPs are also trained to record all diagnoses of medical conditions. 

&#160; 

The data collected during the CHA is captured electronically on a portable tablet. The CHA process is specifically designed to engage and coordinate with the member&#8217;s full care network in order to facilitate follow-up care and treatment. Following each CHA, educational and clinical information is shared with the member, the member&#8217;s primary healthcare provider and health plan to identify and close gaps in care. The CHA captures accurate and detailed health diagnoses, which also assists our health plan customers in determining the appropriate reimbursement levels for their member base. In addition to identifying opportunities to improve and optimize care, our service offering can deliver immediate impact on care outcomes. 

&#160; 

In addition to our primary CHA services, we launched a chronic care management offering in 2015. With data provided by our health plan clients, we utilize analytics to determine which members we can most effectively lower costs and improve outcomes through face-to-face engagements with clinicians. Each program is customized and is served by a comprehensive team of case managers, nurse practitioners, registered nurses, and trained call center colleagues. We anticipate our chronic care management offering will become an increasing proportion of HA Services&#8217; revenue over the next two to three years. 

&#160; 

Revenue, payers and clients. As of December 31, 2015, HA Services&#8217; customers included approximately 40 health plans, including for profit multi-state health plans and non-profit health plans that operate in only one state or several counties within one state. HA Services serves many of the largest and most prestigious health plans and health systems in the US. For the year ended December 31, 2015, HA Services&#8217; top five customers accounted for approximately 73.6% of its revenue, and its largest customer accounted for approximately 31.1% of its revenue. HA Services enters into annual or multi-annual contracts with its customers under which it is paid on a per assessment basis. 

&#160; 

Seasonality . Historically, we have experienced higher CHA volume in the second half of the calendar year as a result of an accelerating demand towards calendar year-end. However, in 2015, CHAs were performed more evenly throughout the year as we worked to balance our volume to more efficiently utilize our NPs. 

&#160; 

Competition . We believe that Matrix and CenseoHealth are the largest independent providers of CHAs to the health plan market. There are many smaller volume competitors, including Advance Health, EMSI Healthcare Services, MedXM, and Inovalon, Inc. Some plans in-source CHA services for their members through their own network of NPs, including some plans which also utilize our services Our services are often priced at a premium relative to our competitors, and we believe we will continue to maintain a pricing differential as a result of: (i) our national footprint across 35 states, (ii) sophisticated stratification techniques to identify gaps in data and care, (iii) multi-channel member engagement capabilities, (iv) the benefits of HA Services&#8217; community-based NPs, (v) greater control, uniformity and consistency in delivering high quality services for beneficiaries, and (vi) our ability to execute and deliver the assessment goals of our customers. Our chronic care management competitors include Landmark Healthcare, PopHealthcare and Optum. 

&#160; 

Business development . Our business development capabilities are key to capitalizing on our significant market and growth opportunities. While we have historically been led by a small team of account managers and sales personnel, we believe that additional strategic investments in sales and marketing will enable us to increasingly seize on the healthcare industry&#8217;s need for expanded assessment offerings and chronic care management solutions. To that end, we are expanding our dedicated sales personnel, which includes focused sales professionals who have expertise in certain fields, including chronic care management. Marketing strategies include sponsorship and partnership of key industry conferences, client-focused events and programs, and face-to-face marketing. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

WD Services 

&#160; 

Services offered. &#160; WD Services provides workforce development and offender rehabilitation services, both of which include employment preparation and placement, apprenticeship and training, and certain health related services, such as employee assistance programs. For 2015, 2014 and 2013, WD Services accounted for 23.3%, 18.4% and 3.6%, respectively, of our consolidated revenue. The growth in revenue is principally due to the acquisition of Ingeus in May 2014. 

&#160; 

WD Services&#8217; end user client base (&#8220;WD end-users&#8221;) is broad, and includes both the recently and long-term unemployed, disabled, and unskilled individuals, as well as individuals that are coping with medical illnesses, are newly graduated from educational institutions, or have been released from incarceration. 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, WD Services operated across 12 countries, including the United Kingdom (&#8220;UK&#8221;), Australia, France, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Canada, the US, Germany, Poland, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland. However, the operations in Sweden will cease during 2016. 

&#160; 

Revenue, payers and clients. The majority of our revenues are generated by providing employability and training programs with national government entities seeking to reduce unemployment or recidivism rates. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, approximately 75.5% and 66.6%, respectively, of WD Services&#8217; revenue was derived from operations in the UK. Additionally, approximately 40.0% and 57.2% of our WD Services&#8217; revenue was derived from a single government customer during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2015, approximately 28.2% of WD Services&#8217; revenue was derived from the second largest WD Services customer. 

&#160; 

The nature of services offered by WD Services often relies on our ability to improve a certain set of outcomes at a reduced cost versus previously utilized in-sourced delivery models. As a result, as we commence new contracts with new transformational delivery models, we are required to invest significant upfront capital for information technology, facilities and transformational costs, such as consultants and redundancy payments. The level of upfront funding required is dependent upon the size and nature of the contract. Although significant upfront funding may be required, revenues are often payable only as services are delivered and in some cases only after incentive measures have been achieved. As a result of these two factors, there can be significant variability in our earnings from quarter to quarter, and from year to year. Thus, we measure our contracts success over the term of the contract and believe the financial results of WD Services are best viewed over a multi-year perspective. 

&#160; 

Seasonality . While there has been period-to-period variability in WD Services&#8217; earnings due to the factors discussed above and also set forth in Item 7 &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8211; How We Earn our Revenue &#8211; WD Services,&#8221; there has not been a material seasonal effect on the WD Services&#8217; results of operations. 

&#160; 

Competition . In the UK, Australia and Saudi Arabia, the workforce development and offender rehabilitation market is served primarily by large multi-national corporations that provide a wider range of outsourced services than we offer. In Canada, France, Germany, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the US, our competition primarily consists of small, privately owned companies. Our larger competitors include Maximus, Capita, G4S, Sodexo, Interserve and Serco. 

&#160; 

The market for services to governments is competitive and subject to change and pricing pressure, particularly during the bidding for contract renewals. However, due to the critical nature of our offerings and the end-users we serve, market entry can be difficult for new entrants or those without previous examples of service excellence. In addition, due to the complexity, significant upfront investment, and long-term nature of the contracts, barriers to entry exist for those potential new competitors without prior, relevant experience. 

&#160; 

Business development . Our business development activities are performed at both the local level as well as centrally in WD Services&#8217; London headquarters. Through local and global networks and relationships, we become aware of new opportunities for which we develop bids through competitive processes. The nature of the competitive processes varies from highly competitive to being one of a few, or the sole, service providers to bid on a contract. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Our primary focus is on expanding our portfolio of national contracts within our areas of expertise. However, other key elements of our long-term strategy include leveraging our expertise in certain adjacent niche or inefficient markets, expanding our services to private corporations, and increasing the provision of skills and training services as well as health-related services. In addition, in late 2015, our bidding process was reviewed and transformed with an improved focus on pursuing only those contracts where we can estimate financial outcomes within our investment and risk criteria and where we can demonstrate differentiated and improved outcomes for our clients. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, we employed approximately 9,072 clinical, client service and administrative personnel. Of these employees, 3,668 work in our NET Services segment, 4,325 work in our WD Services segment and 1,049 work in our HA Services segment. 

&#160; 

We believe that our employee relations are good because we offer competitive compensation, including stock-based compensation to key employees, training, education assistance and career advancement opportunities. By offering competitive compensation and benefit packages to our employees, we believe we are able to consistently deliver high quality service, recruit qualified candidates and increase employee confidence, satisfaction and retention. 

&#160; 

None of our US employees are members of a union. We have nearly 3,000 and 370 full-time employees in the UK and France, respectively. Certain of our UK employees are members of the NAPO and Unison unions and certain of our employees in France are members of the Confederation Generale du Travail. Unionized employees in both countries have collective bargaining rights. Participation in unions is confidential under European employment laws. We believe we have good relationships with our employees, both unionized and non-unionized, in the US and internationally. 

&#160; 

Regulatory Environment 

&#160; 

Overview 

&#160; 

We are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations. These laws and regulations significantly affect the way in which we operate various aspects of our business. We must also comply with state and local licensing requirements and requirements for participation in Medicare, Medicaid, requirements for contracting with MA plans, and contractual requirements imposed upon us by the state and local agencies with which we contract for such healthcare and human services. Failure to follow the rules and requirements of these programs can significantly affect our ability to be paid for the services we provide. 

&#160; 

In addition, our revenue is largely derived from contracts that are directly or indirectly paid or funded by government agencies, including Medicare and Medicaid. A significant decline in expenditures, or shift of expenditures or funding, could cause payers to reduce their expenditures under those contracts or not renew such contracts, either of which could have a negative impact on our future operating results. As funding for our contracts is dependent in part upon federal funding, such funding changes could have a significant effect on our business. 

&#160; 

The healthcare industry is highly regulated and the federal and state laws that affect our business are significant. Federal law and regulations are based primarily upon the Medicare and Medicaid programs, each of which is financed, at least in part, with federal money. State jurisdiction is based upon a state&#8217;s authority to license certain categories of healthcare professionals and providers and the state&#8217;s interest in regulating the quality of healthcare in the state, regardless of the source of payment. The significant areas of federal and state regulatory laws that may affect our business, include, but are not limited to the following: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

false and other improper claims; 

&#160; &#9679; 

the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (&#8220;HIPAA&#8221;) and its privacy, security, breach notification and enforcement and code set regulations, along with evolving state laws protecting patient privacy and requiring notifications of unauthorized access to, or use of, patient medical information; 

&#160; &#9679; 

civil monetary penalties law; 

&#160; &#9679; 

anti-kickback laws; 

&#160; &#9679; 

the Stark Law and other self-referral and financial inducement laws; 

&#160; &#9679; 

CMS regulations pertaining to Medicare as well as CMS releases applicable to the operation of MA plans, such as reimbursement rates, risk adjustment methodologies, adjustments to quality management measurements and other relevant factors; and 

&#160; &#9679; 

state licensure laws. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

A violation of any law could result in civil and criminal penalties, the refund of monies paid by government and/or private payers, our exclusion from participation in federal healthcare payer programs, and/or the loss of our license to conduct business within a particular state&#8217;s boundaries. Although we believe that we are able to maintain material compliance with all applicable laws, these laws are complex and a review of our practices by a court, or applicable law enforcement or regulatory authority, could result in an adverse determination that could harm our business. Furthermore, the laws applicable to our business are subject to change, interpretation and amendment, which could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. 

&#160; 

Federal Law 

&#160; 

Federal healthcare laws apply in any case in which we are providing an item or service that is reimbursable by a federal healthcare payer program. The principal federal laws that affect our business include those that prohibit the filing of false or improper claims with federal healthcare payer programs and those that prohibit unlawful inducements for the referral of business reimbursable under federal healthcare payer programs. 

&#160; 

False and Other Improper Claims 

&#160; 

Under the federal False Claims Act (31 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 3729-3733) and similar state laws, the government may impose civil liability on us if we knowingly submit, or participate in submitting, any claims for payment to the federal or state government that are false or fraudulent, or that contain false or misleading information. The False Claims Act defines a claim as a demand for money or property made directly to the government or to a contractor, grantee, or other recipient if the money is to be spent on the government&#8217;s behalf or if the government will reimburse the contractor or grantee. Liability can be incurred for submitting (or causing another to submit) false claims with actual knowledge or for submitting false claims with reckless disregard or deliberate ignorance. Liability can also be incurred for knowingly making or using a false record or statement to receive payment from the federal government or for knowingly and improperly avoiding or decreasing an obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the government. Consequently, a provider need not take an affirmative action to conceal or avoid an obligation to the government, but the mere retention of an overpayment from the government could lead to potential liability under the False Claims Act. 

&#160; 

If we are ever found to have violated the False Claims Act, we could be required to make significant payments to the government (including damages and penalties in addition to the return of reimbursements previously collected) and could be excluded from participating in federal healthcare programs. Many states also have similar false claims statutes. In addition, healthcare fraud is a priority of the US Department of Justice, Office of Inspector General and the Federal Bureau of Investigation and state Attorneys General. These agencies have devoted a significant amount of resources to investigating healthcare fraud. 

&#160; 

While the criminal statutes generally are reserved for instances evidencing fraudulent intent, the civil and administrative penalty statutes are being applied by the federal government in an increasingly broad range of circumstances. Examples of the types of activities giving rise to liability for filing false claims include billing for services not rendered, misrepresenting services rendered (i.e., mis-coding) and applications for duplicate reimbursement. Additionally, the federal government takes the position that a pattern of claiming reimbursement for unnecessary services violates these statutes if the claimant should have known that the services were unnecessary. The federal government also takes the position that claiming reimbursement for services that are substandard is a violation of these statutes if the claimant should have known that the care was substandard. Criminal penalties also are available in the case of claims filed with private insurers if the federal government shows that the claims constitute mail fraud or wire fraud or violate any of the federal criminal healthcare fraud statutes. 

&#160; 

State Medicaid agencies and state Attorneys General also have authority to seek criminal or civil sanctions for fraud and abuse violations. In addition, private insurers may bring actions under state false claim laws. In certain circumstances, federal and state laws authorize private whistleblowers to bring false claim or &#8220;qui tam&#8221; suits on behalf of the government against providers and reward the whistleblower with a portion of any final recovery. In addition, the federal government has engaged a number of private audit organizations to assist it in tracking and recovering claims for healthcare services that may have been improperly submitted. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Governmental investigations and whistleblower &#8220;qui tam&#8221; suits against healthcare companies have increased significantly in recent years, and have resulted in substantial penalties and fines. Although we monitor our billing practices for compliance with applicable laws, such laws are very complex, and we might not be able to detect all errors or interpret such laws in a manner consistent with a court or an agency&#8217;s interpretation. 

&#160; 

Health information practices 

&#160; 

Under HIPAA, the US Department of Health and Human Services (&#8220;DHHS&#8221;) issued rules to define and implement standards for the electronic transactions and code sets for the submission of transactions such as claims, and privacy and security of individual health information in whatever manner it is maintained. 

&#160; 

The Final Rule on Enforcement of the HIPAA Administrative Simplification provisions, including the transaction standards, the security standards and the privacy rule, published by DHHS addresses, among other issues, DHHS&#8217;s policies for determining violations and calculating civil monetary penalties, how DHHS will address the statutory limitations on the imposition of civil monetary penalties, and various procedural issues. The rule extends enforcement provisions currently applicable to the healthcare privacy regulations to other HIPAA standards, including security, transactions and the appropriate use of service code sets. 

&#160; 

The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, (&#8220;HITECH&#8221;), enacted as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, extends certain of HIPAA&#8217;s obligations to parties providing services to healthcare entities covered by HIPAA known as &#8220;business associates,&#8221; imposes new notice of privacy breach reporting obligations, extends enforcement powers to state attorney generals and amends the HIPAA privacy and security laws to strengthen the civil and criminal enforcement of HIPAA. HITECH establishes four categories of violations that reflect increasing levels of culpability, four corresponding tiers of penalty amounts that significantly increase the minimum penalty amount for each violation, and a maximum penalty amount of $1.5 million for all violations of an identical provision. With the additional HIPAA enforcement power under HITECH, the Office of Civil Rights of the Department of Health and Human Services and states are increasing their investigations and enforcement of HIPAA compliance. We have taken steps to ensure compliance with HIPAA and we are monitoring compliance on an ongoing basis. 

&#160; 

Additionally, the HITECH Final Rule imposes various requirements on covered entities and business associates, and expands the definition of &#8220;business associates&#8221; to cover contractors of business associates. We are continuing to assess our compliance obligations under HIPAA as modified by HITECH, and are implementing operational and systems changes, associate education and resources. There is no guarantee that we will be able to implement them adequately given HIPAA&#8217;s complexity and the recently finalized HIPAA and HITECH regulations, which may be subject to changing and perhaps conflicting interpretation. Our ongoing ability to comply with all of the HIPAA requirements is uncertain, which may expose us to the criminal and increased civil penalties provided under HITECH and may require us to incur significant costs in order to seek to comply with its requirements. 

&#160; 

Federal and state anti-kickback laws &#160; 

&#160; 

Federal law commonly known as the &#8220;Anti-Kickback Statute&#8221; prohibits the knowing and willful offer, solicitation, payment or receipt of anything of value (direct or indirect, overt or covert, in cash or in kind) which is intended to induce: the referral of an individual for a service for which payment may be made by Medicare, Medicaid or certain other federal healthcare programs; or the ordering, purchasing, leasing, or arranging for, or recommending the purchase, lease or order of, any service or item for which payment may be made by Medicare, Medicaid or certain other federal healthcare programs. 

&#160; 

Interpretations of the Anti-Kickback Statute have been very broad and under current law, courts and federal regulatory authorities have stated that this law is violated if even one purpose (as opposed to the sole or primary purpose) of the arrangement is to induce referrals. Even bona fide investment interests in a healthcare provider may be questioned under the Anti-Kickback Statute if the government concludes that the opportunity to invest was offered as an inducement for referrals. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#160; 

This act is subject to numerous statutory and regulatory &#8220;safe harbors.&#8221; The safe harbor regulations, however, do not cover all lawful relationships between healthcare providers and referral sources. Failure of an arrangement to satisfy all of the requirements of a particular safe harbor does not mean that the arrangement is unlawful. However, it may mean that such an arrangement will be subject to scrutiny by the regulatory authorities. 

&#160; 

While we believe that our operations are in compliance with applicable Medicare and Medicaid fraud and abuse laws, there can be no guarantee. We seek to structure all applicable arrangements to comply with applicable safe harbors where reasonably possible. There is a risk however, that the federal government might investigate such arrangements and conclude they violate the Anti-Kickback Statute. If our arrangements are found to violate the Anti-Kickback Statute, we, along with our clients would be subject to civil and criminal penalties, which may include exclusion from participation in government reimbursement programs, and our arrangements would not be legally enforceable, which could materially and adversely affect our business. 

&#160; 

Many states, including some where we do business, have adopted anti-kickback laws that are similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Some of these state laws are very closely patterned on the federal Anti-Kickback Statute; others, however, are broader and reach reimbursement by private payers. If our activities were deemed to be inconsistent with state anti-kickback or illegal remuneration laws, we could face civil and criminal penalties or be barred from such activities, any of which could harm our business. 

&#160; 

Federal and State Self-Referral Prohibitions 

&#160; 

We may be subject to federal and state statutes banning payments for referrals of patients and referrals by physicians to healthcare providers with whom the physicians have a financial relationship. Section 1877 of the Social Security Act, also known as the &#8220;Stark Law&#8221;, prohibits physicians from making a &#8220;referral&#8221; for &#8220;designated health services&#8221; for Medicare (and in many cases Medicaid) patients from entities or facilities in which such physicians directly or indirectly hold a &#8220;financial relationship&#8221;. 

&#160; 

A financial relationship can take the form of a direct or indirect ownership, investment or compensation arrangement. A referral includes the request by a physician for, or ordering of, or the certifying or recertifying the need for, any designated health services. 

&#160; 

Certain services that we provide may be identified as &#8220;designated health services&#8221; for purposes of the Stark Law. We cannot provide assurance that future regulatory changes will not result in other services we provide becoming subject to the Stark Law&#8217;s ownership, investment or compensation prohibitions in the future. 

&#160; 

Many states, including some states where we do business, have adopted similar or broader prohibitions against payments that are intended to induce referrals of clients. Moreover, many states where we operate have laws similar to the Stark Law prohibiting physician self-referrals. We contract with a significant number of human services providers and practitioners, including therapists, physicians and psychiatrists, and arrange for these individuals or entities to provide services to our clients. While we believe that these contracts are in compliance with the Stark Law, no assurance can be made that such contracts will not be considered in violation of the Stark Law. 

&#160; 

Healthcare Reform &#160; 

&#160; 

On March 23, 2010, the President of the United States signed into law comprehensive health reform through the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Pub. L. 11-148) (&#8220;PPACA&#8221; or &#8220;ACA&#8221;). On March 30, 2010, the President signed a reconciliation budget bill that included amendments to the PPACA (Pub. L. 11-152). These laws in combination form the &#8220;Health Care Reform Act&#8221; referred to herein. The changes to various aspects of the healthcare system in the Health Care Reform Act are far-reaching and include, among many others, substantial adjustments to Medicare reimbursement, establishment of individual mandates for healthcare coverage, extension of coverage to certain populations, expansion of Medicaid, restrictions on physician-owned hospitals, and increased efficiency and oversight provisions. 

&#160; 

Some of the provisions of the Health Care Reform Act took effect immediately, while others will take effect later or will be phased in over time, ranging from a few months following approval to ten years. Due to the complexity of the Health Care Reform Act, it is likely that additional legislation will be considered and enacted. The Health Care Reform Act requires the promulgation of regulations that will likely have significant effects on the healthcare industry and third party payers. Thus, the healthcare industry and our operations may be subjected to significant new statutory and regulatory requirements and contractual terms and conditions, and consequently to structural and operational changes and challenges. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

The Health Care Reform Act also implements significant changes to healthcare fraud and abuse laws that will intensify the risks and consequences of enforcement actions. These include expansion of the False Claims Act by: (a) narrowing the public disclosure bar; and (b) explicitly stating that violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute trigger false claims liability. In addition, the Health Care Reform Act lessens the intent requirements under the Anti-Kickback Statute to provide that a person may violate the statute without knowledge or specific intent. The Health Care Reform Act also provides new funding and expanded powers to investigate fraud, including through expansion of the Medicare Recovery Audit Contractor (&#8220;RAC&#8221;) program to Medicare Parts C and D and Medicaid and authorizing the suspension of Medicare and Medicaid payments to a provider of services pending an investigation of a credible allegation of fraud. Finally, the legislation creates enhanced penalties for noncompliance, including increased criminal penalties and expansion of administrative penalties under Medicare and Medicaid. Collectively, such changes could have a material adverse impact on our operations. 

&#160; 

Surveys and audits 

&#160; 

Our programs are subject to periodic surveys by government authorities and/or their contractors to ensure compliance with various requirements. Regulators conducting periodic surveys often provide reports containing statements of deficiencies for alleged failures to comply with various regulatory requirements. In most cases, if a deficiency finding is made by a reviewing agency, we will work with the reviewing agency to agree upon the steps to be taken to bring our program into compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. In some cases, however, an agency may take a number of adverse actions against a program, including: 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

&#160; 

the imposition of fines or penalties; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

&#160; 

temporary suspension of admission of new clients to our program&#8217;s service; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

&#160; 

in extreme circumstances, exclusion from participation in Medicaid, Medicare or other programs; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

&#160; 

revocation of our license; or 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

&#160; 

contract termination. 

&#160; 

While we believe that our programs are in compliance with Medicare, Medicaid and other program certification requirements and state licensure requirements, failure to comply with these requirements could have a material adverse impact on our business and our ability to enter into contracts with other agencies to provide services. 

&#160; 

Billing/claims reviews and audits 

&#160; 

Agencies and other payers periodically conduct pre-payment or post-payment medical reviews or other audits of our claims. In order to conduct these reviews, payers request documentation from us and then review that documentation to determine compliance with applicable rules and regulations, including the eligibility of clients to receive benefits, the appropriateness of the care provided to those clients, and the documentation of that care. Any determination that we have not complied with applicable rules and regulations could result in adjustment of payments or the incurrence of fines and penalties, or in situations of significant compliance failures review or non-renewal of related contracts. 

&#160; 

Corporate practice of medicine and fee splitting 

&#160; 

Some states in which we operate prohibit general business entities, such as we are, from &#8220;practicing medicine,&#8221; which definition varies from state to state and can include employing physicians, as well as engaging in fee-splitting arrangements with these healthcare providers. Among other things, we currently contract with and employ NPs to perform CHAs. We believe that we have structured our operations appropriately; however, we could be alleged or found to be in violation of some or all of these laws. If a state determines that some portion of our business violates these laws, it may seek to have us discontinue those portions or subject us to penalties, fines, certain license requirements or other measures. Any determination that we have acted improperly in this regard may result in liability to us. In addition, agreements between the corporation and the professional may be considered void and unenforceable. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Professional licensure and other requirements 

&#160; 

Many of our employees are subject to federal and state laws and regulations governing the ethics and practice of their professions. For example, our mid-level practitioners, e.g., NPs, are subject to state laws requiring physician supervision and state laws governing mid-level scope of practice. As the use of mid-levels by physicians increases, state governing boards are implementing more robust regulations governing mid-levels and their scope of practice under physician supervision. Our ability to provide mid-level practitioner services may be restricted by the enactment of new state laws governing mid-level scope of practice and by state agency interpretations and enforcement of such existing laws. In addition, professionals who are eligible to participate in Medicare and Medicaid as individual providers must not have been excluded from participation in government programs at any time. Our ability to provide services depends upon the ability of our personnel to meet individual licensure and other requirements. 

&#160; 

International Regulation of WD Services segment 

&#160; 

As a provider of WD services in multiple international jurisdictions, we are subject to numerous national and local laws and regulations. These laws and regulations significantly affect the way in which we operate various aspects of our business. We must also comply with contract-specific technical and infrastructure requirements. Failure to follow the rules and requirements of these programs can significantly affect our ability to be paid for the services we provide. In addition, our revenue is primarily derived from contracts that are funded by national governments that are seeking to reduce the overall unemployment rate, or improve job placement success for targeted cohorts, and the recidivism rate. Further, the revenue we receive from these contracts is typically tied to milestones that are largely uncontrolled by us. Such milestones include the job placement success of clients, duration and tenure of clients in jobs once they are placed, and various other market and industry factors including the overall unemployment rate. A significant decline in national and local government initiatives to provide funding for employment programs, or shift of expenditures or funding, could cause government sponsors to reduce their expenditures under those contracts or not renew such contracts, either of which could have a negative impact on our future operating results. 

&#160; 

Our WD Services segment is also subject to the European Union&#8217;s and other countries&#8217; data security and protection laws and regulations. These laws and regulations may restrict the flow of information, including information about employees or service users, from this segment to the Company in the United States. In certain instances, informed consent to the data transfer must be given by the affected employee or service user. Compliance with such laws and regulations may make it more difficult for the Company to gather data necessary to ensure the appropriate operation of its internal controls or to detect corruption resulting in the need for additional controls or increasing the Company&#8217;s costs to maintain appropriate controls. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result in fines or penalties against the Company. 

&#160; 

Further, our international operations are subject to various US and foreign statutes that prevent bribery and corruption, including the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the UK&#8217;s Bribery Act. These statutes generally prevent the provision of anything of value to government officials for the purposes of influencing official decisions or obtaining or retaining business or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment and require the maintenance of adequate record-keeping and internal accounting practices to accurately reflect transactions. In addition, many countries in which we operate have antitrust or competition regulations which prohibit collusive tendering or bid-rigging behavior. Failure to comply with any of these statutes and regulations could result in fines or penalties and could have a negative impact on our future operations.
