The Company

&#160;

Solitario Exploration &#38; Royalty Corp. (&#8220;Solitario&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) is an exploration stage company with a focus on the acquisition of precious and base metal properties with exploration potential, and the purchase of royalty interests. We acquire and hold a portfolio of exploration properties for future sale, joint venture, or to create a royalty prior to the establishment of proven and probable reserves.

Sale of Mt. Hamilton LLC 

On August 25, 2015, we, along with DHI Minerals (US) Ltd. (&#8220;DHI&#8221;), sold our combined interests in the Mt. Hamilton gold project to Waterton Nevada Splitter, LLC, (&#8220;Waterton&#8221;) for total cash proceeds of US$30 million (the &#8220;Transaction&#8221;) pursuant to a definitive agreement entered into on June 10, 2015 (the &#8220;Agreement&#8221;). We sold our 80% interest in Mt. Hamilton LLC (&#8220;MH-LLC&#8221;), a limited liability company which holds 100% of the Mt. Hamilton project assets, and DHI sold its 20% interest in MH-LLC. DHI is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ely Gold and Minerals, Inc. (&#8220;Ely&#8221;). We received gross cash proceeds of US$24 million and Ely received gross cash proceeds of US$6 million. Our costs and fees related to the Transaction, including broker fees and professional service fees, were $439,000. The Transaction was structured as the sale of DHI&#8217;s and our combined membership interests in MH-LLC. Completion of the Transaction was subject to the satisfaction of various conditions precedent, including the approval of the holders of a majority of Solitario&#8217;s outstanding shares of common stock, which was received at Solitario&#8217;s annual shareholder meeting on August 14, 2015. We recorded a gain on sale related to the Transaction of $12,309,000. The assets and liabilities sold and the gain on the Transaction are detailed under Recent Developments in Note 1, &#8220;Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#8221; to the Consolidated Financial statements in Part II, Item 8, &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.&#8221;

&#160;

Repayment of the RMB Loan 

Concurrent with the closing of the Transaction, we paid $5,000,000 plus $7,000 of interest and fees to fully repay the funds we had borrowed (the &#8220;RMB Loan&#8221;) pursuant to a facility agreement (the &#8220;Facility Agreement&#8221;) with RMB Australia Holdings Limited (&#8220;RMBAH&#8221;) and RMB Resources, Inc. (&#8220;RMBR&#8221;). On August 5, 2015, we entered into an agreement with RMBAH to extend the maturity date of the RMB Loan from August 21, 2015 to September 30, 2015 (the &#8220;RMB Loan Extension&#8221;). In consideration for entering into the RMB Loan Extension, we paid RMBAH an extension fee of $50,000 and agreed to extend the terms of warrants to acquire 1,624,748 shares of Solitario common stock (the &#8220;RMB Warrants&#8221;) from August 21, 2015 to August 21, 2016. The RMB Warrants were originally issued in August 2012 to RMBAH as partial consideration for financing services provided in connection with the Facility Agreement.

&#160;

We have been actively involved in mineral exploration and related activities since 1993. Previous to the Transaction, our last significant proceeds from the sale of a mineral property were recorded in 2000 upon the sale of our Yanacocha property for $6,000,000. During 2014 we recorded revenues from joint venture delay rental payments of $200,000 related to our Bongar&#225; project in Peru. Future proceeds from the sale of properties, if any, will also occur on an infrequent basis. At December 31, 2015, we had four mineral exploration properties in Peru and Mexico, our Yanacocha royalty property in Peru and a retained royalty on the Pedra Branca project in Brazil. We are conducting limited property evaluation activities in those countries either on our own using contract geologists, or through joint ventures operated by our partners.

Solitario was incorporated in the state of Colorado on November 15, 1984 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Crown

Resources Corporation (&#34;Crown&#34;). In July 1994, we became a publicly traded company on the Toronto Stock Exchange (the &#34;TSX&#34;) through our initial public offering. On July 26, 2004, Crown completed a spin-off of its holdings of our shares to its shareholders as part of the acquisition of Crown (the &#8220;Crown - Kinross Merger&#8221;) by Kinross Gold Corporation (&#8220;Kinross&#8221;). On June 12, 2008, our shareholders approved an amendment to our Articles of Incorporation to change the name of the corporation to Solitario Exploration &#38; Royalty Corp. from Solitario Resources Corporation.

&#160;

Our corporate structure as of December 31, 2015 is as follows: All of the subsidiaries are 100%-owned, with the exception of Bongar&#225; project in Peru, with Solitario retaining a 39% interest and Minera Chambara, which is 85%-owned. Both of these projects are joint ventured to Compania Minera Milpo S.A.A. (&#8220;Milpo&#8221;). Milpo is traded on the Lima exchange under the symbol MILPOCI. Beginning in January 2015, Solitario accounts for its interest in both Bongar&#225; and Minera Chambara under the equity method of accounting. During the year ended December 31, 2015 we dissolved our previously owned subsidiary, Altoro Gold Corp., which had held interest in exploration properties in Brazil that had been abandoned in prior years.

General

&#160;

Prior to the Transaction, a significant part of our focus was on the permitting and development of the Mt. Hamilton project. Currently our primary goal is to acquire and/or discover economic deposits on our mineral properties and advance these deposits, either on our own or through joint ventures, up to the development stage (development activities include, among other things, completion of a feasibility study for the identification of proven and probable reserves, as well as permitting and preparing a deposit for mining). At that point, or sometime prior to that point, we would attempt to sell our mineral properties, pursue their development either on our own, or through a joint venture with a partner that has expertise in mining operations, or create a royalty with a third party that continues to advance the property. In addition to focusing on our current assets and properties, we expect to focus on the potential acquisition of new precious and base metal properties and assets with exploration potential and the development or purchase of royalty interests.

&#160;

Prior to the completion of the Transaction we had significantly reduced our exploration activities in Peru, Mexico and Brazil. We no longer have any active properties in Brazil and we have no full-time employees in any of those countries. Our current and near-term future exploration activities in Peru and Mexico consist of care and maintenance of our existing exploration projects through the use of contract geologists, and oversight of our joint ventures in Peru and Mexico that are managed by our partners.

&#160;

In analyzing our activities, a significant aspect relates to our exploration activities and those of our joint venture partners on a property-by-property basis. When these activities, including drilling, sampling and geologic testing, indicate a project may not be economic or contain sufficient geologic or economic potential, we may impair or completely write-off the property. Another significant factor in the success or failure of our activities is the price of commodities. For example, when the price of gold is down, the value of any of our gold-bearing mineral exploration properties decreases; however, it may also become easier and less expensive to locate and acquire new gold-bearing mineral exploration properties with potential to have economic deposits.

&#160;

The sale, joint venture or development, either on our own or through a joint venture of our mineral properties has, and is expected to occur on an infrequent basis. Accordingly, while we conduct exploration activities on our projects, we need to maintain and replenish our capital resources. We have met our need for capital in the past through (i) proceeds of the Transaction; (ii) sale of our shares of Kinross common stock; (iii) borrowing in the form of short-term margin debt secured by our investment in Kinross; (iv) borrowing under the Facility Agreement (v) joint venture delay rental payments, including payments on our Bongar&#225; project; (vi) a royalty sale to Sandstorm, Ltd for $10,000,000 in 2012; and (vii) issuance of common stock, including cash received upon the exercise of options. In the past, we have reduced our exposure to the costs of our exploration activities through the use of joint ventures. We anticipate these practices will continue for the foreseeable future.

&#160;

We operate in one segment, mineral exploration. We currently conduct limited exploration activities in Peru and Mexico. See Note 11 &#8220;Segment Reporting&#8221; in Part II, Item 8, &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8221; of this Form 10-K. As of March 3, 2016, we had five full-time employees, located in the United States and no full-time employees outside of

the United States. We utilize contract managers, geologists and laborers to execute our Latin American project work and acquisition evaluations.

&#160;

&#160;

A large number of companies are engaged in the acquisition, exploration and development of mineral properties, many of which have substantially greater technical and financial resources than we have and, accordingly, we may be at a disadvantage in being able to compete effectively for the acquisition, exploration and development of mineral properties. We are not aware of any single competitor or group of competitors that dominate the exploration and development of mineral properties. In acquiring mineral properties for exploration and development, we rely on the experience, technical expertise and knowledge of our employees and advisors, which is limited by the size of our company compared to many of our competitors who may have either more employees or employees with more specialized knowledge and experience.

&#160;

Governmental Regulations

&#160;

Mineral development and exploration activities are subject to various national, state/provincial, and local laws and regulations, which govern prospecting, development, mining, production, exports, taxes, labor standards, occupational health, waste disposal, protection of the environment, mine safety, hazardous substances and other matters. Similarly, if any of our properties are developed and/or mined those activities are also subject to significant governmental regulation and oversight. We are required to obtain the licenses, permits and other authorizations in order to conduct our exploration programs.

&#160;

Environmental Regulations

&#160;

Our current and planned activities are subject to various national and local laws and regulations governing protection of the environment. These laws are continually changing and, in general, are becoming more restrictive. We attempt to conduct our exploration business in a way that safeguards public health and the environment. We are required to conduct our operations in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Changes to current state or federal laws and regulations in each jurisdiction in which we conduct our exploration activities could, in the future, require additional capital expenditures and increased operating and/or reclamation costs. Although we are unable to predict what additional legislation, if any, might be proposed or enacted, additional regulatory requirements could impact the economics of our projects. During 2015, we had no material environmental incidents or non-compliance with any applicable environmental regulations.

&#160;

Mineral Properties - General

&#160;

We have been involved in the exploration for minerals in the United States and Latin America, focusing on precious and base metals, including gold, silver, platinum, palladium, copper, lead and zinc. We have held concessions in Peru since 1993 and Brazil since 2000. During 2004 we began a reconnaissance exploration program in Mexico and acquired mineral interests there in 2005. During 2013 we significantly reduced our exploration activities in Peru and Mexico, and in 2015 we terminated all of our activities in Brazil. We no longer have any active employees in any of those countries, and our exploration activities consist of care and maintenance of our existing exploration projects in Peru and Mexico through the use of contract geologists and oversight of our joint ventures that are managed by our partners.
