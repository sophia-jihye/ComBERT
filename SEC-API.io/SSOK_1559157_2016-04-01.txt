Background 

&#160; 

The Company has limited operating history and is expected to experience losses in the near term. The Company&#8217;s independent auditors have issued a report raising substantial doubt about the Company&#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern. 

&#160; 

Summary 

&#160; 

The Company operates a deep discount variety retail store under the name &#8220;Dollar Green Stores&#8221; (&#8220;dollar stores&#8221;) in Sacramento and intends to expand throughout California to bring in additional revenue streams from the high demand for such stores. 

&#160; 

In September 2013, the Company&#8217;s management developed plans to open and operate two retail stores in Sacramento, California, under the named &#8220;Dollar Green Stores.&#8221; In February 2014, the Company opened its first dollar store in Sacramento, which consists of more than 2,200 square feet of retail store space. The Company opened its second dollar store in May 2014. In August 2014, the Company was forced to close its original store due to its landlord&#8217;s failure to comply with city building codes. The Company relocated the second store in December 2015 and settled the existing lease at that time. Therefore, the Company currently operates one retail store. 

&#160; 

Additionally, the Company began trading precious metals in December 2014 with the purchase 100 ounces of silver. The Company has since purchased gold and is evaluating potentially expanding its ownership of additional precious metals. Though management has limited experience in the precious metals field they have solicited outside experts to contribute to the Company&#8217;s investment strategies. 

&#160; 

The Company also has plans to acquire and operate hotels and residential properties in the high demand areas of California such as Southern California and the Bay Area. The Company entered into an agreement in 2015 but was not successful in completing the transaction and is currently seeking other opportunities in 2016. 

&#160; 

The Business: Discount Retail Stores 

&#160; 

The Company owns and operates a discount retail store and expects to expand to add additional dollar store retail locations in strategic locations throughout northern California. These strategic locations will be areas currently underserved by the dollar store channel. 

&#160; 

According to Deloitte&#8217;s general publication &#8220;Dollar Store Strategies for National Brands,&#8221; as the stigma of dollar store shopping wanes, the dollar store channel has developed into a booming, $55.6 million industry in the United States. Through its discount retail stores segment, the Company intends to offer a broad selection of merchandise, including consumable products such as food, paper and cleaning products, bathroom and kitchen cleaners, personal grooming products such as soap, hair products, as well as pet supplies, and non-consumable products such as seasonal merchandise, home d&#233;cor and domestics, and apparel. The Company intends to stock its retail stores with high quality national brands from leading manufacturers, as well as comparable quality private brand selections with prices at substantial discounts to national brands. 

&#160; 

According to a 2012 Supermarket News survey conducted in June of 2012, dollar stores sit in prime position to provide great value for everyday items such as cleaning products, personal grooming and many other personal items. The survey quotes one respondent saying that &#8220;Dollar stores are capturing paper products and cleaning products away from supermarkets, especially in small markets.&#8221; Dry food products, snacks, balloons, toys, holiday decorations, reading glasses and other popular items are also a factor in the popularity of dollar stores. 

&#160; 

The retail landscape for food, beverage, personal goods, and household goods is evolving rapidly as the range of retail formats expands and consumer preferences change. In the United States, consumers have a vast array of retail choices to purchase their preferred brands and products. For example, some brands are so ubiquitous that the identical product stock-keeping unit (SKU) is available at grocery stores, mass merchandisers, club stores, drug stores, and convenience stores, all within walking distance of each other. Each consumer has a distinct set of stores they shop at, a cadence with which they visit, and a unique selection of products they tend to purchase. Some consumers actively shop across channels comparing prices and offerings. Other consumers primarily shop at a small set of stores, or a single store. Furthermore, each retailer, and often store location, has a specific set of consumer segments they target.

&#160; 

The Business: Hotel and Residential Properties 

&#160; 

The Company believes the hotel industry accounts for a significant part of the overall economy. The industry is highly segmented with many different brands targeting a vast range of customer needs at various price points. Businesses in the hotel industry generally operate under one or more business models, including hotel management, brand franchising and hotel ownership. Hotels are categorized into three groups: full-service, select-service and limited-service. Full-service hotels typically offer a full range of amenities and facilities, including food and beverage facilities and meeting facilities. Select-service hotels furnish some of the amenities offered at full-service hotels but on a smaller scale and generally do not to have meeting facilities. Limited-service hotels usually offer only lodging, however some provide modest food and beverage facilities such as breakfast buffets or small meeting rooms. 

&#160; 

Lodging demand growth is generally related to the strength of the overall economy. Additionally, local demand factors may stimulate business and leisure travel to specific locations. In particular, macroeconomic trends relating to GDP growth, corporate profits, capital investments and employment growth are some of the primary drivers of lodging demand. As the economy continues to improve, the ongoing trend of strong transient demand and growing group business will continue to drive demand for hotels and lodging and allow the industry to achieve increased growth. 

&#160; 

The Market 

&#160; 

The dollar channel is a $55.6 billion industry in the United States. The recent recession and post-recessionary shopping habits have made dollar stores a frequent channel for more consumers&#8212;of all incomes. Dollar stores appeal to primarily low- and fixed-income consumers; however, a growing segment of shoppers are high-income consumers, as the stigma of dollar stores seems to be waning. Across consumer segments, dollar-store shopping trips appear to be expanding from merely a fill-in or occasional targeted purchase to a grocery or mass merchandise substitute. To some extent, the growth of dollar stores&#8212;in particular multi-price-point dollar stores, where the price of most products exceeds one dollar&#8212;is at the expense of mass merchandisers and grocery channels. 

&#160; 

This growth in dollar stores is faster than traditional channels, particularly in the sales of personal goods, household goods, food, and beverages. Dollar stores typically offer more variety in food and beverage (including national brands) and the consumer perception of store brand quality improves. 

&#160; 

The hotel industry globally and in the United States has improved as the economy has recovered over the past few years. According to the STR Global Census, October 2013 (adjusted to September 2013), U.S. hotel demand has grown at a compound annual growth (&#8220;CAGR&#8221;) rate of 4.9% over the past three years. Hotel supply has lagged at a CAGR of just 0.9%. The Company believes there is ample room to enter this market and that barriers for entry remain relatively low. 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s Presence in the Market 

&#160; 

The Company has targeted strategic locations in northern California that are currently underserved by the dollar store channel. It currently operates one deep discount retail store location in Sacramento, California. The Company plans to grow organically as a participant in the discount retail store industry. The Company will benefit from further expanding its operations and developing its economy of scale, expanding its brand recognition and customer loyalty and increasing its knowledge of industry operations, thereby allowing the Company to optimize its future operations and progressively develop future projects to reach their full potential.

&#160;

&#160; 

Although the Company intends to begin trading precious metals and has begun acquiring and evaluating potential positions in the market, it does not currently have a presence in the trade of such metals. Likewise, the Company currently has no presence in the hotel or residential property marketplace. It intends to acquire such properties in the near future, thereby establishing a footprint in the market. 

&#160; 

The Business: Precious Metals 

&#160; 

Silver and other precious metals, may be used as an investment. A traditional way of investing in silver is by buying actual bullion bars. In some countries, like Switzerland and Liechtenstein, bullion bars can be bought or sold over the counter at major banks. Another means of buying and trading silver is through silver coins. Silver coins include the one ounce 99.99% pure Canadian Silver Maple Leaf and the one ounce 99.93% pure American Silver Eagle. Likewise, an increasing popular method of trading in silver and precious metals is through exchange-traded products, such as exchange-traded funds, exchange-traded notes and closed-end funds that aim to track the price of silver. Silver exchange-traded products are traded on the major stock exchanges including the London and New York Stock Exchanges. 

&#160; 

The Company believes that stimulative monetary policies adopted by the United States, the European Union, China and Japan may cause an increase in inflation. Gold and silver have traditionally served as a hedge against economic uncertainty and high inflation. 

&#160; 

At the present time, the Company does not anticipate or foresee a material effect on this line of its business from existing or probable governmental regulations. 

&#160; 

Services and Products 

&#160; 

The Company plans to operate discount retail stores in the basic consumer goods market. Such consumable goods include packaged food comprised of cereals, canned soups, milk, eggs, vegetables, frozen and refrigerated foods, candies, cookies, crackers, salty snacks, carbonated beverages, over-the-counter medicines and personal care products, such as soap, body wash, shampoo, dental hygiene, as well as skin, and foot care products. The Company intends to offer additional products including gifts, party goods, toys, batteries, small electronics, greeting cards, pet supplies, pet food, gardening supplies, durable housewares, kitchen supplies, cookware, consumables, such as paper, plastics, household chemicals, and other items, including seasonal goods, such as Easter, Halloween, and Christmas merchandise. 

&#160; 

The Company has begun to establish positions in precious metals and intends to begin trading such metals. Currently, the Company has acquired 21,000 ounces of silver and a small amount of gold. 

&#160; 

The Company has yet to identify and acquire hotel or residential properties. Currently, the Company is working with PKF Capital and other commercial brokers to identify potential hotel properties for purchase. Prospective properties include medium-sized hotels and residential apartment complexes. 

&#160; 

Pricing 

&#160; 

At the moment, the Company&#8217;s business is in the dollar store retail sector. Thus, most products are priced at 99 cents or less. However, about 20% of the products offered at the 2,700 square feet store are priced over $1.00 due to customer requests for specific products. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s discount retail stores are part of a highly competitive industry. The basic consumer packaged goods market encompasses discount stores and many other retailers, including mass merchandise, grocery, drug, convenience, variety and other specialty stores. The Company&#8217;s direct competitors will include retail companies such as &#8216;Dollar General&#8217;, &#8216;Family Dollar&#8217;, &#8216;Dollar Tree&#8217;, and &#8217;99 Cent Only Store&#8217; to the extent that these competitors are within a similar geographic area to the Company&#8217;s stores. These competitors may have greater financial and other resources than does the Company. 

&#160; 

&#160; 5 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

The Company intends to differentiate itself from other forms of discount retail stores by targeting low to middle-class consumers in strategic locations in northern California currently underserved by the dollar store channel. 

&#160; 

If the Company does enter the hotel and or residential property industry, it will encounter significant competition from other hotel, residential and resort owners and operators. Primary competitors would include branded and independent hotel operating companies, national and international hotel brands and ownership companies. 

&#160; 

Strategic Partners and Suppliers 

&#160; 

The Company believes that strategic partnerships will be a major component of the Company&#8217;s operating strategy and path to success. The Company hopes to work with several strategic partners in important areas of its business and operations. However, currently, the Company has no such strategic partners. 

&#160; 

The Company entered into a Purchase Agreement with Dollar Store Services, Inc. in October 2013. The Company worked with Dollar Store Services, Inc. to develop, design and build out its first retail storefront. 

&#160; 

Marketing Strategy 

&#160; 

The Company has conducted limited advertising and marketing to date as the primary focus of the Company since inception has been to concentrate on beginning its construction and development efforts. The Company has, however, given substantial attention to constructing the marketing strategy and plans that it will use once its project enters the marketplace. The Company plans to market its Dollar Stores through newspaper advertisement and low cost promotional campaigns. 

&#160; 

Operations 

&#160; 

The Company believes that presentation of the stores and customer service are important factors in each customer&#8217;s experience. Therefore, the Company&#8217;s personnel regularly check the stores to ensure items are appropriately placed and aisles are organized. The stores are maintained to provide a clean, convenient shopping experience and employees offer friendly, knowledgeable customer service. 

&#160; 

Sales Strategy 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s management has handpicked the products in the stores to offer quality products priced at 99 cents or less. Compared to other dollar stores, the Company offers newer inventory and approximately one and a half times more inventory per square foot than other dollar stores. The Company also incentivizes larger purchases by offering customers a 10% discount if they spend more than $50.00 before tax. 

&#160; 

Revenues and Losses 

&#160; 

Since its inception, the Company has focused its efforts on conducting market research and development, and has devoted little attention or resources to sales and marketing or generating near-term revenues and profits. The Company has limited revenues to date and has not realized any profits as of yet. In order to succeed, the Company needs to develop a viable strategy to market its Dollar Stores and hotels and residential properties once they have been acquired and developed. 

&#160; 

The Company has posted limited revenues from operations based on customer sales at its discount retail stores. The Company posted revenues of approximately $69,000 and $166,000 during the years ending December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. 

&#160; 

The Company has not generated profits and has posted net losses since inception. The Company posted net losses of ($346,763) for the year ended 2014 and ($202,031) for the year ended December 31, 2015.

THE COMPANY 

&#160; 

Change of Control 

&#160; 

The Company was incorporated in the State of Delaware in July 2012, and was formerly known as Sandgate Acquisition Corporation. In July 2013, the Company implemented a change of control by issuing shares to new shareholders, redeeming shares of existing shareholders, electing new officers and directors and accepting the resignations of its then existing officers and directors. In connection with the change in control, the shareholders of the Company and its board of directors unanimously approved the change of the Company&#8217;s name from Sandgate Acquisition Corporation to Sunstock, Inc. 

&#160; 

Relationship with Tiber Creek Corporation 

&#160; 

The Company previously entered into an engagement agreement with Tiber Creek Corporation, a Delaware corporation (&#8220;Tiber Creek&#8221;), whereby Tiber Creek would provide assistance to the Company in effecting transactions for the Company to combine with a public reporting company, including: transferring control of such reporting company to the Company; preparing the business combination agreement; effecting the business combination; causing the preparation and filing of forms, including a registration statement, with the Securities and Exchange Commission; assist in listing its securities on a trading exchange; and assist in establishing and maintaining relationships with market makers and broker-dealers. 

&#160; 

Under the agreement, Tiber Creek is entitled to receive cash fees from the Company. In addition, the Company&#8217;s then-current shareholders, Tiber Creek and MB Americus, LLC, a California limited liability company (&#8220;MB Americus&#8221;), were permitted to retain the aggregate total of 500,000 shares. 

&#160; 

In general, Tiber Creek holds interests in inactive Delaware corporations which may be used by issuers (such as the Company) to reincorporate their business in the State of Delaware and capitalize the issuer at a level and in a manner (i.e. the number of authorized shares and rights and preferences of shareholders) that is appropriate for a public company. Otherwise, these corporations are inactive, and Tiber Creek does not conduct any business in such corporations. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

Currently, the Company has one employee that receives Compensation and Benefits. This employee has agreed to work for the Company for one year (2015) as a full-time employee, and the Company has agreed to pay the employee 120,000 shares of common stock, an agreement for the year 2016 has not been agreed upon to this date.
