 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

Overview 

Innoviva, Inc. ("Innoviva", the "Company", the "Registrant" or "we" and other similar pronouns) is focused on bringing compelling new medicines to patients in areas of unmet need by leveraging its significant expertise in the development, commercialization and financial management of bio-pharmaceuticals. Innoviva's portfolio is anchored by the respiratory assets partnered with Glaxo Group Limited ("GSK"), including RELVAR &#174; /BREO &#174; ELLIPTA &#174; (fluticasone furoate/ vilanterol, "FF/VI") and ANORO&#174; ELLIPTA &#174; (umeclidinium bromide/ vilanterol, "UMEC/VI"). Under the Long-Acting Beta 2 Agonist ("LABA") Collaboration Agreement and the Strategic Alliance Agreement with GSK (referred to herein collectively as the "GSK Agreements"), we are entitled to receive annual royalties from GSK on sales of RELVAR&#174;/BREO&#174; ELLIPTA&#174; as follows: 15% on the first $3.0 billion of annual global net sales and 5% for all annual global net sales above $3.0 billion. For other products combined with a LABA from the LABA collaboration, such as ANORO&#153; ELLIPTA&#153;, royalties are upward tiering and range from 6.5% to 10%. Innoviva is also entitled to 15% of any future payments made by GSK under its agreements originally entered into with us, and since assigned to Theravance Respiratory Company, LLC ("TRC"), relating to the combination FF/UMEC/VI and the Bifunctional Muscarinic Antagonist-Beta 2 Agonist ("MABA") program, as monotherapy and in combination with other therapeutically active components under the LABA Collaboration Agreement, which has been assigned to TRC other than RELVAR&#174;/BREO&#174;ELLIPTA&#174; and ANORO&#174; ELLIPTA&#174;. We do not manufacture or sell any of the products commercialized under the GSK Agreements, as it is the exclusive responsibility of GSK. 

Our headquarters are located at 951 Gateway Boulevard, South San Francisco, California 94080. Innoviva was incorporated in Delaware in November 1996 under the name Advanced Medicine, Inc. and began operations in May 1997. The Company changed its name to Theravance, Inc. in April 2002. In June 2014, we spun-off our research and development activities by distributing the outstanding shares of Theravance Biopharma, Inc. ("Theravance BioPharma") on a pro-rata basis to our stockholders (the "Spin-Off"), which resulted in Theravance Biopharma becoming an independent, publicly traded company. Following a rebranding exercise, we changed our name to Innoviva, Inc. in January 2016. 

Our Strategy 

Innoviva uniquely combines deep pharmaceutical industry expertise and strategic financial management with the goal of maximizing the commercial potential and royalties we receive from our partnered pharmaceutical products. By channeling our significant expertise in the key field of pharmaceutical medicines&#151;including product development, commercialization, and financial strategy&#151;Innoviva seeks to become a major partner in the delivery of compelling new medicines that impact public health. We plan to leverage our unique industry knowledge and capabilities to identify medicines that have the potential to improve the lives of patients. This patient-centric approach is central to how Innoviva operates and collaborates with a partner to advance the availability of crucial medicines and treatments. Our corporate strategy is focused on stockholder returns by: 

1. Maximizing the potential value of our respiratory assets partnered with GSK; 2. Providing capital returns to our stockholders through dividends or share repurchases; 3. Reducing our overall corporate cost of capital; and 4. Building a long-term recurring revenue business. 4 

Our Relationship with GSK 

LABA Collaboration 

In November 2002, we entered into our LABA Collaboration Agreement with GSK to develop and commercialize once-daily LABA products for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ("COPD") and asthma. For the treatment of COPD, the collaboration has developed two combination products: (1) RELVAR&#174;/BREO&#174; ELLIPTA&#174; (FF/VI) (BREO &#174; ELLIPTA &#174; is the proprietary name in the U.S. and Canada and RELVAR&#174; ELLIPTA&#174; is the proprietary name outside the U.S. and Canada), a once-daily combination medicine consisting of a LABA, vilanterol (VI), and an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS), fluticasone furoate (FF) and (2) ANORO&#174; ELLIPTA&#174; (UMEC/VI), a once-daily medicine combining a long-acting muscarinic antagonist ("LAMA"), umeclidinium bromide (UMEC), with a LABA, VI. Under the LABA Collaboration Agreement, GSK and Innoviva are exploring various paths to create triple therapy medications. GSK is now responsible for all direct research and development activities associated with the collaboration. We are also eligible to receive the associated royalty revenues from VI monotherapy, if approved and commercialized. However, GSK has recently notified us of their intent to discontinue the development of VI monotherapy following continued delays in the program, and, as such, we do not expect to receive future revenues from that product. 

As a result of the launch and approval of RELVAR&#174;/BREO&#174; ELLIPTA&#174; and ANORO&#174; ELLIPTA&#174; in the U.S., Japan and Europe, we paid milestone fees to GSK totaling $220.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2014. Although we have no further milestone payment obligations to GSK pursuant to the LABA Collaboration Agreement, we continue to have ongoing management obligations as part of the collaboration, including certain development and commercialization activities that are expected to continue over the life of the agreements. The milestone fees paid to GSK were recognized as capitalized fees paid to a related party, which are being amortized over their estimated useful lives commencing upon the commercial launch of the product. 

We are entitled to receive annual royalties from GSK on sales of RELVAR&#174;/BREO&#174; ELLIPTA&#174; as follows: 15% on the first $3.0 billion of annual global net sales and 5% for all annual global net sales above $3.0 billion. For other products combined with a LABA from the LABA collaboration, such as ANORO&#153; ELLIPTA&#153;, royalties are upward tiering and range from 6.5% to 10%. 

2004 Strategic Alliance 

In March 2004, we entered into the Strategic Alliance Agreement with GSK where GSK received an option to license exclusive development and commercialization rights to product candidates from certain of our discovery programs on pre-determined terms and on an exclusive, worldwide basis. In 2005, GSK licensed our MABA program for the treatment of COPD, and in October 2011, we and GSK expanded the MABA program by adding six additional Innoviva-discovered preclinical MABA compounds (the "Additional MABAs"). The development program is funded in full by GSK and is currently in Phase II clinical studies. As a result of the transactions effected by the Spin-Off, we are only entitled to receive 15% of any contingent payments and royalties payable by GSK from sales of FF/UMEC/VI (and MABA, and MABA/FF) while Theravance Biopharma receives 85% of those same payments. 

Agreements Entered into with GSK in Connection with the Spin-Off 

On March 3, 2014, in contemplation of the Spin-Off, we, Theravance Biopharma and GSK entered into a series of agreements clarifying how the companies would implement the Spin-Off and operate following the Spin-Off. We, Theravance Biopharma and GSK entered into a three-way master agreement providing for GSK's consent to the Spin-Off provided certain conditions were met. Pursuant to a three-way master agreement entered into by and among us, Theravance Biopharma and GSK in connection with the Spin-Off, we agreed to withhold a certain number of Theravance Biopharma shares 

from the taxable dividend of Theravance Biopharma shares to GSK. We sold all of these shares in Theravance Biopharma during the first quarter of 2015. 

The amendments to the GSK Agreements do not change the economics or royalty rates under the GSK Agreements, though the assignment of the Strategic Alliance Agreement and portions of the LABA Collaboration Agreement to TRC do change how the economics are allocated between Theravance Biopharma and us. The amendments to the GSK Agreements do provide that GSK's diligent efforts obligations regarding commercialization matters under both agreements will change upon regulatory approval in either the United States or the European Union (the "EU") of FF/UMEC/VI or a MABA in combination with FF. Upon such regulatory approval, GSK's diligent efforts obligations as to commercialization matters under the GSK Agreements will have the objective of focusing on the best interests of patients and maximizing the net value of the overall portfolio of products under the GSK Agreements. Since GSK's commercialization efforts following such regulatory approval will be guided by a portfolio approach across products in which we will retain our full interests upon the Spin-Off and also products in which we have retained only a portion of our interests following the Spin-Off, GSK's commercialization efforts may have the effect of reducing the overall value of our remaining interests in the GSK Agreements following the Spin-Off. 

Purchases of Common Stock by GSK 

Prior to 2015, affiliates of GSK purchased an aggregate of 31.6 million shares of our common stock. During 2015, GSK purchased 424,081 shares of our common stock pursuant to its periodic "top-up" rights under our Amended and Restated Governance Agreement, dated as of June 4, 2004, as amended, among us, GSK and certain GSK affiliates, for an aggregate purchase price of $6.5 million. GSK's periodic "top-up" rights terminated with the expiration of the Governance Agreement in September 2015. As of February 16, 2016, GSK beneficially owned approximately 28.1% of our outstanding capital stock. 

Recent Highlights 

&#149; In January 2016, we announced our corporate name change from Theravance, Inc. to Innoviva, Inc. &#149; Royalty revenues earned from sales of RELVAR&#174;/BREO&#174; ELLIPTA&#174; and ANORO&#174; ELLIPTA&#174; in 2015 grew to $66.9 million, up 263% compared to 2014, &#149; In the fourth quarter of 2015, net sales of RELVAR&#174;/BREO&#174; ELLIPTA&#174; by GSK were $154.7 million, comprised of $72.5 million in the U.S. market (an increase 79 percent from the prior quarter in the U.S.) and $82.2 million in non-U.S. markets (an increase of 43 percent from the prior quarter). &#149; As of December 31, 2015, RELVAR&#174;/BREO&#174; ELLIPTA&#174; has been launched in 45 countries. &#149; In the fourth quarter of 2015, sales of ANORO&#174; ELLIPTA&#174; by GSK were $45.4 million, an increase of 44 percent compared to the prior quarter. Sales were $31.2 million in the U.S. market (an increase of 42 percent from the prior quarter) and $14.2 million in non-U.S. markets (an increase of 48 percent from the prior quarter). &#149; As of December 31, 2015, ANORO&#174; ELLIPTA&#174; has been launched in 38 countries. &#149; Through January 29, 2016, we repurchased $37.3 million of stock under our previously announced $150 million share repurchase program through a combination of a "modified Dutch auction" tender offer (completed in December 2015) and open market purchases, with an average purchase price of $9.49 per share. 6 

Manufacturing 

Manufacturing of RELVAR&#174;/BREO&#174; ELLIPTA&#174; (FF/VI) and ANORO&#153; ELLIPTA&#153; (UMEC/VI) and for the MABA program is performed by GSK. 

Government Regulation 

The development and commercialization of products and product candidates pursuant to the GSK Agreements are subject to extensive regulation by governmental authorities in the United States and other countries. Before marketing in the United States, any medicine must undergo rigorous preclinical studies and clinical studies and an extensive regulatory approval process implemented by the FDA. Outside the United States, the ability to market a product depends upon receiving a marketing authorization from the appropriate regulatory authorities. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical studies, marketing authorization, pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. In any country, the commercialization of medicines is permitted only if the appropriate regulatory authority is satisfied that our collaborative partner has presented adequate evidence of the safety, quality and efficacy of such medicines. 

Once a product is approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-marketing regulatory standards is not maintained or if safety or quality issues are identified after the product reaches the marketplace. In addition, the FDA may require post-marketing studies, referred to as Phase 4 studies, to monitor the effect of approved products, and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies. The FDA has broad post-market regulatory and enforcement powers, including the ability to suspend or delay issuance of approvals, seize products, withdraw approvals, enjoin violations, and institute criminal prosecution. 

If regulatory approval for a medicine is obtained, the clearance to market the product will be limited to those diseases and conditions for which the medicine is effective, as demonstrated through clinical studies and included in the medicine's labeling. Even if this regulatory approval is obtained, a marketed medicine, its manufacturer and its manufacturing facilities are subject to continual review and periodic inspections by the FDA. The FDA ensures the quality of approved medicines by carefully monitoring manufacturers' compliance with its cGMP regulations. The cGMP regulations for drugs contain minimum requirements for the methods, facilities, and controls used in manufacturing, processing, and packaging of a medicine. The regulations are intended to make sure that a medicine is safe for use, and that it has the ingredients and strength it claims to have. Discovery of previously unknown problems with a medicine, manufacturer or facility may result in restrictions on the medicine or manufacturer, including costly recalls or withdrawal of the medicine from the market. 

We and our collaborative partner are also subject to various laws and regulations regarding laboratory practices, the experimental use of animals and the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances in connection with the development and commercialization of products and product candidates. In each of these areas, as above, the FDA and other regulatory authorities have broad regulatory and enforcement powers, including the ability to suspend or delay issuance of approvals, seize products, withdraw approvals, enjoin violations, and institute criminal prosecution, any one or more of which could have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Outside the United States, our collaborative partner's ability to market partnered products will also depend on receiving marketing authorizations from the appropriate regulatory authorities. Risks similar to those associated with FDA approval described above exist with the regulatory approval processes in other countries. 

Patents and Proprietary Rights 

We and our collaborative partner will be able to protect our partnered technology from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that such technology is covered by valid and enforceable patents or is effectively maintained as trade secrets. Our success in the future will depend in part on us and our collaborative partner obtaining patent protection for our partnered products and product candidates. Accordingly, patents and other proprietary rights are essential elements of our business. 

For proprietary know-how that is not patentable, processes for which patents are difficult to enforce and any other elements of our business that involve proprietary know-how and technology that is not covered by patent applications, we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect our interests. We require all of our employees, consultants and advisors to enter into confidentiality agreements. Where it is necessary to share our proprietary information or data with outside parties, our policy is to make available only that information and data required to accomplish the desired purpose and only pursuant to a duty of confidentiality on the part of those parties. 

As of December 31, 2015, we owned 32 issued United States patents and 173 granted foreign patents, as well as additional pending United States patent applications and foreign patent applications. The claims in these various patents and patent applications are directed to compositions of matter, including claims covering product candidates, lead compounds and key intermediates, pharmaceutical compositions, methods of use and processes for making our compounds. 

United States issued patents and foreign patents generally expire 20 years after filing. Nevertheless, issued patents can be challenged, narrowed, invalidated or circumvented, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing similar products and threaten our ability to commercialize our product candidates. Our patent position, similar to other companies in our industry, is generally uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions. To maintain our proprietary position, we will need to obtain effective claims and enforce these claims once granted. It is possible that, before any of our products can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force only for a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing any advantage of the patent. Also, we do not know whether any of our patent applications will result in any issued patents or, if issued, whether the scope of the issued claims will be sufficient to protect our proprietary position. 

Competition 

We anticipate that RELVAR&#174;/BREO&#174; ELLIPTA&#174; (FF/VI) and ANORO&#174; ELLIPTA&#174; (UMEC/VI), will compete with a number of approved bronchodilator drugs and drug candidates under development that are designed to treat asthma and COPD. These include but are not limited to: 

&#149; Advair&#174;/Seretide&#153; (salmeterol and fluticasone proprionate as a combination) marketed by GSK, &#149; Symbicort&#174; (formoterol and budesonide as a combination) marketed by AstraZeneca, &#149; Spiriva&#174; (tiotropium) marketed by Boehringer Ingelheim, &#149; Dulera&#174; (formoterol and mometasone as a combination) marketed by Merck, &#149; Tudorza &#174; (aclidinium) marketed by AstraZeneca and Seebri&#174; (glycopyrronium) were also launched in the year ended December 31, 2012 (Seebri, ex-U.S.), &#149; Incruse&#174; (umeclidinium) and Arnuity&#174; (fluticasone furoate), launched in January 2015 by GSK in the U.S. (we are not entitled to any royalties from either product), &#149; UMEC/VI/FF being developed by GSK, &#149; Foradil&#174;/Oxis&#174; (formoterol) marketed by a number of companies, 8 

&#149; Striverdi&#174; Respimat&#174; (olodaterol) marketed by Boehringer Ingelheim, &#149; Onbrez&#174;/Arcapta&#174; (indacaterol) marketed by Novartis, &#149; Ultibro&#174;/ Ultibron&#174;, (indacaterol combined with the LAMA glycopyrronium bromide) developed by Novartis and approved and launched in Europe and Japan in the year ended December 31, 2013 as a once-daily treatment for COPD. In the U.S., the product was approved in October 2015 at a lower strength and as a twice-daily COPD treatment, &#149; Stiolto (U.S.)/Spiolto (E.U.) approved in mid-2015, consists of the LAMA tiotropium combined with the LABA olodaterol, marketed by Boehringer Ingelheim for the treatment of COPD, &#149; Duaklir&#174; Genuair&#174; (consisting of the LAMA aclidinium bromide and LABA formoterol fumarate), developed by AstraZeneca and approved in November 2014 in the EU as a maintenance bronchodilator treatment for COPD, &#149; Indacaterol in combination with an ICS (mometasone), being developed by Novartis for markets outside the U.S., and &#149; Formoterol combined with the LAMA glycopyrronium pMDI is reported by AstraZeneca to be in phase III for the treatment of COPD. In addition, several firms are developing new formulations of Advair/Seretide (salmeterol /fluticasone proprionate) and Symbicort (formoterol fumerate/budesonide) which may be marketed as generics or branded generics relative to the existing products from GSK and AstraZeneca, respectively. All of these efforts represent potential competition for any of our partnered products. Efforts have intensified following the publication of FDA draft guidance for the approval of fully substitutable versions of Advair and Symbicort in late 2013 and mid-2015 respectively. Current examples of these products include the marketed products Duoresp/Biresp from Teva (generic Symbicort), AirFluSal Forspiro by Sandoz, Rolenium by Elpen and Sirdupla by Mylan (all generic Advair) which are all available in a wide number of countries in the E.U. In the US, several competitors are attempting to gain market authorization for a generic version of Advair in the next one to two years. Chief among these are Mylan and Sandoz (Mylan confirmed filing of an ANDA with USFDA for their product in December 2015), Vectura and Roxane who own the U.S. rights to AirFluSal, and Teva who is developing both a fully substitutable and non-substitutable generic Advair that are expected to be filed in the next one to two years. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015, we had 13 employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. We consider our employee relations to be good.
