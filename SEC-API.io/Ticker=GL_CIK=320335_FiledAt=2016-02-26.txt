Health Insurance 

&#160; 

Torchmark offers limited-benefit supplemental health insurance products that include primarily critical illness and accident plans. These policies are designed to supplement health coverage that applicants already own. Medicare Supplements are also offered to enrollees in the traditional fee-for-service Medicare program. Medicare Supplement plans are standardized by federal regulation and are designed to pay deductibles and co-payments not paid by Medicare. 

On February 4, 2016, Torchmark announced that management has committed to a plan to sell its Medicare Part D business during the calendar year 2016. Torchmark no longer wishes to emphasize its Medicare Part D business due to declining margins, increased risks, higher drug costs, and increased administrative and compliance costs. Management believes this sale will allow the Company to better focus on its core protection life and health insurance businesses. As the historical results for the Medicare Part D business are accounted for as discontinued operations, all business results and relevant forward looking statements of the Company are reported as continuing operations. For further discussion of the disposition of the Medicare Part D business, see Note 6&#8212;Discontinued Operations &#32;in the &#32;Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Annuities 

&#160; 

Annuity products include single-premium and flexible-premium deferred annuities. Annuities in each of the three years ended December 31, 2015 &#32;comprised less than 1% of premium. 

&#160; 

Pricing 

&#160; 

Premium rates for life and health insurance products are established using assumptions as to future mortality, morbidity, persistency, and expenses. These assumptions are based on Company experience and projected investment earnings. Revenues for individual life and health insurance products are primarily derived from premium income, and, to a lesser extent, through policy charges to the policyholder account values on annuity products and certain individual life products. Profitability is affected to the extent actual experience deviates from the assumptions made in pricing and to the extent investment income varies from that which is required for policy reserves. 

&#160; 

Collections for annuity products and certain life products are not recognized as revenues but are added to policyholder account values. Revenues from these products are derived from charges to the account balances for insurance risk and administrative costs. Profits are earned to the extent these revenues exceed actual costs. Profits are also earned from investment income on the deposits invested in excess of the amounts credited to policyholder accounts. 

Underwriting 

&#160; 

The underwriting standards of each Torchmark insurance subsidiary are established by management. Each subsidiary uses information from the application and, in some cases, telephone interviews with applicants, inspection reports, pharmacy data, doctors&#8217; statements and/or medical examinations to determine whether a policy should be issued in accordance with the application, with a different rating, with a rider, with reduced coverage or rejected. 

&#160; 

Index to Financial Statements 

Reserves 

&#160; 

The life insurance policy reserves reflected in Torchmark&#8217;s financial statements as future policy benefits are calculated based on generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). These reserves, with premiums to be received in the future and the interest thereon compounded annually at assumed rates, must be sufficient to cover policy and contract obligations as they mature. Generally, the mortality and persistency assumptions used in the calculations of reserves are based on Company experience. Similar reserves are held on most of the health policies written by Torchmark&#8217;s insurance subsidiaries, since these policies generally are issued on a guaranteed-renewable basis. The assumptions used in the calculation of Torchmark&#8217;s reserves are reported in Note 1&#8212;Significant Accounting Policies in the &#32;Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. &#32;Reserves for annuity products and certain life products consist of the policyholders&#8217; account values and are increased by policyholder deposits and interest credited and are decreased by policy charges and benefit payments. 

&#160; 

Investments 

&#160; 

The nature, quality, and percentage mix of insurance company investments are regulated by state laws. The investments of Torchmark insurance subsidiaries consist predominantly of high-quality, investment-grade securities. Fixed maturities represented 96% &#32;of total investments at fair value at December 31, 2015 . ( See &#32; Note 4&#8212;Investments &#32;&#32;in the &#32;Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements &#32;and Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis . ) 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

Torchmark competes with other insurance carriers through policyholder service, price, product design, and sales efforts. While there are insurance companies competing with Torchmark, no individual company dominates any of Torchmark&#8217;s life or health markets. 

&#160; 

Torchmark&#8217;s health insurance products compete with, in addition to the products of other health insurance carriers, health maintenance organizations, preferred provider organizations, and other health care-related institutions which provide medical benefits based on contractual agreements. 

&#160; 

Management believes Torchmark companies operate at lower policy acquisition and administrative expense levels than peer companies. This allows Torchmark to have competitive rates while maintaining higher underwriting margins. 

&#160; 

Regulation 

&#160; 

Insurance. Insurance companies are subject to regulation and supervision in the states in which they do business. The laws of the various states establish agencies with broad administrative and supervisory powers which include, among other things, granting and revoking licenses to transact business, regulating trade practices, licensing agents, approving policy forms, approving certain premium rates, setting minimum reserve and loss ratio requirements, determining the form and content of required financial statements, and prescribing the type and amount of investments permitted. They are also required to file detailed annual reports with supervisory agencies, and records of their business are subject to examination at any time. Under the rules of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC), insurance companies are examined periodically by one or more of the supervisory agencies. 

Risk Based Capital. The NAIC requires a risk based capital formula be applied to all life and health insurers. The risk based capital formula is a threshold formula rather than a target capital formula. It is designed only to identify companies that require regulatory attention and is not to be used to rate or rank companies that are adequately capitalized. All Torchmark insurance subsidiaries are more than adequately capitalized under the risk based capital formula. 

&#160; 

Guaranty Assessments. State guaranty laws provide for assessments from insurance companies to be placed into a fund which is used, in the event of failure or insolvency of an insurance company, to fulfill the obligations of that company to its policyholders. The amount which a company is assessed is based on its proportional share of the premium in each state. Assessments are recoverable to a great extent as offsets against state premium taxes. 

&#160; 

Holding Company. States have enacted legislation requiring registration and periodic reporting by insurance companies domiciled within their respective jurisdictions that control or are controlled by other corporations so as to constitute a holding company system. Torchmark and its subsidiaries have registered as a holding company system pursuant to such legislation in Indiana, Nebraska, Ohio, and New York. 

&#160; 

Index to Financial Statements 

Insurance holding company system statutes and regulations impose various limitations on investments in subsidiaries, and may require prior regulatory approval for material transactions between insurers and affiliates and for the payment of certain dividends and other distributions. 

&#160; 

Personnel 

&#160; 

At the end of 2015 , Torchmark had 3,115 employees.
