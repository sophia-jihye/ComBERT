 Item 1. Business 

Standex International Corporation was incorporated in 1975 and is the successor of a corporation organized in 1955. As used in this report, the terms &#147;we,&#148; &#147;us,&#148; &#147;our,&#148; the &#147;Company&#148; and &#147;Standex&#148; mean Standex International Corporation and its subsidiaries. We have paid dividends each quarter since Standex became a public corporation in November 1964. 

Unless otherwise noted, references to years are to fiscal years.

We are a leading manufacturer of a variety of products and services for diverse commercial and industrial markets. We have 11 operating segments, aggregated and organized for reporting purposes into five segments: Food Service Equipment, Engraving, Engineering Technologies, Electronics and Hydraulics. Overall management, strategic development and financial control are maintained by the executive staff from our corporate headquarters located in Salem, New Hampshire. 

Our corporate long term strategy has several primary components to build larger industrial platforms through a value creation system that assists management in meeting specific corporate and business unit financial and strategic performance goals in order to create and sustain shareholder value. The Balanced Performance Plan process aligns annual goals throughout the business and provides a standard reporting, management and review process. It is focused on setting and meeting annual and quarterly targets that support our short term and long term goals. The Standex Growth Disciplines use a set of tools and processes including market maps, growth lane ways, and market tests to identify opportunities to expand the business organically and through acquisitions. Standex Operational Excellence employs a standard playbook and processes, including LEAN, to eliminate waste and improve profitability, cash flow and customer satisfaction. Finally, the Standex Talent Management is an organizational development process that provides training, development, and succession planning for our employees throughout our worldwide organization. The Standex Value Creation System provides standard tools and processes throughout Standex to deliver our business objectives:

&#183;

It is our objective to grow larger and more profitable business units through both organic initiatives and acquisitions. On an ongoing basis we identify and implement organic growth initiatives such as new product development, geographic expansion, introduction of products and technologies into new markets and applications, key accounts and strategic sales channel partners. Also, we have a long-term objective to create sizable business platforms by adding strategically aligned or &#147;bolt on&#148; acquisitions to strengthen the individual businesses, create both sales and cost synergies with our core business platforms, and accelerate their growth and margin improvement. We have a particular focus on identifying and investing in opportunities that complement our products and will increase the global presence and capabilities of our businesses. From time to time we have divested and likely will continue to divest businesses that we feel are not strategic or do not meet our growth and return expectations.

&#183;

We create &#147;Customer Intimacy&#148; by utilizing the Standex Growth Disciplines to partner with our customers in order to develop and deliver custom solutions or engineered components that solve problems for our customers or otherwise meet their needs. This relationship generally provides us with the ability to improve sales and profit growth over time and provide operating margins that enhance shareholder returns. Further, we have made a priority of developing new sales channels and leveraging strategic customer relationships.

&#183;

Standex Operational Excellence drives continuous improvement in the efficiency of our businesses. We recognize that our businesses are competing in a global economy that requires us to improve our competitive position. We have deployed a number of management competencies to drive improvements in the cost structure of our business units including operational excellence through lean enterprise, the use of low cost manufacturing facilities in countries such as Mexico, and China. The consolidation of manufacturing facilities to achieve economies of scale and leveraging of fixed infrastructure costs, alternate sourcing to achieve procurement cost reductions, and capital improvements to increase shop floor productivity. 

&#183;

The Company&#146;s strong historical cash flow has been a cornerstone for funding our capital allocation strategy. We use cash flow generated from operations to fund the strategic growth programs described above, (including acquisitions and investments for organic growth), and to return cash to our shareholders through payment of dividends and stock buybacks.

Our flexible design capability and global supply chain enable us to be successful in our expansion efforts. Our team is dedicated to superior customer service through our technical engineering support and on-time delivery. 

Raw Materials 

Raw materials and components necessary for the manufacture of our products are generally available from numerous sources. Generally, we are not dependent on a single source of raw materials and supplies. We do not foresee unavailability of materials or supplies which would have a significant adverse effect on any of our businesses, nor any of our segments, in the near term.

Seasonality 

We are a diversified business with generally low levels of seasonality; however, our fiscal third quarter is typically the period with the lowest level of sales volume.

Patents and Trademarks 

We hold approximately 39 United States patents and patents pending covering processes, methods and devices and approximately 43 United States trademarks. Many counterparts of these patents have also been registered in various foreign countries. In addition, we have various foreign registered and common law trademarks. 

Due to the diversity of our businesses and the markets served, the loss of any single patent or trademark would not, in our opinion, materially affect any individual segment. 

While we believe that many of our patents are important, we credit our competitive position in our niche markets to customer intimacy, engineering capabilities, manufacturing techniques and skills, marketing and sales promotions, service and the delivery of quality products. 

Customers 

Our business is not dependent upon a single customer or a few large customers, the loss of any one of which would not have a material adverse effect on our operations. No customer accounted for more than 5% of our consolidated revenue in fiscal 2016 or any of the years presented. 

Working Capital 

Our primary source of working capital is the cash generated from continuing operations. No segments require any special working capital needs outside of the normal course of business. 

Backlog 

Backlog includes all active or open orders for goods and services that have a firm fixed customer purchase order with defined delivery dates. Backlog also includes any future deliveries based on executed customer contracts, so long as such deliveries are based on agreed upon delivery schedules. Backlog is not generally a significant factor in the Company&#146;s businesses because of our relatively short delivery periods and rapid inventory turnover with the exception of Engineering Technologies. Due to the nature of long term agreements in the Engineering Technologies segment, the timing of orders and delivery dates can vary considerably resulting in significant backlog changes from one period to another.

Backlog orders in place at June 30, 2016 and 2015 are as follows (in thousands):

The backlog decrease of $8.9 million in Food Service Equipment resulted primarily from lower demand in the refrigeration markets. The increase in Electronics backlog of $6.3 million is primarily a result of the recently acquired Northlake business.

Competition 

Standex manufactures and markets products many of which have achieved a unique or leadership position in their market. However, we encounter competition in varying degrees in all product groups and for each product line. Competitors include domestic and foreign producers of the same and similar products. The principal methods of competition are product performance and technology, price, delivery schedule, quality of services, and other terms and conditions.

International Operations 

We have international operations in all of our business segments. International operations are conducted at 60 locations, in Europe, Canada, China, India, Southeast Asia, Korea, Australia, Mexico, Brazil, and South Africa. See the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for international operations financial data. Our international operations contributed approximately 27% of operating revenues in 2016 and 2015. International operations are subject to certain inherent risks in connection with the conduct of business in foreign countries including, exchange controls, price controls, limitations on participation in local enterprises, nationalizations, expropriation and other governmental action, restrictions of repatriation of earnings, and changes in currency exchange rates. 

Research and Development 

Developing new and improved products, broadening the application of established products, continuing efforts to improve our methods, processes, and equipment continues to drive our success. However, due to the nature of our manufacturing operations and the types of products manufactured, expenditures for research and development are not significant to any individual segment or in the aggregate. Research and development costs are quantified in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We develop and design new products to meet customer needs in order to offer enhanced products or to provide customized solutions for customers. 

Environmental Matters 

Based on our knowledge and current known facts, we believe that we are presently in substantial compliance with all existing applicable environmental laws and regulations and do not anticipate any instances of non-compliance that will have a material effect on our future capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. 

Financial Information about Geographic Areas 

Information regarding revenues from external customers attributed to the United States, all foreign countries and any individual foreign country, if material, is contained in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for &#147;Industry Segment Information.&#148; 

Number of Employees 

As of June 30, 2016, we employed approximately 5,300 employees of which approximately 2,100 were in the United States. About 300 of our U.S. employees were represented by unions. Approximately 44% of our production workforce is situated in low-cost manufacturing regions such as Mexico, Brazil and Asia.
