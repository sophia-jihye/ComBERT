ROXADUSTAT FOR THE TREATMENT OF ANEMIA IN CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE 

Roxadustat is an internally discovered HIF-PH inhibitor that acts by stimulating the body&#8217;s natural pathway of erythropoiesis, or red blood cell production. Roxadustat, the first HIF-PH inhibitor to enter Phase 3 clinical development, represents a new paradigm for the treatment of anemia in CKD patients, with the potential to offer a safer, more effective, more convenient and more accessible therapy than the current therapies available for anemia in CKD, such as injectable erythropoiesis stimulating agents (&#8220;ESAs&#8221;).

Roxadustat is currently in Phase 3 global development for the treatment of anemia in patients with CKD. Over 1,400 subjects have participated in 26 completed Phase 1 and 2 clinical studies for roxadustat in North America, Europe and Asia. These studies have demonstrated roxadustat&#8217;s potential for a favorable safety and efficacy profile in anemic CKD patients, both those who are dialysis-dependent (&#8220;DD-CKD&#8217;), including hyporesponsive patients, and those who are not dialysis-dependent (&#8220;NDD-CKD&#8221;). According to IMS Health, 2013 global ESA sales in all anemia indications totaled $8.6 billion. While the use of ESAs to treat anemia in CKD has largely been limited to use in DD-CKD patients, we and our partners believe that, as an oral agent with a potentially more favorable safety profile, roxadustat could increase accessibility and expand the market for anemia treatment by penetrating the NDD-CKD market. In the longer term, we believe roxadustat has the potential to address non-CKD anemia markets, including chemotherapy-induced anemia, anemia related to inflammation (such as inflammatory bowel disease, lupus and rheumatoid arthritis), myelodysplastic syndrome (&#8220;MDS&#8221;), and surgical procedures requiring transfusions.

We, along with our collaboration partners Astellas Pharma Inc. (&#8220;Astellas&#8221;), and AstraZeneca AB (&#8220;AstraZeneca&#8221;), have designed a global Phase 3 program to support regulatory approval of roxadustat in both NDD-CKD and DD-CKD patients in the United States (&#8220;U.S.&#8221;), the European Union (&#8220;EU&#8221;), Japan and China. Our U.S. and EU Phase 3 program has an aggregate target enrollment of approximately 7,000 to 8,000 patients worldwide and is the largest Phase 3 clinical program ever conducted for an anemia product candidate. Our Phase 3 program is also designed and sized for, and will incorporate major adverse cardiac events (&#8220;MACE&#8221;), composite safety endpoints that we believe will be required for approval in the U.S. for all new anemia therapies. Our Phase 3 program will study multiple patient populations, including patients within the first four months of initiating dialysis, or incident dialysis, and non-incident, or stable, dialysis patients and will include multiple NDD-CKD studies comparing roxadustat against placebo control.

Background of Anemia in CKD

Anemia is a serious medical condition in which patients have insufficient red blood cells and low levels of hemoglobin (&#8220;Hb&#8221;), a protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen to cells throughout the body. Anemia is associated with increased risks of hospitalization, cardiovascular complications, need for blood transfusion, exacerbation of other serious medical conditions and death. In addition, anemia frequently leads to significant fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, and decreased quality of life. The more severe the anemia, as measured in lower Hb levels, the greater the health impact on patients. Severe anemia is common in patients with CKD, cancer, MDS, inflammatory diseases, and other serious illnesses. Even when it accompanies prevalent and serious diseases, anemia is often not effectively treated.

Anemia is particularly prevalent in patients with CKD, which is a critical healthcare problem and is most commonly caused by diabetes and hypertension in the U.S. and Europe. CKD affects over 200 million people worldwide and anemia significantly increases healthcare costs for those patients. CKD is generally a progressive disease characterized by the gradual loss of kidney function that may eventually lead to kidney failure, also known as end stage renal disease (&#8220;ESRD&#8221;). Patients with ESRD require renal replacement therapy &#8212; either dialysis treatment or kidney transplantation. CKD accompanied by anemia is associated with worse health outcomes than CKD alone, including more rapid progression of CKD and increased death rate. There are 5 stages of CKD which are primarily defined by a measure of the filtration function of the kidney (GFR).

Sources: The prevalence of stage 1 through stage 4 CKD was calculated based on 2013 estimates by the United States Renal Data System (&#8220;USRDS&#8221;) presented in the 2015 USRDS annual data report: Epidemiology of kidney disease in the United States (&#8220;2015 USRDS ADR&#8221;), using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (&#8220;NHANES&#8221;) 2007-2012 and 2013 data from the U.S. Census Bureau. The prevalence of stage 5 CKD was calculated based on 2013 data from the 2015 USRDS ADR using data from the U.S. National ESRD database, NHANES 2007-2012 and 2013 data from the U.S. Census Bureau. 

The prevalence rate of anemia in patients with Hb&#60;12 g/dL is set forth below. 

Sources: The prevalence of anemia in stage 1 through stage 4 CKD and stage 5 NDD-CKD were derived from Stauffer and Fan, Prevalence of Anemia in Chronic Kidney Disease in the United States, PLoS ONE (2014). The prevalence of anemia in patients undergoing dialysis was derived from Goodkin et al, Naturally Occurring Higher Hemoglobin Concentration Does Not Increase Mortality among Hemodialysis Patients, J Am Soc Nephrol (2011).

In the U.S., according to the USRDS, a majority of dialysis eligible CKD patients are currently on dialysis. According to USRDS data as of 2013, approximately 470,000 patients were receiving dialysis in the U.S., of whom approximately 80% were being treated with ESAs for anemia. Despite the presence of anemia in stages 3 and 4 CKD patients, in clinical practice, patients typically do not receive ESA treatment for their anemia until they initiate dialysis. Approximately 16% of U.S. NDD-CKD patients were being treated with ESAs prior to initiation of dialysis as of 2013 (2015 USRDS ADR). In many CKD patients, the disease progresses gradually over decades and, therefore, patients can spend years suffering from the symptoms and negative health impacts of anemia before they receive treatment. Many of these patients die from cardiovascular events before they initiate dialysis.

&#160;

Limitations of the Current Standard of Care for Anemia in CKD 

Current therapies to treat anemia in CKD include injectable ESAs, intravenous iron (&#8220;IV iron&#8221;), oral iron and blood transfusions. ESAs have been used in the treatment of anemia in CKD for over 20 years and are administered intravenously or subcutaneously, typically in conjunction with IV iron. NDD-CKD patients who are not under the care of nephrologists, including those with diabetes and hypertension, do not typically receive ESAs and are often left untreated. ESAs currently on the market are all synthetic recombinant versions of human erythropoietin (&#8220;EPO&#8221;), a hormone that stimulates erythropoiesis and increases Hb levels by binding to receptors on red blood cell precursors in the bone marrow.

The introduction of the first ESA in 1989 was viewed as a major advance in the treatment of anemia in CKD because it significantly decreased the need for blood transfusions. Since then, ESAs have become one of the most commercially successful drug classes. However, because ESAs were never studied relative to placebo in large randomized clinical trials prior to approval, it was not until years later that their safety profile became better elucidated. Studies published in 2006 to 2009 demonstrated the safety risks of higher ESA doses used to target Hb levels of 13 to 15 g/dL, prompting physicians to balance serious safety concerns against the efficacy of ESAs. The safety concerns observed with injectable ESAs in these studies included an increased risk of cardiovascular adverse events and death as well as a potentially increased rate of tumor recurrence in patients with cancer.

The emergence of the safety issues resulted in several changes to ESA drug labeling. This combination of safety concerns and labeling changes, in addition to the subsequent reimbursement changes, described below, was followed by a decline in ESA sales revenues beginning in 2007. While we believe this decline in ESA sales is primarily due to complete suspension of the label for use of ESAs in anemias associated with cancer, and restrictions on use in chemotherapy induced anemia, we believe the decline in sales is also partly due to the progressive decline in ESA dose administered to CKD patients. Compared to the average ESA dose at the end of 2006, the mean monthly ESA dose in patients on hemodialysis dropped by 18%, 36%, 45% and 45% by the end of 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013 respectively (2015 USRDS ADR).

Safety Issues of ESAs

Several large clinical trials were designed to demonstrate that targeting higher as opposed to lower Hb levels results in better outcomes. However, they instead generated data showing that targeting higher Hb levels with ESAs resulted in an increase in adverse events, including cardiovascular adverse events. These adverse events were initially observed in 1998 in the NHCT (Normal Hematocrit Cardiac Trial) in CKD patients on dialysis, where the high Hb level treatment arm targeted Hb levels of 13 to 15 g/dL. Additional safety concerns emerged following the CHOIR (Correction of Hemoglobin in Outcomes and Renal Insufficiency), CREATE (Cardiovascular Risk Reduction by Early Anemia Treatment with Epoetin Beta), and TREAT (Trial to Reduce Cardiovascular Events with Aranesp Therapy) studies in NDD-CKD patients, which were published between 2006 and 2009.

Secondary analyses of NHCT, CHOIR and TREAT, as well as subsequent observational studies in dialysis patients, suggest that these safety concerns, particularly the increased cardiovascular risk associated with ESAs, may result from the high ESA doses used to target higher Hb levels rather than the achieved Hb levels themselves. For example, a secondary analysis of CHOIR showed that patients who achieved the desired Hb level with the lowest amounts of ESA have the lowest risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes as measured by composite endpoints consisting of hospitalization for heart failure, heart attack, stroke, and death. Patients who were treated with the highest ESA doses and, particularly those who achieved the lowest Hb levels, had the greatest risk for these events. In addition, observational studies in patients undergoing dialysis highlighted these risks with high ESA doses and also indicated that higher Hb levels achieved with lower ESA doses were associated with better outcomes.

&#160;

For example, in an analysis of data from the USRDS of 94,569 hemodialysis patients, increased mortality was found in patients with increased epoetin alfa dose. Patients who achieved the highest hematocrit level (which is a measure of the percentage of volume of whole blood made up of red blood cells; under typical conditions, Hb level can be estimated as one-third the hematocrit level) and received the lowest ESA doses (lowest dose quartile, Q1) had the lowest mortality rate, and, at any particular ESA dose quartile, patients with higher hematocrit levels tended to have lower mortality levels, according to Zhang et al (Am J Kidney Dis 44:866-876) as illustrated in the chart below. 

Unadjusted 1-Year Mortality Rates (per 1000)

by Hematocrit and ESA dosing quartile

Warnings about these risks have been incorporated into guidelines and position papers from major kidney societies and thought leaders. Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (&#8220;KDIGO&#8221;), a non-profit foundation established in 2003 and operated by the National Kidney Foundation, committed to improving global clinical guidelines for kidney patients, for example, states that, &#8220;[t]here may be toxicity from high doses of ESA, as suggested, though not proven, by recent post-hoc analyses of major ESA randomized controlled trials, especially in conjunction with the achievement of high Hb levels. Therefore, in general ESA dose escalation should be avoided.&#8221; In addition, the European Renal Best Practices Group specified in a recent position statement that caution should be used in ESA therapy in patients with specific risk factors.

Limited Effectiveness of ESAs in Certain Patient Populations

Hb responses to ESA doses are on a continuum with some patients responding with a satisfactory Hb increase to a small ESA dose and others responding very poorly to very high doses. In addition, patients&#8217; responsiveness to ESAs can change over time and as a result of circumstances such as acute illness or surgery. In an attempt to reach target Hb level, ESA doses are increased in treatment-resistant patients (&#8220;hyporesponders&#8221;), which can result in up to a 40-fold difference in ESA doses between the most ESA-resistant and the most ESA-responsive DD-CKD patients. Even with high doses of ESAs and concomitant IV iron, some of these hyporesponders are unable to reach target Hb levels.

Hyporesponsiveness is a significant problem in incident dialysis patients, for whom ESA doses are typically high, and is associated with a combination of critically low kidney function and accompanying illnesses, such as infections and chronic inflammation. Incident dialysis patients are generally more anemic, and have a higher risk of death, than patients who have been on dialysis for many months.

&#160;

A major cause of ESA hyporesponsiveness is an underlying chronic inflammatory state that exists in many CKD patients. Chronic inflammation has a suppressive effect on erythropoiesis in CKD via two main mechanisms. Firstly, pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (&#8220;TNF-alpha&#8221;), and interleukin-6 (&#8220;IL-6&#8221;), have been implicated in the suppression of erythropoiesis through inhibition of the response of erythroid progenitor cells to EPO. Secondly, pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 elevate the levels of hepcidin, the major hormone that regulates iron metabolism. The consequence of elevated hepcidin levels is a reduction in iron absorption from the gastrointestinal tract (&#8220;GI tract&#8221;), and the trapping of iron in cellular stores. Together this leads to inadequate availability of iron to keep pace with the demands of the bone marrow for erythropoiesis, despite adequate total body iron stores. This condition is referred to as functional iron deficiency. 

In the presence of inflammation, even high doses of ESAs may be ineffective to achieve target Hb levels, and to the extent Hb levels are raised, the risks associated with the higher ESA doses required may outweigh the benefits of any increased Hb levels.

Requirement for IV Iron to Support ESA Activity and Associated Safety Risks

IV iron supplementation is used to support anemia correction in a majority of hemodialysis patients treated with ESAs in the U.S. ESA labeling indicates that physicians should evaluate the iron status in all patients before and during CKD anemia treatment and maintain iron repletion. Many CKD patients have deficient iron stores, or absolute iron deficiency, and cannot absorb enough iron from diet or oral iron supplements to correct this deficiency. Physicians administer IV iron to ensure patients are iron replete prior to initiating ESA treatment and continue IV iron to mitigate iron depletion caused by ESA-mediated erythropoiesis.

Additionally, many CKD patients who have adequate iron stores suffer from functional iron deficiency. IV iron is administered in an attempt to address this shortage of available iron in these CKD patients, resulting in many patients having elevated body iron stores. While IV iron can help correct anemia when used with ESAs, published studies have suggested acute and chronic risks of both morbidity and mortality associated with the use of IV iron. The acute risks of IV iron supplementation include hypersensitivity reactions (which can be life-threatening and the warning of anaphylaxis risk appears in every IV iron product package insert in the U.S.), infection, as well as less severe but more common side-effects, such as skin problems, hypotension and GI tract symptoms. In addition to acute side-effects, there may also be chronic adverse effects on organ systems related to the cumulative deposits of iron resulting from the volume of iron administered.

Increased use of IV iron has been associated with increased risk of hospitalization and death. Using data from 12 countries obtained over the past twelve years, Bailie et al. demonstrated a direct dose risk relationship between the amount of IV iron administered per month to dialysis patients and the risk of hospitalization and death (Kidney International (2014)). The study identified that, even after controlling for other risk factors and adjusting for different practice patterns globally, dialysis patients receiving greater than 300 mg of IV iron per month had a greater risk of hospitalization or death than those receiving less than 300 mg. Mortality was 13% greater among those receiving between 300 and 400 mg of IV iron per month and 18% greater among those receiving greater than 400 mg of IV iron per month. Furthermore, hospitalization risk was 12% greater among those who received greater than 300 mg per month. The current paradigm of administrating greater doses of IV iron to decrease ESA doses in light of this recently described associated risk underscores the significant unmet need in the treatment of anemia. However, new and purportedly safer and more effective iron supplementation therapies are being developed and introduced, and if such new therapies are accepted by patients and physicians as a superior alternative to traditional IV iron supplementation therapies, they may help maintain or increase the attractiveness of ESA therapy.

Elevated Blood Pressure

ESAs have long been associated with increased blood pressure, including new onset hypertension and exacerbation of pre-existing hypertension. As a result, ESA labeling carries a warning for the potential for increased blood pressure with ESA usage. Hypertension has been shown to accelerate CKD progression and significantly increase the risk of death in CKD patients due to the increased risk of heart attack or stroke.

Increased Thromboembolism and Vascular Access Thrombosis

ESA use has been associated with thromboembolic events, including stroke, vascular access thrombosis (where the dialysis access shunt is blocked due to blood-clotting), blood clots in the leg, which may in part be due to increases in circulating platelet levels. As a result, ESA labeling carries a warning for an increased risk of thromboembolic events.

&#160;

FDA Restrictions on ESA Usage 

In response to safety concerns elucidated in the large clinical studies described above, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (&#8220;FDA&#8221;), steadily increased restrictions on the use of injectable ESAs from 2007 through 2011. During 2007, following the NHCT, CHOIR and CREATE studies and several oncology studies, the FDA mandated the inclusion of a boxed warning, or &#8220;Black Box&#8221; warning, in the package insert for ESAs. A Black Box warning is the strongest warning that the FDA can require in the package insert of prescription drugs. In June 2011, the FDA required further modification to the package insert for ESAs. The current boxed warning states that ESAs increase the risk of death, myocardial infarction, or heart attack, stroke, venous thromboembolism, thrombosis of vascular access and tumor progression or recurrence. In addition, the package insert changes include more conservative dosing guidelines for the use of injectable ESAs in anemic CKD patients. Specifically, the FDA removed the prior target Hb range of 10 to 12 g/dL and recommends that physicians initiate treatment of CKD patients when the Hb level is less than 10 g/dL and reduce or interrupt ESA dosing if the Hb level approaches or exceeds 10 g/dL for NDD-CKD patients and 11 g/dL for DD-CKD patients. In addition, physicians are advised to use only the lowest dose needed to avoid red blood cell transfusions.

Reimbursement Challenges Associated with ESAs

In addition to the safety concerns and labeling changes for ESAs, the reimbursement applicable to dialysis, including associated drugs such as ESAs, has also changed significantly in recent years, which made ESAs less economically attractive for providers to administer. Prior to January 2011, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (&#8220;CMS&#8221;) reimbursed dialysis centers and other healthcare providers for use of ESAs at average selling price plus a premium to their cost, which enabled providers to realize a profit on the administration of ESAs, regardless of the quantity dosed. Under the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act (&#8220;MIPPA&#8221;), a basic case-mix adjusted composite, or bundled, payment system commenced in January 2011 and transitioned fully by January 2014 to a single reimbursement rate for drugs and all services furnished by renal dialysis centers for Medicare beneficiaries with end-stage renal disease. Specifically, under MIPPA the bundle now covers drugs, services, lab tests and supplies under a single treatment base rate for reimbursement by CMS based on the average cost per treatment, including the cost of ESAs and IV iron doses, typically without adjustment for usage.

ESAs administered to NDD-CKD patients have long been reimbursed under Medicare Part B, which requires providers to purchase and store ESAs in advance of being reimbursed, and in many healthcare practices, the amount reimbursed does not cover the cost of ESA administration. For many of these providers, including in nephrology practices where purchase and storing is most common, due to label changes and related reduction in patients available for treatment, ESA administration in NDD-CKD has become economically unattractive. Furthermore, non-nephrologists generally have elected not to provide ESAs. Accordingly, ESA treatment has been limited outside of dialysis centers.

Inconvenience of ESAs

In addition to safety, labeling, reimbursement and efficacy limitations, ESAs must be administered intravenously or subcutaneously, often with IV iron in order for ESAs to be effective at treating to target Hb levels. ESAs are therefore inconvenient for the NDD-CKD population, the peritoneal dialysis population, for whom treatment is often administered at home, and other non-CKD anemia patients who are not already regularly visiting a hospital or dialysis center.

Our Solution

We believe that there is a significant need for a safer, more effective, more convenient and more accessible alternative to injectable ESAs for the treatment of anemia in CKD patients. In addition, we believe there is a significant opportunity for treatment of anemia in markets not effectively addressed by ESAs, such as in the NDD-CKD population, DD-CKD in the presence of inflammation, and non-CKD anemia markets.

&#160;

Roxadustat &#8212; A Novel, Orally Administered Treatment for Anemia 

Roxadustat is an orally administered small molecule that corrects anemia by a different mechanism of action from that of ESAs. As a HIF-PH inhibitor, roxadustat activates a response that is naturally activated when the body responds to reduced oxygen levels in the blood, such as when a person adapts to high altitude. The response activated by roxadustat involves the regulation of multiple, complementary processes to promote erythropoiesis and increase the blood&#8217;s oxygen carrying capacity. 

This coordinated erythropoietic response includes both the stimulation of red blood cell progenitors, by increasing the body&#8217;s production of EPO, and an increase in iron availability for Hb synthesis. Patients taking roxadustat typically have circulating endogenous EPO levels at peak concentration within or near the physiologic range naturally experienced by people adapting to hypoxic conditions such as at high altitude, following blood donation or impaired lung function, such as pulmonary edema. By contrast, ESAs act only to stimulate red blood cell progenitors without a corresponding increase in iron availability, and are typically dosed at well above the natural physiologic range of EPO. The sudden demand for iron stimulated by ESA-induced erythropoiesis can lead to functional or absolute iron deficiency. We believe these high doses of ESAs are a main cause of the significant safety issues that have been attributed to this class of drugs. In contrast, the differentiated mechanism of action of roxadustat, which involves induction of the body&#8217;s own natural pathways to achieve a more complete erythropoiesis, has the potential to provide a safer and more effective treatment of anemia, including in the presence of inflammation, which normally limits iron availability.

&#160;

Our HIF-PH inhibitor technology relies on the natural mechanism by which the body responds to low oxygen levels. HIF is a transcription factor comprised of a HIF-alpha and a HIF-beta subunit, both of which are required to stimulate erythropoiesis. Under normal oxygen conditions, the HIF-alpha subunit is targeted for rapid degradation through the activity of a family of HIF-PH enzymes. However, under low oxygen conditions, the HIF-PH enzymes cannot function and HIF-alpha accumulates. HIF-alpha then combines with HIF-beta, and the newly formed HIF complex initiates transcription of a number of genes involved in the erythropoietic process, which ultimately leads to increased oxygen delivery to tissues. Roxadustat works by reversibly inhibiting the HIF-PH enzymes, thus mimicking this coordinated natural erythropoietic response through genes transcribing the proteins shown below involved in iron absorption, mobilization and transport as well as stimulation of red blood cell progenitors.

&#160;

Our discovery and development of roxadustat resulted from years of experience working with prolyl hydroxylase enzymes, such as those that regulate HIF, and a deep understanding of the complexities of HIF biology. We have explored therapeutic activation of HIF to treat anemia from an integrated perspective with a focus on applying our HIF-PH inhibitor technology to produce coordinated effects on erythropoiesis and iron homeostasis and metabolism. As part of these progressive efforts, we have explored the ability of our HIF-PH inhibitor technology to increase sensitivity to endogenous EPO by increasing EPO receptor expression on red blood cell progenitors. We have investigated multiple effects of HIF-PH inhibitors on iron metabolism, including their ability to regulate genes that can increase iron bioavailability. We have also shown that administration of HIF-PH inhibitors can decrease expression of hepcidin, the key hormone that regulates iron metabolism. Hepcidin is elevated under conditions of chronic inflammation, leading to reduced iron availability for erythropoiesis. Based on our gene expression and hepcidin data, we believe HIF-PH inhibitors can increase intestinal iron absorption and enhance the mobilization and uptake of iron. In addition, we have shown that HIF-PH inhibitors can improve transferrin saturation (a measure of circulating iron available for erythropoiesis) and can correct anemia associated with chronic inflammation by overcoming the hepcidin-mediated sequestration of iron that cannot be overcome by ESA therapy.

We selected roxadustat from our extensive library of compounds from various chemical classes of HIF-PH inhibitors, including heterocyclic carboxamides and 2-oxoglutarate mimetics. Roxadustat was selected based on our belief that stabilizing the two main forms of HIF in the cell, HIF-1 and HIF-2, leads to a more complete erythropoietic response.

Although HIF-PH inhibitor programs have been subsequently initiated at several other companies, we expect to remain the leader in the development of HIF-PH inhibitors for anemia, with more patients dosed and more studies conducted with roxadustat than with any other HIF-PH inhibitor.

Potential Advantages of Roxadustat for Treatment of Anemia in CKD

We believe that roxadustat has the potential to offer several safety, efficacy, reimbursement, and convenience advantages over ESAs.

Potential Safety and Efficacy Advantages

Our clinical trials to date have shown that roxadustat can treat anemia in CKD with much lower circulating EPO levels than with treatment by ESAs, mitigate the need for IV iron and treat anemia in the presence of inflammation, thereby offering potential safety and efficacy benefits over ESAs. We have incorporated several endpoints into our Phase 3 studies to further elucidate and demonstrate these and other potential clinical benefits of roxadustat.

&#160;

Potential Cardiovascular Benefits 

The CKD patient population is at high risk for cardiovascular events such as heart attacks and strokes. One known side effect of ESAs is elevation of blood pressure, which is particularly dangerous in this high risk patient population. In contrast, we did not observe increases in blood pressure in patients treated with roxadustat beyond the background levels observed for the comparable placebo-treated patients in a NDD-CKD Phase 2 trial. However, these data should be cautiously assessed due to the limited number of patients exposed. In Study 041, the NDD-CKD patients treated with roxadustat three times weekly for more than 12 weeks had a modest decrease in blood pressure in a subgroup analysis of our Phase 2 NDD-CKD study.

In our Phase 2 studies, we did not observe a safety signal for thromboembolic risk. In contrast to the platelet increase with ESA treatment, platelet counts reported in roxadustat-treated patients did not increase, as those with platelet levels in the top 25th percentile at baseline saw their platelet levels decrease towards normal levels while those with platelet levels in the lower 75th percentile at baseline saw their platelet levels remain stable. This finding supports our belief in a potential safety benefit over ESAs since the platelet increase with ESAs could be a contributing factor in the thromboembolic risk associated with ESAs.

In addition, in our Phase 2 clinical trials, we observed reductions in total cholesterol and an improvement in average HDL / LDL ratio. Since many CKD patients have high cholesterol levels, which contribute to cardiovascular-related morbidity and mortality, the improvement in the average HDL / LDL ratio observed with roxadustat treatment could confer a benefit to patients.

Based on our preclinical and clinical data generated to date, we believe roxadustat could offer cardiovascular benefits to a CKD patient population that typically has cardiovascular-related co-morbidities and is at a high risk for cardiovascular events.

Potential for Anemia Correction with Moderate EPO Levels

Randomized trials have suggested that high doses of ESAs administered in an attempt to achieve a target Hb level may cause the safety issues associated with ESA therapy. These high doses result in serum EPO levels much higher than physiological range. In contrast, the level of endogenous EPO elevation among patients treated with roxadustat is typically within or near the range observed when ascending to a higher elevation or giving blood. Treating anemia while maintaining lower circulating EPO levels may mitigate, or even avoid, the risks from ESA therapy, including cardiovascular events and death.

(1994) Ren Fail 16:645; 4 The transient peak endogenous EPO concentrations (&#8220;Cmax&#8221;), data for roxadustat was derived from a subset of 243 patients who achieved a Hb response to roxadustat in our Phase 2 studies for whom we believe doses depicted approximated therapeutic doses. Hb target ranges for these patients were above the Hb levels specified in the current ESA package insert for CKD patients. Only doses in those patients whose Hb responded in Phase 2 studies are reflected in the figure. The subset of patients included 134 NDD-CKD patients treated to thrice-weekly, twice-weekly, or weekly doses of roxadustat for &#62;16 weeks. The subset also included 109 DD-CKD patients, including incident dialysis patients whose anemia was corrected with therapeutic doses, and stable dialysis patients who received maintenance doses. Cmax of endogenous EPO levels were not measured in all patients; instead the range of EPO Cmax levels were estimated based on data derived from a more limited number of patients in whom EPO levels were measured at various roxadustat doses and among whom there was substantial variation in measured EPO levels. Accordingly, individual patients who received roxadustat may have realized EPO Cmax levels significantly above or below these estimated levels. Moreover, the estimates reflected in the graph may not be reflective or predictive of actual EPO Cmax levels or ranges that will be realized in larger populations of patients receiving roxadustat in our Phase 3 clinical trials. 5 EPO C max was computed from ESA dose distributions based on Flaherty et al.

Potential for Anemia Correction for Patient Populations that are Hyporesponsive to ESAs

Incident dialysis patients and patients who have chronic inflammation are often hyporesponsive to ESAs, which necessitates the use of higher doses of ESAs to increase Hb levels, thus increasing both safety risk and treatment cost. In contrast, the dose of roxadustat may not need to be increased in incident dialysis patients or to overcome the suppressive effects of inflammation on erythropoiesis, which we believe may confer significant safety and efficacy benefits.

As a result of roxadustat&#8217;s different mechanism of action, the ability of roxadustat to stimulate erythropoiesis does not appear to be impaired by chronic inflammation. 

Our preclinical studies indicate that roxadustat can overcome the direct suppressive effects of inflammatory cytokines on erythropoiesis. In addition, in our preclinical studies, we have seen an ability of roxadustat to reduce hepcidin expression, thus increasing absorption of iron from the GI tract and the release of iron from intracellular stores and mitigating the functional iron deficiency associated with chronic inflammation.

&#160;

In our Phase 2 studies, patients&#8217; Hb response to roxadustat was independent of the degree of underlying inflammation, as assessed by circulating levels of C-reactive protein (&#8220;CRP&#8221;), a well-recognized marker of inflammation. Incident dialysis patients have the highest levels of mortality of all dialysis patients. The incident dialysis period is also the period during which mean ESA doses are generally highest. To the extent the increased levels of mortality are associated with high ESA doses, roxadustat may offer a benefit to incident dialysis patients. The median roxadustat dose in our dialysis Study 053 was 1.3 mg/kg; the Cmax of endogenous EPO levels usually associated with this dose level are comparable to the physiologic range naturally experienced by people adapting to high altitude or following blood donation. Refer to additional information on endogenous EPO levels under the heading &#8220; Potential for Anemia Correction with Moderate EPO Levels. &#8221; 

Potential for Reduced Hepcidin Levels and Anemia Correction Without IV Iron

An important differentiator of roxadustat from ESAs is that roxadustat is expected to correct anemia and maintain Hb without IV iron supplementation. Patients with chronic illness, such as CKD, often suffer from absolute iron deficiency or functional iron deficiency. We believe that elevated levels of hepcidin, the major hormone that regulates iron metabolism, contributes to both absolute and functional iron deficiency.

Our Phase 2 clinical trials have shown that roxadustat can significantly reduce hepcidin levels in patients with DD-CKD and NDD-CKD. The following figure shows a reduction in serum hepcidin level of approximately two thirds, observed at week 5, in 52 incident dialysis patients treated with roxadustat.

Reduction of Serum Hepcidin Levels (Study 053) in Incident Dialysis Patients

In addition, we believe roxadustat increases the levels of proteins involved in iron uptake, release and transport. Data from our Phase 2 clinical trials indicate that oral iron supplementation alone is adequate to correct anemia during treatment with roxadustat, in contrast to ESAs which typically require IV iron supplementation. Additionally, our data indicate that unlike ESAs, roxadustat treatment does not require that patients be iron replete before initiating therapy.

Avoiding IV iron helps to avoid the significant safety risks associated with IV iron described above, and, because the cost of oral iron is significantly less than the cost of IV iron, could also confer significant costs savings.

&#160;

Potential Reimbursement and Convenience Advantages 

Potentially Differentiated Reimbursement Framework

ESAs are included in the MIPPA bundled payment system in the DD-CKD setting and reimbursed under Medicare Part B in the NDD-CKD setting. Based on our roxadustat data to date, we believe roxadustat has the potential to correct anemia through a differentiated mechanism of action and different therapeutic effects that create the potential to displace multiple drugs in current use (such as ESAs and IV iron), or those in development (such as agents for suppression of hepcidin). Although the bundle currently covers ESAs or oral equivalents of ESAs or other IV products encompassed by the bundle, due to the differentiated nature of roxadustat and a lack of definition in the regulations on oral equivalency, for which there may be a CMS determination later this year, it is unclear whether roxadustat will be included in or excluded from the bundle. Under MIPPA, agents that have no IV equivalent in the bundle are currently expected to be excluded from the bundle until 2024. We believe that there may be commercial benefits in either event but are unable to predict the potential benefits until further guidance from CMS becomes available.

In the NDD-CKD setting, we expect that roxadustat, an oral treatment, should be subject to Medicare Part D, which would allow physicians to prescribe roxadustat without the financial and reimbursement risk associated with purchasing and storing injectable ESAs. We believe that this should encourage significantly greater usage outside of the dialysis setting.

Potential Reduction of Other Medications

In addition to potentially eliminating the need for IV iron, based on our Phase 2 clinical trial results to date, we believe that roxadustat has the potential to reduce the use of other medications frequently required in some CKD anemia patients, such as anti-hypertensives, anti-coagulants, and statins.

Oral Administration

Many physicians that treat CKD patients, particularly cardiologists, endocrinologists, and internists, do not typically stock or administer ESAs. An easily accessible oral agent that is dispensed by pharmacies could significantly increase the number of physicians treating anemia in patients with CKD and therefore the number of patients receiving treatment.

In addition, the oral administration of roxadustat potentially offers a significant convenience advantage for CKD patients who have yet to initiate dialysis and are therefore not regularly visiting a dialysis center. Patients can more easily self-administer medicine in any setting, rather than being subject to the inconvenience and restrictions of regular visits to physicians&#8217; offices or infusion centers for treatment with ESAs.

Potential Pharmacoeconomic Advantages

Based on our Phase 2 clinical trial results to date, we believe that roxadustat&#8217;s potential pharmacoeconomic advantages over ESA therapy may include safety (with a potential decrease in cardiovascular events and consequently lower associated treatment costs), lower administrative cost, reduction or elimination of IV iron and potentially other medications. If we can demonstrate any of these pharmacoeconomic advantages in our Phase 3 studies, they may help support reimbursement worldwide, including Europe and China.

The Market Opportunity for Roxadustat

We believe that there is a significant opportunity for roxadustat to address markets currently served by injectable ESAs. According to IMS Health, 2013 global ESA sales in all indications totaled $8.6 billion, driven primarily by $6.2 billion in the U.S. and Europe. We believe that a substantial portion of ESA sales are for CKD anemia. For example, in the U.S., EPOGEN, which is primarily used in the DD-CKD patient population, had 2014 sales of approximately $2 billion. We further believe that the number of patients requiring anemia therapy will grow steadily as the global CKD population and access to dialysis care continue to expand, particularly in China and other emerging markets including the rest of Asia, Latin America, Eastern Europe, the Middle East and the Commonwealth of Independent States.

Furthermore, we believe that there is a significant opportunity for roxadustat to address patient segments that are currently not effectively served by ESAs, such as anemia in the NDD-CKD patient population, which is substantially larger than the DD-CKD patient population. Diabetes and hypertension are the leading causes of secondary CKD. Although we estimate approximately 36% of diabetic and 20% of hypertensive CKD patients are anemic (Hb&#60;12g/dL), we believe the majority of these patients are currently untreated for anemia since they are under the care of non-nephrology specialists, such as endocrinologists, diabetologists, cardiologists and internists, where ESA therapies are not readily available.

&#160;

We also believe that roxadustat may provide a safer option to re-establish the chemotherapy induced anemia market, which was once a market of comparable size to the DD-CKD anemia market. Other non-CKD anemias, including anemia related to inflammatory diseases, MDS and surgical procedures requiring transfusions, which are not addressed adequately with currently available therapies, could form another opportunity. 

OUR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM FOR ROXADUSTAT

In addition to the over 1,100 subjects who have been exposed to roxadustat in Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical studies, including treatment of some patients for 24 weeks in Phase 2 studies and several patients for approximately 4 years in a safety extension study , our ongoing Phase 3 program, which requires a minimum treatment duration of a year, provides additional long term safety data .

We along with our partners, Astellas and AstraZeneca, have designed our global Phase 3 program to support regulatory approval of roxadustat in both NDD-CKD and DD-CKD patients in the U.S., the EU, Japan and China. Our U.S. and EU Phase 3 program has an aggregate target enrollment of approximately 7,000 to 8,000 patients worldwide. Our U.S. Phase 3 program is also designed and sized for demonstrating non-inferiority to comparators for the MACE composite safety endpoints in two separate patient pools, NDD-CKD and DD-CKD. We believe this will be required for approval in the U.S. for all new anemia therapies. Our Phase 3 program will study multiple patient populations, including incident dialysis patients and stable dialysis patients and will include multiple NDD-CKD studies comparing roxadustat against placebo controls. Five of the six Phase 3 studies supporting approval in the EU use the same patients that are intended to support approval in the U.S. However, the EU requires shorter treatment duration and less overall patient exposure. 

For our three roxadustat Phase 3 studies, we have reached approximately 90% of our cumulative target enrollment agreed upon with our partners. We completed patient enrollment in one of these three studies and the second should complete in early March 2016; w e currently expect to complete enrollment in the third U.S. study in the third quarter of 2016. We currently anticipate filing for New Drug Application (&#8220;NDA&#8221;) approval for roxadustat in the U.S. in 2018. 

Our subsidiaries, FibroGen China Anemia Holdings, Ltd. and FibroGen (China) Medical Technology Development Co., Ltd. (individually or collectively referred to as &#8220;FibroGen China&#8221;), began enrolling patients in our China Phase 3 studies in December 2015. The primary efficacy endpoint is 26 weeks for the 300 subject dialysis study and 8 weeks for the 150 subject non-dialysis study. We expect to complete enrollment of the dialysis study in the second quarter of 2016 and the non-dialysis study in the third quarter of 2016. We expect to complete enrollment of the 52 week extension study (100 subjects) in the first half of 2016. 

We are operating within the context of a Class 1.1 drug approval pathway for Domestic innovative drugs, and we currently anticipate initiating the NDA process in the fourth quarter of 2016 after we have reached the primary efficacy endpoint for both studies. Given that there is little precedent in China for the approval pathway, and the China Food and Drug Administration (&#8220;CFDA&#8221;) is in the process of enacting regulatory reform, we continue to regularly consult with the CFDA. We currently do not expect to announce the interim data publicly prior to initiating the NDA process. We expect that the Beijing CFDA will conduct the manufacturing review and site inspections first, to be followed by technical review of the preclinical, clinical and Chemistry, Manufacturing and Control filing by the Center for Drug Evaluation. 

Our Phase 2 Program

We have completed and analyzed six roxadustat Phase 2 studies, three in NDD-CKD patients and three in DD-CKD patients, to assess the efficacy of roxadustat to both correct anemia (&#8220;correction&#8221;) and maintain the Hb response (&#8220;maintenance&#8221;). Data from these studies have been published and presented at various medical conferences and medical journals. Two of the six completed Phase 2 studies were conducted in China. The efficacy and safety data generated from our China studies were consistent with our U.S. Phase 2 studies and further contributed to the promising efficacy and safety results to date. Astellas&#8217; Phase 2 DD-CKD and NDD-CKD studies in Japan have been completed, and data reconciliation and analysis are in progress.

The data from our completed Phase 2 studies demonstrated that roxadustat achieved a clinically meaningful increase in Hb levels in anemic NDD-CKD and DD-CKD patients and maintained Hb levels in DD-CKD patients who were converted from ESA therapy. Roxadustat corrected anemia without the need for IV iron supplementation and exhibited an acceptable safety profile. Specifically, our Phase 2 studies achieved the following objectives: 

&#160;

&#160;

&#8226;

&#160;

Identified optimal roxadustat dosing regimens for anemia correction and maintenance of Hb response.

&#160;

&#160;

&#8226;

&#160;

Demonstrated roxadustat&#8217;s potential to treat anemia in both NDD-CKD and DD-CKD patients, including incident dialysis patients, the most unstable and high risk CKD patient population.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

&#8226;

&#160;

Generated substantial safety data, indicating that roxadustat is well tolerated, appears safe and could offer an improved cardiovascular profile relative to ESAs. Including our Phase 1, 2 and 3 studies over 1,500 subjects have been exposed to roxadustat.

&#160;

&#160;

&#8226;

&#160;

Demonstrated that roxadustat may be able to treat anemia without the need for IV iron supplementation.

&#160;

&#160;

&#8226;

&#160;

Demonstrated that roxadustat can reduce hepcidin levels and potentially treat anemia in a significant subset of patients with inflammation.

The following chart summarizes the design of our completed studies in DD-CKD and NDD-CKD patients and indicates the primary objectives of each study .

Study 017: Dose Escalating Study in NDD-CKD patients

Study 017 established proof of concept for roxadustat by showing a significant increase in Hb in a dose-dependent manner, and provided data on the relationship between roxadustat dose and Hb response. This formed the basis for the dosing rules that we applied in subsequent studies of longer duration and in a larger number of patients.

This study, a randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation study, was the first Phase 2 study to assess the safety and efficacy of a range of roxadustat doses in the correction of anemia in NDD-CKD stage 3 and 4 patients, over four weeks of treatment, and a 12-week safety follow-up period. A total of 117 patients (of which 96 were evaluable) were randomized sequentially into four weight-based dose cohorts: 1 mg/kg, 1.5 mg/kg, 2 mg/kg, and 0.7 mg/kg, respectively. Roxadustat was administered either twice weekly or three times weekly.

Weight Based, Three Times Weekly and Twice Weekly Dosing Leads to Hb Improvement . We tested 4 different roxadustat weight-based doses administered for four weeks with Hb measurements over a six week period. As shown in the table below, all of the patients in the highest weight-based dose cohort met the criteria for response in that they achieved Hb rise &#62; 1 g/dL in four weeks. As roxadustat achieved 100% Hb response at the 2 mg/kg dose, higher doses were not pursued in this study despite the absence of dose limiting toxicity. Roxadustat was well tolerated without any safety concerns. 

&#160;

Significant, Dose Dependent Increases in Hb . As shown in the table below, the dose-dependent change in Hb from baseline in roxadustat patients was statistically significant from placebo by Day 8 (p=0.025) and remained so at each assessment through Week 6 (p=0.0001 at Day 22; p&#60;0.0001 at Day 26&#8211;29/end of treatment). 

A p-value is a statistical measure of the probability that the difference in two values could have occurred by chance. The smaller the p-value, the greater the statistical significance and confidence in the result. Typically, results are considered statistically significant if they have a p-value less than 0.05, meaning that there is less than a one-in-20 likelihood that the observed results occurred by chance. The FDA requires that sponsors demonstrate the effectiveness and safety of their product candidates through the conduct of adequate and well-controlled studies in order to obtain marketing approval. Typically, the FDA requires a p-value of less than 0.05 to establish the statistical significance of a clinical trial, although there are no laws or regulations requiring that clinical data be statistically significant, or that require a specific p-value, in order for the FDA to grant approval.

Standard error of the mean (&#8220;SE&#8221;), is a statistical measure of the amount that an observed mean may be expected to differ by chance from the true mean. For a population that follows a normal distribution, 68% of observed means will be within one standard error of the mean.

Dose-Dependent Reduction in Hepcidin Levels . Roxadustat reduced serum hepcidin levels in a dose-dependent fashion. 

Study 041: Study for Optimization of Starting Dose and Dose Titration in NDD-CKD Patients

Study 041 demonstrated that both tier-weight and fixed starting doses can initiate anemia correction. In tier-weight based dosing for this study, we used starting doses based on the patient&#8217;s body weight category: high, middle or low. This randomized, open-label Phase 2 study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of roxadustat over 16 to 24 weeks in 145 NDD-CKD patients (of which 143 were efficacy evaluable), and to evaluate the effects of dosing regimens in order to determine an optimized approach to anemia correction. In this trial, we tested six different starting dose regimens: three fixed doses, and three tier-weight doses. In fixed dosing, all patients in the same cohort were given the same starting dose.

We tested both three times weekly and twice weekly dosing frequencies for anemia correction, similar to Study 017, and further demonstrated that Hb levels can be maintained using 3 dosing frequencies (three times weekly, twice weekly and weekly) once target Hb &#179; 11 g/dL was achieved. We also studied various dose adjustment rules, with dose adjustment decisions made from 5 weeks onward, and every 4 weeks thereafter, to seek the best dose titration scheme.

Hb Correction . We met the primary efficacy endpoint of cumulative number (%) of patients with a Hb response, defined as an increase in Hb &#32; &#179; 1.0 g/dL from baseline and Hb &#179; 11.0 g/dL at the end of treatment. Regardless of the starting dose or dose titration scheme, 92% of patients collectively from all cohorts achieved an Hb increase of at least 1 g/dL from baseline. These data suggest the doses studied are of adequate range for anemia correction. The following figure shows mean Hb levels for the six dose groups.

Hb Correction was Independent of Inflammation Status . In this study, in a post-hoc analysis, we observed that the magnitude of increases in Hb in response to roxadustat treatment was comparable for both patients with inflammation (elevated CRP levels) and without inflammation (normal CRP levels). 

FGCL-4592-041 Mean (&#177; SE) Maximum Change in Hb (g/dL) in 12 Weeks

This stands in contrast to treatments with ESAs, where elevated CRP is frequently associated with lower Hb response to ESAs. We observed a 30% reduction in mean hepcidin level from baseline with eight weeks of roxadustat treatment (p=0.0003), which supports our belief in roxadustat&#8217;s ability to overcome inflammation and to maintain iron availability for erythropoiesis.

Hb Correction Without IV Iron and in Patients Who Have Low Iron Levels at Study Initiation . In connection with the conduct of the study, we also evaluated several iron parameters to assess roxadustat&#8217;s ability to improve Hb without the use of IV iron. At baseline, 49% of the efficacy evaluable patients did not have sufficient iron levels in the body to qualify for initiation of ESA treatment under current practice guidelines and would have been excluded from participation in all prior ESA Phase 3 trials. These patients would not be considered iron replete and are typically first treated with IV iron prior to ESA treatment initiation in an effort to ensure an adequate response to ESA and to minimize the risk of iron depletion. Of all patients in this study receiving roxadustat, only 38% were taking oral iron supplements. A mean Hb increase of 1.8 g/dL was achieved in the first 16 weeks of treatment without IV iron supplementation. There was no evidence for iron depletion as CHr, reticulocyte Hb content or the amount of Hb in newly formed red blood cells, was maintained. Furthermore, there was evidence for improved iron utilization with increases in the MCV and increase in mean corpuscular Hb concentration (MCHC) over the first 16 weeks of treatment with roxadustat from baseline (p=0.0018 and p&#60;0.0001, respectively); both MCV and MCHC typically decrease when there is iron deficiency. 

Despite the minimal use of oral iron and lack of IV iron usage, patients who were not iron replete had similar Hb responses at Week 16 as patients who were iron replete.

Reduction in Cholesterol Levels . In a post-hoc analysis of all cohorts, total cholesterol decreased during treatment with roxadustat. Mean reductions in total cholesterol were greater for patients with abnormally high cholesterol levels (&#62; 200mg/dL). Decreases in cholesterol levels were independent of whether patients were taking statins or other lipid lowering agents. Furthermore, the HDL/LDL ratio improved with roxadustat treatment in the subgroup of patients in whom lipid profiles were conducted. 

Improvement in Quality of Life . Finally, in an analysis of exploratory endpoints we observed improved quality of life in patients treated with roxadustat using a standard questionnaire called the SF-36 HRQOL. The largest positive changes from baseline occurred in the Vitality subscale (&#62;4 points, p&#60;0.0001) and Physical Component (&#62;1.6 points, p&#60;0.005) subscales of the questionnaire. We believe these data demonstrate that by correcting patients&#8217; anemia, roxadustat may improve quality of life. 

Study 040: ESA Conversion Study in DD-CKD Patients

Study 040 was designed to evaluate the short- and long-term dosing of roxadustat in patients on hemodialysis (&#8220;HD&#8221;) treatment. These results established a conversion dose relationship between ESAs and roxadustat that will be used for Phase 3 trials. Roxadustat maintained Hb without the use of IV iron, which is generally required for the treatment of anemia by ESAs.

&#160;

This randomized, single-blind study was the first roxadustat study in patients on HD treatment. Part 1 was a six week open-label Phase 2 dose ranging study in 54 patients (of which 42 were efficacy evaluable) to evaluate the impact of 4 sequential doses of roxadustat on dialysis patients&#8217; Hb levels over six weeks upon switching from epoetin alfa, in comparison to those continuing prior epoetin alfa doses. Part 2 was a 19 week treatment study in 90 patients (of which 83 were efficacy evaluable) to establish optimal conversion doses and dose adjustments. Patients included had previously demonstrated a wide range of ESA-responsiveness. Study 040 met its primary endpoint in Part 1 of maintaining Hb in patients previously treated with epoetin alfa at Week 6, indicating that roxadustat can replace ESAs in DD-CKD. Study 040 also met its primary endpoint in Part 2 of maintaining Hb at Week 19, indicating that roxadustat may be effective at long-term maintenance of Hb. IV iron was prohibited in both roxadustat treated patients and ESA treated control patients during this study. 

Maintenance of Hb Levels Following Conversion from ESAs . In Part 1 of this study (six week treatment), 41 patients were randomized to one of four roxadustat dose cohorts, and 13 were randomized to continue on epoetin alfa treatment. The primary endpoint was maintaining an Hb level equal to or above 0.5 g/dL below baseline Hb by the end of six weeks. As shown in the figure below, roxadustat had a dose-response effect for maintaining Hb levels. The lowest roxadustat dose cohort of 1.0 mg/kg was comparable to epoetin alfa with maintenance in 44% of roxadustat patients and 33% of the control arm, patients who continued treatment with epoetin alfa (but who were required to stop concomitant treatment with IV iron). Roxadustat doses of 1.5 mg/kg or higher were better than epoetin alfa at maintaining Hb, with 79.2% overall maintenance and with 80% maintenance at the 1.5 mg/kg roxadustat dose, 80% maintenance at the 1.8 mg/kg roxadustat dose and 77.8% maintenance at 2 mg/kg roxadustat dose. 

In Part 2 of the study (19 week treatment), 67 patients (with baseline ESA dose requirements ranging from 7 to 164.5 U/kg three times weekly) were randomized to seven cohorts of roxadustat (with various starting doses) and 23 patients were randomized to continue on epoetin alfa. Hb correction in the roxadustat treated patients pooled across all treatment cohorts was maintained over the 19 week treatment period and was comparable to epoetin alfa. The average roxadustat dose requirement for Hb maintenance was approximately 1.70 mg/kg three times weekly.

In Part 1, which was dose ranging, we observed an increase in Hb level at doses of 1.5 to 2.0 mg/kg TIW as shown in the figures below. In Part 2, which was to establish the optimal conversion dose, we observed similar Hb maintenance between roxadustat and epoetin alfa.

Roxadustat Doses are Associated with Lower Circulating EPO Levels than Epoetin Alfa . The following chart shows the result of six patients who were highly responsive to epoetin alfa and participated in a substudy in which their EPO levels during treatment with roxadustat were compared to EPO levels when the patients were receiving epoetin alfa prior to randomization. Their mean peak EPO concentration after an average dose of 44 U/kg was significantly higher when patients were receiving epoetin alfa relative to when they were receiving a mean roxadustat dose of 1.3 mg/kg as illustrated below. This observation is consistent with the mechanisms of action of ESA and roxadustat, respectively, and we believe the lower EPO exposure observed with roxadustat offers potential safety benefits.

Maintenance of Adequate Iron Supply . The concentrations of Hb within newly formed red blood cells (&#8220;CHr&#8221;) is a measure of iron availability for erythropoiesis. In an exploratory analysis of this study, without IV iron supplementation (which was prohibited in this study), CHr was maintained during roxadustat treatment but declined in patients who continued treatment with epoetin alfa. This finding indicates that unlike epoetin alfa, roxadustat allows endogenous stores of iron to provide an adequate supply to newly forming red blood cells without any IV iron supplementation.

Reduction in Total Cholesterol . Consistent with our Phase 2 studies in NDD-CKD patients, we observed in a post-hoc analysis that roxadustat reduced total cholesterol levels in stable dialysis patients, and this effect appeared durable throughout the 19 week treatment period as depicted below.

Study 053: Correction of Anemia in Incident Dialysis Patients 

Incident dialysis patients are at increased risk of serious cardiovascular events and death as compared to stable dialysis patients. The mortality rate among dialysis patients is highest during the first few months of dialysis initiation, and on average, patients also require the highest doses of ESA in this period. These patients typically have high levels of systemic inflammation and require IV iron supplementation for ESA to be effective.

This randomized, open-label study was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of roxadustat for correction of anemia in 60 incident dialysis patients (of which 55 were efficacy evaluable) who were on dialysis for at least two weeks and not more than four months and had not been treated with ESAs, and to compare the treatment responses to roxadustat under the different iron supplementation conditions. All treatment groups in Study 053 met their primary endpoint in increasing Hb level during treatment: each cohort achieved maximum mean Hb increases from baseline, ranging between 2.8 g/dL to 3.5 g/dL, resulting from 12 weeks of roxadustat treatment. We observed that at week 12 in excess of 90% of the patients achieved a greater than 1 g/dL increase in Hb from baseline. In addition, while roxadustat corrected anemia without iron supplementation, oral iron enabled an optimal Hb response. More importantly, oral iron was as effective as IV iron for Hb correction by roxadustat. In contrast, ESA therapy requires IV iron supplementation in this patient population.

This study also showed that roxadustat can correct anemia regardless of the patient&#8217;s level of inflammation as measured by CRP. At Week 12, the median weekly dose of roxadustat was 4.0 mg/kg in this trial of incident dialysis patients and is similar to the median weekly dose of 4.45 mg/kg at Week 12 in Study 040, our trial of roxadustat in stable dialysis patients. In contrast, ESA therapy typically involves higher doses at the time of dialysis initiation.

The 48 HD patients were randomized to one of the three iron supplementation options: oral iron, IV iron or no iron. Included in the 60 patients were 12 peritoneal dialysis (&#8220;PD&#8221;), patients who received oral iron. This study incorporated the same tier-weight based dosing regimen utilized in Study 041.

Hb Correction in Incident Dialysis Patients Without IV Iron Administration . All three cohorts of roxadustat treated HD patients (no iron, oral iron or IV iron supplementation) and PD patients (oral iron) achieved a significant increase in the maximum Hb change from baseline, the primary efficacy endpoint. Most importantly, the maximum increase in Hb was not significantly different between roxadustat treated HD patients supplemented with oral iron (3.5 g/dL) and those supplemented with IV iron (3.5 g/dL). In contrast, a published study of ESAs in this patient population showed that patients supplemented with oral iron achieved a Hb response comparable to no iron supplementation and significantly lower Hb response than those supplemented with IV iron. These Phase 2 data demonstrate that roxadustat, unlike ESAs, may eliminate the need for IV iron and thus avoid the side effects of IV iron in DD-CKD patients.

Maintenance of Iron Stores . In an exploratory analysis of this study, transferrin saturation (&#8220;TSAT&#8221;), a marker of iron stores, was well maintained during this period of intensive production of red blood cells with oral iron alone, indicating that iron stores can be maintained without IV iron. 

FGCL-4592-053: TSAT Over Time During Anemia Correction With Roxadustat In Incident Dialysis Patients, With No Iron, Oral Iron, or IV Iron Supplementation

Hb Correction Independent of Inflammation Status . As is typical of incident dialysis patients, about half of all patients had elevated CRP levels at baseline. In a post-hoc analysis of this study, we observed that Hb responses following roxadustat treatment were independent of baseline CRP levels. These data demonstrate that, unlike the ESAs, roxadustat has the potential to overcome the suppressive effects of inflammation on Hb responsiveness to treatment. 

&#160;

Significant Reduction in Hepcidin . Consistent with our other studies, in an exploratory analysis of this study we observed that patients&#8217; hepcidin levels were significantly reduced, most notably in the no iron and oral iron cohorts, by &#62; 50% from baseline, and to a lesser extent in the IV iron cohort. At follow-up (4 weeks after stopping roxadustat), hepcidin levels returned towards baseline values. Hepcidin reduction may be one of the mechanisms for overcoming the Hb suppressive effects of inflammation by making iron more available for roxadustat-induced erythropoiesis. 

China Phase 2 Studies

In China, roxadustat is known as FG-4592. We performed two Phase 2 studies in China, one trial in NDD-CKD patients, and another trial in DD-CKD patients. In these trials, Hb correction in NDD-CKD patients and Hb maintenance in DD-CKD patients replicated the results seen in the U.S. trials.

Study 047: 8 Week Placebo-Controlled NDD-CKD

In this multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 91 anemic CKD patients were randomized 2:1 to roxadustat or placebo treatment groups, respectively, in two sequential dose cohorts or placebo. Iron repletion at baseline was not required and IV iron supplementation was prohibited during the trial; oral iron supplementation was allowed during the trial, similar to the corresponding U.S. Study 041. The study used tier-weight starting dose for four weeks after which the roxadustat dose was adjusted, depending upon the initial response to treatment. Study 047 met its primary endpoint of a mean maximum increase from baseline Hb at the end of Week 8. The mean Hb increases at the end of eight weeks of treatment were 1.6 g/dL and 2.4 g/dL in the low-dose and the high dose cohort, respectively, compared to 0.4 g/dL for placebo, p &#60; 0.0001 for each cohort compared to placebo.

Study 048: Stable Dialysis Conversion in China 

In this multi-center, open-label, ESA-controlled study, 87 HD patients (of which 82 were efficacy evaluable) with Hb 9 to 12 g/dL previously maintained with ESAs were randomized 3:1 to roxadustat or epoetin alfa treatment groups, respectively, in three sequential dose cohorts of increasing starting doses of roxadustat. This study design was similar to Part 1 of Study 040. Study 048, an exploratory study, achieved its objective of number (%) of patients with successful dose conversion whose Hb levels are maintained at no lower than 0.5 g/dL below their mean baseline value at the end of Weeks 5 and 6 (59.1% for the low-dose, 88.9% for the mid-dose, and 100% for the high dose). The Hb responses to the roxadustat treatment of Chinese dialysis patients, with the low dose cohort were numerically similar to epoetin alfa, while the mid-dose and the high-dose cohorts each had a statistically significantly higher Hb response rate than epoetin alfa. Hb responses to the roxadustat treatment of Chinese dialysis patients (as shown in the figure below) were similar to Part 1 of Study 040 in the U.S.

Safety Summary

A range of roxadustat doses, up to 3.0 mg/kg in DD-CKD patients and up to 5.0 mg/kg in healthy volunteers, have been administered and all roxadustat doses have been well-tolerated. In January 2016, the roxadustat data safety monitoring board (&#8220;DSMB&#8221;) completed its scheduled review of the data from all active Phase 3 roxadustat clinical trials and recommended that the program proceed with no protocol changes. The following summarizes the safety findings of our preclinical, Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies:

&#160;

&#183; 

No Overall Safety Signals . An independent data monitoring committee consisting of external experts in nephrology, hepatology, and biostatistics reviewed safety data from all U.S. and Europe Phase 2 studies, and determined there were no safety signals. The overall frequency and type of treatment-emergent adverse events (&#8220;TEAEs&#8221;) and serious adverse events (&#8220;SAEs&#8221;) observed in these clinical studies reflect events that would be expected to occur in each of the NDD-CKD and DD-CKD patient populations. Safety analyses did not reveal any association between the rates of occurrence of cardiovascular events with roxadustat dose, rate of Hb rise or Hb level. The SAEs experienced in our studies identified by the principal investigator as possibly related to roxadustat were a stroke in a patient with a prior history of multiple strokes, one incident of vomiting, and one incident of deep venous thrombosis. The most commonly reported TEAE in the Phase 2 studies were diarrhea, nausea, urinary tract infection, nasopharyngitis, peripheral edema, hyperkalemia, headache, hypertension and upper respiratory tract infection. 

Of our completed Phase 2 clinical studies, four (Studies 017, 047, 040 and 048) were controlled, two with placebo and two with ESA.

&#160;

For Study 017, which had a treatment period of 4 weeks, for 88 subjects on roxadustat, and 28 subjects on placebo, we observed treatment emergent SAEs (&#8220;TSAEs&#8221;), in 4 patients (4.5%) on roxadustat, with 0 cardiovascular SAEs and 0 SAEs for the composite safety endpoint. There were also TSAEs in 1 patient (3.6%) in the placebo arm of the study, including 1 cardiovascular SAE and 0 SAEs for the composite safety endpoint. The composite safety endpoint (exploratory analysis) includes death, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, subendocardial ischaemia, cerebrovascular accident, thrombosis (fistula), arteriovenous fistula occlusion, angina pectoris, and vascular graft thrombosis. A patient may experience more than one SAE, in which case a patient is only counted once in this analysis. TSAEs observed in patients treated with roxadustat were arteriovenous fistula site complications, dyspnea, femoral neck fracture and non-cardiac chest pain. SAEs observed in patients treated with placebo were acute renal failure and pericarditis. 

For Study 047, which had a treatment period of 8 weeks, for 61 subjects on roxadustat, and 30 subjects on placebo, we observed TSAEs in 8 patients on roxadustat (13.1%), with 0 cardiovascular SAEs, and 0 SAEs for the composite safety endpoint, and TSAEs in 4 patients on placebo (13.3%), including 1 cardiovascular SAE (3.3%), and 1 SAE (3.3%) for the composite safety endpoint. TSAEs observed in patients treated with roxadustat were chronic renal failure (4), upper respiratory tract infection (1), hyperkalaemia (2) and urinary tract infection (1). TSAEs observed in patients treated with placebo were unstable angina (1), anemia (1), retinal detachment (1), pneumonia (1) and gastritis (1).

For Study 040, for those who had a treatment period of 19 weeks, for 66 subjects on roxadustat, and 23 subjects on ESAs, we observed TSAEs in 15 patients on roxadustat (22.7%), including 1 cardiovascular SAEs (1.5%), and 8 SAEs for the composite safety endpoint (12.1%), and TSAEs in 4 patients on ESAs (17.4%), including 2 cardiovascular SAEs (8.7%), and 4 SAEs (17.4%) for the composite safety endpoint. TSAEs categorized by System Organ Class, a standard event classification, observed in patients treated with roxadustat were infections and infestations (5), metabolism and nutrition disorders (2), cardiac disorders (1), gastrointestinal disorders (1), nervous system disorders (2), respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders (2), skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (1), injury, poisoning and procedural complications (2), and psychiatric disorders (1). TSAEs categorized by System Organ Class observed in patients treated with ESA were infections and infestations (3), metabolism and nutrition disorders (3), cardiac disorders (1), respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders (1), blood and lymphatic system disorders (1) and vascular disorders (1).

For Study 048 which had a treatment period of 6 weeks, for 74 subjects on roxadustat, and 22 subjects on ESAs, we observed 0 TSAEs in patients on roxadustat, including cardiovascular SAEs and for the composite safety endpoint. There were also 0 TSAEs in the patients taking ESAs.

The differences in the SAE percentages described are not considered statistically significant.

The three SAEs described above that were considered by the principal investigator to be possibly related to roxadustat did not occur in these four studies.

No Liver Enzyme Safety Signal . Liver enzymes were monitored closely in the roxadustat Phase 2 clinical development program. No evidence of hepatotoxicity was observed in any of the roxadustat clinical trials, and the independent data monitoring committee concluded that there was no concern for hepatotoxicity to date. Liver enzymes are being monitored in Phase 3 according to current FDA guidelines, without any special requirements. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Extensive Evaluation of Cancer Risk . Furthermore, to assess the potential cancer risk of roxadustat, we conducted 12 tumor studies in rodents. These studies included xenograft, syngeneic, or spontaneous tumors of lung, colon, breast, pancreas, melanoma, ovarian, renal, prostate and leukemic origin, several of which are reported to be dependent on vascular endothelial growth factor (&#8220;VEGF&#8221;), a protein that can be regulated by HIF for which increased levels have potentially been linked to increased tumor growth. No effect on tumor promotion was observed with roxadustat in any of the studies. In addition, roxadustat had no effect on tumor initiation or metastasis in the studies in which these end-points were also measured. Five other HIF-PH inhibitors from our library have been evaluated in many of the same rodent tumor models as roxadustat, as well as some additional ones (35 studies of six HIF-PH inhibitors in 18 models total), with no observed effect on tumor initiation, promotion or metastasis. Finally, no significant increases in plasma VEGF levels have been observed in any of our nonclinical studies at clinically relevant erythropoietic doses of roxadustat. 

In March 2015, we received final reports for two-year rat and mouse carcinogenicity studies of roxadustat. Roxadustat treatment had no adverse effect on survival and did not cause carcinogenic effects in either species. Two-year rodent carcinogenicity studies that were conducted with one of the other HIF-PH inhibitors evaluated in the tumor models showed no effect on mortality or incidence of tumors.

In clinical studies to date, we and our independent data monitoring committee have not identified any evidence to suggest tumor risk in the use of roxadustat.

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

No QT Prolongation . We conducted a Thorough QT study evaluating roxadustat doses up to 5 mg/kg (approximately four times the average maintenance dose studied in the NDD-CKD patient population). A lengthened QT interval is a biomarker for certain ventricular arrhythmias and a risk factor for sudden death. Our results demonstrate that roxadustat did not affect the QT interval in this study. Based on the extensive safety data collected to date, we believe that roxadustat has a favorable safety profile that supports its further development in Phase 3 clinical studies. &#160;

Our Global Phase 3 Program for Roxadustat

In support of our efforts for regulatory approval in the U.S. and Europe, we have continued with our partners to progress on our global Phase 3 clinical program for roxadustat . FibroGen China has also begun enrolling patients in its Phase 3 program in China, and Astellas is responsible for Phase 3 studies in Japan. Roxadustat is the first HIF-PH inhibitor to enter Phase 3 clinical trials. This broad Phase 3 program is designed to meet regulatory approval requirements of multiple regions, and is being jointly implemented with our partners, Astellas and AstraZeneca. The below chart summarizes our ongoing and planned Phase 3 clinical trials, all of which include Hb level maintenance as a study objective once correction or conversion is achieved.

To maximize the commercial potential for roxadustat, we have incorporated several unique elements into our Phase 3 program. We are performing the first placebo-controlled Phase 3 studies in NDD-CKD patients to potentially demonstrate the benefits of anemia therapy and safety of roxadustat compared to placebo. We are also performing the largest Phase 3 study in incident dialysis anemia patients, who have the highest risk for death, and are the most difficult patients to stabilize and treat for anemia in CKD. Based on data from our Phase 2 studies, we believe that roxadustat may offer a safer alternative to ESAs for this particularly vulnerable patient population. We are also evaluating the cardiovascular safety of roxadustat compared to placebo in NDD-CKD patients to first demonstrate a lack of increased risk to qualify for marketing approval by the FDA, and in these patients we will have an opportunity to measure improvements in patient outcomes with anemia therapy. Separately, we are evaluating cardiovascular safety of roxadustat compared to ESA in DD-CKD patients.

&#160;

Primary and Secondary Endpoints of Our Phase 3 Program 

With our partners, we have designed our Phase 3 studies to evaluate the following endpoints, most of which were evaluated in our Phase 2 studies.

&#160;

&#183; 

Primary efficacy endpoints for anemia correction studies: 

&#160;

o 

U.S.: Hb change from baseline to the average Hb level during weeks 28-52. 

&#160;

o 

EU: Cumulative % patients with Hb response by week 24. Hb response is defined as Hb of 11 g/dL and an increase of at least 1 g/dL from baseline. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Primary efficacy endpoints for conversion and maintenance studies: 

&#160;

o 

U.S.: Hb change from baseline to the average Hb level during weeks 28-52. 

&#160;

o 

EU: Hb change from baseline to the average Hb level during weeks 28-36. 

&#160;

&#183; 

The primary safety endpoints for U.S. approval will be MACE, which is a composite endpoint designed to identify major safety concerns, in particular relating to cardiovascular events such as cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction and stroke, and will be pooled across multiple studies and evaluated separately in our NDD-CKD trials and our DD-CKD trials. 

&#160;

&#183; 

We expect that our Phase 3 clinical trials supporting approval in Europe will be required to include MACE+ as a safety endpoint which, in addition to the MACE endpoints, also incorporates measurements of hospitalization rates due to heart failure or unstable angina. 

&#160;

&#183; 

We also plan to evaluate secondary endpoints, including the following: 

&#160;

o 

IV iron usage in roxadustat-treated patients relative to ESA-treated patients with DD-CKD. 

&#160;

o 

Red blood cell transfusion rate in roxadustat-treated relative to placebo treated patients with NDD-CKD. 

&#160;

o 

Hypertension adverse events in roxadustat-treated patients relative to ESA-treated patients with DD-CKD, and blood pressure in roxadustat-treated patients relative to placebo-treated patients with NDD-CKD. 

&#160;

o 

Total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and VLDL-cholesterol levels in roxadustat-treated patients relative to placebo-treated patients with NDD-CKD and relative to ESA-treated patients in all three anemic CKD patient populations. 

&#160;

o 

Quality of life in roxadustat-treated patients relative to placebo-treated patients with NDD-CKD. 

&#160;

o 

CKD progression in roxadustat-treated patients relative to placebo-treated patients with NDD-CKD. 

&#160;

o 

Hospitalization rate in roxadustat-treated patients relative to placebo-treated patients with NDD-CKD and relative to ESA-treated patients in all three anemic CKD patient populations. 

&#160;

o 

Rate of vascular access thrombosis in roxadustat-treated patients relative to ESA-treated patients in DD-CKD. 

Dosing Regimen 

Our Phase 3 studies incorporate dosing regimens that were extensively tested in our six Phase 2 studies.

&#160;

&#183; 

Identified Dosing Regimen . The dosing regimens for our Phase 3 studies are designed to achieve an appropriate rate and magnitude of Hb rise. In our Phase 2 studies, we explored ranges of therapeutic doses under several dosing regimens, including both tier-weight and fixed starting doses and conversion doses. Our Phase 3 program will use two tier-weight starting doses for ESA-naive patients (70 mg for patients between 45 and 70 kg and 100 mg for patients between 70 and 160 kg). Our Phase 3 dosing strategies are based on our understanding of effective approaches, derived from our Phase 2 studies, tested in modeling and simulation, and were designed to achieve Hb correction for patients with varying dose requirements in a manner that is optimal for both patients and physicians. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Dose Titration . Our Phase 3 program will use a pre-determined sequence of dose steps to titrate to a patient&#8217;s particular response to roxadustat, which we found to be simple to use and sufficient to correct anemia in our Phase 2 studies. In our Phase 2 anemia correction studies, only one or two cycles of dose titration were necessary to achieve Hb correction in at least 80% of patients on average. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Dose Conversion for Dialysis Patients Previously Treated with ESAs . In our Phase 2 conversion studies, we tested a variety of starting doses and developed a mathematical relationship between baseline ESA dose and roxadustat dose required to maintain Hb levels. We use dose conversion tables derived from these Phase 2 studies to formulate starting roxadustat doses in our Phase 3 trials for patients who switch to roxadustat from ESAs. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Dose Frequency . In preclinical and Phase 1 studies, we observed that intermittent dosing yielded optimal responses to roxadustat. Our Phase 2 studies indicated that three times weekly, twice weekly and weekly dosing regimens achieved Hb maintenance. Our Phase 3 program will dose three times weekly for all studies except two (060 and 0608) which will dose some patients twice per week and some patients once per week. We believe that intermittent dosing may help ensure a consistent and durable treatment effect for several reasons: &#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Greater Hb Response While Minimizing Total Drug Exposure. Early preclinical studies in rodents with a HIF-PH inhibitor (that was not FG-4592) indicated that a greater Hb response could be achieved using a lower total weekly dose with intermittent dosing compared to daily dosing. In the studies shown below, rats were dosed with HIF-PH inhibitor using either a daily or twice weekly dosing regimen. Both a higher Hb response and a better dose response were observed in animals dosed with HIF-PH inhibitor twice weekly compared to animals that were dosed daily. Furthermore, the total weekly dose required to achieve this greater Hb response was lower than with daily dosing exposure. 

In addition, our previous preclinical studies suggested that a wider therapeutic window was achieved with intermittent dosing compared with daily dosing. Preclinical observations such as these led us to conclude that intermittent dosing could enable a better Hb response with a lower overall drug exposure and offer a potentially wider therapeutic window.

&#160;

&#183; 

Reduce the Risk of Changing the HIF Set Point . The HIF system has a built-in negative feedback mechanism. Genes for two of the PHD enzymes that are responsible for degrading HIF under normal oxygen conditions are actually HIF target genes. Thus, while these PHD enzymes are inhibited by hypoxia (or by a HIF-PH inhibitor), the resulting HIF activation leads to an increase in the very enzymes that are responsible for its degradation following the re-oxygenation (or potentially removal of the HIF-PH inhibitor). This negative feedback mechanism is important in enabling the HIF system to reset. However, under chronically hypoxic conditions, it has been shown that the elevation in PHD enzyme levels is maintained, leading to a change in the HIF set-point. Based on this knowledge of HIF biology, it is our belief that prolonged HIF activation by a HIF-PH inhibitor drug could similarly lead to a change in the HIF set-point, which we believe may then require an increased HIF-PH inhibitor dose to elicit the same HIF response. In an effort to avoid this potential risk, and to potentially prolong drug effectiveness, we have undertaken an intermittent dosing regimen. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Increase Intervals Between HIF Activation . The kinetics of HIF target gene induction (including genes encoding PHD enzymes) are variable, with some HIF target genes being induced very quickly after HIF activation and others requiring longer periods of HIF activation for significant induction. We believe that increasing the intervals between HIF activation using an intermittent dosing regimen has the potential to limit the HIF target gene response. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Potential Commercial Advantages . We expect that a dosing regimen that enables dosing concurrently with hemodialysis treatment, typically administered on a thrice weekly basis, will be more commercially attractive in the dialysis market. 

&#160;

Our Phase 2 studies indicated that intermittent dosing enabled anemia correction up to 24 weeks and Hb maintenance up to 19 weeks when converting a patient from ESA. 

Clinical Trial Eligibility, Iron Status, and Iron Supplementation During Treatment

Unlike ESA clinical trials where patient study eligibility criteria included a requirement of adequate iron availability (measured by ferritin &#179; 100 ng/mL and TSAT &#179; 20%) and encouraged IV iron use, roxadustat Phase 2 studies included anemic NDD-CKD patients with ferritin &#179; 30 ng/mL and TSAT &#179; 5% and anemic DD-CKD patients with ferritin &#179; 50 ng/mL and TSAT &#179; 10%, which permits the inclusion of patients who are iron deficient. Hb response was generally achieved in iron deficient NDD-CKD and DD-CKD patients (ferritin &#60;100 ng/mL and TSAT&#60; 20%) despite the fact that IV iron was not allowed during roxadustat treatment.

Our placebo-controlled Phase 3 NDD-CKD studies will use iron eligibility criteria employed in our Phase 2 studies, allow oral iron, but prohibit the use of IV iron (except as a rescue medication). In our Phase 3 DD-CKD studies, since ESA serves as the comparator and similar treatment conditions are required for roxadustat and ESA, study eligibility criteria include ferritin &#179; 100 ng/mL and TSAT &#179; 20%. Patients will be randomized to roxadustat or ESA, and will be encouraged to take oral iron as a first line supplemental agent. IV iron is permitted if there is inadequate Hb response to treatment and if the patient is iron deficient (ferritin &#60;100 ng/mL and TSAT&#60; 20%).

Status with Regulatory Agencies

In the last four years, we and our collaboration partners have had interactions with regulatory agencies in multiple territories regarding the planned development and potential path to approval of roxadustat.

We met with the FDA in May, June and July of 2014 to discuss the overall scope of our Phase 3 development program. In order to comply with FDA&#8217;s recommendation, we have designed and sized our Phase 3 program for, and will incorporate MACE composite safety endpoints that we believe will be required for approval in the U.S. for all new anemia therapies.

We have also discussed our Phase 3 clinical development program with three National Health Authorities in the EU and obtained scientific advice from the European Medicines Agency, which was confirmed in writing in January 2014 with respect to the adequacy of our current clinical development program to support the indication for the treatment of anemia in NDD-CKD and DD-CKD patients. We expect the MAA submission in Europe to precede our NDA filing in the U.S.

Investigational New Drug and Clinical Trial Applications

Roxadustat is being studied under one Investigational New Drug Application (&#8220;IND&#8221;), and several Clinical Trial Applications (&#8220;CTAs&#8221;), all with a specified indication of treatment of anemia in CKD. We originally submitted the IND in the U.S. to the FDA in April 2006. Our collaboration partner, Astellas, submitted the CTA in Japan to the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency in June 2009. We and our collaboration partners Astellas and AstraZeneca have also submitted CTAs in Europe, Latin America, Canada, Russia, and Asia, beginning in 2013.

Opportunities in Other Anemia Indications

Based on roxadustat&#8217;s safety and efficacy profile to date and other potential advantages over ESAs, we believe that in addition to treating anemia in CKD, roxadustat has the potential to treat anemia associated with many other conditions, such as chemotherapy-induced anemia, anemia related to inflammatory diseases, MDS and surgical procedure requiring transfusions. We think that roxadustat, if successful, could potentially address the significant unmet need in these anemia markets. In the first half of 2016, we plan on submitting a clinical trial application in China to study roxadustat in MDS. We also plan on submitting a clinical trial application in China to study roxadustat in chemotherapy induced anemia in 2016. 

We investigated the effects of roxadustat in rats with cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury (&#8220;AKI&#8221;), a model of chemotherapy induced anemia. Cisplatin injection (5 mg/kg) induced AKI as reflected by an increase in serum creatinine and a significant increase in Blood Urea Nitrogen (&#8220;BUN&#8221;) concentrations. Animals were treated with vehicle control (n=8) or roxadustat at 20 and 40 mg/kg (n=6/group) via oral dosing 3 times a week for 2 weeks starting at 2 hours after cisplatin administration. 

Cisplatin treatment significantly decreased reticulocyte counts at day 4 and roxadustat restored the reticulocyte counts in a dose dependent fashion. By day 14, cisplatin caused significant reduction of Hb levels and roxadustat normalized Hb concentration in a dose dependent fashion in the cisplatin-treated rats. Treatment with roxadustat at the higher dose (40 mg/kg), but not at the lower dose (20 mg/kg), prevented the increase in serum creatinine and BUN levels. This study demonstrated that roxadustat, in an intermittent dosing regimen starting 2 hours before cisplatin administration, improved renal function as measured by creatinine and BUN levels in a cisplatin-induced AKI and effectively ameliorated cisplatin-induced anemia. 

&#160;

HIF-PH Inhibitor Platform 

We have been a world leader in prolyl hydroxylase inhibition since the mid-nineties. Over the past two decades, we have built a robust drug discovery platform based on our deep understanding of the inhibition of prolyl hydroxylase enzymes using small molecules. Our platform is supported not only by internal research but also by numerous academic collaborations, including a long-standing funded collaboration with a research group at the University of Oulu, Finland, headed for many years by our scientific co-founder, Dr. Kari I. Kivirikko. Dr. Kivirikko is one of the world&#8217;s leading experts in collagen prolyl hydroxylases, and he remains an advisor to us.

Prior to the discovery of HIF regulation by prolyl hydroxylase activity, we had acquired compound collections from several pharmaceutical companies and assembled a diverse library of prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors to target collagen prolyl hydroxylase enzymes for fibrosis. Consequently, we were particularly well positioned to rapidly generate proof-of-concept for a number of aspects of HIF biology, and to direct medicinal chemistry efforts towards increasing potency and selectivity for the newly identified HIF-PH enzymes.

We have applied our expertise in the field of HIF-PH inhibition to develop an understanding, not only of the role of HIF in erythropoiesis, but also of other areas of HIF biology with important therapeutic implications. This consistent progression of discovery has led to findings relating to HIF-mediated effects associated with inflammatory pathways, various aspects of iron metabolism, insulin sensitivity and glucose and fat metabolism, neurological disease, and stroke. The extensive patent portfolio covering our discoveries represents an important competitive advantage.

The strength of our platform capitalizes on these internal discoveries, as well as some of the complexities of HIF biology that we and the scientific community have uncovered over the past decade. There are at least three different HIF-PH enzymes that are known to regulate the stability of HIF &#8212; these enzymes are commonly referred to in the scientific literature as PHD1, PHD2 and PHD3. Studies of genetically modified mice, in which the individual HIF-PH enzymes have been deleted, have revealed that PHD2 plays a major role in the regulation of erythropoiesis by HIF. In contrast, PHD1 and PHD3 appear to play less important roles in HIF-mediated erythropoiesis, but instead have been implicated in other important biological pathways.

We believe that inhibitors selectively targeting PHD1 or PHD3 could have important therapeutic applications beyond anemia. For example, as PHD1 has been implicated in ischemic tissue injury, it has been proposed that PHD1 inhibitors may provide a novel therapeutic approach to protect organs and tissues from ischemic damage. PHD3 on the other hand has been implicated in insulin signaling, raising the possibility that PHD3 inhibitors may have therapeutic utility in the treatment of diabetes. Despite the challenges associated with selectively inhibiting just one enzyme from a closely related family, we have made important advances in the identification of selective HIF-PH inhibitors. We currently have active research programs focused on exploring the therapeutic utility of PHD1 selective inhibitors and PHD3 selective inhibitors for use as cardioprotective agents or for the treatment of metabolic disease such as diabetes . 

ROXADUSTAT FOR THE TREATMENT OF ANEMIA IN CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE IN CHINA

We are currently performing two Phase 3 trials in China to support approval of roxadustat for treatment of anemia in DD-CKD and NDD-CKD patients. Our ongoing Phase 3 trials are designed to confirm Phase 2 results and are similar in design and endpoints to our Phase 2 trials in DD-CKD and NDD-CKD, except that our Phase 3 trials will include a larger number of patients and will study longer dosing durations. 

We believe there is a particularly significant unmet medical need for the treatment of anemia in CKD in China. Specifically, anemia is undertreated in the rapidly growing number of dialysis stage patients and anemia is not treated in non-dialysis patients including patients who are eligible for dialysis but are not treated due to a shortage of dialysis facilities, and cannot easily obtain anemia treatment outside of the dialysis system. In the context of the rapidly growing Chinese pharmaceutical market, we believe that the demand for anemia therapy will continue to grow as a result of an expanding CKD population, as well as the central government&#8217;s mandate to make dialysis, which is still in the early stages of infrastructure development, more available through expansion of government reimbursement and build-out of dialysis facilities. We believe that roxadustat is a particularly promising product candidate for this market.

Addressable Patient Populations in China

Based on a cross-sectional survey performed between September 2009 and September 2010 published in the Lancet (Zhang, et al. Lancet (2012)), there are an estimated 119.5 million CKD patients in China. There were approximately 19 million patients in CKD stage 3, stage 4 and stage 5 which we have grouped into three categories: DD-CKD patients; Dialysis Eligible patients who need dialysis under treatment guidelines but are not dialyzed (&#8220;Dialysis Eligible NDD-CKD&#8221;); and stages 3 and 4 patients as well as stage 5 patients who are not eligible for dialysis (&#8220;Other NDD-CKD&#8221;).

&#160;

DD-CKD (Dialysis) 

Dialysis can be delivered in the form of HD, or peritoneal dialysis (&#8220;PD&#8221;). In China, HD is mostly performed at dialysis clinics within hospitals, not at freestanding dialysis centers outside of hospitals which is the common practice in the U.S. PD is self-administered at home by patients, and they visit their nephrologists on a monthly basis at the hospital for monitoring and follow-up.

Dialysis Eligible NDD-CKD

Dialysis Eligible NDD-CKD refers to patients who need dialysis under Chinese treatment guidelines but are not dialyzed. The Chinese treatment guidelines recommend initiation of dialysis at eGFR&#60;10 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (and eGFR&#60;15 mL/min/1.73m 2 for diabetic nephropathy patients). The Minister of Health estimated that one to two million people in China were eligible for dialysis in 2011, and of those we believe that only 300,000 to 400,000 are on dialysis. While the size of dialysis population is large and approaches that of the U.S., it nevertheless falls far short of the number who require dialysis treatment. We believe that this Dialysis Eligible NDD-CKD population is characteristic of developing markets like China and is at risk for severe anemia.

Other NDD-CKD

Other NDD-CKD refers to the other sub-groups of CKD patients within non-dialysis who are earlier stage: CKD patients in stage 3 and stage 4, as well as stage 5 who are not eligible for dialysis. Many of these patients receive medical care in endocrinology, cardiology or internal medicine clinics where they are treated for their primary disease.

Unmet Medical Need

DD-CKD Patients are Under-Treated for Anemia

We believe there is chronic under-treatment for anemia within the DD-CKD patient population, as many patients do not reach target Hb levels despite ESA therapy. The consensus opinion of the expert panel assembled by the Chinese Journal of Nephrology in 2013 advocated treating to Hb 11.0 g/dL to 13.0 g/dL, whereas we believe, based on our key opinion leader Advisory Board Meeting in Shanghai in March 2013 that in clinical practice, nephrologists generally use Hb 10.0 g/dL to 12.0 g/dL as the target. However, according to the 2012 Shanghai Dialysis Registry, approximately 50% of patients in Shanghai did not exceed a Hb level of 10.0 g/dL and approximately 75% did not exceed Hb 11.0 g/dL. Over 19% of dialysis patients failed to reach a severely low Hb level of 8.0 g/dL. The Chinese Renal Data System reported that in 2011, the most recently reported data, the average Hb level of DD-CKD patients in the registry was approximately 9.1 g/dL and the percentage of patients who reached Hb levels greater than or equal to 11.0 g/dL was only about 21%.

We believe there are a number of factors that have led to under-treatment of anemia in the dialysis population, including:

&#160;

&#183; 

The ESA doses used are generally not sufficient to treat to target Hb levels for certain patient populations. We believe that the reasons include constraints on reimbursement for anemia treatment and fixed hospital pharmacy budgets, as well as safety and efficacy limitations of these drugs. Lower dose levels are particularly ineffective in the hypo-responsive patient population. 

&#160;

&#183; 

The use of IV iron, which is often needed to correct Hb to target levels with ESAs, is limited due to limited reimbursement and perceived clinical risk. According to the Shanghai Dialysis Registry, in 2011, less than 9% of dialysis patients in Shanghai were treated with IV iron. 

&#160;

&#183; 

For the PD population, where patients are not already visiting the hospital for HD and are receiving ESA treatment during dialysis, similar logistical and financial issues that impede ESA use in the NDD-CKD population discussed below apply to these patients. 

Dialysis Eligible NDD-CKD and Other NDD-CKD Patients are Largely Un-Treated for Anemia

Apart from the ESAs used by the dialysis patients in China, we believe that there is a low level of use of ESAs in the non-dialysis population. Based on our clinical trial experience in China, we believe use of ESAs in this population is generally limited to &#8220;CKD Clinics&#8221; at major research hospitals in top cities where CKD patients are admitted into programs for academic research purposes. We believe there are a number of significant impediments that inhibit the use of ESAs in the outpatient setting, for patients who are not already visiting the hospital for dialysis treatment on a regular basis.

&#160;

&#183; 

Generally, under the Chinese healthcare system, patients do not have a personal physician but rather are seen by the physician on the schedule on the day of the visit. This limited continuity of care makes managing the potential risks of ESAs and the titration of ESA treatment needed to maintain Hb within target range particularly difficult. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Hypertension and associated co-morbidities are top risk factors for the CKD population. Many physicians in China believe that for the outpatient NDD-CKD population, the risk of developing new or exacerbating existing hypertension from ESA with the attendant risk of worsening renal failure outweigh the benefits of treating anemia. &#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Injectable drugs like ESAs present a challenge in China because even subcutaneous administration is performed at hospitals and not in the home. Frequent hospital visits for injections, for the sole purpose of receiving ESA treatment, can present a substantial logistical and financial burden on patients. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Nephrologists are the primary prescribers of ESAs. Those CKD patients with hypertension or diabetes who are treated by other physicians, such as cardiologists and endocrinologists, are generally not treated with ESAs. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Non-dialysis patients are covered under outpatient reimbursement, unlike dialysis patients who are covered under Severe Disease reimbursement, when available. The lower level of reimbursement coverage means a higher patient co-pay, which further limits ESA use and compliance. 

We believe that these impediments have contributed to a low rate of ESA use in the NDD-CKD population in China, and that roxadustat, as an oral agent triggering the HIF mechanism of action, has the potential to make this population accessible for effective anemia treatment in CKD.

Growing Market Opportunity

Healthcare expenditures in China have more than doubled between 2006 and 2011, from $156 billion to $357 billion. China is projected by IMS Health to become the world&#8217;s second largest pharmaceutical market after the U.S. by 2016 (IMS Market Prognosis, May 2012). We believe several factors will continue to drive the growth of the overall pharmaceutical market in China as well as the market for the treatment of anemia in CKD. These factors include continuing urbanization, an aging population and the increasing prevalence of chronic diseases (particularly diabetes and hypertension which are common causes of CKD), and income growth. We also believe that the increasing standard of living will drive higher rates of disease awareness, leading to greater rates of diagnosis and treatment.

The strong growth in the China healthcare sector is a direct result of central government policy. In 2009, the Chinese government implemented healthcare reform that greatly expanded reimbursement coverage across population, scope, and level of coverage, and in 2011, the 12 th Five Year Plan placed the biomedical industry and development of innovative medicines as a strategic priority for the country.

Current ESA Market Size and Drivers of Market Growth in China

Total ESA sales in China were approximately $145 million in 2013, and the ESA market in China has grown at a 25% compound annual growth rate between 2006 and 2013 based on data from IMS Health.

&#160;

We believe that given the limited availability of dialysis in China, the dialysis market is still in the early stages of development relative to the U.S., and has the potential for sustained long-term growth. We believe growth of dialysis will be driven by the expansion of reimbursement and expansion of dialysis facilities. We further believe that the growing pipeline of CKD patients and expansion of reimbursement will drive growth in demand for anemia treatment in CKD patients. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Expansion of Reimbursement . Reimbursement exists for the use of ESAs in the treatment of anemia in CKD and the coverage levels are expanding. Under Basic Medical Insurance, the reimbursement program for the urban population, coverage for healthcare and drugs is categorized into one of three categories: outpatient, inpatient, and Severe Disease. Both the Dialysis Eligible and Other NDD-CKD patients are reimbursed under outpatient coverage. As an example, coverage levels for outpatient are in the 60-85% range in Shanghai, depending on level of hospital visited and patient age. Dialysis patients, on the other hand, receive reimbursement under the more generous Severe Disease coverage, which is reimbursement for catastrophic healthcare expenditures. Coverage levels are set at a minimum level of 50% by policy and are as high as 85% for employees and 92% for retirees in Shanghai. We expect the availability of Severe Disease reimbursement to significantly drive the utilization of dialysis services and ESAs in the coming years. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Expansion of Dialysis Infrastructure . The number of DD-CKD patients increased from approximately 70,000 in 2007 to an estimated 300,000 to 400,000 in 2013 and has grown at a compound annual growth rate of 25% to 30% per year from 2007 to 2013. Despite this substantial rate of growth, the Ministry of Health and the Chinese Society of Nephrology have publicly recognized the need for further investment in dialysis infrastructure to accommodate the expected continued growth of the patient population requiring dialysis. PD is an alternative to HD and does not require the level of capital investment in facilities and equipment that is necessary to enable HD. At the end of 2012, PD was estimated to account for 10% of the current dialysis population. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Demographics-Driven Growth . Diabetes and hypertension are common causes of CKD, the rates of which have been growing in China over past two decades. China is experiencing epidemiological changes in metabolic diseases due to economic development, urbanization and an aging population. We believe the increase in diabetes and hypertension prevalence will result in increasing numbers of patients with CKD in the future. 

Our China Solution

We believe that roxadustat, if approved, has the potential to address the unmet medical need for the treatment of anemia in each of the three categories of CKD patients in China. Several of the safety, efficacy, reimbursement and convenience advantages that roxadustat, our oral therapeutic, potentially offers over ESAs (refer to &#8220;&#8212; Our Solution &#8212; Roxadustat &#8212; A Novel, Orally Administered Treatment for Anemia &#8221;) are particularly applicable in the China market.

Roxadustat May Address Chronic Under-Treatment in DD-CKD Patients

We expect roxadustat to be viewed as more attractive than ESAs, and particularly attractive within certain categories of the dialysis population &#8212; patients who are not treated to target Hb levels for any reason, patients who are hyporesponsive to ESAs, patients on PD, which is home-based, and DD-CKD patients who have not previously received ESA treatment.

&#160;

&#183; 

Roxadustat May Increase Rate of Successful Anemia Treatment . We believe that the level of ESA dosing generally used in China is not adequate to achieve target Hb levels for many dialysis patients, especially with minimal use of IV iron. The dose levels used are within a very narrow range due to clinical concerns over ESA safety at higher doses. Moreover, reimbursement limits may cap ESA dose. In contrast, assuming roxadustat is approved, we believe we can price roxadustat so that reimbursable doses of roxadustat will be sufficient to treat most patients to target Hb levels. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Roxadustat May Address Hyporesponsiveness . Hyporesponsive patients, who often fail to respond to ESA treatment, in particular are often inadequately treated due to need for significantly higher doses of ESAs. Our data suggest that roxadustat may be safe and effective in this patient population without the use of high doses. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Roxadustat May Reduce Requirements for IV Iron . ESAs generally require IV iron for effective anemia treatment, and IV iron use is limited in China due to limited reimbursement and perceived clinical risk. Roxadustat potentially eliminates the need for IV iron to reach treatment target. 

Roxadustat May Address Lack of Access of ESA Treatment in NDD-CKD Patients

We view NDD-CKD as the segment where roxadustat, with the benefits of the HIF mechanism of action and being an orally administered small molecule, could potentially represent the only viable treatment solution for this patient population.

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Roxadustat May Make Treatment Accessible and Feasible . As an oral agent, roxadustat eliminates the need for frequent hospital visits which are needed for ESA administration, decreasing the overall cost and inconvenience of treatment, particularly for DD-CKD patients undergoing PD who are otherwise treated in the home, as well as Dialysis Eligible NDD-CKD and Other NDD-CKD patients. &#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Roxadustat May Have an Improved Safety Profile . ESA treatment is associated with an increased risk of severe adverse events including hypertension, stroke, myocardial infarction and death. Our data suggest that roxadustat may not increase the risk of these events and therefore may be safer than ESAs thereby potentially removing a significant deterrent to anemia therapy in China. 

Roxadustat May Add Value in Both the NDD-CKD and DD-CKD Patient Populations

&#160;

&#183; 

Roxadustat May Reduce Overall Cost of Treatment Associated With Anemia . For the equivalent reimbursement cost to the government, we believe that roxadustat may deliver a higher potential clinical benefit compared to ESAs. Roxadustat, if approved, could treat patients to target Hb level. Roxadustat could also potentially lower the use of IV iron and anti-hypertensives. Moreover, the total cost of care would be reduced by lowering loss of time and cost of hospital-based ESA injections, and eliminating the infrastructure costs necessary to store ESAs in a cold storage environment. Finally, patients would benefit by reducing the cost of travel to the hospital and the potential lost wages for hospital visits. 

Commercialization

Regulatory Strategy

We plan to seek product approval from the CFDA, as a Domestic Class 1.1 drug through our China subsidiary, FibroGen China. FibroGen China submitted a CTA to the CFDA for roxadustat for the treatment of anemia in CKD in March 2013. This Domestic Class 1.1 designation allows us to use the &#8220;green channel,&#8221; which may facilitate expedited approval with access to the regulatory authorities for formal and informal dialogue about development plans. We believe the domestic pathway represents the fastest route for bringing roxadustat to market and providing patients with access to a potentially safer, more effective, more convenient and more accessible therapy.

We believe the development of roxadustat is aligned with the Chinese government&#8217;s current policies. The Chinese government is building dialysis infrastructure to address the unmet need for dialysis. We believe that anemia treatment is a critical component of any national dialysis program, and the cost of anemia treatment is an important factor in the public health burden of CKD.

FibroGen China has completed Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials in China and began enrollment in its Phase 3 clinical trials in China in the fourth quarter of 2015, with initial Phase 3 data expected in the second half of 2016 and, assuming the Phase 3 clinical trial is successful, possible NDA approval in China in late-2017. However, actual dates depend on a variety of factors and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including with respect to patient enrollment, safety results, manufacturing, third party contractors and government regulators, some of which are out of our control (such as the recent backlog in CFDA review of pending clinical trial applications). Refer to &#8220; Risk Factors &#8221;, and particularly those risk factors under the heading &#8220; Risks Related to the Development and Commercialization of Our Product Candidates. &#8221; These trials have been conducted, and will continue to be conducted, in parallel with but independently of the other trials conducted in the global roxadustat development program. All available safety data from the global program will be included in the China NDA submission.

Manufacturing Certification

FibroGen China plans to secure all New Drug and Manufacturing Licenses (including a Drug Approval Code) required for commercialization of roxadustat in China. A Manufacturing License is fundamental for production and sale of drugs in China, and it is the Manufacturing License, not the New Drug License which is granted at NDA approval, that gives FibroGen China the right to market roxadustat. With the Manufacturing License, FibroGen China will have the right to sell roxadustat (issue &#8220;fa-piaos,&#8221; or invoices, for the sale) into the highly regulated pharmaceutical distribution system, and recognize revenues for such sale. FibroGen China will also have the right to negotiate pricing with the government and the right to apply for reimbursement for roxadustat.

FibroGen China has completed construction and validation of its manufacturing facility in Beijing. We received a Pharmaceutical Production Permit, which is a general certification by the CFDA that the facility is deemed ready for current good manufacturing practices (&#8220;cGMP&#8221;) production in August 2014, and we expect to receive the Manufacturing Licenses that will allow the Beijing facility to manufacture roxadustat for the commercial market after NDA approval and successful completion of the registration and validation campaigns and associated CFDA inspections. (Refer to &#8220;&#8212; Manufacture and Supply&#8221; and &#8220;&#8212; Government Regulation &#8212; Regulation in China&#8221;) .

&#160;

Market Segmentation 

We believe DD-CKD market in China is readily addressable in the near term, and we believe roxadustat has the potential to deliver a compelling value proposition in particular to certain subgroups within DD-CKD: patients who are not treated to target Hb levels for any reason, patients who are hypo-responsive to ESAs, and patients on PD, which is performed at home. In addition, we believe that roxadustat, if approved, would have the potential to be the preferred anemia treatment for newly-initiated dialysis patients who have not been previously treated with ESA. With the expected expansion of Severe Disease reimbursement, we believe that the number of DD-CKD patients will increase steadily. We believe that it could require more than a decade for China to address the treatment gap between patients who need dialysis and those who are actually dialyzed.

If roxadustat is approved, we believe the Dialysis Eligible NDD-CKD population could represent another readily accessible and potentially new market segment for anemia therapy. There is an urgent and severe unmet medical need for these very sick patients, and the current low rate of treatment within this patient group could be addressed by an approved anemia treatment such as roxadustat. We view the Other NDD-CKD population as a longer term market opportunity where the potential number of patients could be substantial.

We believe the hospital-based nature of the China healthcare system is a very attractive feature of this market as it lends itself to rapid adoption of roxadustat within nephrology practices and across specialties, unlike in the U.S. where dialysis is performed separately at freestanding dialysis centers and CKD is treated at widely dispersed clinics and primary care offices across the country. In China, within nephrology, the same physicians care for dialysis, Dialysis Eligible NDD-CKD and Other NDD-CKD patients. Moreover, cardiologists and endocrinologists are located at the same hospitals as nephrologists, and prescriptions from all specialties are often filled at the same hospital pharmacy; as a result, the points of sale are highly concentrated.

Reimbursement

As roxadustat is potentially a chronic use drug that addresses an unmet medical need and is intended to benefit large numbers of Chinese patients, we intend to apply for reimbursement by the Chinese government. Pricing for drugs sold without reimbursement is determined by the drug manufacturer, whereas pricing for drugs under reimbursement is determined by the government. We believe the compelling pharmaco-economic value proposition will support fair pricing for roxadustat.

AstraZeneca

We have entered into an agreement with AstraZeneca relating to roxadustat in China. Under the agreement, FibroGen China will hold all of the regulatory licenses issued by China regulatory authorities and be primarily responsible for regulatory, clinical and manufacturing activities.

AstraZeneca will conduct commercialization activities as well as serve as the national distributor for roxadustat, sourcing the distribution of roxadustat to a network of regional and local distributors. FibroGen China will be responsible for medical affairs and physician education.

We believe that the collaboration will not only help to accelerate market access and patient adoption, but also reduce our risks associated with roxadustat launch in China, as AstraZeneca has significant experience with the China market and will be paying for launch-related commercialization costs in advance and recouping 50% of these expenses from initial roxadustat profits.

Clinical Trials

Our clinical development plan is based upon an agreement with the CFDA that our NDA package will include Phase 1, 2 and 3 trials performed exclusively in China, as well as reference data from Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials performed outside of China.

Completed Clinical Trials of Roxadustat in China

We have successfully completed Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials in China. A summary of our data and comparison to data from our trials performed outside of China is as follows:

Phase 1 Trials

We completed Phase 1 trials of single and multiple ascending doses of roxadustat. Key findings were:

&#160;

&#183; 

Roxadustat pharmacokinetic parameters in Chinese are similar to those in Caucasians and Japanese. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Stimulation of endogenous EPO, a marker of roxadustat pharmacodynamics, in Chinese is similar to stimulation in Caucasians and Japanese. &#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Roxadustat was well tolerated and there were no negative safety signals. 

Phase 2 Trials

We completed a Phase 2 double-blind placebo controlled trial in NDD-CKD patients and a Phase 2 randomized trial of roxadustat compared to epoetin alfa in DD-CKD patients. Results of these trials are very similar to results from comparable trials performed in the U.S. Refer to &#8220; Business &#8212; Our Development Program for Roxadustat. &#8221; The results of the DD-CKD trial were presented at the 2013 World Congress of Nephrology and the results of the NDD-CKD trial were presented at the 2013 American Society of Nephrology meeting. Key findings of these trials are as follows:

DD-CKD Trial Results

&#160;

&#183; 

Roxadustat achieved Hb maintenance in DD-CKD patients who discontinued treatment with epoetin alfa. 

&#160;

&#183; 

In a post-hoc analysis, the data met the primary endpoint of our planned Phase 3 trial in China in this patient population. 

&#160;

&#183; 

There were no serious adverse events after starting roxadustat and most common adverse events were muscle spasms, abdominal discomfort, decreased appetite and infections which were typical of those expected for DD-CKD patients. There were no dose-related trends or imbalances in the nature of adverse events between roxadustat and epoetin alfa groups. 

NDD-CKD Trial Results

&#160;

&#183; 

By Week 9, roxadustat increased Hb levels significantly compared to placebo (p&#60;0.001). 

&#160;

&#183; 

In a post-hoc analysis, the data met the primary endpoint of our planned Phase 3 trial in China in this patient population. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Serious adverse events were progression of CKD, infection and high potassium levels and the most common adverse events were infections, high potassium levels, nausea and dizziness. The percentage of patients with adverse events was similar for patients treated with roxadustat compared to patients treated with placebo. There were no imbalances in the nature of adverse events between the patient groups. 

Strategy for Continued Development of Roxadustat in China

We dosed our first patients in our DD-CKD and NDD-CKD Phase 3 trials in China in December 2015. Our planned Phase 3 trials are designed to confirm Phase 2 results and are similar in design and endpoints to our Phase 2 trials in DD-CKD and NDD-CKD, except that our Phase 3 trials will include a larger number of patients and will study longer dosing durations. The overall designs of our planned Phase 3 trials are as follows:

Phase 3 Trial in DD-CKD (FGCL-4592-806):

&#160;

&#183; 

Design: Randomized, multicenter, open-label, active control. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Patients: CKD on dialysis. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Number: 300. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Control treatment: epoetin alfa. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Randomization: 2:1 (roxadustat:epoetin alfa). 

&#160;

&#183; 

Dosing duration: 26 weeks with option for some patients to continue dosing to Week 52. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Primary endpoint: Hb mean change from baseline averaged over Weeks 23 to 27. 

Phase 3 Trial in NDD-CKD (FGCL-4592-808):

&#160;

&#183; 

Design: Randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo controlled. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Patients: CKD not on dialysis. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Number: 150. &#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Control treatment: placebo. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Randomization: 2:1 (roxadustat:placebo). 

&#160;

&#183; 

Dosing duration: 8 weeks followed by open-label treatment to week 26 and option for some patients to continue dosing to week 52. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Primary endpoint: Hb mean change from baseline averaged over Weeks 7 to 9 . 

In designing these trials, we had several important considerations:

&#160;

&#183; 

We had successful Phase 2 trials, and in post-hoc analyses our Phase 2 trial results met the primary endpoints of our planned Phase 3 trials. 

&#160;

&#183; 

The dosing regimens in our planned Phase 3 trials are based on the dosing regimens in our China Phase 2 trials doses that met the primary endpoints. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Dosing duration to meet the primary endpoint in the NDD-CKD Phase 3 trial is identical to the China Phase 2 trial dosing duration with additional dosing beyond eight weeks as part of this trial. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Dosing duration to meet the primary endpoint in the DD-CKD Phase 3 trial is longer than the China Phase 2 trial dosing duration but similar to U.S. Phase 2 trial dosing duration. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Increased number of patients in Phase 3 increases the trials&#8217; power, or ability to detect the primary endpoint. 

Planned Phase 4 Studies 

The CFDA imposes a five-year monitoring surveillance period after NDA approval on all Class 1.1 innovative drugs like roxadustat. Based on current CFDA guidelines, we believe we will need to conduct a 2,000 subject post-marketing study to demonstrate the long-term safety of roxadustat as well as provide additional information related to the quality of the manufacturing process for roxadustat. The study design and patient size will be determined after Phase 3 data become available.

FG-5200 FOR THE TREATMENT OF CORNEAL BLINDNESS IN CHINA

Corneal blindness, defined as visual acuity of 3/60 or less, is caused by various factors, including scarring resulting from infections, such as herpes simplex, physical trauma, chemical injury and genetic diseases affecting the function of the cornea. In countries with sufficient tissue banks and skilled surgeons, the treatment for corneal blindness is the replacement of the damaged cornea with a corneal graft from donor corneas from human cadavers. Despite use of immunosuppressive drugs, graft rejection remains a serious problem, resulting in graft failure within five years in approximately 35% of cases in the U.S. We are developing FG-5200 for the treatment of corneal blindness resulting from partial thickness corneal damage.

In China, there are ethical or religious beliefs, cultural norms and significant infrastructure barriers that limit organ donation or tissue banking possibilities, resulting in an extreme shortage of cadaver corneas. In April 2015, a subsidiary of China Regenerative Medicine International Limited received approval for their acellular porcine cornea stroma medical device for the indication of repair of corneal ulcers in China. However, alternatives to cadaver corneas, such as synthetic corneas using collagen derived from porcine tissue or fish scales, are either experimental or to our knowledge, have not yielded satisfactory results for restoration of vision in patients with corneal blindness . In many cases of corneal blindness, infection and other factors lead to serious risks to the patient.

Market Opportunity

Approximately 40,000 corneal grafts were performed in the U.S. in 2011 using tissue from human cadavers. In contrast, while there are approximately 4 to 5 million patients in China with corneal blindness and an incidence of 100,000 cases of corneal blindness each year, there were only about 3,000 corneal grafts performed in China in 2007 using tissue from human cadavers. We believe the number of corneal grafts using cadaver tissue in China may decrease significantly due to recent changes in government policy.

&#160;

FG-5200 as a Potential Solution to This Unmet Medical Need 

FG-5200 Corneal Implant

Our expertise in fibrosis and extracellular matrix proteins has allowed us to develop processes for producing human collagen types I, II and III, as well as coordinate expression of several enzymes involved in assembly of collagen. We have successfully produced a proprietary version of recombinant human collagen III that is suitable for use in cornea repair.

FG-5200, a corneal implant medical device we are developing in China, is designed to serve as an immediately functional replacement cornea as well as a scaffold to allow for regeneration of the native corneal tissue for the primary purpose of restoration of vision . In contrast, cadaver graft tissue is never &#8220;turned over&#8221;; in fact, only limited integration occurs over the life of the graft. Our FG-5200 implant is made of recombinant human collagen that has been formed into a highly concentrated fibrillar matrix to provide physical characteristics optimal for corneal implantation.

In animal models, FG-5200 persists for less than one year, at which time native tissue has completely regrown, including both epithelium (the outer cell layer of the cornea) and stroma. The stroma in these animal models is seen to be infiltrated with nerve fibers, leading to the reacquisition of the touch response critical to the avoidance of additional corneal damage.

Corneal implants using human donor tissue are currently being reimbursed by the government, and similar to many other implantable Class III devices in China (including stents and bone grafts), we would expect that FG-5200 could be added to the reimbursement list for medical devices, if approved.

Clinical Testing of FG-5200

An initial clinical study outside of China has been conducted to test the safety and feasibility of using a biosynthetic implant composed of our recombinant human collagen , and substantially similar to FG-5200, for the treatment of severe corneal damage as an alternative to human donor tissue. Ten patients with advanced keratoconus, or severe corneal scarring, were implanted with the recombinant collagen implants and have been followed for more than five years. Two-year follow-up data were reported in Science Translational Medicine (Fagerholm et al., (2010)) and four-year follow-up data were reported in Biomaterials (Fagerholm et al., Biomaterials (2014)). Key clinical findings include the following:

&#160;

&#183; 

Patients with biosynthetic implants had a 4-year mean corrected visual acuity of 20/54 and gained on average more than 5 Snellen lines of vision on an eye chart. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Nerve re-growth and touch sensitivity was closer to that of healthy corneas and significantly better in corneas with biosynthetic implants than in human donor corneas. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Corneas with biosynthetic implants maintained a stable shape and thickness without any need for a long course of immunosuppression therapy. 

&#160;

&#183; 

There has been no recruitment of inflammatory dendritic cells into the biosynthetic implant area and no episodes of rejection, in contrast to the control arm of human donor cornea transplantation, where a rejection episode was observed. 

FG-5200 Strategy

In January 2016, our subsidiary FibroGen China received CFDA&#8217;s written notice of classification of our FG-5200 corneal implant as a Domestic Class III medical device. This allows FibroGen to develop, and if approved, to market FG-5200 corneal implants fabricated in China without any prior reference approval outside of China. 

We currently plan to manufacture FG-5200 preclinical and clinical trial material in our aseptic GMP production suite located at our Beijing manufacturing plant. We have completed process technology transfer and expect to complete the registration campaign in the second half of 2016. Materials from this campaign will be used in preclinical studies which will commence in China in the second half of this year. We expect to file a CTA at the end of 2017 and to commence the pivotal clinical trial thereafter.

We plan to develop FG-5200 in China first. If FG-5200 is successful in China, we believe there is a future opportunity to develop FG-5200 in other Asian countries where cadaver materials are in short supply, in part because cultural norms and infrastructure and other challenges in tissue banking limit tissue donations. We also believe there is an opportunity to obtain CE Marking to facilitate entry into other markets, such as Latin America. We may develop FG-5200 in the U.S. and Europe as well, where cadaver corneas are available but the required immunosuppressive therapy may make FG-5200 a potentially attractive alternative.

FG-3019 FOR THE TREATMENT OF FIBROSIS AND CANCER 

We were founded to discover and develop therapeutics for fibrosis. We began studying connective tissue growth factor (&#8220;CTGF&#8221;), shortly after its discovery. Our ongoing internal research, efforts with collaboration partners and the work of other investigators have consistently demonstrated elevated CTGF levels in pathologic fibrotic conditions characterized by sustained production of extracellular matrix (&#8220;ECM&#8221;), elements that are key molecular components of fibrosis. Our accumulated discovery research efforts indicate that CTGF is a critical common element in the progression of serious diseases associated with fibrosis.

From our library of fully-human monoclonal antibodies that bind to different parts of the CTGF protein and block various aspects of CTGF biological activity, we selected FG-3019, for which we have exclusive worldwide rights. We believe that FG-3019 blocks CTGF and inhibits its central role in causing diseases associated with fibrosis. Our data to date indicate that FG-3019 is a promising and highly differentiated product with broad potential to treat a number of fibrotic diseases and cancers. We are currently conducting Phase 2 trials in IPF, pancreatic cancer and DMD. Additionally, we are also preparing to conduct a clinical trial in liver fibrosis due to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (&#8220;NASH&#8221;). FG-3019 has received orphan drug designation in IPF in the U.S.

Based on its ability to block CTGF, FG-3019 may be a treatment for a broad array of fibrotic disorders of nearly every organ system. In animal studies of FG-3019, such as radiation-induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice, we have demonstrated that FG-3019 is capable of reversing fibrosis. In clinical trials, we have used advanced medical imaging technology to quantify changes in fibrosis throughout the lungs. Our data to date using these measures demonstrate that FG-3019 may stabilize and in some instances reverse pulmonary fibrosis and improve pulmonary function in IPF patients.

Certain cancers have a prominent ECM component that contributes to metastasis and progressive disease. Specifically, ECM is the connective tissue framework of an organ or tissue; all tumors have ECM. In the case of fibrotic tumors, ECM is more pronounced and there is more fibrosis than in other tumor types. In mouse models of pancreatic cancer, FG-3019 treatment has demonstrated reduction of tumor mass, slowing of metastasis and improvement in survival. In an open-label Phase 2 study of FG-3019 plus gemcitabine and erlotinib, FG-3019 demonstrated a dose-dependent improvement in one year survival rate. We are also currently conducting a randomized, active-control, neoadjuvant Phase 2 trial combining FG-3019 with nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine in approximately 42 patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer. 

DMD is an inherited disorder of the dystrophin gene that leads to progressive muscle loss and results in early death due to pulmonary or cardiac failure. Numerous pre-clinical studies including those in the mdx model of DMD suggest that CTGF contributes to the process by which muscle is replaced by fibrosis and fat and that CTGF may also impair muscle cell differentiation during muscle repair after injury. FG-3019 treatment has improved muscle strength and exercise endurance in the mdx model of DMD. We recently began an open label single arm trial in non-ambulatory boys with DMD.

Results to date indicate that FG-3019 has broad potential to address unmet needs for the treatment of fibrotic diseases and cancers. Specifically, given our preclinical and clinical data to date, our primary focus for clinical development of FG-3019 is in IPF , DMD and pancreatic cancer . We are also preparing to conduct an exploratory clinical trial in liver fibrosis due to NASH. 

Overview of Fibrosis

Fibrosis is an aberrant response of the body to tissue injury that may be caused by trauma, inflammation, infection, cell injury, or cancer. The normal response to injury involves the activation of cells that produce collagen and other components of the ECM that are part of the healing process. This healing process helps to fill in tissue voids created by the injury or damage, segregate infections or cancer, and provide strength to the recovering tissue. Under normal circumstances, where the cause of the tissue injury is limited, the scarring process is self-limited and the scar resolves to approximate normal tissue architecture. However, in certain disease states, this process is prolonged and excessive and results in progressive tissue scarring, or fibrosis, which can cause organ dysfunction and failure as well as, in the case of certain cancers, promote cancer progression.

&#160;

Excess CTGF Causes Fibrosis. FG-3019 Blocks CTGF and Can Reverse Fibrosis 

Excess CTGF levels are associated with fibrosis. CTGF increases the abundance of myofibroblasts, a cell type that drives wound healing, and stimulates them to deposit ECM proteins such as collagen at the site of tissue injury. In the case of normal healing of a limited tissue injury, myofibroblasts eventually die by programmed cell death, or apoptosis, and the fibrous scarring process recedes. In fibrotic conditions, excess CTGF results in chronic activation of myofibroblasts, which leads to chronic ECM deposition and fibrosis (refer to figure above).

Multiple biological agents and pathways have been implicated in the fibrotic process (Wynn J Pathol (2008)). Many fibrosis pathways converge on CTGF (refer to figure below), which the scientific literature demonstrates to be a central mediator of fibrosis (Oliver et al, J Inv Derm (2010)). In the case of cancer, the sustained tumor-associated fibrotic tissue promotes tumor cell survival and metastasis. The figure below shows the commonality of cellular mechanisms that may result in fibrosis and cancer.

Most Biological Factors Implicated in Fibrosis Work Through CTGF

&#160;

CTGF is a secreted glycoprotein produced by fibroblasts, endothelium, mesangial cells and other cell types, including cancers, and is induced by a variety of regulatory modulators, including TGF-&#223; and VEGF. CTGF expression has been demonstrated to be up-regulated in fibrotic tissues. Thus, we believe that targeting CTGF to block or inhibit its activity could stop or reverse tissue fibrosis. In addition, since CTGF is implicated in nearly all forms of fibrosis, we believe FG-3019 has the potential to provide clinical benefit in a wide range of clinical indications that are characterized by fibrosis. 

Until recently, it was believed that fibrosis was an irreversible process. It is now generally understood that the process is dynamic and potentially amenable to reversal. Based on studies in animal models of fibrosis of the liver, kidney, muscle and cardiovascular system, it has been shown that fibrosis can be reversed. It has also been demonstrated in humans that fibrosis caused by hepatitis virus can be reversed (Chang et al. Hepatology (2010)). Additionally, we have generated data in human and animal studies that lung fibrosis can be reversed in some instances upon treatment with FG-3019. We do not believe that there is clinical evidence that therapies currently on the market directly prevent or reverse fibrosis in IPF. While certain other companies are working on topical inhibition of CTGF, we are not aware of other products in development that target CTGF inhibition for deep organ fibrosis and cancer.

Clinical Development of FG-3019 &#8212; Overview

We have performed clinical trials of FG-3019 in IPF, pancreatic cancer, liver fibrosis and diabetic kidney disease. We are currently conducting an extension study for an open-label Phase 2 trial in IPF; a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled Phase 2 trial in IPF; a randomized, open label Phase 2 trial in stage 3 pancreatic cancer; and an open label single arm trial in non-ambulatory boys with DMD; In ten Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical studies involving FG-3019 to date, including more than 375 patients who were treated with FG-3019 (146 patients dosed for more than 6 months), FG-3019 has been well-tolerated across the range of doses studied, and there have been no dose-limiting toxicities seen thus far.

In IPF, we completed a Phase 1 single dose trial, and subsequently advanced the program to an ongoing open-label Phase 2 trial of FG-3019 in 89 patients, which has completed its one year treatment period and based on encouraging results is now in an extension phase. We are conducting a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 trial of FG-3019 for first-line treatment. This protocol includes a sub-study that examines safety and efficacy of FG-3019 when combined with either pirfenidone or nintedanib, both of which are approved for treatment of IPF in the U.S. and Europe . Both Phase 2 trials are designed to evaluate the effects of FG-3019 on pulmonary function, extent of fibrosis and health-related quality of life. 

In pancreatic cancer, we performed an open-label, dose-finding Phase 2 trial in a total of 75 patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. We are also currently conducting a randomized, active-control, neoadjuvant Phase 2 trial combining FG-3019 with nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine in approximately 42 patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer. Initial results for the first 12 subjects in the study indicated that more subjects treated on the combination arm containing FG-3019 were converted from unresectable to fully resectable status. The study continues to enroll subjects in order to confirm these early preliminary data. 

We conducted a randomized placebo-controlled study of FG-3019 in subjects with liver fibrosis due to hepatitis B who were about to start anti-viral treatment with entecavir. This study tested two doses of FG-3019. The primary endpoint was improvement in liver fibrosis. Interim data indicated that the rate of liver fibrosis improvement in the placebo group that received entecavir alone was much higher than expected (54% compared to 30% expected). Based on this analysis, we determined that the trial was unlikely to be successful and the trial was closed. Based on the safety data in that study we are planning to conduct a trial of FG-3019 in subjects with advanced liver fibrosis due to NASH, for which there is no effective therapy. 

In January 2016, we dosed the first patients in an exploratory single arm trial of the safety and efficacy of FG-3019 in non-ambulatory subjects with DMD. The primary endpoint is change in forced vital capacity; other endpoints include changes in arm function and in muscle and heart fibrosis.

Actual dates depend on a variety of factors and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including with respect to patient enrollment, safety results, manufacturing, third party contractors, and government regulators, some of which are out of our control. Also refer to &#8220; Risk Factors, &#8221; and particularly those risk factors under the heading &#8220; Risks Related to the Development and Commercialization of Our Product Candidates. &#8221;

Early clinical development included studies in diabetic kidney disease. Although no adverse outcomes were observed, we decided not to pursue this indication at this time based on the difficulty of the regulatory path and the extensive clinical trials likely to be required for approval for the treatment of diabetic kidney disease.

Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis

Understanding IPF and the Limitations of Current Therapies

IPF is a form of progressive pulmonary fibrosis, or abnormal scarring, which destroys the structure and function of the lungs. As tissue scarring progresses in the lungs, transfer of oxygen into the bloodstream is increasingly impaired. Average life expectancy at the time of confirmed diagnosis of IPF is estimated to be between 3 to 5 years, with approximately two-thirds of patients dying within five years of diagnosis. Thus, the survival rates are comparable to some of the most deadly cancers. The cause of IPF is unknown but is believed to be related to unregulated cycles of injury, inflammation and fibrosis.

&#160;

Patients with IPF experience debilitating symptoms, including shortness of breath and difficulty performing routine functions, such as walking and talking. Other symptoms include chronic dry, hacking cough, fatigue, weakness, discomfort in the chest, loss of appetite and weight loss. Over the last decade, refinements in diagnosis criteria and enhancements in high-resolution computed tomography, (&#8220;HRCT&#8221;), imaging technology have enabled more reliable diagnosis of IPF without the need for a lung biopsy more clear distinction from other interstitial lung diseases. 

The U.S. prevalence and incidence of IPF are estimated to be 44,000 to 135,000 cases, and 21,000 new cases per year, respectively, based on Raghu et al. (Am J Respir Crit Care Med (2006)) and on data from the United Nations Population Division. We believe that with the availability of technology to enable more accurate diagnoses, the number of individuals diagnosed per year with IPF will continue to increase. In 2011, Decision Resources Group estimated that there will be approximately $4.6 billion in sales of IPF drugs in the U.S. and Europe in 2020.

Pirfenidone has been approved to treat IPF in Europe, Canada, Japan and the U.S. According to the FDA advisory committee submission by its sponsor, pirfenidone has been shown to have a modest effect on slowing the progression of IPF as measured by forced vital capacity (&#8220;FVC&#8221;) with an annual decline in FVC of 235 mL compared to 428 mL for placebo . Nintedanib has also been approved to treat IPF in the U.S. and the EU and has similar modest effect with an annual decrease in FVC of approximately 115 mL compared to approximately 240 mL for placebo. To our knowledge, neither pirfenidone nor nintedanib has been shown to reverse pulmonary fibrosis . We believe that FG-3019 has the potential to stabilize or reverse lung fibrosis in a subset of IPF patients and if approved, improve the prognosis for patients with IPF.

Phase 2 Clinical Trial of FG-3019 for IPF 

Study 002 was a Phase 1 open-label study to determine the safety and PKs of escalating single doses of FG-3019. Patients with a diagnosis of IPF by clinical features and surgical lung biopsy received a single IV dose of FG-3019 at 1, 3, or 10 mg/kg. A total of 21 patients were enrolled in the study; 6 patients received a dose of 1 mg/kg, 9 patients received 3 mg/kg, and 6 patients received 10 mg/kg. FG-3019 was well tolerated across the range of doses studied; and there were no dose-limiting toxicities. TEAE that were considered to be possibly related by the principal investigator to FG-3019 were mild and self-limited, consisting of pyrexia, cough and headache.

We completed the initial one-year treatment portion of Study 049, a Phase 2 open-label, dose-escalation study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of FG-3019 in 89 patients with IPF. FG-3019 was administered at a dose of 15 mg/kg in Cohort 1 (53 patients) and 30 mg/kg in Cohort 2 (36 patients) by IV infusion every 3 weeks for 45 weeks. After 45 weeks of dosing, subjects whose FVC declined less than predicted were allowed to continue dosing in an extension study until they had disease progression. Nineteen patients from Cohort 1 (35.8%) and 13 patients from Cohort 2 (36.1%) entered the extension study . Efficacy endpoints are pulmonary function assessments, extent of pulmonary fibrosis as measured by quantitative imaging and measures of health-related quality of life. A total of 16 patients (4 from cohort 1 and 12 from cohort 2) remain in the extension study, 2.8 to 4.6 years after enrolling in the original study.

HRCT is typically used to diagnose IPF based on visual assessments of computed tomography (&#8220;CT&#8221;), images of lung fibrosis. We used quantitative HRCT to measure changes in fibrosis in this Study 049. We used software to quantify whole lung fibrosis from the compilation of 1 mm HRCT sections of the entire lung. The computer algorithm, which our vendor validated, provides an overall determination of the percentage of the lung that contains individually the three characteristic forms of IPF fibrosis, including reticular IPF fibrosis which is expected to make the most dynamic contribution to overall lung fibrosis.

The extent of lung fibrosis as measured by quantitative HRCT has been shown to be accurate and reproducible (Kim et al. Eur Radiol (2011)). Recent publications based on similar quantitative HRCT methods have identified an association between worsening pulmonary fibrosis and mortality in IPF (Maldonado et al. Eur Resp J (2014); Oda et al. Respiratory Research (2014)). However, HRCT has not been used by the FDA to establish efficacy in IPF.

Eighty-nine patients in this Phase 2 open label study received at least one dose of FG-3019. We defined disease severity in terms of baseline pulmonary function, measured as the FVC percent of the predicted value for a healthy matched person of the same age, or FVC percent predicted. Severe disease was FVC percent predicted &#60; 55%, moderate disease was FVC percent predicted between 55% and 80%, and mild disease was FVC percent predicted &#62;80%.

In Cohort 1, we enrolled patients with a wide range of disease severity to assess safety and efficacy across the full spectrum. Baseline FVC percent predicted for Cohort 1 was 43% to 90%, with a mean of 62.8%. In contrast, other IPF clinical trials, such as those for pirfenidone and nintedanib, have enrolled patients who on average had mild to moderate disease (mean FVC percent predicted 73.1% to 85.5%). Fourteen patients in Cohort 1 withdrew, and ten of the 14 had severe disease.

&#160;

In order to enroll IPF patients similar to those in other IPF trials, we amended the protocol for Cohort 2 to include only patients with mild to moderate disease (FVC &#179; 55% predicted). Baseline FVC percent predicted for Cohort 2 was 53% to 112%, with a mean of 72.7%. Based on this definition of disease severity, 37 patients in Cohort 1 and 32 patients in Cohort 2 had mild to moderate disease.

The table below provides a summary of the observed quantitative change in fibrosis for mild to moderate patients in Cohorts 1 and 2 as measured by HRCT. Twenty-four percent of these patients had improved fibrosis at Week 48. We believe that this is the first trial to demonstrate reversal of fibrosis in a subset of IPF patients. Stable fibrosis has been considered the only achievable favorable outcome in IPF. The table below sets forth the number of patients who showed stable or improved fibrosis at Weeks 24 and 48 compared to the amount of fibrosis at the start of the trial.

Fibrosis improvement or stabilization in patients with mild to moderate disease as measured as reticular fibrosis by HRCT correlated with improvement or stabilization of pulmonary function measured by FVC (p&#60;0.0001; r=-0.59 Cohorts 1 and 2 combined). The figure below shows FVC changes up to Week 48 for mild to moderate patients with stable or improved fibrosis versus patients with worsening fibrosis. Patients with stable or improved fibrosis showed improved pulmonary function, on average, which was significantly different or better than patients with worsening fibrosis who showed a substantial decline in FVC (p= 0.0001, Cohorts 1 and 2 combined). Patients with worsening fibrosis had pulmonary function that was similar to the annual decline in pulmonary function for typical IPF patients.

*** Full analysis set 

Eighty-nine patients had at least one adverse event. The most common reported events were cough, fatigue, shortness of breath, upper respiratory tract infection, sore throat, bronchitis, nausea, dizziness and urinary tract infection. To date, including the 1-year extension of dosing, there have been 45 SAEs in 31 patients, four of which were considered possibly related by the principal investigator to study treatment. During the first year of treatment there were 32 SAEs in 24 patients. Adverse events observed to date are consistent with typical conditions observed in this patient population.

In aggregate, the data from the Phase 2 open-label, dose-escalation study indicate that a subset of FG-3019 treated IPF patients experienced improvements in lung fibrosis with commensurate improvement in pulmonary function and a potential for prolonged benefit with continued treatment. These results are consistent with the mouse disease model results which showed that FG-3019 treatment can reverse lung fibrosis and result in improved pulmonary function. We believe that our patient data showing correlated improvements in both fibrosis and lung function in some patients have not been seen in previously published IPF clinical studies.

Clinical Development Plan for FG-3019 in IPF 

Study 067 is an ongoing Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of FG-3019 in IPF patients with mild to moderate disease (baseline FVC percentage predicted between 55% and 90%). As with our open-label Phase 2 trial, Study 049, the primary efficacy endpoint for Study 067 is change in FVC from baseline. Secondary endpoints are extent of pulmonary fibrosis as measured by quantitative HRCT, other pulmonary function assessments and measures of health-related quality of life. This trial was initially a placebo-only controlled study targeting 90 subjects. We expanded the trial to enable enrollment of both first-line and second-line treatment. The presence of approved therapies has made enrollment in this first-line, placebo-controlled arm of the trial more challenging, and because the approved therapies have only recently become available, few patients have enrolled for second-line treatment. Hoffmann-La Roche&#8217;s (&#8220;Roche&#8217;s&#8221;) pirfenidone is approved for marketing in Europe, Canada, Japan and the U.S. and Boehringer Ingelheim&#8217;s nintedanib is approved for marketing in Europe and the U.S. Consequently we are focused on the first-line patients and are currently over two-thirds enrolled toward the requisite 90 patients. We are also expanding this trial to include 60 subjects to test FG-3019 in combination with therapies approved for IPF. We expect to report topline data of FG-3019 vs. placebo in the first half of 2017. Reaching the target enrollment of 90 subjects in the first half of 2016 is dependent upon our enrolling patients at sites in countries outside the U.S. where approved therapies do not exist or have not fully penetrated the market. We are enrolling subjects in Canada, New Zealand, India, South Africa, Australia, Bulgaria, and Romania.

Pancreatic Cancer 

Understanding Pancreatic Cancer and the Limitations of Current Therapies

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, or pancreatic cancer, is the fourth leading cause of cancer deaths in the U.S. According to the World Health Organization (&#8220;WHO&#8221;), and based on data from the United Nations Population Division, there were approximately 79,000 new cases of pancreatic cancer and approximately 78,000 deaths in the EU in 2012. The National Cancer Center of Japan estimated that in 2010 (latest year available) there were 32,330 new cases of pancreatic cancer. In 2013, Decision Resources Group estimated that there will be approximately $1.3 billion in sales of pancreatic cancer drugs in 2022. There are 47,000 new cases of pancreatic cancer per year in U.S. Fifty percent of patients with pancreatic cancer have no detectable metastases at presentation, and are thus classified as clinically localized (50%). In one third (8,225) the nature of the cancer precludes resection, in two thirds (15,275) the tumors are potentially resectable, For those with non-resectable tumors, 50% survive 8 to 12 months post-diagnosis, and few report 5-year survival; similar to metatastatic cases. For those with resectable tumors, 50% survive 17 to 27 months post-diagnosis and ~20% report 5-year survival. 

Pancreatic cancer is aggressive and typically not diagnosed until it is largely incurable. Most patients are diagnosed after the age of 45, and according to the American Cancer Society, 94% of patients die within five years from diagnosis. The majority of patients are treated with chemotherapy, but pancreatic cancer is highly resistant to chemotherapy. Approximately 15% to 20% of patients are treated with surgery; however, even for those with successful surgical resection, the median survival is approximately two years, with a five year survival rate of 15% to 20% (Neesse et al. Gut (2011)). Radiation treatment may be used for locally advanced diseases, but it is not curative.

The duration of effect of approved anti-cancer agents to treat pancreatic cancer is limited. Gemcitabine demonstrated improvement in median overall survival from approximately four to six months, and erlotinib in combination with gemcitabine demonstrated an additional ten days of survival. Nab-paclitaxel in combination with gemcitabine was recently approved by the FDA for the treatment of pancreatic cancer, having demonstrated median survival of 8.5 months. The combination of folinic acid, 5-fluorouracil, irinotecan and oxaliplatin (FOLFIRINOX) was reported to increase survival to 11.1 months from 6.8 months with gemcitabine. These drugs illustrate that progress in treatment for pancreatic cancer has been modest, and there remains a need for substantial improvement in patient survival and quality of life. 

The approved chemotherapeutic treatments for pancreatic cancer target the cancer cells themselves. Tumors are composed of cancer cells and associated non-cancer tissue, or stroma, of which ECM is a major component. In certain cancers such as pancreatic cancer, both the stroma and tumor cells produce CTGF which in turn promotes the proliferation and survival of stromal and tumor cells. CTGF also induces ECM deposition that provides advantageous conditions for tumor cell adherence and proliferation, promotes blood vessel formation, or angiogenesis, and promotes metastasis, or tumor cell migration, to other parts of the body.

Pancreatic cancers are generally resistant to powerful chemotherapeutic agents, and there is now growing interest in the use of an anti-fibrotic agent to diminish the supportive role of stroma in tumor cell growth and metastasis. The anti-tumor effects observed with FG-3019 in preclinical models indicate that it has the potential to inhibit tumor expansion through effects on tumor cell proliferation and apoptosis as well as reduce metastasis.

Clinical Trials of FG-3019 for Pancreatic Cancer

We completed an open-label Phase 2 (FGCL-MC3019-028) dose finding trial of FG-3019 combined with gemcitabine plus erlotinib in patients with previously untreated locally advanced (stage 3) or metastatic (stage 4) pancreatic cancer. The trial tested FG-3019 doses of 3 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, 15 mg/kg, 25 mg/kg, 35 mg/kg and 45 mg/kg administered every two weeks, and FG-3019 doses of 17.5 mg/kg and 22.5 mg/kg administered weekly after a double loading dose. On Day 15, treatment began with gemcitabine 1000 mg/m 2 weekly for three weeks in a four week cycle and erlotinib 100 mg daily. Treatment continued until progression of the cancer or the patient withdrew for other reasons. Patients were then followed until death. Tumor status was evaluated by CT imaging every eight weeks until disease progression to assess changes in tumor mass.

Seventy-five patients were enrolled in this study with 66 (88%) having stage 4 metastatic cancer. The study demonstrated a dose-related increase in survival, as described in the figure below. At the lowest doses, no patients survived for even one year while at the highest doses up to 31% of patients survived one year.

&#160;

Effect of FG-3019 Dose on One Year Survival in Pancreatic Cancer 

* 

QW = weekly; Q2W = twice weekly

A post-hoc analysis found that there was a significant relationship between survival and trough levels of plasma FG-3019 measured immediately before the second dose (Cmin), as illustrated below. Cmin greater than or equal to 150 &#181;g/mL was associated with significantly improved progression-free survival (p=0.01) and overall survival (p=0.03) versus those patients with Cmin less than 150 &#181;g/mL. For patients with Cmin &#62; 150 &#181;g/mL median survival was 9.4 months compared to median survival of 4.8 months for patients with Cmin &#60; 150 &#181;g/mL. Similarly, 37% of patients with Cmin &#62; 150 &#181;g/mL survived for longer than one year compared to 11% for patients with Cmin &#60; 150 &#181;g/mL. These data suggest that sufficient blockade of CTGF requires FG-3019 threshold blood levels of approximately 150 &#181;g/mL in order to improve survival in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer.

Increased Pancreatic Cancer Survival Associated with Increased Plasma Levels of FG-3019

The Kaplan-Meier plot provides a representation of survival of all patients in the clinical trial. Each vertical drop in the curve represents a recorded event (death) of one or more patients. When a patient&#8217;s event cannot be determined either because he or she has withdrawn from the study or because the analysis is completed before the event has occurred, that patient is &#8220;censored&#8221; and denoted by a symbol ( &#9679; ) on the curve at the time of the last reliable assessment of that patient.

&#160;

In the study, the majority of adverse events were mild to moderate, and were consistent with those observed for erlotinib plus gemcitabine treatment without FG-3019. There were 99 treatment emergent SAEs; six of which were assessed as possibly related by the principal investigator, and 93 as not related to study treatment. We did not identify any evolving dose-dependent pattern, and higher doses of FG-3019 were not associated with higher numbers of SAEs or greater severity of the SAEs observed. 

In both the KPC mouse study and in this clinical trial, FG-3019 treatment had a substantial effect on survival with no apparent increase to the toxicity of the chemotherapeutic regimen.

Clinical Development Plan for FG-3019 in Pancreatic Cancer

For pancreatic cancer, we continue to enroll an open-label, randomized (2:1) Phase 2 trial (FGCL-3019-069) of FG-3019 combined with gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel chemotherapy versus the chemotherapy regimen alone in patients with inoperable locally advanced pancreatic cancer that has not been previously treated. Approximately 42 patients are expected to be treated for up to 6 months and the number may be increased based on preliminary results. The overall goal of the trial is to determine whether the FG-3019 combination can convert inoperable pancreatic cancer to operable , or resectable, cancer. Tumor removal is the only chance for cure of pancreatic cancer, but only 15% to 20% of patients are eligible for surgery. The patients are then followed for disease progression and overall survival. We reported on the first eight evaluable patients at the 2016 American Society of Clinical Oncology GastroIntestinal Cancer Meeting. Of the four patients randomized to FG-3019 plus standard of care (gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel), one discontinued therapy due to a serious adverse event unrelated to study drug and three were converted to operable cancer; two having complete resection (R0) and one having an R1 resection (microscopic evidence of residual tumor cells at the resection margins). Of the four patients randomized to gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel alone, two experienced progressive disease, one remained inoperable and one was converted to operable cancer having an R0 resection. After 2 cycles of treatment in the first 12 subjects, plasma levels of CA19.9, a non-specific tumor marker, showed a mean reduction of 78.3% with FG-3019 plus chemotherapy compared to 48.7% with chemotherapy alone. Patients with locally advanced unresectable pancreatic cancer have median survival of less than 12 months, only slightly better than patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer, whereas patients with resectable pancreatic cancer have a much better prognosis with median survival of approximately 23 months and some patients being cured. If FG-3019 in combination with chemotherapy continues to demonstrate an enhanced rate of conversion from unresectable cancer to resectable cancer, it will support the possibility that FG-3019 could provide a substantial survival benefit for locally advanced pancreatic cancer patients, and we will explore the clinical and regulatory path for approval. 

Liver Fibrosis

Understanding Liver Fibrosis and the Limitations of Current Therapies

Fibrosis in the liver is caused primarily by hepatitis virus infection, obesity associated disorders such as NASH, and excessive consumption of alcohol. Repetitive injury to the liver from these causes leads to worsening fibrosis culminating in liver cirrhosis, organ failure and increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma. There are no approved pharmaceutical treatments for liver fibrosis in the U.S. Treating the underlying cause of disease may stabilize or reverse fibrosis, but only liver transplantation can treat fibrosis that has advanced to cirrhosis.

Reversal of fibrosis after anti-viral therapy is largely observed in patients with mild to moderate fibrosis in hepatitis B and is slow in hepatitis C. Nonetheless, a significant proportion of hepatitis patients have pre-cirrhotic or cirrhotic liver fibrosis and treatments that address the fibrotic process itself would provide benefit for patients with approaching liver failure. Aside from weight loss, there are no available treatments for NASH. The American Liver Foundation estimates a prevalence of 0.9 to 2.5 million cases in the U.S. for advanced NASH. As in other forms of fibrosis, elevated tissue and plasma levels of CTGF have correlated with disease severity.

According to the World Health Organization, about 240 million people worldwide are chronically infected with HBV and approximately 130 to 150 million people are chronically infected with HCV. NASH and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease are associated with obesity and are becoming increasingly important causes of cirrhosis. NASH has been estimated to affect 5% to 7% of the general population (Starley et al. Hepatology (2010)).

&#160;

Clinical Development of FG-3019 for Liver Fibrosis 

We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 clinical trial with FG-3019 in 113 patients with HBV-associated liver fibrosis in Hong Kong and Thailand, where the prevalence of HBV is high. Subjects were eligible if they had biopsy-proven liver fibrosis and were starting anti-viral therapy with entecavir. The trial tested two doses of FG-3019, 15 mg/kg and 45 mg/kg, administered every three weeks for 45 weeks. The primary endpoint of the trial was change in fibrosis as assessed in liver biopsies. We designed the trial based on the expectation that liver fibrosis improved slowly in subjects who are starting entecavir and that no more than 30% of subjects assigned to the control placebo arm of entecavir alone would have improved liver fibrosis after one year of treatment. An interim data analysis revealed that 54% of subjects on the control arm had reduced liver fibrosis after one year of entecavir. The trial was not designed to demonstrate benefit of FG-3019 in the setting of such a high background improvement rate and the trial was closed early. Although there were no significant efficacy results, there were trends for dose related improvements in fibrosis and Fib-4, a non-invasive marker of liver fibrosis. For patients who received a full course of FG-3019 at 15 mg/kg, were switched mid-course from 15 to 45 mg/kg or received a full course at 45 mg/kg, a 1 point or more improvements in Ishak fibrosis score was seen in 55.6% (N=20), 60% (N=6) or 66.7% (N=2) respectively, compared to 54.2% (N=13) of placebo-treated patients. Similarly, for patients who received a full course of FG-3019 at 15 mg/kg, were switched mid-course from 15 to 45 mg/kg or received a full course at 45 mg/kg, a 10% or greater reduction in Fib-4 was seen in 44.7% (N=21), 80% (N=8) or 83.3% (N=5) respectively, compared to 63.6% (N=21) of placebo-treated patients. The proportion of subjects who had grade 3 or 4 adverse events was similar between the FG-3019 arm and the placebo arm. No deaths were reported in this study. Overall there were no safety signals or change in the safety profile of FG-3019 from the results of this trial. 

The need and opportunity for an anti-fibrotic therapy to prevent cirrhosis associated with hepatitis and NASH patients are sizable. However, there is no regulatory consensus on study end-points for mild to moderate disease because clinical manifestations of liver disease do not become apparent until fibrosis is advanced. As with HRCT for pulmonary fibrosis, the imaging technologies and other technologies are improving for assessment of liver fibrosis, and we are evaluating their applicability to clinical trials for liver fibrosis. There are active efforts by the FDA and liver medical societies to focus on clinical trial design for liver fibrosis and address this challenge. Liver biopsies, the gold standard for measuring liver fibrosis, has significant risks and sample only a small portion of the liver. In a manner similar to our approach to IPF where we assess lung fibrosis by quantitative HRCT, we are currently exploring other non-invasive measurements of overall liver fibrosis and function.

We are assessing the potential study design and timing of a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled Phase 2 trial of FG-3019 for treatment of advanced liver fibrosis due to NASH. We are also evaluating the potential of a trial of FG-3019 in patients with advanced liver fibrosis due to Hepatitis C particularly where it appears that fibrosis may not resolve after cure of hepatitis C with the latest antiviral agents. 

FG-3019 for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy

Understanding DMD and the Limitations of Current Therapies

In the U.S., 1 in 3,500 boys have DMD, and there are currently no approved disease-modifying treatments. Most children, despite taking steroids to mitigate progressive muscle loss, are wheelchair bound by age 12, and median survival is age 25. DMD is caused by absence of the dystrophin protein resulting in abnormal muscle structure and function and buildup of fibrosis in muscle, leading to diminished mobility, pulmonary function and cardiac function. Constant myofiber breakdown results in persistent activation of myofibroblasts and altered production of ECM resulting in extensive fibrosis in skeletal muscles of DMD patients. Desguerre et al. (2009) showed that muscle fibrosis was the only myo-pathologic parameter that significantly correlated with poor motor outcome as assessed by quadriceps muscle strength, manual muscle testing of upper and lower limbs, and age at ambulation loss.

Clinical Development of FG-3019 for DMD

In 2015 we filed an IND for DMD which was approved in July 2015. In January 2016, we dosed the first patients in the first study under this IND, a 22 patient open-label trial of FG-3019 in non-ambulatory patients. The primary endpoint is change in pulmonary function compared to each individual subject&#8217;s historical decline in lung function. Other endpoints include assessments of cardiac fibrosis and function assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (&#8220;MRI&#8221;), upper arm muscle fibrosis and fat assessed by MRI and upper body strength. Clinical sites began screening subjects for eligibility in late 2015 and the first subjects were enrolled in January 2016. We plan to meet with the FDA to discuss development of FG-3019 for further treatment of DMD including in ambulatory subjects. 

&#160;

Other Potential Indications for FG-3019 

We believe that FG-3019 has potential to be a treatment for cancers and a broad array of fibrotic disorders, including:

&#160;

&#183; 

Cancers &#8212; melanoma, breast cancer, hepatoma 

&#160;

&#183; 

Lung &#8212; scleroderma lung disease 

&#160;

&#183; 

Radiation induced fibrosis 

&#160;

&#183; 

Muscular dystrophies other than Duchenne muscular dystrophy 

&#160;

&#183; 

Kidney &#8212; diabetic nephropathy, focal segmental glomerular sclerosis 

&#160;

&#183; 

Cardiovascular system &#8212; congestive heart failure, pulmonary arterial hypertension 

Investigational New Drug and Clinical Trial Applications

FG-3019 is being studied in the U.S. for the treatment of IPF under an IND that we submitted to the FDA in August 2003. FG-3019 is also being studied in the U.S. for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer under an IND that we submitted to the FDA in September 2004. FG-3019 is being studied in the U.S. for the treatment of DMD under an IND that we submitted to the FDA in June 2015. We have an IND number for treatment of liver fibrosis due to NASH and in October 2015 we held a pre-IND meeting with the FDA to discuss our development plans. 

Commercialization Strategy for FG-3019

Our goal, if FG-3019 is successful, is to be a leader in the development and commercialization of novel approaches for inhibiting deep organ fibrosis and treating some forms of cancer. To date, we have retained exclusive worldwide rights for FG-3019. We plan to retain commercial rights to FG-3019 in North America and will also continue to evaluate the opportunities to establish co-development partnerships for FG-3019 as well as commercialization collaborations for territories outside of North America.

COLLABORATIONS 

Our Collaboration Partnerships for Roxadustat

Astellas

We have two agreements with Astellas for the development and commercialization of roxadustat, one for Japan, and one for Europe, the Commonwealth of Independent States, the Middle East and South Africa. Under these agreements we provided Astellas the right to develop and commercialize roxadustat for anemia in these territories.

We share responsibility with Astellas for clinical development activities required for U.S. and EU regulatory approval of roxadustat, and share equally those development costs under the agreed development plan for such activities. Astellas will be responsible for clinical development activities and all associated costs required for regulatory approval in all other countries in the Astellas territories. Astellas will own and have responsibility for regulatory filings in its territories. We are responsible, either directly or through our contract manufacturers, for the manufacture and supply of all quantities of roxadustat to be used in development and commercialization under the agreements.

The Astellas agreements will continue in effect until terminated. Either party may terminate the agreements for certain material breaches by the other party. In addition, Astellas will have the right to terminate the agreements for certain specified technical product failures, upon generic sales reaching a particular threshold, upon certain regulatory actions, or upon our entering into a settlement admitting the invalidity or unenforceability of our licensed patents. Astellas may also terminate the agreements for convenience upon advance written notice to us. In the event of any termination of the agreements, Astellas will transfer and assign to us the regulatory filings for roxadustat and will assign or license us the relevant trademarks used with the products in the Astellas territories. Under certain terminations, Astellas is also obligated to pay us a termination fee.

Consideration under these agreements includes a total of $360.1 million in upfront and non-contingent payments, and milestone payments totaling $557.5 million, of which $542.5 million are development and regulatory milestones, and $15.0 million are commercial-based milestones. Total consideration, excluding development cost reimbursement and product sales-related payments, could reach $917.6 million. The aggregate amount of such consideration received through December 31, 2015 totals $462.6 million.

&#160;

Additionally, under these agreements, Astellas pays 100% of the commercialization costs in their territories. Astellas will pay us a transfer price for our manufacture and delivery of roxadustat based on a calculation based on net sales of roxadustat in the low 20% range. 

In addition, Astellas has separately invested $80.5 million in the equity of FibroGen, Inc. to date.

AstraZeneca

We also have two agreements with AstraZeneca for the development and commercialization of roxadustat for anemia, one for China (the &#8220;China Agreement&#8221;), and one for the U.S. and all other countries not previously licensed to Astellas (the &#8220;U.S./RoW Agreement&#8221;). Under these agreements we provided AstraZeneca the right to develop and commercialize roxadustat for anemia in these territories. We share responsibility with AstraZeneca for clinical development activities required for United States regulatory approval of roxadustat.

Now that we have reached the $116.5 million cap on our initial funding obligations (under which we shared 50% of the initial development costs), all future development and commercialization costs for roxadustat for the treatment of anemia in CKD in the U.S., Europe, Japan and all other markets outside of China will be paid by Astellas and AstraZeneca.

In China, our subsidiary FibroGen China will conduct the development work for CKD anemia and will hold all of the regulatory licenses issued by China regulatory authorities and be primarily responsible for regulatory, clinical and manufacturing. China development costs are shared 50/50. AstraZeneca is also responsible for 100% of development expenses in all other licensed territories outside of China. We are responsible, through our contract manufacturers, for the manufacture and supply of all quantities of roxadustat to be used in development and commercialization under the agreements.

Under the AstraZeneca agreements, we receive upfront and subsequent non-contingent payments totaling $402.2 million, a portion of which we have received and the remainder of which we expect to receive in various amounts through 2016, including a $62.0 million time based development milestone which became non-contingent as of July 30, 2014. Potential milestone payments under the agreements total $1.2 billion, of which $571.0 million are development and regulatory milestones, and $652.5 million are commercial-based milestones. Total consideration under the agreements, excluding development cost reimbursement, transfer price payments, royalties and profit share, could reach $1.6 billion. The aggregate amount of such consideration received through December 31, 2015 totals $355.2 million.

Payments under these agreements include over $500 million in upfront, non-contingent and other payments received or expected to be received prior to the first U.S. approval, excluding development expense reimbursement.

AstraZeneca purchased 1,111,111 shares of our common stock at the initial public offering (&#8220;IPO&#8221;) price for an aggregate purchase price of $20.0 million in a private placement concurrent with our IPO. In connection with the purchase of our shares of common stock in the private placement, AstraZeneca has also entered into a standstill agreement which provides that, until November 2019, neither AstraZeneca nor its representatives will, directly or indirectly, among other things, acquire any additional securities or assets of ours, solicit proxies for our securities, participate in a business combination involving us, or seek to influence our management or policies, except with the prior consent of our board of directors and in certain other specified circumstances involving a change of control of our company. In addition, AstraZeneca has agreed to vote its shares in favor of nominees to our board of directors, increases in the authorized capital stock of the company and amendments to our equity plans approved by the board of directors, in each case as recommended by a majority of our board of directors. AstraZeneca has also agreed, subject to specified exceptions, not to sell shares purchased by it in the private placement for the two-year period following such purchase and to limitations on the volume of its sales of such shares thereafter. 

Under the U.S./RoW Agreement, AstraZeneca will pay for all commercialization costs in the U.S. and RoW, AstraZeneca will be responsible for the U.S. commercialization of roxadustat, with FibroGen undertaking specified promotional activities in the ESRD segment in the U.S. In addition, we will receive a transfer price for delivery of commercial product based on a percentage of net sales in the low- to mid-single digit range and AstraZeneca will pay us a tiered royalty on net sales of roxadustat in the low 20% range.

Under the China Agreement, which is conducted through FibroGen China, the commercial collaboration is structured as a 50/50 profit share. AstraZeneca will conduct commercialization activities in China as well as serve as the master distributor for roxadustat and will fund roxadustat launch costs in China until FibroGen China has achieved profitability. At that time, AstraZeneca will recoup 50% of their historical launch costs out of initial roxadustat profits in China.

&#160;

AstraZeneca may terminate the U.S./RoW Agreement upon specified events, including our bankruptcy or insolvency, our uncured material breach, technical product failure, or upon 180 days prior written notice at will. If AstraZeneca terminates the U.S/RoW Agreement at will, in addition to any unpaid non-contingent payments, it will be responsible to pay for a substantial portion of the post-termination development costs under the agreed development plan until regulatory approval. 

AstraZeneca may terminate the China Agreement upon specified events, including our bankruptcy or insolvency, our uncured material breach, technical product failure, or upon advance prior written notice at will. If AstraZeneca terminates our China Agreement at will, it will be responsible to pay for transition costs as well as make a specified payment to FibroGen China.

In the event of any termination of the agreements, but subject to modification upon termination for technical product failure, AstraZeneca will transfer and assign to us any regulatory filings and approvals for roxadustat in the affected territories that they may hold under our agreements, grant us licenses and conduct certain transition activities.

Of the $1,113.5 million in development and regulatory milestones payable in the aggregate under our Astellas and AstraZeneca collaboration agreements, $425.0 million is payable upon achievement of milestones relating to the submission and approval of roxadustat in DD-CKD and NDD-CKD in the U.S. and Europe.

Information about collaboration partners that accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue or accounts receivable for the last three fiscal years is set forth in Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Annual Report.

COMPETITION 

The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are highly competitive, particularly in some of the indications we are developing drug candidates, including anemia in CKD, IPF, pancreatic cancer, liver fibrosis and DMD. We face competition from multiple other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, many of which have significantly greater financial, technical and human resources and experience in product development, manufacturing and marketing. These potential advantages of our competitors are particularly a risk in IPF, pancreatic cancer, liver fibrosis and DMD, where we do not currently have a development or commercialization partner.

We expect any products that we develop and commercialize to compete on the basis of, among other things, efficacy, safety, convenience of administration and delivery, price, the level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third party payors.

If either of our lead product candidates is approved, they will compete with currently marketed products, and product candidates that may be approved for marketing in the future, for treatment of the following indications:

Roxadustat &#8212; Anemia in CKD

If roxadustat is approved for the treatment of anemia in patients with CKD, competing drugs are expected to include ESAs such as epoetin alfa (EPOGEN &#174; marketed by Amgen Inc. in the U.S., Procrit &#174; marketed by Johnson &#38; Johnson, Inc. in the U.S., and Erypo &#174; /Eprex &#174; also marketed by Johnson &#38; Johnson in other markets and Espo &#174; marketed by Kyowa Hakko Kirin (&#8220;KHK&#8221;), in Japan and China), darbepoetin (Aranesp &#174; marketed by Amgen in the U.S. and Europe, and by KHK in Hong Kong; NESP &#174; marketed by KHK in Japan, Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand), as well as Mircera &#174; (marketed by Roche in various markets including Europe and Japan, and marketed by Galenica in the U.S.) and NeoRecormon &#174; /Epogin &#174; (marketed by Roche in Japan and certain other markets). In addition, several biosimilar versions of currently marketed ESAs are available for sale in the EU and many other markets, and, in the U.S., a few BLAs for epoetin alpha biosimilars are currently under review by the U.S. FDA, and if approved, could alter the competitive and pricing landscape of anemia therapy in dialysis patients under the ESRD bundle. ESAs have been used in the treatment of anemia in CKD for over 20 years, serving a significant majority of dialysis patients as well as those non-dialysis patients receiving anemia therapy under nephrology care. NDD-CKD patients who are not under the care of nephrologists, including those with diabetes and hypertension, do not typically receive ESAs and are often left untreated. Physicians and patients currently treated with ESAs may be reluctant to switch to roxadustat from products with which they have become familiar. 

&#160;

We, and our collaboration partners, will also likely face competition from potential new therapies currently in clinical development for the treatment of anemia in CKD patients, including those patient segments not currently addressed by ESAs. In addition to our roxadustat programs, several companies, including GlaxoSmithKline plc (&#8220;GSK&#8221;), Bayer Corporation (&#8220;Bayer&#8221;), and Akebia Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (&#8220;Akebia&#8221;) are currently in clinical development of their HIF-PH inhibitor s. While roxadustat was the only HIF-PH inhibitor in Phase 3 development for the past few years, Akebia began its first Phase 3 study of its HIF-PH inhibitor in NDD-CKD in December 2015. The company also plans to consult with the U.S. FDA regarding its Phase 3 DD-CKD program. Bayer and GSK are both in P hase 2 development of their respective HIF-PH inhibitor product candidates for anemia in CKD indications. In Japan, while Daiichi Sankyo terminated its HIF-PH inhibitor program at P hase 1, Japan Tobacco Inc. has advanced to P hase 2b development. We may face competition for patient recruitment and enrollment for clinical trials and potentially in commercial sales by some of those HIF-PH inhibitors. 

In addition, there are other companies developing biologic therapies for treatment of other anemia indications, including MDS. In MDS, current therapeutic options are limited, and many patients are exposed to multiple RBC transfusions. Despite lack of regulatory approvals for MDS (except for Japan where darbepoetin is approved for MDS), ESA therapy is recommended for anemia treatment in MDS patients with low serum EPO levels. If roxadustat is approved for MDS, it would compete with ESA and potentially with the new biologic therapies currently under development. For example, Celgene Corporation, in partnership with Acceleron Pharma Inc. is initiating Phase 3 development of protein therapeutic candidates to treat anemia and associated complications in patients with &#223;-thalassemia and certain type of MDS, and has received orphan drug status from the EMA and FDA for these indications. Noxxon Pharma AG is developing an anti-hepcidin Spiegelmer &#174; lexaptepid pegol (NOX-H94), a mirror image of a natural oligonucleotide, which is in Phase 2 development in cancer patients for the treatment of anemia associated with chronic disease, as well as in ESA-hyporesponsive patients on dialysis.

In China, biosimilars of epoetin alfa are offered by Chinese pharmaceutical companies such as EPIAO marketed by 3SBio Inc. and Xue Da Sheng marketed by Hayao Biological. We may also face competition by HIF-PH inhibitors from other companies such as Akebia, GSK, and Bayer. Akebia announced in December 2015 that it has entered into a development and commercialization partnership with Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharmaceutical Corporation for vadadustat, one of its HIF-PH inhibitor in Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, India and certain other countries in Asia. 3SBio Inc. also plans on beginning a Phase 1 clinical trial of a HIF-PH inhibitor for the China market in 2016.

The currently marketed ESA products are supported by large pharmaceutical companies with greater experience and expertise in commercialization in the anemia market, including securing reimbursement, government contracts and relationships with key opinion leaders. We expect that significant resources will be required from us and our collaboration partners, AstraZeneca and Astellas, to overcome the challenges of bringing a new product into an established market with concentrated buyers.

In the U.S., two of the largest operators of dialysis clinics, DaVita Healthcare Partners Inc. (&#8220;DaVita&#8221;) and Fresenius Medical Care AG &#38; Co. KGaA (&#8220;Fresenius&#8221;), collectively provide dialysis care to approximately 70% of the dialysis market, and therefore have historically won long-term contracts including rebate terms with Amgen. DaVita&#8217;s contract with Amgen that began in January 2012 includes an exclusive relationship through 2018. Fresenius&#8217; contract with Amgen is non-exclusive and expired in 2015. Fresenius is now administering Mircera &#174; in a significant portion of its U.S. dialysis patients since Mircera was made available by Galenica. Successful penetration in this market may require a significant agreement with at least either Fresenius or DaVita, on favorable terms and on a timely basis. 

FG-3019

We are currently in Phase 2 development of FG-3019 to treat DMD, IPF, pancreatic cancer, and liver fibrosis. Most of our competitors have significantly more resources and expertise in development, commercialization and manufacturing, particularly due to the fact that we have not yet established a co-development partnership for FG-3019. For example, both Roche (through its acquisition of InterMune) and Boehringer Ingelheim Pharma GmbH &#38; Co. KG, who have received approval for product candidates for the treatment of IPF in the U.S., have successfully developed and commercialized drugs in various indications and have built sales organizations that we do not currently have; both have more resources and more established relationships when competing with us for patient recruitment and enrollment for clinical trials or, if we are approved, in the market.

Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis

If approved to treat IPF, FG-3019 would compete with pirfenidone, which is approved for marketing in Europe, Canada and Japan. As of October 2014, Roche (through its acquisition of InterMune) has obtained approval in the U.S. for pirfenidone for the treatment of IPF and Boehringer Ingelheim has obtained approval in the U.S. and the EU for nintedanib for the treatment of IPF. We believe that if FG-3019 can be shown to safely stabilize or reverse lung fibrosis in a subset of IPF patients , and thus stabilize or improve lung function, it can compete with pirfenidone and nintedanib for market share in IPF. However, it may be difficult to encourage treatment providers and patients to switch to FG-3019 from a product they are already familiar with. We will also likely face competition from potential new IPF therapies.

&#160;

FG-3019 is an injectable protein, which may be more expensive and less convenient than small molecules such as nintedanib and pirfenidone. Other potential competitive product candidates in various stages of Phase 2 development for IPF include Bristol-Myers Squibb&#8217;s BMS-986020 and Biogen-Idec&#8217;s STX-100. 

Pancreatic Cancer

We are developing FG-3019 to be used in combination with Abraxane &#174; (nab-paclitaxel) and gemcitabine in pancreatic cancer. Celgene&#8217;s Abraxane was launched in the U.S. and Europe in 2013 and 2014, respectively, and was the first drug approved in this disease in nearly a decade. In addition, treatments for cancer are often used in combination instead of as monotherapy; thus, we also face competition for FG-3019 from other agents seeking approval in conjunction with gemcitabine and Abraxane. For example, Halozyme Therapeutics, Inc. is in Phase 2 clinical trials to treat pancreatic cancer with its compound PEGPH20 in combination with gemcitabine and Abraxane.

There are a number of other product candidates in clinical trials for pancreatic cancer, many of which are in combination with existing chemotherapies, as both first-line and second-line therapy for metastatic pancreatic cancer. We will not only face a large number of product candidates competing for patient recruitment and enrollment for our clinical trials, but we could also face a substantial number of competitors if FG-3019 is approved for the treatment of pancreatic cancer.

Liver Fibrosis

If approved to treat HBV and HCV associated liver fibrosis, FG-3019 would compete with advances in HBV and HCV antiviral therapy, which may significantly decrease the potential market for FG-3019 in liver fibrosis. HBV and HCV therapies include: Gilead&#8217;s sofosbuvir (Sovaldi &#174; ), Abbvie&#8217;s Viekira Pak&#8482;, entecavir (Baraclude &#174; ), adefovir (Hepsera &#174; ), lamivudine (Epivir &#174; ), simeprevir (Olysio &#174; ), tenofovir (Viread &#174; ), telbivudine (Tyzeka &#174; ), and interferon alpha-2a and PEGylated interferon alpha-2a (Pegasys &#174; ). Nonetheless, a significant proportion of hepatitis patients have pre-cirrhotic or cirrhotic liver fibrosis and treatments that address the fibrotic process itself could provide benefit for patients with approaching liver failure. Potential antifibrotic competitors in the area of liver fibrosis, including NASH, include Gilead&#8217;s simtuzumab and Intercept Pharmaceuticals, Inc.&#8217;s obeticholic acid.

Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy

Currently, no disease modifying drugs have received full approval to treat DMD, and no disease modifying products are commercially available outside of the European Economic Area. If approved and launched commercially to treat DMD, FG-3019 may face competition for some patients from Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc., as well as BioMarin, and PTC Therapeutics, Santhera Pharmaceuticals, Pfizer, Summit plc and Tivorsan Pharmaceuticals. BioMarin, along with Sarepta have entered clinical development with therapeutics based on exon-skipping technology which seeks to help patients produce functioning forms of the dystrophin protein. The lead molecules for both BioMarin (drisapersen) and Sarepta (eteplirsen) focus on skipping exon-51. Therapies skipping exon-51 target only approximately 13% of the patients who have DMD. To reach other DMD patients with their technology BioMarin and Sarepta would need to generate a new clinical candidate for each type of mutation in the dystrophin gene. PTC Therapeutics&#8217; product ataluren (Translarna TM ) received conditional approval in Europe in 2014.Translarna targets a different set of DMD patients from those being targeted by BioMarin &#8217;s and Sarepta&#8217;s therapeutics that skip exon-51; however, it is also limited to a subset of patients who carry a specific mutation. Conversely, FG-3019 is intended to treat DMD patients without limitation to type of mutation. Santhera Pharmaceuticals recently reported positive Phase 3 data with its drug idebenone (Raxone &#174; /Catena &#174; ) in a trial measuring changes in lung function for DMD patients. Idebenone is a synthetic short-chain benzoquinone and a cofactor for the enzyme NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1). Pfizer&#8217;s product candidate, which is in Phase 2 development, is an antibody targeting myostatin which is a protein that regulates muscle growth. The goal of the program is to increase muscle growth and muscle strength in patients with DMD. Summit plc and Tivorsan Pharmaceuticals are both working on drugs involving the utrophin pathway. The goal of these programs is to increase the production the utrophin protein to compensate for the nonfunctional dystrophin protein produced by DMD patients. Utrophin is a protein similar to dystrophin. Summit is conducting a Phase 1b trial and Tivorsan is conducting preclinical work.

MANUFACTURE AND SUPPLY

We have historically and in the future plan to continue to enter into contractual arrangements with qualified third-party manufacturers to manufacture and package our products and product candidates for territories outside of China. We believe that this manufacturing strategy enables us to more efficiently direct financial resources to the research, development and commercialization of product candidates rather than diverting resources to establishing a significant internal manufacturing infrastructure, unless there is additional strategic value for establishing manufacturing capabilities, such as in China. As our product candidates proceed through development, we are discussing the timing of entry into longer term commercial supply agreements with key suppliers and manufacturers in order to meet the ongoing and planned clinical and commercial supply needs for ourselves and our partners. Our timing of entry into these agreements is based on the current development plans for roxadustat, FG-3019 and FG-5200.

&#160;

Roxadustat 

Roxadustat is a small-molecule drug manufactured from generally available commercial starting materials and chemical technologies and multi-purpose equipment available from many third party contract manufacturers. Our third party manufacturers of roxadustat Phase 3 study material include Shanghai SynTheAll Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. and STA Pharmaceutical Hong Kong Limited and their respective affiliates (collectively &#8220;WuXi STA,&#8221; and &#8220;Catalent Pharma Solutions,&#8221; or &#8220;Catalent&#8221;). WuXi STA is located in China and currently supplies our active pharmaceutical ingredient (&#8220; API&#8221;), and intermediate needs for those materials used in our Phase 3 clinical trials. WuXi STA has passed inspections by several regulatory agencies, including the FDA and CFDA, and is cGMP compliant. Catalent is located in the U.S. and supplies our Phase 3 tablet materials and provides tablet development services. Catalent has passed several regulatory inspections, including by the FDA, and manufactures commercial products for other clients.

To date, we believe that roxadustat has been manufactured under cGMP, regulations and in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements for the manufacture of drug substance and drug product used in clinical trials and we and Astellas have performed audits of the existing roxadustat manufacturers. The intended commercial manufacturing route outside of China has been successfully scaled up to multiple hundred kilogram scale and produced several metric tons of roxadustat drug substance. We are in discussions with multiple parties, including WuXi STA and other potential suppliers regarding longer term commercial supply arrangements.

In China, we plan to use the clinical material from WuXi STA and will conduct bioequivalence tests before NDA product is manufactured at the FibroGen China manufacturing facility in Beijing. Until our FibroGen China manufacturing facility is qualified and licensed for manufacture of roxadustat for the China market, we will continue to rely on external contract manufacturers for both API and drug product manufacturing. We plan to use drug product from our FibroGen China manufacturing facility upon commercialization. We plan on using API from contract manufacturers or our own facility for commercial supply, depending on evolving manufacturing and environmental regulations. 

Irix Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 

In July 2002, we and IRIX Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (&#8220;IRIX&#8221;), a third party manufacturer, entered into a Letter of Agreement for IRIX Pharmaceuticals Single Source Manufacturing Agreement (the &#8220;Letter of Agreement&#8221;), in connection with a contract manufacturing arrangement for clinical supplies of HIF-PH inhibitors, including roxadustat. The Letter of Agreement contained a service agreement that included terms and schedule for the delivery of clinical materials, and also included a term sheet for a single source agreement for the cGMP manufacture of HIF-PH inhibitors, including roxadustat. Specifically, pursuant to the Letter of Agreement, we and IRIX agreed to negotiate a single source manufacturing agreement that included a first right to negotiate a manufacturing contract for HIF-PH inhibitors, including roxadustat, provided that IRIX is able to match any third party bids within 5%, and the exclusive right to manufacture extends for five years after approval of an NDA. Any agreement would provide that no minimum amounts would be specified until appropriate by forecast, that we and our commercialization partner would have the rights to contract with independent third parties that exceed IRIX&#8217;s internal capabilities or in the event that we or our commercialization partner determines for reasons of continuity and security that such a need exists, provided that IRIX would supply a majority of the product if it is able to meet the requirements and the schedule required by us and our partner. Subsequent to the Letter of Agreement, we and IRIX have entered into several additional service agreements. IRIX has requested in writing that we honor the Letter of Agreement with respect to the single source manufacturing agreement. To date, we have offered to IRIX opportunities to bid for the manufacture of HIF-PH inhibitors, including roxadustat. In 2015, Patheon Pharmaceuticals Inc., a business unit of DPx Holdings B.V., acquired IRIX. 

FG-3019

To date, FG-3019 has been manufactured using specialized biopharmaceutical process techniques under an agreement with a qualified third party contract manufacturer, Boehringer Ingelheim. Our contract manufacturer is the sole source for the current clinical supply of the drug substance and drug product for FG-3019. Our contract manufacturer is only obligated to supply the amounts of FG-3019 as agreed on pursuant to work orders that are executed from time to time under our agreement as we determine need for clinical material, and we are not required to make fixed or minimum annual purchases. Our existing agreement allows us to transfer the cell line manufacturing process to another third party manufacturer at our expense, and our contractor is obligated to provide reasonable technology transfer assistance in the event of such a transfer.

&#160;

FG-5200 

The manufacture of FG-5200 requires three distinct steps under cGMP and involves three parties in three locations. Our proprietary recombinant human collagen is produced under contract by a third party in Finland. After quality assurance release, we freeze-dry the material in our U.S. facility. We are still determining any facility licensing requirements for this step. The final step is the production of FG-5200, which will be done in a qualified aseptic manufacturing suite at the FibroGen China manufacturing facility. After completion of the final validation of the sterile process (currently in progress), implants will be manufactured there for product registration testing, clinical testing, as well as for commercial use in the future.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION

The clinical testing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, distribution, record keeping, advertising, promotion, import, export and marketing, among other things, of our product candidates are subject to extensive regulation by governmental authorities in the U.S. and other countries. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations, including in Europe and China, requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant and/or sponsor to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, including refusal by the applicable regulatory authority to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters and other types of letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal investigations and penalties brought by FDA and the Department of Justice, or other governmental entities.

U.S. Product Approval Process

In the U.S., the FDA regulates drugs and biological products, or biologics, under the Public Health Service Act, as well as the FDCA which is the primary law for regulation of drug products. Both drugs and biologics are subject to the regulations and guidance implementing these laws. Pharmaceutical products are also subject to regulation by other governmental agencies, such as the Federal Trade Commission, the Office of Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the Consumer Product Safety Commission and the Environmental Protection Agency. The clinical testing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, distribution, record keeping, advertising, promotion, import, export and marketing, among other things, of our product candidates are subject to extensive regulation by governmental authorities in the U.S. and other countries. The steps required before a drug or biologic may be approved for marketing in the U.S. generally include:

&#160;

&#183; 

Preclinical laboratory tests and animal tests conducted under Good Laboratory Practices. 

&#160;

&#183; 

The submission to the FDA of an IND for human clinical testing, which must become effective before each human clinical trial commence. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product and conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practices. 

&#160;

&#183; 

The submission to the FDA of an NDA, in the case of a small molecule drug product, or a BLA, in the case of a biologic product. 

&#160;

&#183; 

FDA acceptance, review and approval of the NDA or BLA, as applicable. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facilities at which the product is made to assess compliance with cGMPs. 

The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and the receipt and timing of any approval is uncertain. The FDA may suspend clinical trials at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to a potentially unacceptable health risk.

Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluations of the product candidate, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and efficacy of the product candidate. Preclinical studies must be conducted in compliance with FDA regulations regarding GLPs. The results of the preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted to the FDA as part of the IND, which includes the results of preclinical testing and a protocol detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated if the first phase or phases of the clinical trial lends themselves to an efficacy determination. The IND will become effective automatically 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the trials as outlined in the IND prior to that time. In this case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can proceed. The IND must become effective before clinical trials may be commenced.

&#160;

Clinical trials involve the administration of the product candidates to healthy volunteers, or subjects, or patients with the disease to be treated under the supervision of a qualified principal investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted under the supervision of one or more qualified principal investigators in accordance with GCPs and in accordance with protocols detailing the objectives of the applicable phase of the trial, dosing procedures, research subject selection and exclusion criteria and the safety and effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Progress reports detailing the status of clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA annually. Sponsors must also timely report to the FDA serious and unexpected adverse events, any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse event over that listed in the protocol or investigator&#8217;s brochure, or any findings from other studies or tests that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the product candidate. Further, the protocol for each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent institutional review board (&#8220;IRB&#8221;), either centrally or individually at each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. The IRB will consider, among other things, ethical factors, and the safety of human subjects and the possible liability of the institution. 

Clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases prior to approval, but the phases may overlap and different trials may be initiated with the same drug candidate within the same phase of development in similar or different patient populations. These phases generally include the following:

Phase 1. Phase 1 clinical trials represent the initial introduction of a product candidate into human subjects, frequently healthy volunteers. In Phase 1, the product candidate is usually tested for pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties such as safety, including adverse effects, dosage tolerance, absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion. 

Phase 2. Phase 2 clinical trials usually involve studies in a limited patient population to (1) evaluate the efficacy of the product candidate for specific indications, (2) determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage and (3) identify possible adverse effects and safety risks. 

Phase 3. If a product candidate is found to be potentially effective and to have an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 studies, the clinical trial program will be expanded to Phase 3 clinical trials to further evaluate clinical efficacy, optimal dosage and safety within an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical study sites. 

Phase 4. Phase 4 clinical trials are conducted after approval to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication and to document a clinical benefit in the case of drugs approved under accelerated approval regulations, or when otherwise requested by the FDA in the form of post-market requirements or commitments. Failure to promptly conduct any required Phase 4 clinical trials could result in withdrawal of approval. 

The results of preclinical studies and clinical trials, together with detailed information on the manufacture, composition and quality of the product candidate, are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA (for a drug) or BLA (for a biologic), requesting approval to market the product. The application must be accompanied by a significant user fee payment. The FDA has substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept any application or decide that the data is insufficient for approval and require additional preclinical, clinical or other studies.

Review of Application

Once the NDA or BLA submission has been accepted for filing, which occurs, if at all, 60 days after submission, the FDA informs the applicant of the specific date by which the FDA intends to complete its review. This is typically 12 months from the date of submission. The review process is often extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA reviews NDAs and BLAs to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product&#8217;s identity, strength, quality and purity. Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA may inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured and will not approve the product unless the manufacturing facility complies with cGMPs and will also inspect clinical trial sites for integrity of data supporting safety and efficacy. During the approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (&#8220;REMS&#8221;), is necessary to assure the safe use of the product. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the application must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the application without an approved REMS, if required. A REMS can substantially increase the costs of obtaining approval. The FDA may also convene an advisory committee of external experts to provide input on certain review issues relating to risk, benefit and interpretation of clinical trial data. The FDA may delay approval of an NDA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied and/or the FDA requires additional testing or information. The FDA may require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor safety or efficacy of a product. FDA will issue either an approval of the NDA or BLA or a Complete Response Letter detailing the deficiencies and information required in order for reconsideration of the application.

&#160;

Pediatric Exclusivity and Pediatric Use 

Under the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, certain drugs or biologics may obtain an additional six months of exclusivity in an indication, if the sponsor submits information requested in writing by the FDA (&#8220;Written Request&#8221;), relating to the use of the active moiety of the drug or biologic in children. The FDA may not issue a Written Request for studies on unapproved or approved indications or where it determines that information relating to the use of a drug or biologic in a pediatric population, or part of the pediatric population, may not produce health benefits in that population.

We have not received a Written Request for such pediatric studies with respect to our product candidates, although we may ask the FDA to issue a Written Request for studies in the future. To receive the six-month pediatric market exclusivity, we would have to receive a Written Request from the FDA, conduct the requested studies in accordance with a written agreement with the FDA or, if there is no written agreement, in accordance with commonly accepted scientific principles, and submit reports of the studies. A Written Request may include studies for indications that are not currently in the labeling if the FDA determines that such information will benefit the public health. The FDA will accept the reports upon its determination that the studies were conducted in accordance with and are responsive to the original Written Request, agreement, or commonly accepted scientific principles, as appropriate, and that the reports comply with the FDA&#8217;s filing requirements.

In addition, the Pediatric Research Equity Act (&#8220;PREA&#8221;) requires a sponsor to conduct pediatric studies for most drugs and biologicals, for a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration. Under PREA, original NDAs, BLAs and supplements thereto must contain a pediatric assessment unless the sponsor has received a deferral or waiver. The required assessment must include the evaluation of the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA, on its own initiative or at the request of the sponsor, may request a deferral of pediatric studies for some or all of the pediatric subpopulations. A deferral may be granted by FDA if they believe that additional safety or effectiveness data in the adult population needs to be collected before the pediatric studies begin. After April 2013, the FDA must send a non-compliance letter to any sponsor that fails to submit the required assessment, keep a deferral current or fails to submit a request for approval of a pediatric formulation.

Post-Approval Requirements

Even after approval, drugs and biologics manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuous regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data.

The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of an NDA or BLA. For example, the FDA may require post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product&#8217;s safety and effectiveness after commercialization.

In addition, entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs and biologics are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.

Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may also result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:

&#160;

&#183; 

Restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or BLAs or supplements to approved NDAs or BLAs, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals. &#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. 

The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability.

Prescription Drug Marketing Act

The distribution of pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act (&#8220;PDMA&#8221;), which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors at the state level. Under the PDMA and state law, states require the registration of manufacturers and distributors who provide pharmaceuticals in that state, including in certain states manufacturers and distributors who ship pharmaceuticals into the state even if such manufacturers or distributors have no place of business within the state. The PDMA and state laws impose requirements and limitations upon drug sampling to ensure accountability in the distribution of samples. The PDMA sets forth civil and criminal penalties for violations of these and other provisions.

Federal and State Fraud and Abuse and Data Privacy and Security and Transparency Laws and Regulations

In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, federal and state healthcare laws restrict certain business practices in the biopharmaceutical industry. These laws include, but are not limited to, anti-kickback, false claims, data privacy and security, and transparency statutes and regulations.

The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce, or in return for, purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any good, facility, item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term &#8220;remuneration&#8221; has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including for example, gifts, discounts, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, credit arrangements, payments of cash, waivers of payment, ownership interests and providing anything at less than its fair market value. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for a statutory exception or safe harbor protection. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. Several courts have interpreted the statute&#8217;s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the statute has been violated. The intent standard under the Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively &#8220;PPACA&#8221;), to a stricter intent standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or the specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, PPACA codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act (discussed below). Further, civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person or entity who, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent.

&#160;

The federal false claims laws prohibit, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval to the federal government or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. As a result of a modification made by the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009, a claim includes &#8220;any request or demand&#8221; for money or property presented to the U.S. government. Recently, several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for, among other things, allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies&#8217; marketing of the product for unapproved, and thus non-reimbursable, uses. The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (&#8220;HIPAA&#8221;), created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payers and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items or services. 

In addition, we may be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (&#8220;HITECH&#8221;), and its implementing regulations, imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA&#8217;s privacy and security standards directly applicable to business associates &#8212; independent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney&#8217;s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.

Additionally, the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act within the PPACA, and its implementing regulations, require that certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologicals and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children&#8217;s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report information related to certain payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to physicians and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, the physicians and teaching hospitals and to report annually certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.

Also, many states have similar healthcare statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payer. Some states require the posting of information relating to clinical studies. In addition, California requires pharmaceutical companies to implement a comprehensive compliance program that includes a limit on expenditures for, or payments to, individual medical or health professionals. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the health regulatory laws described above or any other laws that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including potentially significant criminal, civil and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, exclusion of products from reimbursement under government programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. To the extent that any of our products will be sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals.

&#160;

Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement 

In both domestic and foreign markets, our sales of any approved products will depend in part on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payers. Third-party payers include government health administrative authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. Patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payers to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Patients are unlikely to use our products unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our products. Sales of our products will therefore depend substantially, both domestically and abroad, on the extent to which the costs of our products will be paid by third-party payers. These third-party payers are increasingly focused on containing healthcare costs by challenging the price and examining the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services. In addition, significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare product candidates. The market for our products and product candidates for which we may receive regulatory approval will depend significantly on access to third-party payers&#8217; drug formularies, or lists of medications for which third-party payers provide coverage and reimbursement. The industry competition to be included in such formularies often leads to downward pricing pressures on pharmaceutical companies. Also, third-party payers may refuse to include a particular branded drug in their formularies or otherwise restrict patient access to a branded drug when a less costly generic equivalent or other alternative is available.

Because each third-party payer individually approves coverage and reimbursement levels, obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement is a time-consuming, costly and sometimes unpredictable process. We may be required to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of any product to each third-party payer separately with no assurance that approval would be obtained, and we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of our products. This process could delay the market acceptance of any product and could have a negative effect on our future revenues and operating results. We cannot be certain that our products and our product candidates will be considered cost-effective. Because coverage and reimbursement determinations are made on a payer-by-payer basis, obtaining acceptable coverage and reimbursement from one payer does not guarantee that we will obtain similar acceptable coverage or reimbursement from another payer. If we are unable to obtain coverage of, and adequate reimbursement and payment levels for, our product candidates from third-party payers, physicians may limit how much or under what circumstances they will prescribe or administer them and patients may decline to purchase them. This in turn could affect our ability to successfully commercialize our products and impact our profitability, results of operations, financial condition and future success.

In addition, in many foreign countries, particularly the countries of the EU and China, the pricing of prescription drugs is subject to government control. In some non-U.S. jurisdictions, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the EU provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of a company placing the medicinal product on the market. We may face competition for our product candidates from lower-priced products in foreign countries that have placed price controls on pharmaceutical products. In addition, there may be importation of foreign products that compete with our own products, which could negatively impact our profitability.

&#160;

Healthcare Reform 

In the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and we expect there will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system that could affect our future results of operations as we begin to directly commercialize our products. In particular, there have been and continue to be a number of initiatives at the U.S. federal and state level that seek to reduce healthcare costs. If a drug product is reimbursed by Medicare or Medicaid, pricing and rebate programs must comply with, as applicable, the Medicaid rebate requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, as amended, and the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (&#8220;MMA&#8221;). The MMA imposed new requirements for the distribution and pricing of prescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities that provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Part D plans include both stand-alone prescription drug benefit plans and prescription drug coverage as a supplement to Medicare Advantage plans. Unlike Medicare Part A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for our products for which we receive marketing approval. However, any negotiated prices for our future products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan will likely be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain from non-governmental payers. Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payers often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in payment that results from Medicare Part D may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-governmental payers.

Moreover, the recently enacted federal Drug Supply Chain Security Act, imposes new obligations on manufacturers of pharmaceutical products, among others, related to product tracking and tracing. Among the requirements of this new federal legislation, manufacturers will be required to provide certain information regarding the drug product to individuals and entities to which product ownership is transferred, label drug product with a product identifier, and keep certain records regarding the drug product. Further, under this new legislation, manufacturers will have drug product investigation, quarantine, disposition, and notification responsibilities related to counterfeit, diverted, stolen, and intentionally adulterated products, as well as products that are the subject of fraudulent transactions or which are otherwise unfit for distribution such that they would be reasonably likely to result in serious health consequences or death.

Furthermore, political, economic and regulatory influences are subjecting the healthcare industry in the U.S. to fundamental change. Initiatives to reduce the federal budget and debt and to reform healthcare coverage are increasing cost-containment efforts. We anticipate that Congress, state legislatures and the private sector will continue to review and assess alternative healthcare benefits, controls on healthcare spending through limitations on the growth of private health insurance premiums and Medicare and Medicaid spending, the creation of large insurance purchasing groups, price controls on pharmaceuticals and other fundamental changes to the healthcare delivery system. Any proposed or actual changes could limit or eliminate our spending on development projects and affect our ultimate profitability. In March 2010, PPACA was signed into law. PPACA has the potential to substantially change the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. Among other cost containment measures, PPACA established: an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs and biologic agents; revised the methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers to the state and federal government for covered outpatient drugs under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated; increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by most manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program; and extended the Medicaid Drug Rebate program to utilization of prescriptions of individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations. In the future, there may continue to be additional proposals relating to the reform of the U.S. healthcare system, some of which could further limit the prices we are able to charge for our products, or the amounts of reimbursement available for our products. If future legislation were to impose direct governmental price controls and access restrictions, it could have a significant adverse impact on our business. Managed care organizations, as well as Medicaid and other government agencies, continue to seek price discounts. Some states have implemented, and other states are considering, price controls or patient access constraints under the Medicaid program, and some states are considering price-control regimes that would apply to broader segments of their populations that are not Medicaid-eligible. Due to the volatility in the current economic and market dynamics, we are unable to predict the impact of any unforeseen or unknown legislative, regulatory, payer or policy actions, which may include cost containment and healthcare reform measures. Such policy actions could have a material adverse impact on our profitability.

&#160;

Regulation in China 

The pharmaceutical industry in China is highly regulated. The primary regulatory authority is the CFDA, including its provincial and local branches. As a developer, manufacturer and supplier of drugs, we are subject to regulation and oversight by the CFDA and its provincial and local branches. The Drug Administration Law of China provides the basic legal framework for the administration of the production and sale of pharmaceuticals in China and covers the manufacturing, distributing, packaging, pricing and advertising of pharmaceutical products. Its implementing regulations set forth detailed rules with respect to the administration of pharmaceuticals in China. In addition, we are, and we will be, subject to other Chinese laws and regulations that are applicable to business operators, manufacturers and distributors in general.

Pharmaceutical Clinical Development

A new drug must be registered and approved by the CFDA before it can be manufactured and marketed for sale. To obtain CFDA approval, the applicant must conduct clinical trials, which must be approved by the CFDA and are subject to the CFDA&#8217;s supervision and inspection. There are four phases of clinical trials. Application for registration of new drugs requires completion of Phase 1, 2 and 3 of clinical trials, similar to the U.S. In addition, the CFDA may require the conduct of Phase 4 studies as a condition to approval.

Phase 4 studies are post-marketing studies to assess the therapeutic effectiveness of and adverse reactions to the new drug, including an evaluation of the benefits and risks, when used among the general population or specific groups, with findings used to inform adjustments to dosage, among other things.

NDA and Approval to Market

China requires approval of the NDA as well as the manufacturing facility before a drug can be marketed in China. Approval and oversight are performed at a national and provincial levels of the CFDA, involve multiple agencies and consist of various stages of approval.

Under the applicable drug registration regulations, drug registration applications are divided into three different types, namely Domestic New Drug Application, Domestic Generic Drug Application, and Imported Drug Application. Drugs fall into one of three categories, namely chemical medicine, biological product or traditional Chinese or natural medicine.

Class 1 refers to a new drug which has never been marketed in any country. Domestic Class 1.1 refers to a chemical drug within Class 1. FibroGen China as a domestic entity will be submitting a Domestic New Drug Application under the Domestic Class 1.1 designation which is the anticipated route by which we expect roxadustat to be considered.

In order to obtain market authorization, FibroGen China must submit to the CFDA an NDA package that contains information similar to what is necessary for a U.S. NDA, including preclinical data, clinical data, technical data on API and drug product and related stability data. The stability data must be generated from a three-batch registration campaign that is conducted at our Beijing facility, from which samples will be tested by the CFDA.

If the NDA package is acceptable, FibroGen China will be granted a New Drug License confirming the drug as suitable for marketing. In addition, FibroGen China will be granted a Manufacturing License which lists the Drug Approval Code as well as the name and address of the Manufacturing License holder. Manufacturing further requires a Pharmaceutical Production Permit (&#8220;PPP&#8221;), as well as cGMP certification. We recently received a PPP, certifying that our manufacturing facility and manufacturing process in that facility are suitable for the manufacture of a drug for clinical or commercial purposes. A PPP requires demonstration that the facility has: (i) legally qualified pharmaceutical and engineering professionals and necessary technical workers; (ii) the premises, facilities and hygienic environment required for drug manufacturing; (iii) institutions, personnel, instruments and equipment necessary to conduct quality control and testing for drugs to be produced; and (iv) rules and regulations to ensure the quality of drugs. The PPP is required prior to conducting the registration campaign for stability and other data for the NDA.

After NDA approval, FibroGen China will be required to conduct a three-batch validation campaign, one of which will be observed onsite by the CFDA. At the successful completion of the validation campaign and associated inspection, FibroGen China will be granted a cGMP certification for the commercial production of roxadustat at our Beijing manufacturing facility. Only after the issuance of the cGMP license can roxadustat be manufactured and sold commercially to the China market.

&#160;

Drug Price Controls 

The administration of price control of pharmaceutical products is vested in the national and provincial price administration authorities. Depending on the categories of pharmaceutical products in question, the prices of pharmaceutical products listed in the Medical Insurance Catalogs, drugs with patents and other drugs whose production or trading may constitute monopolies are subject to the control of the National Development and Reform Commission of China (&#8220;the NDRC&#8221;), and the relevant provincial or local price administration authorities. With respect to pharmaceutical products manufactured in China, the national price administration authority from time to time publishes price control lists setting out the names of pharmaceutical products and their respective price ceilings. The provincial price administration authorities also publish price control lists in respect of the pharmaceutical products which are manufactured within their respective areas. The main purpose of the price control policy is to set an upper limit to the prices of pharmaceutical products to prevent excessive increases in the prices of such products. Price controls on medicines are determined based on profit margins that the relevant authority deems acceptable, the type and quality of the medicine, its production costs, the prices of substitutes and the manufacturer&#8217;s compliance with applicable cGMP standards. Drug companies may apply for an increase in the retail price of their drug to the relevant national or provincial authority if their product has superior effectiveness or other advantages.

Tendering Process for Hospital Purchases of Medicines

Provincial and municipal government agencies such as provincial or municipal health departments also operate a mandatory tender process for purchases by hospitals of a medicine included in provincial medicine catalogs. These government agencies organize tenders in their province or city and typically invite manufacturers of provincial catalog medicines that are on the hospitals&#8217; formularies and are in demand by these hospitals to participate in the tender process. A government-approved committee consisting of physicians, experts and officials is delegated by these government agencies the power to review bids and select one or more medicines for the treatment of a particular medical condition. The selection is based on a number of factors, including bid price, quality and a manufacturer&#8217;s reputation and service. The bidding price of a wining medicine will become the price required for purchases of that medicine by all hospitals in that province or city. This price, however, is effective only until the next tender, where the manufacturer of the winning medicine must submit a new bid. Increasingly, large hospitals are forming purchasing networks in order to increase their purchasing power. In addition, hospitals of certain provinces have begun to implement collective tender processes through online bidding, which is expected to increase the transparency and competitiveness of the tendering system and allow greater access to new entrants.

Device Regulation

In China, medical devices are classified into three different categories, Class I, Class II and Class III, depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of control needed to ensure safety and effectiveness. Classification of a medical device is important because the class to which a medical device is assigned determines, among other things, whether a manufacturer needs to obtain a production permit and whether clinical trials are required. Classification of a medical device also determines the types of registration required and the level of regulatory authority involved in effecting the product registration. In January 2016, we received CFDA&#8217;s approval of our device classification application to designate FG-5200 corneal implants as a Domestic Class III medical device. Class III devices also require product registration and are regulated by the CFDA under the strictest regulatory control.

Before a Class III medical device can be manufactured for commercial distribution, a manufacturer must effect medical device registration by proving the safety and effectiveness of the medical device to the satisfaction of respective levels of the food and drug administration and clinical trials are required for registration of Class III medical devices. In order to conduct a clinical trial on a Class III medical device, the CFDA requires manufacturers to apply for and obtain in advance a favorable inspection result for the device from an inspection center jointly recognized by the CFDA and the State Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine. The application for clinical trials involving a Class III medical device with high risk must be approved by the CFDA before the manufacturer may begin clinical trials. A registration application for a Class III medical device must provide required pre-clinical and clinical trial data and information about the medical device and its components regarding, among other things, device design, manufacturing and labeling. The CFDA must provide the application data to the technical evaluation institute for an evaluation opinion within three working days after its acceptance of the application package and decide, within twenty business days after its receipt of the evaluation opinion, whether the application for registration is approved. However, the time for conducting any detection, expert review and hearing process, if necessary, will not be counted in the abovementioned time limit. If the CFDA requires supplemental information, the approval process may take much longer. The registration is valid for five years and application is required for renewal upon expiration of the existing registration certificate. Once a device is approved, a manufacturer must possess a production permit from the provincial level food and drug administration before manufacturing Class III medical devices.

&#160;

Foreign Regulation Outside of China 

We are planning on seeking approval for roxadustat, and potentially for our other product candidates, in Europe, Japan and China as well as other countries. In order to market any product outside of the U.S., we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, manufacturing, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in foreign countries and jurisdictions. Although many of the issues discussed above with respect to the U.S. apply similarly in the context of other countries we are seeking approval in, including Europe and China, the approval process varies between countries and jurisdictions and can involve different amounts of product testing and additional administrative review periods. For example, in Europe, a sponsor must submit a CTA, much like an IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. A CTA must be submitted to each national health authority and an independent ethics committee.

For other countries outside of the EU, such as China and the countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing, and reimbursement vary from country to country. The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from or be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory approval process in other countries.

Regulatory Exclusivity for Approved Products

U.S. Patent Term Restoration

Depending upon the timing, duration, and specifics of the FDA approval of our product candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent restoration term of up to 5 years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an initial IND and the submission date of an NDA or BLA, plus the time between the submission date of the NDA or BLA and the approval of that product candidate application. Patent term restoration cannot, however, extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product&#8217;s approval date. In addition, only one patent applicable to an approved product is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves applications for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we expect to apply for restoration of patent term for patents relating to each of our product candidates in order to add patent life beyond the current expiration date of such patents, depending on the length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA or BLA.

Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can also delay the submission or the approval of certain applications of companies seeking to reference another company&#8217;s NDA or BLA. The Hatch-Waxman Act provides a 5-year period of exclusivity to any approved NDA for a product containing a new chemical entity (NCE) never previously approved by FDA either alone or in combination with another active moiety. No application or abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) directed to the same NCE may be submitted during the 5-year exclusivity period, except that such applications may be submitted after 4 years if they contain a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement of the patents listed with the FDA by the innovator NDA.

Biologic Price Competition and Innovation Act

The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (&#8220;BPCIA&#8221;), established an abbreviated pathway for the approval of biosimilar and interchangeable biological products. The abbreviated regulatory approval pathway establishes legal authority for the FDA to review and approve biosimilar biologics, including the possible designation of a biosimilar as &#8220;interchangeable&#8221; based on similarity to an existing branded product. Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product cannot be approved by the FDA until 12 years after the original branded product was approved under a BLA. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement to one of the patents listed with the FDA by the innovator BLA holder. The BPCIA is complex and is only beginning to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA. As a result, its ultimate impact, implementation, and interpretation are subject to uncertainty.

&#160;

Orphan Drug Act 

FG-3019 has received orphan drug designation in IPF in the U.S. Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., or if it affects more than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug product available in the U.S. for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan product designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan product designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.

If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug or biological product for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity. The designation of such drug also entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages and user-fee waivers. Competitors, however, may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity. Orphan product exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same drug or biological product as defined by the FDA or if our drug candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor&#8217;s product for the same indication or disease. If a drug product designated as an orphan product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan product exclusivity in any indication.

Orphan designation status in the EU has similar but not identical benefits in that jurisdiction.

Products receiving orphan designation in the EU can receive ten years of market exclusivity, during which time no similar medicinal product for the same indication may be placed on the market. The ten-year market exclusivity may be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan designation; for example, if the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Additionally, marketing authorization may be granted to a similar product for the same indication at any time if the second applicant can establish that its product, although similar, is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior; the initial applicant consents to a second orphan medicinal product application; or the initial applicant cannot supply enough orphan medicinal product. An orphan product can also obtain an additional two years of market exclusivity in the EU for pediatric studies. No extension to any supplementary protection certificate can be granted on the basis of pediatric studies for orphan indications.

Foreign Country Data Exclusivity

The EU also provides opportunities for additional market exclusivity. For example, in the EU, upon receiving marketing authorization, an NCE generally receives eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity. If granted, data exclusivity prevents regulatory authorities in the EU from referencing the innovator&#8217;s data to assess a generic application. During the additional two-year period of market exclusivity, a generic marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovator&#8217;s data may be referenced, but no generic product can be marketed until the expiration of the market exclusivity.

In China, there is also an opportunity for data exclusivity for a period of six years for data included in an NDA applicable to a new chemical entity. According to the Provisions for Drug Registration, the Chinese government protects undisclosed data from drug studies and prevents the approval of an application made by another company that uses the undisclosed data for the approved drug. In addition, if an approved drug manufactured in China qualifies as an innovative drug, such as Domestic Class 1.1, and the CFDA determines that it is appropriate to protect public health with respect to the safety and efficacy of the approved drug, the CFDA may elect to monitor such drug for up to five years. During this post-marketing observation period, the CFDA will not grant approval to another company to produce, change dosage form of or import the drug while the innovative drug is under observation. The approved manufacturer is required to provide an annual report to the regulatory department of the province, autonomous region or municipality directly under the central government where it is located. Each of the data exclusivity period and the observation period runs from the date of approval for production of the new chemical entity or innovative drug, as the case may be.

Our success depends in part upon our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other intellectual property protection for our product candidates including compositions-of-matter, dosages, and formulations, manufacturing methods, and novel applications, uses and technological innovations related to our product candidates and core technologies. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological innovation to further develop and maintain our competitive position.

&#160;

Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing U.S. and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technologies, inventions and any improvements that we consider important to the development and implementation of our business and strategy. Our ability to maintain and solidify our proprietary position for our products and technologies will depend, in part, on our success in obtaining and enforcing valid patent claims. Additionally, we may benefit from a variety of regulatory frameworks in the U.S., Europe, China and other territories that provide periods of non-patent-based exclusivity for qualifying drug products. Refer to &#8220;Government Regulation &#8212; Regulatory Exclusivity for Approved Products.&#8221; 

We cannot ensure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications that may be filed by us in the future, nor can we ensure that any of our existing or subsequently granted patents will be useful in protecting our drug candidates, technological innovations, and processes. Additionally, any existing or subsequently granted patents may be challenged, invalidated, circumvented or infringed. We cannot guarantee that our intellectual property rights or proprietary position will be sufficient to permit us to take advantage of current market trends or otherwise to provide or protect competitive advantages. Furthermore, our competitors may be able to independently develop and commercialize similar products, or may be able to duplicate our technologies, business model, or strategy, without infringing our patents or otherwise using our intellectual property.

Our worldwide patent portfolio encompasses over 200 granted patents and 150 pending patent applications, including multiple granted and pending patent applications relating to roxadustat (FG-4592) and FG-3019. Currently granted patents relating to composition-of-matter for roxadustat and for FG-3019 are expected , for each product candidate, to expire in 2024 or 2025 , in each case without any patent term extension that may be available due to regulatory delay. Two U.S. patents , and corresponding foreign patents if granted, relating to crystalline forms of roxadustat are expected to expire in 2033 , without extension that may be available . Additional patents and patent applications relating to manufacturing processes, formulations, and various therapeutic uses, including treatment of specific indications and improvement of clinical parameters provide further protection for product candidates. 

The protection afforded by any particular patent depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, scope of coverage encompassed by the granted claims, availability of extensions of patent term, availability of legal remedies in the particular territory in which the patent is granted, and validity and enforceability of the patent. Changes in either patent laws or in the interpretation of patent laws in the U.S. and other countries could diminish our ability to protect our inventions and to enforce our intellectual property rights. Accordingly, we cannot predict with certainty the enforceability of any granted patent claims or of any claims that may be granted from our patent applications.

The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights. Our ability to maintain and solidify our proprietary position for our products and core technologies will depend on our success in obtaining effective claims and enforcing those claims once granted. We have been in the past and are currently involved in various administrative proceedings with respect to our patents and patent applications and may, as a result of our extensive portfolio, be involved in such proceedings in the future. Additionally, in the future, we may claim that a third party infringes our intellectual property or a third party may claim that we infringe its intellectual property. In any of the administrative proceedings or in litigation, we may incur significant expenses, damages, attorneys&#8217; fees, costs of proceedings and experts&#8217; fees, and management and employees may be required to spend significant time in connection with these actions.

Because of the extensive time required for clinical development and regulatory review of a product candidate we may develop, it is possible that any patent related to our product candidates may expire before any of our product candidates can be commercialized, or may remain in force for only a short period of time following commercialization, thereby reducing the advantage afforded by any such patent.

The patent positions for our most advanced programs are summarized below.

Roxadustat (FG-4592) Patent Portfolio

Our roxadustat patent portfolio includes multiple granted U.S. patents offering protection for roxadustat, including protection for roxadustat composition-of-matter, for pharmaceutical compositions containing roxadustat , and for methods for treating anemia using roxadustat or its analogs. Exclusive of any patent term extension, the granted U.S. patents relating to the composition-of-matter of roxadustat are due to expire in 2024 or 2025. Corresponding patents have been granted in Europe and in multiple territories worldwide. Exclusive of any patent term extension, these granted foreign patents, and any pending patent applications, if granted are due to expire in 2024. Two crystalline forms patents issued by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office are due to expire in 2033, as would patents granted from the corresponding foreign patent applications currently pending worldwide.

&#160;

Under the Hatch-Waxman Act, we believe that, if roxadustat is approved, we will be eligible for the full five year patent term extension for a granted U.S. patent relating to roxadustat, which extension would expire in 2029 or 2030, depending on the patent extended. Refer to &#8220;Government Regulation &#8212; Regulatory Exclusivity for Approved Products &#8212; U.S. Patent Term Restoration.&#8221; 

We also hold various U.S. and foreign granted patents and pending patent applications directed to manufacturing processes for and formulations of roxadustat, crystalline forms and polymorphs of roxadustat, and methods for use of roxadustat to treat anemia or associated conditions, or to improve clinical parameters relating to anemia. 

Roxadustat China Patent Portfolio

Our Chinese patent portfolio relating to roxadustat includes at least five granted Chinese patents covering roxadustat composition-of-matter and pharmaceutical compositions and uses thereof, as well as medicaments containing roxadustat for treating conditions including anemia of chronic disease, iron deficiency, and ischemic disorders.

These granted patents are due to expire in 2022 through 2024. Our roxadustat patent portfolio in China also includes pending Chinese patent applications relating to manufacturing processes for roxadustat, polymorphs and crystalline forms of roxadustat, and various other aspects relating to the treatment of anemia or improvement of anemia-related parameters using roxadustat.

We believe that roxadustat, as a new chemical entity, would be eligible for six years of data exclusivity in China. Furthermore, upon approval as a new drug, roxadustat may receive up to five years of market exclusivity under a CFDA-imposed new drug monitoring period. Refer to &#8220;Government Regulation &#8212; Regulatory Exclusivity for Approved Products &#8212; Foreign Country Data Exclusivity&#8221; 

HIF Anemia-related Technologies Patent Portfolio

We also have an extensive worldwide patent portfolio providing broad protection for proprietary technologies relating to the treatment of anemia. This portfolio currently contains granted patents and pending patent applications providing exclusivity for use of compounds falling within various and overlapping classes of HIF-PH inhibitors to achieve various therapeutic effects.

This extensive portfolio reflects a series of discoveries we made from the initial days of our HIF program through the present time. Our research efforts have resulted in progressive innovation, and the corresponding patents and patent applications reflect the success of our HIF program. Such discoveries include the ability of HIF-PH inhibitors:

&#160;

&#183; 

To induce endogenous EPO in anemic CKD patients. 

&#160;

&#183; 

To increase efficacy of EPO signaling. 

&#160;

&#183; 

To enhance EPO responsiveness of the bone marrow, for example, by increasing EPO receptor expression. 

&#160;

&#183; 

To overcome the suppressive and inhibitory effects of inflammatory cytokines, such as members of the interleukin 1, IL-1, and interleukin 6, IL-6, cytokine families, on EPO production and responsiveness. 

&#160;

&#183; 

To increase effective metabolism of iron. 

&#160;

&#183; 

To increase iron absorption and bioavailability, as measured using clinical parameters such as percent transferrin saturation (&#8220;TSAT%&#8221;). 

&#160;

&#183; 

To overcome iron deficiency through effects on iron regulatory factors such as ferroportin and hepcidin. 

&#160;

&#183; 

To provide coordinated erythropoiesis resulting in increased reticulocyte Hb content (&#8220;CHr&#8221;), and increased mean corpuscular volume (&#8220;MCV&#8221;). 

&#160;

&#183; 

To improve kidney function. 

&#160;

In addition to the U.S. patents listed above, our HIF anemia-related technologies portfolio includes corresponding foreign patents granted and patent applications pending in various territories worldwide.

In March 2013, we obtained the grant of European Patent No. 1463823 (the &#8216;823 patent), which claims, among other things, the use of a heterocyclic carboxamide compound selected from the group consisting of pyridine carboxamides, quinoline carboxamides, isoquinoline carboxamides, cinnoline carboxamides and beta-carboline carboxamides that inhibits HIF-PH enzyme activity in the manufacture of a medicament for increasing EPO in the prevention, pretreatment, or treatment of anemia. The granted claims of the &#8216;823 patent encompass the use of roxadustat for the treatment of anemia. On December 5, 2013, Akebia Therapeutics, Inc. filed an opposition to the &#8216;823 patent with the European Patent Office. An opposition is a mechanism providing for a third-party challenge to a granted European patent. While we believe the &#8216;823 patent will be upheld in its entirety, the ultimate outcome of the opposition remains uncertain, and ultimate resolution of the proceeding may take two to four years or longer. However, narrowing or even revocation of the &#8216;823 patent would not affect our exclusivity for roxadustat or our freedom-to-operate with respect to use of roxadustat for the treatment of anemia. Akebia and other third parties may initiate additional or similar proceedings with the European Patent Office or other similar foreign jurisdictions.

FG-3019 Patent Portfolio

Our FG-3019 patent portfolio includes at least three granted U.S. patents providing composition-of-matter protection for FG-3019 and related antibodies, and for methods of using such in the treatment of fibroproliferative disorders, including IPF, liver fibrosis, and pancreatic cancer, which cases are owned by us or are exclusively licensed by us from Medarex, Inc. (now Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.). Exclusive of any patent term extension, the U.S. patents relating to composition-of-matter of FG-3019 are due to expire in 2024 or 2025. A corresponding patent has been granted in Europe and in multiple territories worldwide. Exclusive of any patent term extension, these foreign patents, and any patents that may grant from the pending foreign patent applications, are due to expire in 2024.

Under the Hatch-Waxman Act, we believe that, if FG-3019 is approved, we will be eligible for a full five year patent term extension for one U.S. patent relating to FG-3019. In addition, we believe that FG-3019, if approved under a BLA, should qualify for a 12-year period of exclusivity currently permitted by the BPCIA. Refer to &#8220;Government Regulation &#8212; Regulatory Exclusivity for Approved Products.&#8221; 

We also hold additional granted U.S. and foreign patents and pending patent applications directed to the use of FG-3019 to treat IPF, DMD, pancreatic cancer , liver fibrosis and other disorders. 

Trade Secrets and Know-How

In addition to patents, we rely upon proprietary trade secrets and know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, using confidentiality and other terms in agreements with our commercial partners, collaboration partners, consultants and employees. Such agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information, and may also grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with a third party, such as through invention assignment provisions. Agreements may expire and we could lose the benefit of confidentiality, or our agreements may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors.

&#160;

To the extent that our commercial partners, collaboration partners, employees and consultants use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. 

In-Licenses

Dana-Farber Cancer Institute

Effective March 2006, we entered into a license agreement with the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (&#8220;DFCI&#8221;), under which we obtained an exclusive license to certain patent applications, patents and biological materials for all uses. The patent rights relate to inhibition of prolyl hydroxylation of the alpha subunit of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-alpha), and include granted U.S. and foreign patents due to expire in 2022, exclusive of possible patent term extension. The licensed patents relate to use of HIF-PH inhibitors such as roxadustat.

Under the DFCI agreement, we are obligated to pay DFCI for past and ongoing patent prosecution expenses for the licensed patents. We are also obligated to pay DFCI annual maintenance fees, development milestone payments of up to $425,000, sales milestone payments of up to $3 million, and a sub-single digit royalty on net sales by us or our affiliates or sublicensees of products that are covered by the licensed patents or incorporate the licensed biological materials. In addition, each sublicense we grant is subject to a one-time fixed amount payment to DFCI.

Unless earlier terminated, the agreement will continue in effect, on a country-by-country basis, until the expiration of all licensed patents in a country or, if there is no patent covering a licensed product incorporating the licensed biological materials, until 20 years after the effective date of the agreement. DFCI may terminate the agreement for our uncured material breach, if we cease to carry on our business and development activities with respect to all licensed products, if we fail to comply with our insurance obligations, or if we are convicted of a felony related to the manufacture, use, sale or importation of licensed products. We may terminate the agreement at any time on prior written notice to DFCI.

University of Miami

In May 1997, we entered into a license agreement with the University of Miami (&#8220;the University&#8221;), amended in July 1999, under which we obtained an exclusive, worldwide license to certain patent applications and patents for all uses. The current patent rights include U.S. and foreign patents that relate to biologically active fragments of CTGF, and corresponding nucleic acids, proteins, and antibodies, and are due to expire in 2019, exclusive of any patent term extension that may be available. The licensed patents relate to FG-3019 and related products.

Under the University agreement, we are obligated to pay for all ongoing patent prosecution expenses for the licensed patents. We are also obligated to pay an upfront licensing fee of $21,500, all of which has been paid, and development milestone payments of up to $450,000, of which $50,000 has been paid, as well as an additional milestone payment, in the low hundreds of thousands of dollars, for each new indication for which we obtain approval for a licensed product, and a single digit royalty, subject to certain reductions, on net sales of licensed products by us or our affiliates or sublicensees.

Unless earlier terminated, the agreement will continue in effect, on a country-by-country basis, until the expiration of all licensed patents in a country. The University may terminate the agreement for our uncured material breach or bankruptcy. We may terminate the agreement for the University&#8217;s uncured material breach or at any time on prior written notice to the University.

Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (Medarex, Inc.)

Effective July 9, 1998 and as amended on June 30, 2001 and January 28, 2002, we entered into a research and commercialization agreement with Medarex, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary GenPharm International, Inc. (now, collectively, part of Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (&#8220;Medarex&#8221;)) to develop fully human monoclonal antibodies for potential anti-fibrotic therapies. Under the agreement, Medarex was responsible for using its proprietary immunizable transgenic mice or HuMAb-Mouse technology during a specified research period (&#8220;the Research Period&#8221;), to produce fully human antibodies against our proprietary antigen targets, including CTGF, for our exclusive use.

The agreement granted us an option to obtain an exclusive worldwide, royalty-bearing, commercial license to develop antibodies derived from Medarex&#8217;s HuMAb-Mouse technology, for use in the development and commercialization of diagnostic and therapeutic products. In December 2002, we exercised that option with respect to twelve antibodies inclusive of the antibody from which FG-3019 is derived. We granted back to Medarex an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable license, with the right to sublicense, to certain inventions created during the parties&#8217; research collaboration, with such license limited to use by Medarex outside the scope of our licensed antibodies.

&#160;

As a result of the exercise of our option to obtain the commercial license, Medarex is precluded from (i) knowingly using any technology involving immunizable transgenic mice containing unrearranged human immunoglobulin genes with any of our antigen targets that were the subject of the agreement, (ii) granting to a third party a commercial license that covers such antigen targets or those antibodies derived by Medarex during the Research Period, and (iii) using any antibodies derived by Medarex during the Research Period, except as permitted under the agreement for our benefit or to prosecute patent applications in accordance with the agreement. 

Medarex retained ownership of the patent rights relating to certain mice, mice materials, antibodies and hybridoma cell lines used by Medarex in connection with its activities under the agreement, and Medarex also owns certain claims in patents covering inventions that arise during the Research Period, which claims are directed to (i) compositions of matter (e.g., an antibody) except formulations of antibodies for therapeutic or diagnostic use, or (ii) methods of production. We own the patent rights to any inventions that arise during the Research Period that relate to antigens, as well as claims in patents covering inventions directed to (a) methods of use of an antibody, or (b) formulations of antibodies for therapeutic or diagnostic use. Upon exercise of our option to obtain the commercial license, we obtained the sole right but not obligation to control prosecution of patents relating solely to the licensed antibodies or products. Medarex has back-up patent prosecution rights in the event we decline to further prosecute or maintain such patents.

In addition to research support payments by us to Medarex during the Research Period, and an upfront commercial license fee in the form of 181,819 shares of FibroGen Series D Convertible Preferred Stock paid upon exercise of our option, we committed development-related milestone payments of up to $11 million per therapeutic product containing a licensed antibody, and we have paid a $1 million development-related milestone, in the form of 133,333 shares of FibroGen Series G Convertible Preferred Stock, for FG-3019 to date. At our election, the remaining milestone payments may be paid in common stock of FibroGen, Inc., or cash.

With respect to our sales and sales by our affiliates, the agreement also requires us to pay Medarex low single-digit royalties for licensed therapeutic products and low double-digit royalties, plus certain capped sales-based bonus royalties, for licensed diagnostic products. With respect to sales of licensed products by a sublicensee, we may elect to pay the same foregoing royalties or a high double-digit percentage of all payments received by us from such sublicensee. We are also required to reimburse Medarex any pass-through royalties, if any, payable under Medarex&#8217;s upstream license agreements with Medical Research Council and DNX. Royalties payable by us under the agreement are on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis and subject to reductions in specified circumstances, and royalties are payable for a period until either expiration of patents covering the applicable licensed product or a specified number of years following the first commercial sale of such product in the applicable country.

Unless earlier terminated, the agreement will continue in effect for as long as there are royalty payment obligations by us or our sublicensees. Either party may terminate the agreement for certain material breaches by the other party, or for bankruptcy, insolvency or similar circumstances. In addition, we may also terminate the agreement for convenience upon written notice.

Third Party Filings

Numerous U.S. and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications, which are owned by third parties, exist in the fields in which we are developing products. Because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be currently pending applications, unknown to us, which may later result in granted patents that use of our product candidates or proprietary technologies may infringe.

If a third party claims that we infringe its intellectual property rights, we may face a number of issues, including but not limited to, litigation expenses, substantial damages, attorney fees, injunction, royalty payments, cross-licensing of our patents, redesign of our products, or processes and related fees and costs.

We may be exposed to, or threatened with, future litigation by third parties having patent or other intellectual property rights alleging that our products, product candidates, and/or proprietary technologies infringe their intellectual property rights. If one of these patents were to be found to cover our products, product candidates, proprietary technologies, or their uses, we could be required to pay damages and could be restricted from commercializing our products, product candidates or using our proprietary technologies unless we obtain a license to the patent. A license may not be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all. In addition, during litigation, the patent holder might obtain a preliminary injunction or other equitable right, which could prohibit us from making, using or selling our products, technologies, or methods.

&#160;

EMPLOYEES 

As of January 31, 2016, we had 353 full-time employees, 87 of whom held Ph.D. or M.D. degrees, 276 of whom were engaged in research and development and 77 of whom were engaged in business development, finance, information systems, facilities, human resources or administrative support. None of our U.S. employees are represented by a labor union. The employees of FibroGen China are represented by a labor union under the China Labor Union Law. None of our employees have entered into a collective agreement with us. We consider our employee relations to be good.

FACILITIES

Our corporate and research and development operations are located in San Francisco, California, where we lease approximately 234,000 square feet of office and laboratory space with approximately 35,000 square feet subleased. The lease for our San Francisco headquarters expires in 2023. We also lease approximately 67,000 square feet of office and manufacturing space in Beijing, China. Our lease in China expires in 2021. We believe our facilities are adequate for our current needs and that suitable additional or substitute space would be available if needed.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

We are not currently a party to any material legal proceedings.

FINANCIAL INFORMATION

Information regarding our revenues, net loss and total assets is contained in our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Annual Report, which information is incorporated by reference here. For the specifics of our segment and geographic revenue, refer to Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements.

Research and development expenses for fiscal years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 were $214.1 million, $150.8 million, and $85.7 million, respectively. We expect our research and development expenses to continue to increase in the future as we advance our product candidates through clinical trials and expand our product candidate portfolio.

Our revenue to date has been generated primarily from our collaboration agreements with Astellas and AstraZeneca for the development and commercialization of roxadustat. For fiscal years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, substantially all of our revenue was related to our collaboration agreements.
