Our Company 

Energizer Holdings, Inc. (Energizer), through its operating subsidiaries, is one of the world&#8217;s largest manufacturers, marketers and distributors of household batteries, specialty batteries and lighting products, and a leading designer and marketer of automotive fragrance and appearance products. 

Energizer is the beneficiary of over 100 years of expertise in the battery and portable lighting products industries. Its brand names, Energizer&#174; and Eveready&#174;, have worldwide recognition for innovation, quality and dependability, and are marketed and sold around the world. On July 1, 2016, Energizer expanded its portfolio of brands with the acquisition of HandStands Holding Corporation (the auto care acquisition). 

On July 1, 2015, Energizer completed its legal separation from our former parent company, Edgewell Personal Care Company (Edgewell), via a tax free spin-off (the Spin-off or Spin). To effect the separation, Edgewell undertook a series of transactions to separate net assets and legal entities. 

To facilitate the Spin-off, Edgewell distributed 62,193,281 shares of Energizer common stock to its shareholders. Under the terms of the spin-off, Edgewell common stockholders of record as of the close of business on June 16, 2015, the record date for the distribution, received one share in Energizer for each share of Edgewell common stock they held. Edgewell completed the distribution of Energizer common stock to its shareholders on July 1, 2015, the distribution date. 

As a result of the Spin-off, Energizer now operates as an independent, publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange, trading under the symbol "ENR." 

When we use the terms &#8220;Energizer,&#8221; the &#8220;Company,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us&#8221; or &#8220;our&#8221; in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we mean Energizer Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, unless we state or the context implies otherwise. 

We use the Energizer name and logo as our trademark as well as those of our subsidiaries. Product names appearing throughout are trademarks of Energizer. This section also may refer to brand names, trademarks, service marks and trade names of other companies and organizations, and these brand names, trademarks, service marks and trade names are the property of their respective owners. 

Unless indicated otherwise, the information concerning our industry contained in this Annual Report is based on Energizer&#8217;s general knowledge of and expectations concerning the industry. Energizer&#8217;s market position, market share and industry market size are based on estimates using Energizer&#8217;s internal data and estimates, based on data from various industry analyses, its internal research and adjustments and assumptions that it believes to be reasonable.

Our Products 

Today, Energizer offers batteries using many technologies including lithium, alkaline, carbon zinc, nickel metal hydride, zinc air, and silver oxide. These products are sold under the Energizer and Eveready brands in the performance, premium and price segments and include primary, rechargeable, specialty and hearing aid products. In addition, Energizer has an extensive line of lighting products designed to meet a variety of consumer needs. We manufacture, distribute, and market lighting products including headlights, lanterns, kid&#8217;s lights and area lights. In addition to the Energizer and Eveready brands, we market our flashlights under the Hard Case&#174;, Dolphin&#174;, and WeatherReady&#174; sub-brands. In addition to batteries and portable lights, Energizer licenses the Energizer and Eveready brands to companies developing consumer solutions in gaming, automotive batteries, portable power for critical devices (like smart phones), LED light bulbs and other lighting products. 

Energizer has a long history of innovation within our categories. Since our commercialization of the first dry-cell battery in 1893 and the first flashlight in 1899, we have been committed to developing and marketing new products to meet evolving consumer needs and consistently advancing battery technology as the universe of devices powered by batteries has evolved. Over the past 100+ years we have developed or brought to market: 

&#8226; the first flashlight; 

&#8226; the first mercury-free alkaline battery; 

&#8226; the first mercury-free hearing aid battery; 

&#8226; Energizer Ultimate Lithium&#174;, the world&#8217;s longest-lasting AA and AAA battery for high-tech devices; and 

&#8226; 

Energizer EcoAdvanced&#174;, the world&#8217;s first high performance AA battery made with 4% recycled batteries. 

Our approach is grounded in meeting the needs of consumers. In household batteries, we offer a broad portfolio of batteries that deliver long-lasting performance, reliability and quality, which we believe provide consumers the best overall experience. In addition to primary battery technology we offer consumers primary rechargeable options, as well as hearing aid and specialty batteries. This broad portfolio allows us to penetrate a wide range of markets and consumer segments. 

Our innovative line of portable lighting products is designed to meet a breadth of consumer needs, from outdoor activities to emergency situations. With our experience and insight, we are bringing lighting solutions to market that are designed to enhance the lives of consumers worldwide. 

In addition, with our recent auto care acquisition, Energizer's portfolio of innovative products now includes automotive fragrance and appearance products marketed under the Refresh Your Car!&#174;, California Scents&#174;, Driven&#174;, Bahama &#38; Co.&#174;, LEXOL&#174;, and Eagle One&#174; brands.

To ensure a full understanding, you should read the selected historical financial data presented below in conjunction with &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; and the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. 

Our Industry 

&#160; We are a branded manufacturing and distribution company that markets and sells in the battery, lights and auto care categories. These categories are highly competitive, both in the U.S. and on a global basis. We have a large global footprint, and we manufacture and source our products to develop the product portfolio needed to compete for consumers and limited retail shelf space. Competition is based upon brand perceptions, product performance, retail execution, customer service and price. 

A key driver of the battery business is device technology and consumer trends. As the transition to built-in rechargeables is maturing and the Internet of Things (IoT) technology is enabling a new class of devices that, in many instances, are powered with primary batteries, we believe the number of devices utilizing primary batteries has stabilized, although we continue to expect to see decline over the long-term. While we believe these trends will lead to a reduction in the decline in category volume, competition in this category remains aggressive in the U.S. and other markets and could continue to put additional pressure on our results going forward. 

In household batteries, Energizer offers batteries using carbon zinc, alkaline, lithium, nickel metal hydride, zinc air, and silver oxide constructions. These products are sold under the Energizer and Eveready brands in the performance, premium and price segments and include primary, rechargeable, specialty and hearing aid products. In the higher-price premium and performance market segments, characterized by the alkaline and lithium technologies, our primary competitor is Duracell International, Inc. (Duracell). Duracell, which primarily produces batteries using alkaline technology, is a significant competitor in North America, Latin America, Asia and EMEA. In the price-conscious market segment, characterized by alkaline and carbon zinc technologies, we compete with a number of local country and regional manufacturers of private-label, or &#8220;non-branded,&#8221; batteries, as well as branded battery manufacturers such as Spectrum Brands, Inc. and Panasonic Corporation, primarily in Latin America, Asia and EMEA. Alkaline and lithium batteries are generally both more technologically advanced and generally more expensive, with a longer battery life, than carbon zinc batteries. Our sales in North America, Europe and more developed economies throughout the world are concentrated in alkaline batteries. We believe that private-label, or &#8220;non-branded,&#8221; sales by large retailers also have an impact on the market in some parts of the world, particularly in certain European markets such as Germany and Spain. 

The portable lights category volume is flat to slightly down due to LED technology and fewer global disasters. Our competition is highly fragmented with diverse competitors by markets, including private-label. Our portfolio includes portable lights under the Energizer and Eveready brands globally as well as the Dolphin brand in Australia and New Zealand. Across all brands we have a portfolio that includes hand-held, hands-free and area lighting. 

Within the auto care category, Energizer has a broad portfolio of brands, including Refresh Your Car!, Driven, California Scents, and Bahama &#38; Co. within the auto fragrance sub-category, and LEXOL and Eagle One within the auto appearance sub-category. 

We sell to our retailer customers through a combination of a direct sales force as well as exclusive and non-exclusive third party distributors and wholesalers, based on our international go-to-market strategy for a particular market. 

Sales and Distribution 

We distribute our products to consumers through numerous retail locations worldwide, including mass merchandisers and warehouse clubs, food, drug and convenience stores, electronics specialty stores and department stores, hardware and automotive centers, military stores and e-commerce. Although a large percentage of our sales are attributable to a relatively small number of retail customers, in fiscal year 2016, only Wal-Mart stores, Inc. and its subsidiaries, as a group, accounted for ten percent or more ( 10.4% ) of the Company's annual sales. 

Our products are marketed primarily through a direct sales force, but also through exclusive and non-exclusive distributors and wholesalers. Our products are sold through both &#8220;modern&#8221; and &#8220;traditional&#8221; trade. &#8220;Modern&#8221; trade, which is most prevalent in North America, Western Europe, and more developed economies throughout the world, generally refers to sales through large retailers with nationally or regionally recognized brands. &#8220;Traditional&#8221; trade, which is more common in developing markets in Latin America, Asia and EMEA, generally refers to sales by wholesalers or small retailers who may not have a national or regional presence. 

Because of the short period between order and shipment date (generally less than one month) for most of our orders, the dollar amount of current backlog is not material and is not considered to be a reliable indicator of future sales volume. Generally, sales to our top customers are made pursuant to purchase orders and we do not have guarantees of minimum purchases from them. As a result, these customers may cancel their purchase orders or reschedule or decrease their level of purchases from us at any time. 

Sources and Availability of Raw Materials 

The principal raw materials used by Energizer include electrolytic manganese dioxide, zinc, silver, nickel, lithium, graphite, steel cans, plastic, brass wire, separator paper, and potassium hydroxide. The prices and availability of these raw 

materials have fluctuated over time. We believe that adequate supplies of the raw materials required for our operations are available at the present time, although we cannot predict the future availability or prices of such materials. These raw materials are generally available from a number of different sources, and the prices of those raw materials are susceptible to currency fluctuations and price fluctuations due to transportation, government regulations, price controls, economic climate, or other unforeseen circumstances. In the past, we have not experienced any significant interruption in availability of raw materials. We believe we have extensive experience in purchasing raw materials in the commodity markets. From time to time, our management has purchased materials or entered into forward commitments for various ingredients to assure supply and to protect margins on anticipated sales volume. 

Our Trademarks, Patents and Technology 

Our ability to compete effectively in the battery and portable lighting categories depends, in part, on our ability to protect our brands and maintain the proprietary nature of our technologies and manufacturing processes through a combination of trademark, patent and trade secret protection. We own thousands of Energizer and Eveready trademarks globally, which we consider to be of substantial importance and which are used individually or in conjunction with other sub-brand names. As of September 30, 2016, the Energizer trademark was registered in 171 countries, and the Eveready trademark was registered in 152 countries, including in each case, in the United States. Additionally, the Energizer Bunny design trademark was registered in 44 countries, including in the United States, and the Mr. Energizer &#32; design trademark was registered in 63 countries and the European Union. The number of Energizer, Eveready, Energizer bunny design, and Mr. Energizer &#32; design trademarks, including related designs, slogans and sub-brands, is currently over 3,000 worldwide. From our recent auto care acquisition, as of September 30, 2016, we also have the Refresh Your Car! trademark registered in 20 countries, the California Scents trademark registered in 21 countries, the Driven trademark registered in 25 countries, the Bahama &#38; Co. trademark registered in 22 countries, the LEXOL trademark registered in 9 countries, and the Eagle One trademark registered in 104 countries. Each of the referenced trademarks is registered in the United States. The number of trademarks for each of these brand&#8217;s portfolio globally, including related designs, slogans, and sub-brands, is currently over 380 worldwide. 

We also own a number of patents, patent applications and other technology that relate primarily to battery, lighting and automotive fragrance and appearance products, which we believe are significant to our business. As of September 30, 2016, we owned approximately 627 United States utility and design patents, which have a range of expiration dates from November 2016 to December 2035, and approximately 47 United States pending patent applications. We expect to routinely prepare additional patent applications for filing in the United States and abroad. As of September 30, 2016, we owned (directly or beneficially) approximately 920 foreign patents and approximately 85 patent applications pending in foreign countries. 

Seasonality 

Sales and operating profit for our business tend to be seasonal, with increased purchases by consumers and increases in retailer inventories occurring for batteries during our fiscal first quarter and for automotive fragrance and appearance products during our fiscal second and third quarters. In addition, natural disasters such as hurricanes can create conditions that drive short-term increases in the need for portable power and lighting products and thereby increase our battery and flashlight sales. As a result of this seasonality, our inventory and working capital needs fluctuate significantly throughout the year. 

Employees 

As of September 30, 2016, we have approximately 4,800 employees, including approximately 1,500 employees based in the U.S. Approximately 30 employees are unionized, primarily at our Marietta, Ohio facility. Overall, we consider our employee relations to be good. 

&#160; 

&#32; Governmental Regulations and Environmental Matters 

Our operations are subject to various federal, state, foreign and local laws and regulations intended to protect public health and the environment. 

Contamination has been identified at certain current and former facilities as well as third-party waste disposal sites, and we are conducting investigation and remediation activities in relation to such properties. In connection with certain sites, we have received notices from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, state agencies and/or private parties seeking contribution that we have been identified as a &#8220;potentially responsible party&#8221; under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, and that we will be required to share in the cost of cleanup. The amount of our 

ultimate liability in connection with such facilities and sites will depend on many factors, including the type and extent of contamination, the remediation methods and technology to be used, the extent to which other parties may share liability and, in the case of waste disposal sites, the volume and toxicity of material contributed to the site. In fiscal year 2016, we spent approximately $2 million on environmental remedial matters. However, our remediation costs could fluctuate, including from the discovery of additional contamination or the imposition of further cleanup obligations. 

Total environmental capital expenditures and operating expenses continue to increase, although due to optimization efforts, the expenditures are not expected to have a material effect on our total capital and operating expenditures, consolidated earnings or competitive position at this time. Current environmental spending estimates could be modified as a result of changes in legal requirements or the enforcement or interpretation of existing requirements, including any requirements related to global climate change, or other factors. Any imposition of new or more stringent environmental requirements and increased enforcement may increase the risk and expense of doing business in such countries.
