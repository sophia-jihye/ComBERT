As used in this annual report on Form 10-K, the terms &#8220;we&#8221;, &#8220;us&#8221; &#8220;our&#8221; and &#8220;bBooth&#8221; refer to bBooth, Inc., a Nevada corporation, and our wholly-owned subsidiaries, bBooth (USA), Inc. and Global System Designs Inc., unless otherwise specified. 

&#160; 

Corporate Overview &#8211; Formation, Corporate Changes and Material Mergers and Acquisitions 

&#160; 

We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on November 27, 2012. Following incorporation, our business related to the development and marketing of &#8220;green building&#8221; information for homeowners and owners-builders. In January 2013, we formed a Canadian subsidiary, &#8220;Global System Designs Inc.&#8221; in response to Canadian demand for consultative building services. In the second quarter of 2014, we decided to explore alternative business opportunities in order to maximize shareholder value. 

&#160; 

On October 16, 2014, we completed the acquisition of bBooth (USA), Inc., a private Nevada corporation (&#8220;bBooth USA&#8221;), pursuant to the terms of a share exchange agreement dated August 11, 2014, as amended, among our company, bBooth USA and the shareholders of bBooth USA (the &#8220;Exchange Agreement&#8221;). As a result of our acquisition of bBooth USA, we ceased to be a &#8220;shell company&#8221; as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 , as amended. 

&#160; 

bBooth USA was formed as a limited liability company under the laws of the State of Nevada under the name &#8220;Cutaia Media Group, LLC&#8221; on December 12, 2012. On May 19, 2014, Cutaia Media Group, LLC effected a merger under the laws of the State of Nevada with its affiliate, bBooth, Inc., a Nevada corporation, with bBooth, Inc. as the surviving corporation, in order to convert from a limited liability company into a corporation. On October 17, 2014, we changed the name of the private Nevada corporation to &#8220;bBooth (USA), Inc.&#8221;. 

&#160; 

bBooth USA was focused on the manufacture and operation of internet-connected, kiosk-sized, professional-quality portable audio-video recording studios, branded and marketed under the name of &#8220;bBooth&#8221;, as further described below under &#8220;Our Business&#8221;). 

&#160; 

Prior to the closing of the Exchange Agreement, on October 6, 2014, our company effected a name change by merging with our wholly-owned Nevada subsidiary named &#8220;bBooth, Inc.&#8221;, with the surviving corporation having the new name of &#8220;bBooth Inc.&#8221;. In addition, on October 6, 2014, our company effected a two for one forward stock split of our authorized and issued and outstanding common shares. As a result, our authorized capital of common stock increased from 100,000,000 shares of common stock with a par value of $0.0001 per share to 200,000,000 shares of common stock with a par value of $0.0001 per share and our outstanding shares of common stock increased from 5,825,000 shares to 11,650,000 common shares outstanding. The 15,000,000 shares of preferred stock with a par value of $0.0001 per share authorized under our capital structure were unchanged in connection with the forward stock split of our common shares. The Nevada subsidiary referred to in this paragraph was created solely for the purpose of effecting the name change and stock split. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

The name change and forward split became effective for trading purposes at the opening of trading on October 16, 2014 under the stock symbol &#8220;GLSID&#8221;. Our stock symbol was changed to &#8220;BBTH&#8221; effective on November 12, 2014. Our new CUSIP number is 07331L 108. 

&#160; 

Immediately prior to the closing of the Exchange Agreement, bBooth USA converted loans in the aggregate amount of $1,669,316 in principal and accrued interest into an aggregate of 4,769,473 shares of bBooth USA&#8217;s common stock, at a conversion price of $0.35 per share. All of such bBooth USA shares were then converted into shares of our common stock on a one for one basis in connection with the closing of the Exchange Agreement. 

&#160; 

Between September 30, 2014 and October 2, 2014, bBooth USA completed a private placement pursuant to which it issued an aggregate of 9,000,000 shares of common stock at a price of $0.50 per share for gross proceeds of $4,500,000. bBooth USA also issued an aggregate of 659,600 shares of common stock and paid an aggregate cash fee of $412,250 to certain finders in connection with the private placement. Such finders were also reimbursed an aggregate of $23,072 for expenses incurred in connection with the private placement. All of the shares of bBooth USA&#8217;s common stock issued in connection with the private placement, including the shares issued to the finders, were converted into shares of our common stock on a one for one basis in connection with the closing of the Exchange Agreement. 

&#160; 

On December 11, 2014, Songstagram, Inc. (&#8220;Songstagram&#8221;) and Rocky Wright (&#8220;Wright&#8221;) issued secured promissory notes (collectively, the &#8220;Promissory Notes&#8221;) in connection with advances that our company made to Songstagram and Wright. The advances were made by our company in connection with ongoing negotiations for a possible acquisition of Songstagram or its assets by our company. Pursuant to the Promissory Notes, Songstagram has promised to pay us the principal sum of $475,000, together with interest at a rate equal to 8% per annum and Wright has promised to pay us the principal sum of $386,435, together with interest at a rate equal to 8% per annum. All unpaid principal, together with any then unpaid and accrued interest and other amounts payable under the Promissory Notes, were due and payable on the earlier of (i) our demand for payment; or (ii) when, upon or after the occurrence of an event of default, we declared such amounts due and payable or such amounts were made automatically due and payable under the terms of the Promissory Notes. During any period in which an event of default had occurred and was continuing, Songstagram and Wright, as applicable, agreed to pay interest on the unpaid principal balance at a rate of 13% per annum. The Promissory Notes could have been prepaid without our prior written consent. 

&#160; 

In connection with the Promissory Notes, we took security over all of the assets of Songstagram and Wright (related to Songstagram) pursuant to security agreements (collectively, the &#8220;Security Agreements&#8221;) with Songstagram and Wright dated December 11, 2014. Pursuant to the Security Agreements, Songstagram and Wright, as applicable, agreed to, among other things, (i) pay all secured obligations when due; (ii) upon or following the occurrence of an event of default, pay all of our costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys&#8217; fees, incurred by us in the perfection, preservation, realization, enforcement and exercise of our rights, powers and remedies under the Security Agreements; and (iii) execute and deliver such documents as we deemed necessary to create, perfect and continue the security interests. 

&#160; 

Effective January 20, 2015, we entered into an acquisition agreement (the &#8220;Acquisition Agreement&#8221;) with Songstagram and Wright, pursuant to which we agreed to acquire from Wright all assets and intellectual property that Wright owned related to, or used in connection with: (i) the business of Songstagram, (ii) the assets owned and/or used by Songstagram, (iii) the Songstagram software application, (iv) the business and assets of Qubeey Inc. (&#8220;Qubeey&#8221;), and (v) all software applications of Qubeey, in consideration of the forgiveness of all principal and interest owing by Wright to our company under the Promissory Notes. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

In connection with the Acquisition Agreement, we also agreed to employ Wright in a position, and upon terms and conditions, to be mutually agreed upon by our company and Wright. Wright also agreed that any prior agreements between Wright and Songstagram were of no further force or effect, and that any right, title, interest or claim Wright might have in connection with such agreements was fully satisfied and extinguished. Wright and Songstagram also released our company, and other third parties associated or affiliated with our company, from any claims arising under any such agreements, or otherwise, with respect to the business and assets of Songstagram and Qubeey. 

&#160; 

In connection with the Acquisition Agreement and our prior demand for the repayment of all monies owing by Songstagram to our company under the Promissory Notes, as Songstagram was unable to repay such monies, Songstagram consented to the enforcement of the security granted under the Security Agreements, by way of a strict foreclosure. In accordance with the terms of the Acquisition Agreement, and as further provided for in a surrender of collateral, consent to strict foreclosure and release agreement dated January 20, 2015 (the &#8220;Surrender of Collateral, Consent to Strict Foreclosure and Release Agreement&#8221;) between our company and Songstagram, Songstagram agreed to turn over all collateral pledged under the Security Agreements and consented to our retaining such collateral in satisfaction of the indebtedness due under the Promissory Notes. 

&#160; 

In connection with the Acquisition Agreement, we and Songstagram entered into termination agreements and releases (each, a &#8220;Termination Agreement&#8221;) with six employees of, or consultants to, Songstagram pursuant to which each such persons agreed to: (i) the termination of any existing agreements to which they and Songstagram were parties, and (ii) release any claims against our company and Songstagram with respect to the assets and business of Songstagram and Qubeey. 

&#160; 

Effective March 4, 2015, we entered into a settlement and release agreement with Songstagram and Jeff Franklin (&#8220;Franklin&#8221;), pursuant to which we paid $10,000 and issued 500,000 shares of common stock of our company to Franklin in full settlement and release of a claim that he had on certain assets that we acquired from Songstagram and in consideration of his transfer to us a secured lien he held on assets of Qubeey. 

&#160; 

Effective March 5, 2015, the Company entered into a settlement and release agreement with Songstagram and Art Malone Jr., pursuant to which the Company agreed to issue 320,000 shares of common stock to Mr. Malone in full settlement and release of a claim he had on certain assets the Company acquired from Songstagram. The shares of common stock issued to Mr. Malone were valued at $160,000 and were included as part of the acquisition price of Songstagram. The 320,000 shares of common stock were issued to Mr. Malone on April 29, 2015. 

&#160; 

Our Business 

&#160; 

Our business has evolved from one based primarily on our mall-based bBooth kiosks and mobile apps, narrowly focused on talent discovery, to a cloud-based, enterprise level platform, tentatively branded as NOTIFI, developed to address a much larger target market that includes corporate users, consumer brands, and media companies, among others, seeking large scale internal and external messaging and communications capabilities. Offered through bBoothTech, our new, wholly owned technology licensing division, the NOTIFI platform is a fully integrated mobile, desktop, and web-based application, with robust back-end administration and data collection capabilities, designed to provide small, medium and large-scale enterprise users, among others, with the ability to send, receive and manage enhanced, media-rich, highly-engaging messaging for both internal and external communications, as well as for interactive online training and teaching applications.

&#160; 

What distinguishes NOTIFI from other corporate messaging and communications platforms available in the marketplace today is our proprietary &#8220;push-to-screen&#8221; and &#8220;walk-out&#8221; technologies enabling users to assertively push messaging directly to the screens of their subscribers, employees, followers, fans, consumers, customers, partners, distributors, affiliates, and/or team members &#8211; in a media-rich format that can include interactive text, graphics, and video, as well as our &#8216;walk-out&#8217; video messaging technology where the message is delivered by someone who appears to walk-out onto the desktop or mobile screens of targeted recipients, inviting interactivity and engagement &#8211; without the recipients having to open a web-browser or other mobile or desktop program. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Revenue Generation 

&#160; 

We intend to generate revenue from the following sources: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; &#160; Recurring license fees paid by enterprise users for blanket distribution of the applications to, and access by, enterprise employees or affiliates &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; &#160; Recurring subscription fees paid by individual users &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; &#160; In-app and online purchases by users to access various premium services, features, functionality, and options of the platform (such as &#8216;walk-out&#8217; send capability, as well as audio and video enhancement features); &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; User data/lead generation fees from the sale of demographic data &#160; 

Operations 

&#160; 

Our company is headquartered in West Hollywood, California, where our executive, administration and operational management are based. 

&#160; 

Our Market 

&#160; 

Our market is intentionally broad and it includes online marketers, advertisers, sponsors, social media celebrities, entertainment celebrities and performance artists, enterprise users - large and small, religious organizations, health care providers, network and multi-level marketing companies, consumer brands, media companies, major motion picture studios, social media companies, and virtually any other person or organization that seeks to attract, engage, and communicate with customers, consumers, fans, followers, patients, friends, and subscribers, among others, online, utilizing an interactive, highly effective vehicle. 

&#160; 

Distribution Methods 

&#160; 

Our mobile applications will be available in Apple&#8217;s App Store for IOS devices and in Google&#8217;s Google Play Store for Android devices. Desktop/laptop versions for Windows and Mac computers will be available on our website. 

&#160; 

Marketing 

&#160; 

Our marketing strategy is two-fold. First, we leverage the existing relationships we have in the entertainment industry, such as those that we&#8217;ve developed through our engagement by American Idol TM to manage their auditions through our bBooth kiosks for the show&#8217;s current season, among other such industry relationships. These relationships have resulted in a fairly robust sales pipeline of potential customers for our products and services, all of which are in various stages of development, testing, due diligence and/or negotiation. 

&#160; 

Second, we&#8217;ve recently completed development of a new sales tool which allows us to &#8220;push&#8221; a demonstration of our technology, and associated sales pitch, directly to the screens of our business prospects through a link sent via email, text message, Facebook, and even through a Twitter feed, among other means, allowing our targeted recipients to experience the impact of our technology right on their own mobile and desktop devices. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

While we aware of numerous providers of enterprise level messaging and communications platforms, we are unaware of anyone offering products or services in the marketplace that are comparable to our proprietary &#8216;push-to-screen&#8217; and &#8216;walk-out&#8217; technologies. 

&#160; 

Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

bBooth&#8217;s operating system, our apps and our NOTIFI platform are comprised of proprietary software, code and know-how that are of key importance to our plan of operations. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Research and Development 

&#160; 

We spent $81,588 on research and development during the year ended December 31, 2015, and $156,762 on research and development during the year ended December 31, 2014. These funds were primarily used for development of our software and mobile app. 

&#160; 

Sources and Availability of Products and Names of Principal Suppliers 

&#160; 

bBooth currently relies on certain key suppliers and vendors in the construction of its booths and for the maintenance, hosting, and enhancement of our operating software. Management believes it has mitigated the associated risks of these single-source vendor relationships by carefully selecting vendors that are large, financially stable, and have long and successful operating histories with demonstrated ability to deliver similar solutions. bBooth&#8217;s contracts with these vendors does not represent a material portion of their revenue. In addition, bBooth is actively engaged in the process of evaluating additional vendors and suppliers to provide like or complementary services. 

&#160; 

Dependence on Key Customers 

&#160; 

Based on our business plan and anticipated future activities as described in this annual report, we do not expect to have any significant customer concentration and accordingly, we do not expect to be dependent on any key customers. 

&#160; 

Government Regulation 

&#160; 

Government regulation is not of significant concern for the bBooth business nor is government regulation expected to become an impediment to the business in the near or mid-term as management is currently unaware of any planned or anticipated government regulation that would have a material impact on the business. bBooth management believes it currently possesses all requisite authority to conduct its business as described in this annual report. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

We currently operate with 6 full time employees. We also employ consultants on an as-needed-basis to provide specific expertise in areas of software design, development and coding, content creation, audio and video editing, video production services, and other business functions including marketing and accounting. None of our employees or consultants, all of whom work in North America, are currently covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have had no labor-related work stoppages and we believe our relations with our employees and consultants are excellent. 

&#160; 

Seasonality of Business 

&#160; 

There is no seasonality with respect to our business or major fluctuations in monthly demand. 

&#160;
