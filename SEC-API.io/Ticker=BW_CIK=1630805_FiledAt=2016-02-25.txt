 Item 1. BUSINESS 

Overview 

In this annual report on Form 10-K, unless the context otherwise indicates, "B&#38;W," "we," "us," the "Company" and "our" mean Babcock &#38; Wilcox Enterprises, Inc. and its consolidated and combined subsidiaries. 

On June 8, 2015, the board of directors of The Babcock &#38; Wilcox Company (now known as BWX Technologies, Inc.) ("BWC" or the "former Parent") approved the spin-off of B&#38;W through the distribution of shares of B&#38;W common stock to holders of BWC common stock. The distribution of B&#38;W common stock was made on June 30, 2015, and consisted of one share of B&#38;W common stock for every two shares of BWC common stock to holders of BWC common stock as of 5:00 p.m. New York City time on the record date, June 18, 2015. Cash was paid in lieu of any fractional shares of B&#38;W common stock. On June 30, 2015, B&#38;W became a separate publicly traded company, and BWC did not retain any ownership interest in B&#38;W. We filed our Form 10 describing the spin-off with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which was declared effective on June 16, 2015. The spin-off is further described in Note 1 &#32;to the consolidated and combined financial statements included in Item 8 . 

B&#38;W is a leading technology-based provider of advanced fossil and renewable power generation and environmental equipment that includes a broad suite of boiler products and environmental systems, and services for power and industrial uses. We specialize in technology and engineering for power generation and various other industries, the related procurement, erection and specialty manufacturing of equipment, and the provision of related services, including: 

&#8226; 

high-pressure equipment for energy conversion, such as boilers fueled by coal, oil, bitumen, natural gas, and renewables including municipal solid waste and biomass fuels; 

&#8226; 

environmental control systems for both power generation and industrial applications to incinerate, filter, capture, recover and/or purify air, liquid and vapor-phase effluents from a variety of power generation and specialty manufacturing processes; 

&#8226; 

aftermarket support for the global installed base of operating plants with a wide variety of products and technical services including replacement parts, retrofit and upgrade capabilities, field engineering, construction, inspection, operations and maintenance, condition assessment and other technical support; and 

&#8226; 

engineered-to-order services, products and systems for energy conversion worldwide and related auxiliary equipment, such as burners, pulverizers, soot blowers and ash and material handling systems. 

We operate in three reportable segments: Global Power, Global Services and Industrial Environmental. Through our Global Power segment, we engineer, manufacture, procure, construct and commission boilers fueled by fossil fuels and renewables in addition to environmental systems and related auxiliary equipment primarily to steam generating customers globally. Through our Global Services segment, we provide aftermarket products and services to steam generating utilities worldwide and numerous industrial customers globally. We have supplied the boilers for approximately 35% of the coal-fired electric generating capacity in the United States. We also provide aftermarket services for global installed units delivered by other original equipment suppliers. Through our Industrial Environmental segment, we provide a range of environmental technology and services to numerous industrial end markets globally. We established the operations constituting this segment through Babcock &#38; Wilcox MEGTEC Holdings, Inc. ("MEGTEC"), which we acquired on June 20, 2014. See Note 17 &#32;in our consolidated and combined financial statements included in Item 8 &#32;for additional information about our segments. 

Our overall activity depends significantly on the capital expenditures and operations and maintenance expenditures of global electric power generating companies, other steam-using industries and industrial facilities with environmental compliance needs. Several factors influence these expenditures, including: 

&#8226; 

prices for electricity, along with the cost of production and distribution including the cost of fuel within the United States or internationally; 

&#8226; 

demand for electricity and other end products of steam-generating facilities; 

&#8226; 

requirements for environmental improvements; 

&#8226; 

impact of potential United States and international requirements to significantly limit or reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the future; 

&#8226; 

environmental policies which include waste-to-energy or biomass as options to meet legislative requirements and clean energy portfolio standards; 

&#8226; 

level of capacity utilization at operating power plants and other industrial uses of steam production; 

&#8226; 

requirements for maintenance and upkeep at operating power plants to combat the accumulated effects of usage; 

&#8226; 

overall strength of the industrial industry; and 

&#8226; 

ability of electric power generating companies and other steam users to raise capital. 

Customer demand is heavily affected by the variations in our customers' business cycles and by the overall economies and energy and environmental policies of the countries in which they operate.

See Note 3 &#32;to our consolidated and combined financial statements included in Item 8 &#32;for additional information. 

Joint Ventures 

We participate in the ownership of a variety of entities with third parties, primarily through corporations, limited liability companies and partnerships, which we refer to as "joint ventures." We enter into joint ventures primarily for specific market access and to enhance our manufacturing, design and global production operations as well as reduce operating and financial risk profiles. We generally account for our investments in joint ventures under the equity method of accounting. Our unconsolidated joint ventures are described below. 

&#8226; 

Babcock &#38; Wilcox Beijing Company, Ltd. ("BWBC") We own equal interests in this entity with Beijing Jingcheng Machinery Electric Holding Company, Ltd. BWBC was formed in 1986 and is located in Beijing, China. Its main activities are the design, manufacture, production and sale of various power plant and industrial boilers. BWBC expands our markets internationally and provides additional capacity to our boiler products. 

&#8226; 

Thermax Babcock &#38; Wilcox Energy Solutions Private Limited ("TBWES") &#32;In June 2010, one of our subsidiaries and Thermax Ltd., a boiler manufacturer based in India, formed a joint venture to build subcritical and highly efficient supercritical boilers and pulverizers for the Indian utility boiler market. We have licensed to TBWES our technology for subcritical boilers 300 MW and larger, highly efficient supercritical boilers and coal pulverizers. In 2013, TBWES finalized construction of a facility in India designed to produce parts for up to 3,000 MW of utility boiler capacity per year. 

&#8226; 

Halley &#38; Mellowes Pty. Ltd. ("HMA") Diamond Power International, Inc., one of our wholly owned subsidiaries, owns an interest in this Australian company, which was formed in 1984. HMA manufactures, sells 

and services a wide range of capital plant equipment to a diverse range of industries. These include the mining, processing, materials handling, water management, power generation, and oil and gas industries. HMA offers complete service, from equipment selection to installation to commissioning and maintenance, with offices and service facilities located in and serving Australia, New Zealand, Indonesia and South Africa. 

&#8226; 

Other Project Related Ventures &#32;From time to time, we partner with other companies to better meet the needs of our customers, which can result in project-related joint venture entities. Examples of this include BWM Ottumwa Environmental Partners, where we formed a joint venture with Burns &#38; McDonnell Engineering Company, Inc., to engineer, procure, and construct environmental control systems for the Ottumwa Generating Station, a United States based project that was substantially completed in 2014. We also formed BWL Energy Ltd. with Lagan to complete the construction of the Teeside waste wood fired boiler project in the United Kingdom. This joint venture combines our expertise in the waste-to-energy power plant design, engineering, procurement and construction with our partner's civil construction capability to provide a full turnkey product to our customer. 

Contracts 

We execute our contracts through a variety of methods, including fixed-price, cost-plus, target price cost incentive, cost-reimbursable or some combination of these methods. Contracts are usually awarded through a competitive bid process. Factors that customers may consider include price, technical capabilities of equipment and personnel, plant or equipment availability, efficiency, safety record and reputation. 

Fixed-price contracts are for a fixed amount to cover all costs and any profit element for a defined scope of work. Fixed-price contracts entail more risk to us because they require us to predetermine both the quantities of work to be performed and the costs associated with executing the work. For further specification see "Risk Factors Related to Our Business &#8211; We are subject to risks associated with contractual pricing in our industry, including the risk that, if our actual costs exceed the costs we estimate on our fixed-price contracts, our profitability will decline, and we may suffer losses" as outlined in Item 1A of this report. 

We have contracts that extend beyond one year. Most of our long-term contracts have provisions for progress payments. We attempt to cover anticipated increases in labor, material and service costs of our long-term contracts either through an estimate of such changes, which is reflected in the original price, or through risk-sharing mechanisms, such as escalation or price adjustments for items such as labor and commodity prices. 

We generally recognize our contract revenues and related costs on a percentage-of-completion basis. Accordingly, we review contract price and cost estimates regularly as the work progresses and reflect adjustments in profit proportionate to the percentage of completion in the period when we revise those estimates. To the extent that these adjustments result in a reduction or an elimination of previously reported profits with respect to a project, we would recognize a charge against current earnings, which could be material. 

Our arrangements with customers frequently require us to provide letters of credit, bid and performance bonds or guarantees to secure bids or performance under contracts, which may involve significant amounts for contract security. 

In the event of a contract deferral or cancellation, we generally would be entitled to recover costs incurred, settlement expenses and profit on work completed prior to deferral or termination. Significant or numerous cancellations could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 

Other sales, such as parts and certain aftermarket service activities, are not in the form of long-term contracts, and we recognize revenues as goods are delivered and work is performed. 

Backlog 

Backlog represents the dollar amount of revenue we expect to recognize in the future from contracts awarded and in progress. Not all of our expected revenue from a contract award is recorded in backlog for a variety of reasons, including that some projects are awarded and completed within the same fiscal period. 

Backlog is not a measure defined by generally accepted accounting principles. It is possible that our methodology for determining backlog may not be comparable to methods used by other companies. Backlog may not be indicative of future operating results, and projects in our backlog may be cancelled, modified or otherwise altered by customers. Additionally, because we operate globally, our backlog is impacted by changes in foreign currencies. 

We generally include expected revenue from contracts in our backlog when we receive written confirmation from our customers authorizing the performance of work and committing the customer to payment for work performed. Accordingly, we exclude from backlog orders or arrangements that have been awarded but that we have not been authorized to begin performance. 

We do not include the value of our unconsolidated joint venture contracts in backlog. See Note 4 &#32;to the consolidated and combined financial statements included in this annual report for financial information on our equity method investments. 

Our backlog at December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 &#32;was as follows:

Foreign Operations 

Our Canadian operations serve the Canadian electric utility, industrial power and oil production markets. Our operations in Denmark provide comprehensive services to companies in the waste-to-energy sector of the power generation market, primarily in Europe. Our joint ventures in China and India primarily serve the power generation needs of their local domestic and other utility markets, but both joint ventures participate as manufacturing partners on certain of our foreign projects. We also expanded a manufacturing facility in Mexico during 2015 to serve the North American market. The functional currency of these entities is not the United States dollar, and as a result, we are subject to exchange rate fluctuations that impact our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. For additional information on the geographic distribution of our revenues, see Note 17 &#32;to our consolidated and combined financial statements included in Item 8 &#32;of this annual report. 

Customers 

We provide our products and services to a diverse customer base that includes utilities and other power producers located around the world.We have no customers that individually accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated and combined revenues in the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 or 2013. 

Competition 

With 149 years of experience and having supplied more than 300,000 MW of equivalent steam-generating capacity in more than 800 facilities in over 90 countries and some of the world's largest and most efficient steam-generating systems, we have a competitive advantage in our experience and technical capability to reliably convert a wide range of fuels to steam. Our strong, installed base in North America also yields competitive advantages in the Global Services segment, although this segment of the market is highly competitive and price sensitive. We compete with a number of domestic and foreign-based companies specializing in steam generating systems technology, equipment and services, including GE, Doosan, Babcock Power, Inc., Amec Foster Wheeler, CNIM Group, Hitachi Zosen Corporation and MH Power Systems, Ltd.; a variety of engineering and construction companies with respect to the installation of steam generating systems; a number of additional companies in the markets for environmental control equipment and related specialized industrial equipment; and other suppliers of replacement parts, repair and alteration services and other services required to retrofit and maintain existing steam generating systems. The primary bases of competition are price, technical capabilities, quality, timeliness of performance, breadth of products and services and willingness to accept project risks. 

Raw Materials and Suppliers 

Our operations use raw materials such as carbon and alloy steels in various forms and components and accessories for assembly, which are available from numerous sources. We generally purchase these raw materials and components as needed for individual contracts. We do not depend on a single source of supply for any significant raw materials. Although shortages of some raw materials have existed from time to time, no serious shortage exists at the present time. 

Employees 

At December 31, 2015, we had approximately 5,700 employees worldwide, not including 2,500 joint venture employees. Of our hourly employees, approximately 1,200 are union-affiliated, covered by seven union agreements related to active facilities in Ohio, Mississippi, Wisconsin, Mexico, Denmark, and Scotland, of which two expire in 2016 and the remainder in 2017 or 2018. We consider our relationships with our employees and unions to be in good standing. 

Patents and Licenses 

We currently hold a large number of United States and foreign patents and have patent applications pending. We have acquired patents and technology licenses and granted technology licenses to others when we have considered it advantageous for us to do so. Although in the aggregate our patents and licenses are important to us, we do not regard any single patent or license or group of related patents or licenses as critical or essential to our business as a whole. In general, we depend on our technological capabilities and the application of know-how, rather than patents and licenses, in the conduct of our various businesses. 

Research and Development Activities 

Our research and development activities are related to the development and improvement of new and existing products and equipment, as well as conceptual and engineering evaluation for translation into practical applications. We charge to research and development cost the costs of research and development unrelated to specific contracts as incurred. Research and development activities totaled $16.5 million &#32; $18.5 million &#32;and $21.0 million &#32;in the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively. 

Permits and Licenses 

We are required by various governmental and quasi-governmental agencies to obtain certain permits, licenses and certificates with respect to our operations. The kinds of permits, licenses and certificates required in our operations depend upon a number of factors. We are not aware of any material noncompliance and believe our operations and certifications are currently in compliance with all relevant permits, licenses and certifications. 

Environmental 

We have been identified as a potentially responsible party at various cleanup sites under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended ("CERCLA"). CERCLA and other environmental laws can impose liability for the entire cost of cleanup on any of the potentially responsible parties, regardless of fault or the lawfulness of the original conduct. Generally, however, where there are multiple responsible parties, a final allocation of costs is made based on the amount and type of wastes disposed of by each party and the number of financially viable parties, although this may not be the case with respect to any particular site. We have not been determined to be a major contributor of wastes to any of these sites. On the basis of our relative contribution of waste to each site, we expect our share of the ultimate liability for the various sites will not have a material adverse effect on our combined financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in any given year.
