Industry Background

The networking industry appears to be invigorated by a wave of technological change: 

&#160;

&#183; 

Ethernet (wired and wireless) has solidified its role in both public and private networks through its scalability, adaptability and cost-effectiveness. At the same time, the enterprises and service providers expect the technology to follow a price-performance curve that mandates continued innovation by Ethernet vendors. 

&#160;

&#183; 

The mobile workforce has proliferated. Employees expect high-quality and secure access to corporate resources in a Bring Your Own Device ("BYOD") world across a diversity of endpoints such as laptops, tablets, smart phones and wearables, whether they are within the corporate firewall or on-the-go. IT departments focus their investment decisions on this mobile workforce, taking a unified view of wireless access, the campus core and the data center. Networking vendors offer end-to-end solutions that permit IT managers to meet employee expectations and to maximize IT return on investment. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Growing usage of the cloud. Deployment of server virtualization is influencing data center architecture. Enterprises have migrated increasing numbers of applications and services to either private clouds or public clouds offered by third parties. In either case, the network infrastructure must adapt to this new dynamic environment. Intelligence and automation are key if enterprises are to derive maximum benefit from their cloud deployments. Ethernet speeds, scaling from 10 Gigabits per second ("G") to 40G and even 100G, provide the infrastructure for both private and public clouds. In addition, there is growing interest in SDN approaches that may include technologies such as OpenFlow, OpenStack, and CloudStack for increased network agility. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Vendor Consolidation. We believe consolidation of vendors within the Ethernet networking market and between adjacent markets (storage, security, wireless &#38; voice software and applications) continues to gain momentum. In 2015, the Hewlett-Packard Company (&#8220;HP&#8221;) acquired Aruba, Dell, Inc. acquisition of EMC is expected to close in October 2016 and Brocade Communication Systems acquired Ruckus in May 2016. We believe these acquisitions reflect a realization that customers want end-to-end, integrated networking solutions. Extreme identified this trend in 2013 and address the issue with its acquisition of Enterasys in 2013. Since that time, Extreme has rationalized the roadmap and provided an upgrade path for customers. 

Extreme&#8217;s strategy, product portfolio and research and development are closely aligned with what we have identified as the following trends in our industry:

&#160;

&#183; 

Rapid adoption of white box/brite box devices. We believe the transition to white box/brite box is taking place faster than analyst firms had initially predicted. Network decision makers may be able to reduce cost, improve management and enable long-term innovation using brite box switches versus traditional switching approaches. 

&#160;

&#216; 

Extreme announced its brite box offering will begin in the first half of FY 2017. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Cloud is a revolutionary disrupter in the network switching market . In August 2016, International Data Corporation (&#8220;IDC&#8221;), forecasts between 2015 through 2020 that private cloud is expected to experience a compound annual growth rate (&#8220;CAGR&#8221;) of 25.0% w hile (traditional data center) is expected to experience slow to negative growth. &#160;

&#160;

&#216; 

Extreme announced its cloud offering in April of 2016. 

&#160;

&#183; 

SDN is providing more revenue and delivery models to the industry than predicted. 

&#160;

&#216; 

Extreme&#8217;s SDN offering is innovative and adaptable to a wide range of use cases. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Enterprise adoption of the cloud and open-source options are disrupting traditional license and maintenance business models. 

&#160;

&#216; 

Extreme announced cloud offerings in April of 2016 and began participation in the OpenSwitch program in May, 2016. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Growth of wireless devices is expected to continue to outpace hardwire switch growth. 

&#160;

&#216; 

Extreme announced its 802.11ac Wave 2 wireless offering in late 2015 and plans to continue to advance its wireless portfolio of indoor and outdoor access points. 

The Extreme Strategy

In today&#8217;s BYOD world, the proliferation of mobile users and devices within a campus or across continents has increased the challenge of operating and managing a network. IT has rapidly evolved from a fixed world to a new world of mobility where everything - people, devices, machines and applications - is in motion. IT now supports end-users with smart phones, tablets, laptops and other wireless peripherals as well as their wired workstations. Users know what they need to be productive, and they expect the network to help them achieve productivity, as such, they are beginning to define the services that must be offered for these devices so they are able to work on-the-go. The blurring of work and personal applications that must be supported on the network places increasing security demands on our customers.

Extreme delivers software-driven networking solutions designed for the BYOD world, spanning private cloud data centers, the campus and the mobile infrastructure. Customers deploying our solutions know which users are on the network, what they are requesting and where they are located. They are able to provide customized access to approved resources and content. Our solutions provide granular visibility and control, higher performance and resource security.

Our strategy is to offer differentiated solutions that deliver a stronger value proposition to customers and offer an alternative to single-sourced, highly-proprietary networking equipment from other companies. Our commitment to open standards is manifested by demonstrated interoperability within both enterprise and service provider networks, and the active participation in key industry and standards associations.

The increase in demand being seen today, fueled by more users with multiple devices, increases the expectation that everything will just work. The network edge landscape is changing as the explosion of mobile devices increases the demand for mobile, transparent and always-on wired to wireless edge services. This new &#8220;unified access layer&#8221; requires intelligent distributed components to ensure that access control and resiliency of business services are available across the entire infrastructure and manageable from a single console. Our unified access layer portfolio provides intelligence for the wired/wireless edge. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Continue to deliver unified management across the wired/wireless environment from the data center to the mobile edge. Our rich set of integrated management capabilities provides centralized visibility and highly efficient anytime, anywhere control of enterprise wired and wireless network resources. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Offer network-powered business and application analytics. Our network-powered application analytics and optimization solution captures and analyzes context-based data about application traffic to deliver meaningful intelligence about applications, users, locations and devices. This enables the network to become a strategic business asset by enabling the mining of network-based business events and strategic information that help executives make faster and more effective decisions. 

Data can be mined to show how applications are being used enabling a better understanding of user behavior on the network, identifying the level of user engagement and assuring business application delivery to optimize the user experience. Application adoption can be tracked to determine the return on investment associated with new application deployment.

Visibility into network and application performance enables our customers to pinpoint and resolve performance bottlenecks in the infrastructure whether they are caused by the network, application or server. This saves both time and money for the business and ensures critical applications are running at the best possible performance.

&#160;

&#183; 

Support SDN. Networks are built using switches, routers and other devices in a distributed fashion to scale and provide reliability. In this distributed environment, it has become more complex to provide new end-to-end services and applications in a seamless and cost-effective manner. As the business demands more agile and flexible IT services, this has become a focal point for innovation and also for differentiation by vendors that have solved that challenge. To address the simultaneous needs for security, virtualization, manageability, mobility and agility in today&#180;s networks, the concept of SDNs are gaining attention as a viable solution. 

The value of SDN in the enterprise lies specifically in the ability to provide network virtualization and automation of configuration across the entire network/fabric so new services and end systems can be deployed rapidly and operational cost can be minimized.

Although we compete in many vertical markets, in fiscal year 2016, we have focused on the specific verticals of healthcare, education, manufacturing, government and hospitality, which includes sports and entertainment venues. Years of experience and a track record of success in the verticals we serve enables us to address the following industry-specific problems. 

Healthcare: 

&#160;

&#183; 

Patient services. In an increasingly competitive healthcare market, ensuring patient and visitor access from a variety of devices to the Internet can be a competitive advantage. We have several medical facilities worldwide that can reference Extreme&#8217;s expertise in meeting the challenges of patient services which include: online services, guest Wi-Fi, IoT, wearables and sensors. 

&#160;

&#183; 

The majority of new medical devices are IP-based . Not only are most medical devices monitored through the network, they are regulated by various government agencies across the globe. Extreme has success in meeting this challenge with compliance through its complete wireless and wired product suite overseen by innovative management and analytics. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Clinical workflow has shifted to real-time mobility inside and outside the hospital. Medical professionals often access critical patient records through network connections. Extreme&#8217;s reliable and comprehensive technology, including the latest Wave 2 capability, is backed by practical experience in addressing the demanding needs of clinical workflow. 

&#160;

Education: 

&#160;

&#183; 

New styles of teaching. Personalized learning, flipped classrooms and competency-based education depend on well-managed high-bandwidth digital content delivery. Extreme has extensive knowledge in smart classroom and large campus environments; both of which are experiencing a growing presence of IoT devices. Our easy-to-manage networks provide the bandwidth necessary to deliver digital content, including emerging styles like virtual and mixed reality, to thousands of students with the speed and quality required. Extreme has demonstrated the ability to provide high density, two-way Internet connectivity so that each student has a rich and uninterrupted educational experience. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Online and technology-based assessment is growing in importance. K-12 is implementing high stakes standardized testing and higher education is moving to BYOD for online mid-term and final exams. ExtremeAnalytics helps ensure tests proceed by providing visibility into the network flow from student device to local school server to remote testing server. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Protecting student privacy, safety and digital freedom . Extreme has built-in access and identity control to protect the safety and privacy of students, faculty and administrators. This all in one offering helps ease the burden on education institutions that have limited IT resources. 

Manufacturing:

&#160;

&#183; 

Operations to meet the fast-changing customer and market requirements. Flexible manufacturing and build-to-order processes place high demands on the network for material and shop floor control. Extreme&#8217;s proven technology strives to meet these demands in some of the world&#8217;s most demanding manufacturing environments. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Speed, adaptability and innovation are the new currencies in the manufacturing realm . A fast and reliable network can help to accommodate speed. Extreme&#8217;s full suite of wired and wireless product and management and analytics software enable agile manufacturing. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Visibility into plant and back office technology performance . Extreme&#8217;s management, control and analytics provide end-to-end network visibility from a single console without the need to swap user interfaces. This unique capability is well-suited for plant and back office environments. 

Government:

&#160;

&#183; 

Secure access. Government agencies are being challenged to provide their employees and the citizens they serve with secure, cost-effective, high-speed access to online information and resources. For today&#8217;s agencies, high quality video, collaboration, social media, VoIP and multimedia applications have become mission-critical services. These applications have placed unprecedented bandwidth and control demands on existing networks. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Management of new technologies. The increasingly rapid deployment of wireless access, data center virtualization and the adoption of cloud computing have further complicated network management and control. For federal government agencies, the challenge is determining how to deliver secure, seamless, always-on access to these mission-critical services. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Controlling costs. Agencies need to deliver access from laptops, tablets, smartphones and other types of devices, at any time, from any place and from anywhere, while at the same time maximizing efficiencies and cost savings across all areas of the network infrastructure. Extreme provides a rich set of networking solutions that strive to be cost-effective and secure and allow government agencies to meet not only today&#8217;s needs, but also to be prepared for future demands. 

Hospitality:

&#160;

&#183; 

Developing a cohesive and enhanced mobile experience. Through real world experience in sports stadiums, where over 70,000 fans actively access the Internet, Extreme has developed the expertise to handle the most demanding venue challenges. Our hospitality experience spans hotels, casinos, theaters, convention centers, vacation destinations and outdoor venues. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Emphasizing the user experience and mobile engagement. Extreme has the ability to monitor applications so that policy to maximize user experience can be implemented in fixed and mobile environments with the same set of management tools from a single pane of glass. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Generating revenue opportunities for the business . Knowing the behaviors of customers and clients is a key to success and Extreme Analytics provides visibility to the usage patterns and traits of network users. 

&#160;

Furthermore, we have decided to focus on the following custom er profiles where we believe we can add the most value: 

&#160;

&#183; 

Customer size: Those customers with annual revenue of $100 million to $2.5 billion. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Target deployment: Campus deployments with 250 to 5,000 employees or education campuses with 1,000 to 15,000 students. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Target data centers: Data centers with 1,000 servers or less. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Vertical markets: Healthcare, education, manufacturing, government/enterprise, hospitality. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Customer characteristics: Our customers tend to operate in transient environments, such as college campuses, hospitals and sports venues, where BYOD and secure network access and identity control are critical. Their networks must be highly available with the ability to continue operations in the event of a service interruption. Secure access is essential to ensuring the protection of mission-critical systems and confidential information. Often tasked to manage the network with a limited IT staff, our customers appreciate the excellent service and support we strive to provide.

Less than 10% of revenue

International sales

International sales are an important portion of our business. In fiscal 2016, sales to customers outside of the United States accounted for 55% of our consolidated net revenue, compared to 57% in fiscal 2015 and 59% in fiscal 2014. These sales are conducted primarily through foreign-based distributors and resellers managed by our worldwide sales organization. In addition, we have direct sales to end-user customers, including large global accounts. The primary markets for sales outside of the United States are countries in Europe and Asia, as well as Canada, Mexico, Central America and South America. (See &#8220;Net Revenue&#8221; in Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. )

Marketing

We continue to develop and execute on a number of marketing programs to support the sale and distribution of our products by communicating the value of our solutions to our existing and potential customers, our distribution channels, our resellers and our technology alliance partners. Our marketing efforts include participation in industry tradeshows, conferences and seminars, publication of technical and educational articles in industry journals, communication across social media channels, frequent updates to our publicly available website, promotions, web-based training courses, advertising and public relations. We also submit our products for independent product testing and evaluation.

Backlog

Our products are often sold on the basis of standard purchase orders that are cancelable prior to shipment without significant penalties. In addition, purchase orders are subject to changes in quantities of products and delivery schedules in order to reflect changes in customer requirements and manufacturing capacity. Our business is characterized by seasonal variability in demand and short lead-time orders and delivery schedules. Actual shipments depend on the then-current capacity of our contract manufacturers and the availability of materials and components from our vendors. Although we believe that the orders included in the backlog are firm, all orders are subject to possible rescheduling by customers, cancellations by customers which we may elect to allow without penalty to customer, and further pricing adjustments on orders from distributors. Therefore, we do not believe that our backlog, as of any particular date is necessarily indicative of actual revenue for any future period.

Our product backlog at June 30, 2016, net of anticipated back end rebates for distributor sales, was $26.8 million, compared to $14.8 million at June 30, 2015.

&#160;

Seasonality 

Like many of our competitors, we historically have experienced seasonal fluctuations in customer spending patterns, which generally adversely affect our first and third fiscal quarters. This pattern should not be relied upon or be considered indicative of our future performance, however, as it has varied in the past.

Customer Service and Support

Our customers seek high reliability and maximum uptime for their networks. To that extent, we provide the following service offerings:

&#160;

&#183; 

Support services for end-users, resellers and distributors. We meet the service requirements of our customers and channel partners through our Technical Assistance Centers ("TACs"), located in Research Triangle Park ("RTP"), North Carolina; Salem, New Hampshire and Chennai, India. Our TAC engineers and technicians assist in diagnosing and troubleshooting technical issues regarding customer networks. Development engineers work with the TACs to resolve product functionality issues specific to each customer. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Professional services. We provide consultative services to improve customer productivity in all phases of the network lifecycle &#8211; planning, design, implementation, operations and optimization management. Our network architects develop and execute customized software and service-led networking solutions for deployment plans to meet individualized network strategies. These activities may include the management and coordination of the design and network configuration, resource planning, staging, logistics, migration and deployment. We also provide customized training and operational best practices manuals to assist customers in the transition and sustenance of their networks. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Education. We offer classes covering a wide range of topics such as installation, configuration, operation, management and optimization &#8211; providing customers with the necessary knowledge and experience to successfully deploy and manage our products in various networking environments. Classes may be scheduled and available at numerous locations worldwide. We deliver training using our staff, on-line training classes and authorized training partners. In addition, we make much of our training materials accessible free-of-charge on our internet site for customers and partners to use in self-education. We believe this approach enhances the market&#8217;s ability to learn and understand the broad array of advantages of our products. 

Long-Lived Assets

See Note 3 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information regarding our long-lived assets.

Manufacturing

We outsource the majority of our manufacturing and supply chain management operations as part of our strategy to maintain global manufacturing capabilities and to reduce our costs. We conduct quality assurance, manufacturing engineering, document control and test development at engineering facilities at Research Triangle Park (&#8220;RTP&#8221;), North Carolina, Salem, New Hampshire, Toronto, Canada and Chennai, India. This approach enables us to reduce fixed costs and to flexibly respond to changes in market demand. Our end-to-end supply chain, including our three engineering facilities at RTP and Chennai are all ISO 9001 certified.

We use Alpha Networks, Inc. (&#8220;Alpha Networks&#8221;) headquartered in Hsinchu, Taiwan to design and manufacture our Summit, A-Series, B-Series, C-Series, Stackable products, G-Series, D-Series, I-Series and 800-Series Standalone products and Black Diamond chassis products. Alpha Networks is a global networking Original/Joint Design Manufacturer ("ODM/JDM") leader with core competencies in areas such as Ethernet, LAN/MAN, Wireless, Broadband and VoIP. Alpha Networks manufacturing processes and procedures are ISO 9001 certified.

We use Benchmark Electronics, Inc. ("Benchmark") headquartered in Huntsville, Alabama and Flextronics International ("Flextronics") headquartered in Singapore, to manufacture our S-Series and K-Series chassis products, 7100-Series Stackable products and SSA Standalone products. Benchmark and Flextronics have a significant investment in capital to ensure they have the latest in manufacturing and test technologies and both companies are ISO 9001 certified.

Our wireless access point products are supplied by Senao Electronics ("Senao"), headquartered in Taipei, Taiwan. Senao&#8217;s manufacturing processes and procedures are ISO 9001 certified.

&#160;

All of our manufacturers utilize automated testing equipment to perform product testing and burn-in with specified tests. Together we rely upon comp rehensive inspection testing and statistical process controls to assure the quality and reliability of our products. 

We use a collaborative sales and operations planning forecast of expected demand to determine our material requirements. Lead times for materials and components vary significantly, and depend on factors such as the specific supplier, contract terms and demand for a component at a given time. We order most of our materials and components on an indirect basis through our ODM/JDM, OEMs and contract manufacturers&#8217; (&#8220;CMs&#8221;). Purchase commitments with all of our manufacturers are generally on a purchase order basis.

Research and Development

The success of our products to date is due in large part to our focus on research and development. We believe that continued success in the marketplace will depend on our ability to develop new and enhanced products employing leading-edge technology. Accordingly, we plan to undertake development efforts with an emphasis on increasing the reliability, performance and features of our family of products, and designing innovative products to reduce the overall network operating costs of customers.

Our product development activities focus on solving the needs of customers in the enterprise campus by providing an end-to-end, wired and wireless network solution from the access edge to the private clouds in targeted verticals. Current activities include the continuing development of our innovative switching technology aimed at extending the capabilities of our products. Our ongoing research activities cover a broad range of areas, including, in particular, 40G and 100G Ethernet, routing, timing and resiliency protocols, open standards interfaces, software defined networks, network security, identity management, data center fabrics, and wireless networking.

We plan to continue to enhance the functionality of our modular operating systems which have been designed to provide high reliability and availability. This allows us to leverage a common operating system across different hardware and network chipsets.

As of June 30, 2016, our research and development organization consisted of 402 employees. Research and development efforts are conducted in several of our locations, including RTP, North Carolina; Salem, New Hampshire, Toronto, Canada and Chennai, India. Our research and development expenses in fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014 were $78.7 million, $93.4 million and $77.1 million, respectively.

Intellectual Property

We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights. As of June 30, 2016, we had 363 issued patents in the United States and 183 patents outside of the United States. The expiration dates of our issued patents in the United States range from 2017 to approximately 2032. Although we have patent applications pending, there can be no assurance that patents will be issued from pending applications or that claims allowed on any future patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology. With respect to trademarks, we have a number of pending and registered trademarks in the United States and outside the United States.

We enter into confidentiality, inventions assignment or license agreements with our employees, consultants and other third parties with whom we do business, and control access to, and distribution of, our software, documentation and other proprietary information. In addition, we provide our software products to end-user customers primarily under &#8220;shrink-wrap&#8221; or "click-through" license agreements. These agreements are not negotiated with or signed by the licensee, and thus these agreements may not be enforceable in some jurisdictions. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the United States.

Competition

The market for network switches, routers and software (including analytics) which is part of the broader market for networking equipment is extremely competitive and characterized by rapid technological progress, frequent new product introductions, changes in customer requirements and evolving industry standards. We believe the principal competitive factors in this market are:

&#160;

&#183; 

expertise and familiarity with network protocols, network switching/routing/wireless and network management; 

&#160;

&#183; 

expertise and familiarity with application analytics software; 

&#160;

&#183; 

expertise with network operations and management software; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

product performance, features, functionality and reliability; &#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

price/performance characteristics; 

&#160;

&#183; 

timeliness of new product introductions; 

&#160;

&#183; 

adoption of emerging industry standards; 

&#160;

&#183; 

customer service and support; 

&#160;

&#183; 

size and scope of distribution network; 

&#160;

&#183; 

brand name; 

&#160;

&#183; 

breadth of product offering; 

&#160;

&#183; 

access to customers; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

size of installed customer base. 

We believe we compete with our competitors with respect to many of the foregoing factors. However, the market for network switching solutions is dominated by a few large companies, particularly Brocade Communications Systems, Inc., Cisco Systems, Inc., Dell, Hewlett-Packard Company, Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd., and Juniper Networks Inc. Most of these competitors have longer operating histories, greater name recognition, larger customer bases, broader product lines and substantially greater financial, technical, sales, marketing and other resources.

Restructuring 

2015 Restructuring Plan Phase 1

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, we initiated a plan to reduce costs through targeted restructuring activities intended to reduce operating costs and realign our organization in the current competitive environment. We initiated a plan to reduce our worldwide headcount by more than 225 employees, primarily in sales and marketing as well as research and development, consolidate specific global administrative functions, and shift certain operating costs to lower cost regions in the United States, among other actions. 

Phase 2

During fiscal 2016, we continued our initiative to realign our operations with a second phase by abandoning excess facilities, primarily in San Jose, California; Salem, New Hampshire; Research Triangle Park, North Carolina in addition to other smaller leased locations. The abandoned facilities represented approximately 32% of the floor space in the aggregate at these locations and included general office and warehouse space. There may be additional abandonments of excess facilities in future periods as we further align our organization to our business and operational needs. 

Environmental Matters

We are subject to various environmental and other regulations governing product safety, materials usage, packaging and other environmental impacts in the United States and in various countries where our products are manufactured and sold. We are also subject to regulatory developments, including recent SEC disclosure regulations relating to so-called "conflict minerals," relating to ethically responsible sourcing of the components and materials used in our products. To date, compliance with federal, state, local, and foreign laws enacted for the protection of the environment has had no material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position.

We are committed to energy efficiency in our product lines. Accordingly, we believe this is an area that affords us a competitive advantage for our products in the marketplace. We maintain compliance with various regulations related to the environment, including the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment and the Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment regulations adopted by the European Union. To date, our compliance efforts with various United States and foreign regulations related to the environment has not had a material effect on our operating results.

&#160;

Employees 

As of June 30, 2016, we employed 1,378 people, including 521 in sales and marketing, 402 in research and development, 174 in operations, 190 in customer support and services, and 91 in finance and administration. We have never had a work stoppage and no U.S. employees are represented under collective bargaining agreements. We consider our employee relations to be good.

We believe our future success depends on our continued ability to attract, integrate, retain, train and motivate highly qualified employees, and upon the continued service of our senior management and key employees. None of our executive officers or key employees is bound by an employment agreement which mandates that the employee render services for any specific term. The market for qualified personnel is highly competitive.

Organization

We were incorporated in California in May 1996, and reincorporated in Delaware in March 1999. Our corporate headquarters are located at 145 Rio Robles, San Jose, CA 95134 and our telephone number is (408) 579-2800. We electronically file our SEC disclosure reports with the SEC and they are available free of charge at both www.sec.gov and www.extremenetworks.com. The public may also read or copy any materials we file with the Securities Exchange Commission at the SEC&#8217;s Public Reference Room at Station Place, 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, DC 20549. The public may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330.

Our corporate governance guidelines, the charters of our audit committee, our compensation committee and our nominating and corporate governance committee and our code of conduct policy (including code of ethics provisions that apply to our principal executive officer, principal financial officer, controller and senior financial officers) are available on our website at www.extremenetworks.com under &#8220;Corporate Governance.&#8221; These items are also available to any stockholder who requests them by calling (408) 579-2800.
