As used herein, unless the context otherwise requires, ISG, the registrant, is referred to in this Form 10 &#8209;K annual report (&#8220;Form 10 &#8209;K&#8221;) as the &#8220;Company,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us&#8221; and &#8220;our.&#8221; 

Our Company 

Information Services Group, Inc. (&#8216;ISG&#8221;) (NASDAQ: III) is a leading technology insights, market intelligence and advisory services company serving more than 500 clients around the world to help them achieve operational excellence. ISG supports private and public sector organizations to transform and optimize their operational environments through research, benchmarking, consulting and managed services with a focus on information technology, business process transformation, program management services and enterprise resource planning. Clients look to ISG for unique insights and innovative solutions for leveraging technology, our deep data source, and more than five decades of experience of global leadership in information and advisory services. Based in Stamford, Connecticut, the Company has approximately &#160; 1,000 employees and operates in 21 countries. 

Our Company was founded in 2006 with the strategic vision to become a high &#8209;growth, leading provider of information &#8209;based advisory services. In 2007, ISG consummated its initial public offering and completed the acquisition of TPI Advisory Services Americas, Inc. (&#8220;TPI&#8221;). 

On January 4, 2011, we acquired Compass, a premier independent global provider of business and information technology benchmarking, performance improvement, data and analytics services. Headquartered in the United Kingdom, Compass was founded in 1980 and had approximately 180 employees in 16 countries serving nearly 250 clients. 

On February 10, 2011, we acquired Austin, Texas &#8209;based STA Consulting, a premier independent information technology advisor serving the public sector. STA Consulting advises clients on information technology strategic planning and the acquisition and implementation of new Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and other enterprise administration and management systems. STA Consulting was founded in 1997 and had approximately 40 professionals serving state and local government entities in the United States. 

On January 10, 2012, we announced the merger of our individual corporate brands into one globally integrated go &#8209;to &#8209;market business under the ISG brand. TPI, the world&#8217;s leading independent sourcing data and advisory firm; Compass, a premier independent provider of business and IT benchmarking; and STA Consulting, a premier independent technology advisory firm serving the North America public sector, have combined under the ISG brand. This merger offers clients one source of support to drive operational excellence in their organizations. 

On March 17, 2014, we acquired 51% of Convergent Technologies Partners S.p.A. ( &#8220; CTP&#8221;), a leading management consulting firm providing specialized IT and operational strategies and solutions to Italy&#8217;s public sector. At the same time CTP acquired 100% interest of Compass Management Consulting Italy (&#8220;Compass Italy&#8221;), a subsidiary of Compass Holdings BV. CTP was founded in 1999 and had approximately 15 employees in Italy. 

On April 15, 2014, we executed an Asset Purchase Agreement with CCI, an Australia &#8209;based research firm that measures and analyzes customer satisfaction in business &#8209;to &#8209;business relationships. CCI was founded in 2001 and had approximately 14 employees in Australia. 

On August 7, 2015, we executed an Asset Purchase Agreement with Saugatuck Technology Inc. , (&#8220;Saugatuck&#8221;) a subscription-based research and analyst firm that provides C-level executives and technology business leaders with objective insights on the key market trends and emerging technologies that are driving 

&#160;

business transformation and growth. Saugatuck was founded in 2003 and had approximately 6 employees in the United States 

We continue to believe that our vision will be realized through the acquisition, integration, and successful operation of market &#8209;leading brands within the data, analytics and advisory industry. Including our most recent acquisitions, we operate in 21 countries and employ approximately &#160; 1,000 professionals globally, delivering advisory, benchmarking and analytical insight to large, multinational corporations and governments in the Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific. 

Our private and public sector clients continue to face significant technological, business and economic challenges that will continue to fuel demand for the professional services we provide. In the private sector, for example, we believe that companies will continue to face significant challenges associated with globalization and technological innovation, including the need to decrease operating costs, increase efficiencies and deal with increasing numbers of emerging and transformational technologies such as cloud computing. Similarly, public sector organizations at the national, regional and local levels increasingly must deal with the complex and converging issues of outdated technology systems, significantly impaired revenue sources and an aging workforce. 

Overall, we believe that the global marketplace dynamics at work in both the private and public sectors mitigate in favor of the professional services, analytics and advice ISG can provide. In this dynamic environment, the strength of our client relationships greatly depends on the quality of our advice and insight, the independence of our thought leadership and the effectiveness of our people in assisting our clients to implement strategies that successfully address their most pressing operational challenges. 

We are organized as a corporation under the laws of the State of Delaware. The current mailing address of the Company&#8217;s principal executive office is: Information Services Group, Inc., Two Stamford Plaza, 281Tresser Boulevard, Stamford, CT 06901. Our telephone number is (203) 517 &#8209;3100. 

Our Services 

During periods of expansion or contraction, for enterprises large or small, public or private, in the Americas, Europe or Asia Pacific, our services have helped organizations address their most complex operational issues. The functional domain experience of our experts and deep empirical data resources help clients better understand their strategic options. We provide three key lines of service: 

&#183; 

Research. We utilize our extensive experience and proprietary data assets to provide subscription and custom research services to both buyers and sellers of services in the outsourcing and managed services industries. Our combined data sources, compiled from over 30 years of servicing global corporations, provide a rich source of benchmark data into the comparative cost and quality of operational alternatives. For enterprise clients, we use these data sources to provide them with in &#8209;depth analysis into the implications of different service strategies, allowing them to compare and contrast and make informed decisions regarding strategic change. For service providers, our views into the buying behaviors, needs and objectives of global corporations examining transformation of their operations provide unique insights that help them tailor and market their offerings to these enterprises. 

&#183; 

Consulting. We assist clients with envisioning, designing and implementing change in their operational environments. We evaluate existing practices and operating costs of public and private enterprises, identifying potential improvement opportunities to enhance service delivery, optimize operations or reduce costs. Solutions are customized by a client situation and may include internal transformation, the adoption of external strategies, or some combination of both. In all cases, we assist with the selection, implementation and ongoing support for these strategic initiatives. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Managed Services. Our managed service offerings provide operational governance services to our clients to ensure seamless end &#8209;to &#8209;end service. Th ese offering assists clients with monitoring and managing their supplier relationships, providing them with real &#8209;time accurate market intelligence and insights into all aspects of provider performance and cost, allowing them to focus on the more strategic aspects of supplier management. 

Our Competitive Advantages 

We believe that the following strengths differentiate us from our competition: 

&#183; 

Independence and Objectivity. We are not a service provider. We are an independent, fact &#8209;based data, analytics and advisory firm with no material conflicting financial or other interests. This enables us to maintain a trusted advisor relationship with our clients through our unbiased focus and ability to align our interests with those of our clients. 

&#183; 

Domain Expertise. Averaging over 20 years of experience, our strategic consulting teams bring a wealth of industry and domain &#8209;specific knowledge and expertise to address our clients&#8217; most complex transformational needs. 

&#183; 

Strong Brand Recognition. ISG continues to gain marketplace traction as a leading brand in our industry after merging its TPI, Compass and STA Consulting brands into one go &#8209;to &#8209;market brand: ISG. ISG offers an integrated product and service offering for our clients as one, unified company. 

&#183; 

Proprietary Data Assets and Market Intelligence. We have assembled a comprehensive and unique set of data, analytics and market intelligence built over more than thirty years of data collection and analysis, providing insight into the comparative cost and quality of a variety of operational alternatives. 

&#183; 

Global Reach. We possess practical experience in global business operations, and we understand the significance of interconnected economies and companies. Our resources in the Americas, Europe, Asia Pacific, China and India make us a truly global advisory firm able to consistently serve the strategic and implementation needs of our clients. 

We believe that the strengths disclosed above are central to our ability to deal successfully with the challenges that we face. 

Our Strategy 

We intend to use our competitive strengths to develop new services and products, sustain our growth and strengthen our existing market position by pursuing the following strategies: 

&#183; 

Preserve and Expand Our Market Share Positions. We expect the trend toward globalization and greater operating efficiency and technological innovation to play an increasing role in the growth of demand for our services. We plan to leverage our combined operating platform to serve the growing number of private and public enterprises utilizing outside advisors when undertaking transformational projects. In addition, we will seek to continue to expand our products and services and the geographic markets we serve opportunistically as global competition spurs demand for cost savings and value creation. 

&#183; 

Strengthen Our Industry Expertise. We have strengthened our market facing organization to drive increased revenue around five key areas &#160; &#8212; (i) BFSI (Banking, Financial Services and Insurance); (ii) Manufacturing/Auto; (iii) Energy, Life Sciences and Healthcare; (iv) Technology, Retail and Enterprise Businesses; and (v) Public Sector/Government. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Expand Geographically. Historically, we generated the majority of our revenues in North America. Over the past several years, we have made significant investments in Europe and Asia Pacific to capitalize on emerging demand for advisory, benchmarking and analytical insight in these geographic regions. We intend to continue to expand in Europe and Asia Pacific. The acquisition of Compass, CTP and CCI expanded our geographic reach, particularly in Europe and Australia, and increased the amount of our revenues we generated internationally versus in North America. 

&#183; 

Aggressively Expand Our Market Focus. We are seeking to drive our service portfolio and relationships with clients further into: Digital Advisory Services including Cloud Solutions, Automation, Business Advisory Services, Strategy, Data &#38; Analytics, Transition and Organization &#38; Operations are all areas where we are investing additional focus to drive increased revenues and expanded relationships with clients. 

&#183; 

Further Develop Digital and Cloud Competency. There is a nexus of distinct yet complimentary technology trends that are creating a perfect storm of disruption for some companies. Among the most significant technology trends are the speed with which products get to market, large &#8209;scale digitization, the efficiency of the cloud and the immediacy with which new disruptors can become omnipresent. ISG plans to expand resources and intellectual property (&#8220;IP&#8221;) around digitization and the cloud. Digitization is the &#8216;softwarization&#8217; of business. Processes that were once executed over analog channels (such as phone and &#8216;real life&#8217;) increasingly happen over software. Also, digitization has elevated the profile of software. Software no longer merely supports business processes, but is central to the enterprise strategy. &#160; Our purpose in the digital marketplace is to be the trusted advisor, guiding our clients through the digital transformation toward practical innovation of their business models, leveraging strategic partners, emerging technology and thought leadership. &#160; 

&#183; 

Expand &#8220;Recurring Revenue Streams.&#8221; This includes Managed Services, Research and the U.S. Public Sector. All three are characterized by subscriptions (i.e. , renewal &#8209;centric as opposed to project centric revenue streams) or multi &#8209;year contracts. As companies begin to recognize the importance of managing the post &#8209;sourcing &#8209;transaction period, managed services has emerged as a revenue driver for us where our offerings are delivered through multi &#8209;year managed services contracts. We believe that our experience with outsourcing transactions and software implementation initiatives make us uniquely equipped to provide research insights and direct support to help our clients manage their transformational projects or act as a third &#8209;party administrator. We will continue to pursue opportunities to leverage our experience to make research and managed services an even greater revenue generator for us. The U.S. public sector&#8212;particularly state governments, local municipalities, and higher education&#8212;presents a significant opportunity to ISG. Systems are typically outdated , maintenance is expensive, and the workforce charged with maintenance is ageing. There is a need to refurbish systems to reduce the cost of operations (particularly because governments&#8217; tax revenues are under pressure). We are positioned as a third party, objective advisory group with no affiliation to the software providers. 

&#183; 

Consider Acquisition and Other Growth Opportunities. The business services, information and advisory market is highly fragmented. We believe we are well &#8209;positioned to leverage our leading market positions and strong brand recognition to expand through acquisitions. Acquiring firms with complementary services and products allow s us to further develop and broaden our service offerings and domain expertise. We will consider and may pursue opportunities to enter into joint ventures and to buy or combine with other businesses. 

&#183; 

Retool Our Resource and Delivery Model. The goal is to evolve our workforce to achieve a more efficient distribution of resources globally and a more flexible staffing model. This will provide ISG &#8217;s clients with better value for their money while also improving ISG &#8217;s margins. 

&#160;

Our Proprietary Data Assets and Market Intelligence 

One of our core assets is the information, data, analytics, methodologies and other intellectual capital the Company possesses. This intellectual property underpins the independent nature of our operational assessments, strategy development, deal &#8209;structuring, negotiation and other consulting services we provide to our clients. 

With each engagement we conduct, we enhance both the quantity and quality of the intellectual property we employ on behalf of our clients, thus providing a continuous, evolving and unique source of information, data and analytics. 

This intellectual property is proprietary and we rely on multiple legal and contractual provisions and devices to protect our intellectual property rights. We recognize the value of our intellectual property and vigorously defend it. As a result, the Company maintains strict policies and procedures regarding ownership, use and protection with all parties, including our employees. 

Clients 

We operate in 21 countries and across numerous industries. Our private sector clients operate in the financial services, telecommunications, healthcare and pharmaceuticals, manufacturing, transportation and travel and energy and utilities industries. Our private sector clients are primarily large businesses ranked in the Forbes Global 2000 companies annually. Our public sector clients are primarily state and local governments (cities and counties) and authorities (airport and transit) in the United States and national and provincial government units in the United Kingdom, Italy, Canada and Australia. 

Competition 

Competition in the sourcing, data, information and advisory market is primarily driven by independence and objectivity, expertise, possession of relevant benchmarking data, breadth of service capabilities, reputation and price. We compete with other sourcing advisors, research firms, strategy consultants and sourcing service providers. A significant number of independent sourcing and advisory firms offer similar services. In our view, however, these firms generally lack the benchmarking data, scale and diversity of expertise that we possess. In addition, most research firms do not possess the data repository of recent, comparable transactions and benchmarking data. Management consultants bring strategic service capabilities to the sourcing and advisory market. However, they generally lack the depth of experience that sourcing, data and advisory firms such as ISG possess. In addition, management consultants do not possess the sourcing and technology implementation expertise nor the benchmarking data capabilities that are critical to implementing and managing successful transformational projects for businesses and governments. Other service providers often lack the depth of experience, competitive benchmarking data and independence critical to playing the role of &#8220;trusted advisor&#8221; to clients. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 201 5 , we employed 984 people worldwide. 

Our employee base includes executive management, service leads, partners, directors, advisors, analysts, technical specialists and functional support staff. 

We recruit advisors from service providers and consulting firms with direct operational experience. These advisors leverage extensive practical expertise derived from experiences in corporate leadership, consulting, research, financial analysis, contract negotiations and operational service delivery. 

&#160;

All employees are required to execute confidentiality, conflict of interest and intellectual property agreements as a condition of employment. There are no collective bargaining agreements covering any of our employees. 

Our voluntary advisor turnover rate has ranged between 10% and 16% over the last three years.
