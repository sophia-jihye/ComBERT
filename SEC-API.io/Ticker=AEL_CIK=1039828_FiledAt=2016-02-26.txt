 Item 1. Business 

Introduction 

We are a leader in the development and sale of fixed index and fixed rate annuity products. We were incorporated in the state of Iowa on December 15, 1995. We issue fixed annuity and life insurance products through our wholly-owned life insurance subsidiaries, American Equity Investment Life Insurance Company ("American Equity Life"), American Equity Investment Life Insurance Company of New York and Eagle Life Insurance Company ("Eagle Life"). We have one business segment which represents our core business comprised of the sale of fixed index and fixed rate annuities. Our business strategy is focused on growing our policyholder funds and earning predictable returns by managing investment spreads and investment risk. We are licensed to sell our products in 50 states and the District of Columbia. Throughout this report, unless otherwise specified or the context otherwise requires, all references to "American Equity", the "Company", "we", "our" and similar references are to American Equity Investment Life Holding Company and its consolidated subsidiaries.

Annuity Market Overview 

Our target market includes the group of individuals ages 45-75 who are seeking to accumulate tax-deferred savings or create guaranteed lifetime income. We believe that significant growth opportunities exist for annuity products because of favorable demographic and economic trends. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, there were approximately 39 million Americans age 65 and older in 2010, representing 13% of the U.S. population and this group has grown to 44.7 million in 2013. By 2030, this sector of the population is expected to increase to 20% of the total population. Our fixed index and fixed rate annuity products are particularly attractive to this group due to their principal protection, competitive rates of credited interest, tax-deferred growth, guaranteed lifetime income and alternative payout options. Our competitive fixed index and fixed rate annuity products have enabled us to enjoy favorable growth in recent years and since our formation. 

According to Wink's Sales and Market Report published by Wink, Inc., total industry sales of fixed index annuities increased 7.4% to $37.5 billion for the first three quarters of 2015 from $34.9 billion for the first three quarters of 2014, and increased 21.4% to $46.9 billion in 2014 from $38.6 billion in 2013. Total industry sales of fixed index annuities have increased 56% over the five year period from 2009 to 2014, which we believe is attributable to more Americans reaching retirement age and seeking products that will provide principal protection and guaranteed lifetime income. 

Strategy 

Key elements of executing our strategy include the following: 

Enhance our Current Independent Agency Network. We believe that our successful relationships with approximately 35 national marketing organizations, through which we have 35,000 independent agents under contract, represent a significant competitive advantage. Our objective is to improve the productivity and efficiency of our core distribution channel by focusing our marketing and recruiting efforts on those independent agents capable of selling $1 million or more of annuity premium annually. This level of production qualifies them for our Gold Eagle program which was introduced at the beginning of 2007. We believe the Gold Eagle program has been effective as evidenced by the number of qualified Gold Eagle agents ranging from 991 &#32;to as many as 1,377 &#32;during the last three calendar years. Our Gold Eagle agents accounted for 65% of total production in 2015, 63% of total production in 2014 and 61% of total production in 2013. Agents who produce at least $1 million in annuity premium in a year qualify for Gold Eagle status and receive benefits such as express mail discounts. Agents who produce at least $2 million in annuity premium in a year earn cash and equity-based compensation. The equity-based compensation component of our Gold Eagle program is unique in our industry and distinguishes us from our competitors. We will also be alert for opportunities to establish relationships with national marketing organizations and agents not presently associated with us and will strive to provide all of our marketers with the highest quality service possible. 

Continue to Introduce Innovative and Competitive Products. We intend to be at the forefront of the fixed index and fixed rate annuity industry in developing and introducing innovative and new competitive products. We were one of the first companies to offer a fixed index annuity that allows a choice among interest crediting strategies including both equity and bond indices as well as a traditional fixed rate strategy. We were one of the first companies to include a lifetime income benefit rider with our fixed index annuities and first to have a lifetime income benefit rider with gender-based income payments. We believe that our continued focus on anticipating and being responsive to the product needs of our independent agents and policyholders will lead to increased customer loyalty, revenues and profitability. 

Use our Expertise to Achieve Targeted Spreads on Annuity Products. We have had a successful track record in achieving the targeted spreads on our annuity products. This historical success has been challenged in the current extended low interest rate environment. However, we intend to continue to leverage our experience and expertise in managing the investment spread during a range of interest rate environments to achieve, or work towards achieving, our targeted spreads. 

&#32;1 

Maintain our Profitability Focus and Improve Operating Efficiency. We are committed to improving our profitability by advancing the scope and sophistication of our investment management and spread capabilities and continuously seeking out efficiencies within our operations. We have implemented competitive incentive programs for our national marketing organizations, agents and employees to stimulate performance. 

Take Advantage of the Growing Popularity of Index Products. We believe that the growing popularity of fixed index annuity products that allow equity and bond market participation without the risk of loss of the premium deposit presents an attractive opportunity to grow our business. The popularity of fixed index annuity products has increased in recent years with the availability of lifetime income benefit riders that provide an attractive alternative for converting accumulated retirement savings into lifetime income. We intend to capitalize on our reputation as a leading provider of fixed index annuities in this expanding segment of the annuity market. 

Focus on High Quality Service to Agents and Policyholders. We have maintained high quality personal service as one of our highest priorities since the inception of our company and continue to strive for an unprecedented level of timely and accurate service to both our agents and policyholders. Examples of our high quality service include answering our phone calls by a live person and issuing policies within 24 hours of receiving the application if the paperwork is in good order. We believe high quality service is one of our strongest competitive advantages and intend to continue enhancing our digital customer service experience for agents and policyholders. 

Expand our Distribution Channels. We formed Eagle Life with the vision of developing a network of broker/dealers, banks and registered investment advisors that have the ability to distribute fixed index and fixed rate annuity products in large volume. According to Wink's Sales and Market Report published by Wink, Inc., sales of fixed index annuities through broker/dealers and banks have been growing and represented almost 36% of industry sales in the third quarter of 2015 compared to 16% in the third quarter of 2014. In 2015, we introduced broker/dealer and bank friendly products for American Equity Life for those broker/dealers and banks who choose to associate with us through American Equity Life. 

Products 

Annuities offer our policyholders a tax-deferred means of accumulating retirement savings, as well as a reliable source of income during the payout period. When our policyholders deposit cash to annuities, we account for these receipts as policy benefit reserves in the liability section of our consolidated balance sheet. The annuity deposits collected, by product type, during the three most recent fiscal years are as follows:

Fixed Index Annuities 

Fixed index annuities allow policyholders to earn index credits based on the performance of a particular index without the risk of loss of their principal. Most of these products allow policyholders to transfer funds once a year among several different crediting strategies, including one or more index based strategies and a traditional fixed rate strategy. Approximately 86% , 95% &#32;and 97% &#32;of our fixed index annuity sales for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 , respectively, were "premium bonus" products. The initial annuity deposit on these policies is increased at issuance by a specified premium bonus ranging from 3% to 10%. Generally, the surrender charge and bonus vesting provisions of our policies are structured such that we have comparable protection from early termination between bonus and non-bonus products. 

The annuity contract value is equal to the sum of premiums paid, premium bonuses and interest credited ("index credits" for funds allocated to an index based strategy), which is based upon an overall limit (or "cap") or a percentage (the "participation rate") of the annual appreciation (based in certain situations on monthly averages or monthly point-to-point calculations) in a recognized index or benchmark. Caps and participation rates limit the amount of annual interest the policyholder may earn in any one contract year and may be adjusted by us annually subject to stated minimums. Caps generally range from 1% to 12% and participation rates range from 10% to 100%. In addition, some products have a spread or "asset fee" generally ranging from 0.75% to 3.5%, which is deducted from annual interest to be credited. For products with asset fees, if the annual appreciation in the index does not exceed the asset fee, the policyholder's index credit is zero. The minimum guaranteed surrender values are equal to no less than 87.5% of the premium collected plus interest credited at an annual rate ranging from 1% to 3%. 

&#32;2 

Fixed Rate Annuities 

Fixed rate deferred annuities include annual reset and multi-year rate guaranteed products. Our annual reset fixed rate annuities have an annual interest rate (the "crediting rate") that is guaranteed for the first policy year. After the first policy year, we have the discretionary ability to change the crediting rate once annually to any rate at or above a guaranteed minimum rate. Our multi-year rate guaranteed annuities are similar to our annual reset products except that the initial crediting rate is guaranteed for up to seven years before it may be changed at our discretion. The minimum guaranteed rate on our annual reset fixed rate deferred annuities ranges from 1% to 4% and the initial guaranteed rate on our multi-year rate guaranteed policies ranges from 1.7% to 4.1%. 

The initial crediting rate is largely a function of the interest rate we can earn on invested assets acquired with new annuity deposits and the rates offered on similar products by our competitors. For subsequent adjustments to crediting rates, we take into account the yield on our investment portfolio, annuity surrender and withdrawal assumptions and crediting rate history for particular groups of annuity policies with similar characteristics. As of December 31, 2015 , crediting rates on our outstanding fixed rate deferred annuities generally ranged from 1.0% to 4.1%. The average crediting rates on our outstanding annual reset and multi-year rate guaranteed fixed rate deferred annuities at December 31, 2015 &#32;were 2.14% and 2.82%, respectively. 

We also sell single premium immediate annuities ("SPIAs"). Our SPIAs are designed to provide a series of periodic payments for a fixed period of time or for life, according to the policyholder's choice at the time of issue. The amounts, frequency and length of time of the payments are fixed at the outset of the annuity contract. SPIAs are often purchased by persons at or near retirement age who desire a steady stream of payments over a future period of years. The implicit interest rate on SPIAs is based on market conditions when the policy is issued. The implicit interest rate on our outstanding SPIAs averaged 2.37% at December 31, 2015 . 

Withdrawal Options&#8212;Fixed Index and Fixed Rate Annuities 

Policyholders are typically permitted penalty-free withdrawals up to 10% of the contract value in each year after the first year, subject to limitations. Withdrawals in excess of allowable penalty-free amounts are assessed a surrender charge during a penalty period which ranges from 6 to 17 years for fixed index annuities and 5 to 15 years for fixed rate annuities from the date the policy is issued. This surrender charge initially ranges from 7% to 20% for fixed index annuities and 8% to 20% for fixed rate annuities of the contract value and generally decreases by approximately one-half to two percentage points per year during the surrender charge period. For certain policies, the premium bonus is considered in the establishment of the surrender charge percentages. For other policies, there is a vesting schedule ranging from 10 to 14 years that applies to the premium bonus and any interest earned on that premium bonus. Surrender charges and bonus vesting are set at levels aimed at protecting us from loss on early terminations and reducing the likelihood of policyholders terminating their policies during periods of increasing interest rates. This practice enhances our ability to maintain profitability on such policies. Policyholders may elect to take the proceeds of the annuity either in a single payment or in a series of payments for life, for a fixed number of years or a combination of these payment options. 

Beginning in July 2007, substantially all of our fixed index annuity policies and many of our annual reset fixed rate deferred annuities were issued with a lifetime income benefit rider. This rider provides an additional liquidity option to policyholders. With the lifetime income benefit rider, a policyholder can elect to receive guaranteed payments for life from their contract without requiring them to annuitize their contract value. The amount of the living income benefit available is determined by the growth in the policy's income account value as defined in the rider (4.0% to 8.0%), which is selected by the policyholder at the time of purchase, and the policyholder's age at the time the policyholder elects to begin receiving living income benefit payments. As discussed above, in 2014, we modified our lifetime income benefit rider with gender-based income payouts. Lifetime income benefit payments may be stopped and restarted at the election of the policyholder. During 2013, we introduced new versions of our lifetime income benefit rider that had an optional wellbeing benefit or optional death benefit. Policyholders have the choice of selecting a rider with a base level of benefit for no explicit fee or paying a fee for a rider that has a higher level of benefits, and beginning in 2013 we introduced products where the addition of a rider to the policy is completely optional. Rider fees range from 0.30% to 1.00%. 

Life Insurance 

These products include traditional ordinary and term, universal life and other interest-sensitive life insurance products. We have approximately $2.1 billion of life insurance in force as of December 31, 2015 . Premiums related to this business accounted for less than 1% of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 . 

Investments/Spread Management 

Investment activities are an integral part of our business, and net investment income is a significant component of our total revenues. Profitability of our annuity products is significantly affected by spreads between interest yields on investments, the cost of options to fund the annual index credits on our fixed index annuities and rates credited on our fixed rate annuities and the fixed rate strategy in our fixed index annuities. We manage the index-based risk component of our fixed index annuities by purchasing call options on the applicable indices to fund the annual index credits on these annuities and by adjusting the caps, participation rates and asset fees on policy anniversary dates to reflect the change in the cost of such options which varies based on market conditions. All options are purchased on the respective policy anniversary dates, and new options are purchased on each of the anniversary dates to fund the next annual index credits. All credited rates on annual reset fixed rate deferred annuities and the fixed rate strategy in fixed index annuities may be changed annually, subject to minimum guarantees. Changes in caps, participation rates and asset fees on fixed index annuities and crediting rates on fixed rate and fixed index annuities may not be sufficient to maintain targeted investment spreads in all economic and market environments. In addition, competition and other factors, including the potential for increases in surrenders and withdrawals, may limit our ability to adjust or to maintain caps, participation rates, asset fees and crediting rates at levels necessary to avoid narrowing of spreads under certain market conditions.

For additional information regarding the composition of our investment portfolio and our interest rate risk management, see Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Financial Condition&#8212;Investments, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk and Note 3 to our audited consolidated financial statements. 

Marketing 

We market our products through a variable cost brokerage distribution network of independent agents through national marketing organizations. We emphasize high quality service to our agents and policyholders along with the prompt payment of commissions to our agents. We believe this has been significant in building excellent relationships with our independent agency force. 

Our independent agents and agencies range in profile from national sales organizations to personal producing general agents. We actively recruit new agents and terminate those agents who have not produced business for us in recent periods and are unlikely to sell our products in the future. In our recruitment efforts, we emphasize that agents have direct access to our executive officers, giving us an edge in recruiting over larger and foreign-owned competitors. We also emphasize our products, service and our Gold Eagle program which provides unique cash and equity-based incentives to those agents that reach certain benchmarks of annuity premium annually. Agents who produce at least $1 million in annuity premium in a year qualify for Gold Eagle status and receive benefits such as express mail discounts. Agents who produce at least $2 million in annuity premium in a year earn cash and equity-based compensation. We also have favorable relationships with our national marketing organizations, which have enabled us to efficiently sell through an expanded number of independent agents. 

The insurance distribution system is comprised of insurance brokers and marketing organizations. We are pursuing a strategy to increase the efficiency of our distribution network by strengthening our relationships with key national and regional marketing organizations and are alert for opportunities to establish relationships with organizations not presently associated with us. These organizations typically recruit agents for us by advertising our products and our commission structure through direct mail advertising or seminars for insurance agents and brokers. These organizations bear most of the cost incurred in marketing our products. We compensate marketing organizations by paying them a percentage of the commissions earned on new annuity policy sales generated by the agents recruited by such organizations. We also conduct incentive programs for marketing organizations and agents from time to time, including equity-based programs for our leading national marketers and those agents qualifying for our Gold Eagle program. For additional information regarding our equity-based programs for our leading national marketers and independent agents, see Note 11 to our audited consolidated financial statements. We generally do not enter into exclusive arrangements with these marketing organizations. 

Eagle Life's fixed index and fixed rate annuities are distributed pursuant to selling agreements with the applicable broker/dealers, banks and registered investment advisors. Relationships with these firms are facilitated by wholesalers who promote Eagle Life and are compensated based upon the sales of the firms that they have contracted with Eagle Life. At December 31, 2015 , we had 42 selling agreements in place with broker/dealers. Five of these selling agreements are with broker/dealers affiliated with banks. 

Agents contracted with us through one &#32;national marketing organization which markets our products accounted for more than 10% of the annuity deposits and insurance premiums collected during 2015 &#32;representing 24% of the annuity deposits and insurance premiums collected, and we expect this organization to continue as marketers for American Equity Life with a focus on selling our products. The states with the largest share of direct premiums collected during 2015 &#32;were: Florida (10.7%), California (9.2%), Texas (7.2%), Pennsylvania (5.1%) and Illinois (5.0%). 

Competition and Ratings 

We operate in a highly competitive industry. Our annuity products compete with fixed index, fixed rate and variable annuities sold by other insurance companies and also with mutual fund products, traditional bank products and other investment and retirement funding alternatives offered by asset managers, banks, and broker/dealers. Our insurance products compete with products of other insurance companies, financial intermediaries and other institutions based on a number of features, including crediting rates, index options, policy terms and conditions, service provided to distribution channels and policyholders, ratings, reputation and distributor compensation. 

The sales agents for our products use the ratings assigned to an insurer by independent rating agencies as one factor in determining which insurer's annuity to market. The degree to which ratings adjustments have affected and will affect our sales and persistency is unknown. Following is a summary of American Equity Life's financial strength ratings:

Financial strength ratings generally involve quantitative and qualitative evaluations by rating agencies of a company's financial condition and operating performance. Generally, rating agencies base their ratings upon information furnished to them by the insurer and upon their own investigations, studies and assumptions. Ratings are based upon factors of concern to policyholders, agents and intermediaries and are not directed toward the protection of investors and are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold securities. 

In addition to the financial strength ratings, rating agencies use an "outlook statement" to indicate a medium or long-term trend which, if continued, may lead to a rating change. A positive outlook indicates a rating may be raised and a negative outlook indicates a rating may be lowered. A stable outlook is assigned when ratings are not likely to be changed. Outlook statements should not be confused with expected stability of the insurer's financial or economic performance. A rating may have a "stable" outlook to indicate that the rating is not expected to change, but a "stable" outlook does not preclude a rating agency from changing a rating at any time without notice. 

In January 2016, A.M. Best affirmed its rating outlook on the U.S. life/annuity sector as stable, which has been A.M. Best's outlook on our industry since 2010. In January 2016, Standard &#38; Poor's affirmed its outlook on the U.S. life insurance sector as stable. The rating agencies have heightened the level of scrutiny they apply to insurance companies, increased the frequency and scope of their credit reviews and may adjust upward the capital and other requirements employed in the rating agency models for maintenance of certain ratings levels. 

A.M. Best Company ratings currently range from "A++" (Superior) to "F" (In Liquidation), and include 16 separate ratings categories. Within these categories, "A++" (Superior) and "A+" (Superior) are the highest, followed by "A" (Excellent) and "A-" (Excellent) then followed by "B++" (Good) and "B+" (Good). Publications of A.M. Best Company indicate that the "A-" rating is assigned to those companies that, in A.M. Best Company's opinion, have demonstrated an excellent ability to meet their ongoing obligations to policyholders. 

Standard &#38; Poor's insurer financial strength ratings currently range from "AAA (extremely strong)" to "R (under regulatory supervision)", and include 21 separate ratings categories, while "NR" indicates that Standard &#38; Poor's has no opinion about the insurer's financial strength. Within these categories, "AAA" and "AA" are the highest, followed by "A" and "BBB". Publications of Standard &#38; Poor's indicate that an insurer rated "A-" is regarded as having strong financial security characteristics, but is somewhat more likely to be affected by adverse business conditions than are higher rated insurers. 

FitchRating's insurer financial strength ratings currently range from "AAA (exceptionally strong)" to "C (distressed)." Ratings of "BBB-" and higher are considered to be "secure," and those of "BB+" and lower are considered to be "vulnerable." 

A.M. Best Company, Standard &#38; Poor's and Fitch review their ratings of insurance companies from time to time. There can be no assurance that any particular rating will continue for any given period of time or that it will not be changed or withdrawn entirely if, in their judgment, circumstances so warrant. If our ratings were to be negatively adjusted for any reason, we could experience a material decline in the sales of our products and the persistency of our existing business. 

Reinsurance 

Coinsurance 

American Equity Life has two coinsurance agreements with EquiTrust Life Insurance Company ("EquiTrust"), covering 70% of certain of American Equity Life's fixed index and fixed rate annuities issued from August 1, 2001 through December 31, 2001, 40% of those contracts issued during 2002 and 2003, and 20% of those contracts issued from January 1, 2004 to July 31, 2004. The business reinsured under these agreements may not be recaptured. Coinsurance deposits (aggregate policy benefit reserves transferred to EquiTrust under these agreements) were $0.8 billion &#32;at December 31, 2015 &#32;and $0.9 billion at December 31, 2014 . We remain liable to policyholders with respect to the policy liabilities ceded to EquiTrust should EquiTrust fail to meet the obligations it has coinsured. EquiTrust has received a financial strength rating of "B++" (Good) with a stable outlook from A.M. Best Company. None of the coinsurance deposits with EquiTrust are deemed by management to be uncollectible. 

American Equity Life has three coinsurance agreements with Athene Life Re Ltd. ("Athene"), an unauthorized life reinsurer domiciled in Bermuda. One agreement ceded 20% of certain of American Equity Life's fixed index annuities issued from January 1, 2009 through March 31, 2010. The business reinsured under this agreement is not eligible for recapture until the end of the month following seven years after the date of issuance of the policy. The second agreement cedes 80% of American Equity Life's multi-year rate guaranteed annuities issued from July 1, 2009 through December 31, 2013 and 80% of Eagle Life's multi-year rate guaranteed annuities issued from November 20, 2013 through December 31, 2013. The business reinsured under this agreement may not be recaptured. The third agreement cedes 80% of American Equity Life's and Eagle Life's multi-year rate guaranteed annuities issued on or after January 1, 2014 and 80% of Eagle Life's fixed index annuities. The reinsurance agreement specifies that the coinsurance percentage for Eagle Life's fixed index annuities decreases to 50% for policies issued between January 1, 2017 and December 31, 2018, and to 20% for policies issued on or after January 1, 2019. The business reinsured under this agreement may not be recaptured. Coinsurance deposits (aggregate policy benefit reserves transferred to Athene under these agreements) were $2.4 billion &#32;and $2.2 billion &#32;at December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively. American Equity Life is an intermediary for reinsurance of Eagle Life's business ceded to Athene. American Equity Life and Eagle Life remain liable to policyholders with respect to the policy liabilities ceded to Athene should Athene fail to meet the obligations it has coinsured. The annuity deposits that have been ceded to Athene are held in trusts and American Equity Life is named as the sole beneficiary of the trusts. The assets in the trusts are required to remain at a value that is sufficient to support the current balance of policy benefit liabilities of the ceded business on a statutory basis. If the value of the trust accounts would ever be less than the amount of the ceded policy benefit liabilities on a statutory basis, Athene is required to either establish a letter of credit or deposit securities in the trusts for the amount of any shortfall. None of the coinsurance deposits with Athene are deemed by management to be uncollectible. 

&#32;5 

Financing Arrangements 

American Equity Life has a reinsurance transaction with Hannover Life Reassurance Company of America, ("Hannover"), which is treated as reinsurance under statutory accounting practices and as a financing arrangement under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). The statutory surplus benefit under this agreement is eliminated under GAAP and the associated charges are recorded as risk charges and included in other operating costs and expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. The transaction became effective July 1, 2013 and is a yearly renewable term reinsurance agreement for statutory purposes covering 45.6% &#32;of waived surrender charges related to penalty free withdrawals, deaths and lifetime income benefit rider payments as well as lifetime income benefit rider payments in excess of policy fund values on certain business. We may recapture the risks reinsured under this agreement as of the end of any quarter after June 30, 2016. However, the agreement, as amended, makes it punitive to us if we do not recapture the business ceded no later than the first quarter of 2018. The reserve credit recorded on a statutory basis by American Equity Life was $480.7 million &#32;and $322.5 million &#32;at December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively. We pay quarterly reinsurance premiums under this agreement with an experience refund calculated on a quarterly basis and a risk charge equal to 1.25% &#32;of the pretax statutory surplus benefit as of the end of each calendar quarter. 

Indemnity Reinsurance 

Consistent with the general practice of the life insurance industry, American Equity Life enters into agreements of indemnity reinsurance with other insurance companies in order to reinsure portions of the coverage provided by its annuity, life and accident and health insurance products. Indemnity reinsurance agreements are intended to limit a life insurer's maximum loss on a large or unusually hazardous risk or to diversify its risks. Indemnity reinsurance does not discharge the original insurer's primary liability to the insured. 

The maximum loss retained by us on any one life insurance policy we have issued was $0.1 million or less as of December 31, 2015 . American Equity Life's reinsured business under indemnity reinsurance agreements is primarily ceded to two reinsurers. Reinsurance related to life and accident and health insurance that was ceded by us to these reinsurers was immaterial. 

We believe the assuming companies will be able to honor all contractual commitments, based on our periodic review of their financial statements, insurance industry reports and reports filed with state insurance departments. 

Regulation 

Life insurance companies are subject to regulation and supervision by the states in which they transact business. State insurance laws establish supervisory agencies with broad regulatory authority, including the power to: 

&#8226; 

grant and revoke licenses to transact business; 

&#8226; 

regulate and supervise trade practices and market conduct; 

&#8226; 

establish guaranty associations; 

&#8226; 

license agents; 

&#8226; 

approve policy forms; 

&#8226; 

approve premium rates for some lines of business; 

&#8226; 

establish reserve requirements; 

&#8226; 

prescribe the form and content of required financial statements and reports; 

&#8226; 

determine the reasonableness and adequacy of statutory capital and surplus; 

&#8226; 

perform financial, market conduct and other examinations; 

&#8226; 

define acceptable accounting principles for statutory reporting; 

&#8226; 

regulate the type and amount of permitted investments; and 

&#8226; 

limit the amount of dividends and surplus note payments that can be paid without obtaining regulatory approval. 

Our life subsidiaries are subject to periodic examinations by state regulatory authorities. In 2015, the Iowa Insurance Division completed financial examinations of American Equity Life and Eagle Life for the five year period ending December 31, 2013. There were no adjustments to American Equity Life's or Eagle Life's statutory financial statements as a result of these examinations. The New York Insurance Department is currently conducting a financial examination of American Equity Investment Life Insurance Company of New York for the three year period ending December 31, 2013. 

The payment of dividends or the distributions, including surplus note payments, by our life subsidiaries is subject to regulation by each subsidiary's state of domicile's insurance department. Currently, American Equity Life may pay dividends or make other distributions without the prior approval of the Iowa Insurance Commissioner, unless such payments, together with all other such payments within the preceding twelve months, exceed the greater of (1) American Equity Life's statutory net gain from operations for the preceding calendar year, or (2) 10% of American Equity Life's statutory surplus at the preceding December 31. For 2016 , up to $241.3 million &#32;can be distributed as dividends by American Equity Life without prior approval of the Iowa Insurance Commissioner. In addition, dividends and surplus note payments may be made only out of earned surplus, and all surplus note payments are subject to prior approval by regulatory authorities. American Equity Life had $1.3 billion &#32;of statutory earned surplus at December 31, 2015 . 

Most states have also enacted regulations on the activities of insurance holding company systems, including acquisitions, extraordinary dividends, the terms of surplus notes, the terms of affiliate transactions and other related matters. We are registered pursuant to such legislation in Iowa. A number of state legislatures have also considered or have enacted legislative proposals that alter and, in many cases, increase the authority of state agencies to regulate insurance companies and holding company systems. 

&#32;6 

Most states, including Iowa and New York where our life subsidiaries are domiciled, have enacted legislation or adopted administrative regulations affecting the acquisition of control of insurance companies as well as transactions between insurance companies and persons controlling them. The nature and extent of such legislation and regulations currently in effect vary from state to state. However, most states require administrative approval of the direct or indirect acquisition of 10% or more of the outstanding voting securities of an insurance company incorporated in the state. The acquisition of 10% of such securities is generally deemed to be the acquisition of "control" for the purpose of the holding company statutes and requires not only the filing of detailed information concerning the acquiring parties and the plan of acquisition, but also administrative approval prior to the acquisition. In many states, the insurance authority may find that "control" in fact does not exist in circumstances in which a person owns or controls more than 10% of the voting securities. 

Historically, the federal government has not directly regulated the business of insurance. However, federal legislation and administrative policies in several areas, including pension regulation, age and sex discrimination, financial services regulation, securities regulation and federal taxation can significantly affect the insurance business. Additionally, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the "Dodd-Frank Act") generally provides for enhanced federal supervision of financial institutions, including insurance companies in certain circumstances, and financial activities that represent a systemic risk to financial stability or the U.S. economy. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, a Federal Insurance Office has been established within the U.S. Treasury Department to monitor all aspects of the insurance industry and its authority may extend to our business, although the Federal Insurance Office is not empowered with any general regulatory authority over insurers. The director of the Federal Insurance Office serves in an advisory capacity to the Financial Stability Oversight Council ("FSOC") and has the ability to recommend that an insurance company be subject to heightened prudential standards by the Federal Reserve, if it is determined that financial distress at the company could pose a threat to financial stability in the U.S. The Dodd-Frank Act also provides for the preemption of state laws when inconsistent with certain international agreements. 

In April, 2015, the U.S. Department of Labor re-proposed a regulation which, if finalized in current form, substantially expands the range of activities that would be considered to be fiduciary advice under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and the Internal Revenue Code. If finalized as proposed, agents who sell annuities to policyholders for their 401(k) plans and individual retirement accounts (&#8220;IRAs&#8221;) would be considered fiduciaries and subject to additional conflict of interest disclosure requirements. A significant portion of our annuity sales are to IRAs. 

State insurance regulators and the National Association of Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC") are continually reexamining existing laws and regulations and developing new legislation for passage by state legislatures and new regulations for adoption by insurance authorities. Proposed laws and regulations or those still under development pertain to insurer solvency and market conduct and in recent years have focused on: 

&#8226; 

insurance company investments; 

&#8226; 

risk-based capital ("RBC") guidelines, which consist of regulatory targeted surplus levels based on the relationship of statutory capital and surplus, with prescribed adjustments, to the sum of stated percentages of each element of a specified list of company risk exposures; 

&#8226; 

the implementation of non-statutory guidelines and the circumstances under which dividends may be paid; 

&#8226; 

principles-based reserving; 

&#8226; 

own risk solvency and enterprise risk management assessment; 

&#8226; 

cybersecurity assessments; 

&#8226; 

product approvals; 

&#8226; 

agent licensing; 

&#8226; 

underwriting and suitability practices; and 

&#8226; 

life insurance and annuity sales practices. 

The NAIC's RBC requirements are intended to be used by insurance regulators as an early warning tool to identify deteriorating or weakly capitalized insurance companies for the purpose of initiating regulatory action. The RBC formula defines a minimum capital standard which supplements low, fixed minimum capital and surplus requirements previously implemented on a state-by-state basis. Such requirements are not designed as a ranking mechanism for adequately capitalized companies. 

The NAIC's RBC requirements provide for four levels of regulatory attention depending on the ratio of a company's total adjusted capital to its RBC. Adjusted capital is defined as the total of statutory capital and surplus, asset valuation reserve and certain other adjustments. Calculations using the NAIC formula at December 31, 2015 , indicated that American Equity Life's ratio of total adjusted capital to the highest level at which regulatory action might be initiated was 336% . 

Our life subsidiaries also may be required, under the solvency or guaranty laws of most states in which they do business, to pay assessments up to certain prescribed limits to fund policyholder losses or liabilities of insolvent insurance companies. These assessments may be deferred or forgiven under most guaranty laws if they would threaten an insurer's financial strength and, in certain instances, may be offset against future premium taxes. 

Federal Income Tax 

The annuity and life insurance products that we market generally provide the policyholder with a federal income tax advantage, as compared to certain other savings investments such as certificates of deposit and taxable bonds, in that federal income taxation on any increases in the contract values (i.e., the "inside build-up") of these products is deferred until it is received by the policyholder. With other savings investments, the increase in value is generally taxed each year as it is realized. Additionally, life insurance death benefits are generally exempt from income tax. 

&#32;7 

From time to time, various tax law changes have been proposed that could have an adverse effect on our business, including the elimination of all or a portion of the income tax advantage described above for annuities and life insurance. If legislation were enacted to eliminate the tax deferral for annuities, such a change would have an adverse effect on our ability to sell non-qualified annuities. Non-qualified annuities are annuities that are not sold to an individual retirement account or other qualified retirement plan. 

Since 2013, distributions from non-qualified annuity policies are considered "investment income" for purposes of the Medicare tax on investment income contained in the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010. As a result, in certain circumstances a 3.8% tax ("Medicare Tax") may be applied to some or the entire taxable portion of distributions from non-qualified annuities to individuals whose income exceeds certain threshold amounts. This tax may have an adverse effect on our ability to sell non-qualified annuities to individuals whose income exceeds these threshold amounts.
