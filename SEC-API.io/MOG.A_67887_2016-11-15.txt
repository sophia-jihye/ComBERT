Business. 

Description of the Business . &#32; Moog is a worldwide designer, manufacturer and systems integrator of high performance precision motion and fluid controls and controls systems for a broad range of applications in aerospace and defense and industrial markets. We have four operating segments: Aircraft Controls, Space and Defense Controls, Industrial Systems and Components. 

Additional information describing the business and comparative segment revenues, operating profits and related financial information for 2016 , 2015 &#32;and 2014 &#32;are provided in Note 17 of Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. 

Distribution . &#32; Our sales and marketing organization consists of individuals possessing highly specialized technical expertise. This expertise is required in order to effectively evaluate a customer&#8217;s precision control requirements and to facilitate communication between the customer and our engineering staff. Our sales staff is the primary contact with customers. Manufacturers&#8217; representatives are used to cover certain domestic aerospace markets. Distributors are used selectively to cover certain industrial and medical markets. 

Industry and Competitive Conditions . &#32; We experience considerable competition in our aerospace and defense and industrial markets. We believe that the principal points of competition in our markets are product quality, reliability, price, design and engineering capabilities, product development, conformity to customer specifications, timeliness of delivery, effectiveness of the distribution organization and quality of support after the sale. We believe we compete effectively on all of these bases. Competitors in our four operating segments include: 

&#8226; 

Aircraft Controls: Curtiss-Wright, Liebherr, Nabtesco, Parker Hannifin, UTC (Goodrich, Hamilton Sundstrand) and Woodward. 

&#8226; 

Space and Defense Controls: Aeroflex, Airbus, ATA Engineering, BAE, Chess Dynamics, Cohu, Curtiss-Wright, ESW, Flowserve Limitorque, Honeywell, Marotta, RUAG, Lord Corp., Pelco, SABCA, Sargent Aerospace &#38; Defense, SEAKR, Sierra Nevada Corp., Southwest Research Institute, UTC, Vacco, Valcor, &#32; Videotec, ValveTech and Woodward. 

&#8226; 

Industrial Systems: Allen-Bradley, Bosch Rexroth, Danaher, DEIF Wind Power, KEB, MTS Systems Corp., Parker Hannifin, Siemens and SSB Wind Systems. 

&#8226; 

Components: Allied Motion Technologies, Ametek, Cobham, CME Medical, General Dynamics Mission Systems, Kearfott, Kollmorgen, Medtronic, Pfizer, Schleifring, Smiths Medical, Stemmann, Woodward and Whippany Actuation Systems. 

Government Contracts . &#32; All U.S. Government contracts are subject to termination by the U.S. Government. In 2016 , sales under U.S. Government contracts represented 30% &#32;of total sales and were primarily within our Aircraft Controls, Space and Defense Controls and Components segments. 

Backlog . &#32; Our twelve-month backlog represents confirmed orders we believe will be recognized as revenue within the next twelve months. As noted in Item 6, Selected Financial Data of this report, as of October 1, 2016 , our twelve-month backlog was $1.2 billion, a decline of 4% compared to October 3, 2015 . See Item 7, Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this report for a discussion on the various business drivers and conditions contributing to the twelve-month backlog change. 

Raw Materials . &#32;Materials, supplies and components are purchased from numerous suppliers. We believe the loss of any one supplier, although potentially disruptive in the short-term, would not materially affect our operations in the long-term. 

Working Capital. &#32; See the discussion on operating cycle in Note 1 of Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. 

Seasonality. &#32; Our business is generally not seasonal; however, certain products and systems, such as those in the energy market of our Industrial Systems segment, do experience seasonal variations in sales levels. 

Patents . We maintain a patent portfolio of issued or pending patents and patent applications worldwide that generally includes the U.S., Europe, China, Japan and India. The portfolio includes patents that relate to electrohydraulic, electromechanical, electronics, hydraulics, components and methods of operation and manufacture as related to motion control and actuation systems. The portfolio also includes patents related to wind turbines, robotics, surveillance/security, vibration control and medical devices. We do not consider any one or more of these patents or patent applications to be material in relation to our business as a whole. The patent portfolio related to certain medical devices is significant to our position in this market as several of these products work exclusively together, and provide us future revenue opportunities. 

Research Activities. &#32; Research and development activity has been, and continues to be, significant for us. Research and development expense was at least $130 million &#32;in each of the last three years and represented over 6% &#32;of sales in 2016 . 

Employees . &#32; On October 1, 2016 , we employed 10,497 &#32;full-time employees. 

Customers . &#32;Our principal customers are Original Equipment Manufacturers, or OEMs, and end users for whom we provide aftermarket support. Aerospace and defense OEM customers collectively represented 52% &#32;of 2016 &#32;sales. The majority of these sales are to a small number of large companies. Due to the long-term nature of many of the programs, many of our relationships with aerospace and defense OEM customers are based on long-term agreements. Our industrial OEM sales, which represented 31% &#32;of 2016 &#32;sales, are to a wide range of global customers and are normally based on lead times of 90 days or less. We also provide aftermarket support, consisting of spare and replacement parts and repair and overhaul services, for all of our products. Our major aftermarket customers are the U.S. Government and commercial airlines. In 2016 , aftermarket sales accounted for 17% &#32;of total sales. 

Significant customers in our four operating segments include: 

&#8226; 

Aircraft Controls: Boeing, Airbus, Lockheed Martin, Japan Aerospace, United Technologies, Honeywell, Goodrich, Gulfstream, Bombardier, Embraer and the U.S. Government. 

&#8226; 

Space and Defense Controls: Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, Aerojet Rocketdyne, Boeing, Airbus, General Dynamics, Orbital ATK, United Launch Alliance, Northrup Grumman and the U.S. Government.

See Note 17 of Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report for information regarding sales by geographic area and Exhibit 21 of Item 15, Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules of this report for a list of subsidiaries. Our international operations are subject to the usual risks inherent in international trade, including currency fluctuations, local government contracting regulations, local governmental restrictions on foreign investment and repatriation of profits, exchange controls, regulation of the import and distribution of foreign goods, as well as changing economic and social conditions in countries in which our operations are conducted.
