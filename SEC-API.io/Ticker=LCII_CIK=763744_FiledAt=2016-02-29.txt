 Item 1. BUSINESS. 

Summary 

Drew Industries Incorporated (&#8220;Drew&#8221; and collectively with its subsidiaries, the &#8220;Company&#8221; or the &#8220;Registrant&#8221;), through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Lippert Components, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, &#8220;Lippert Components&#8221; or &#8220;LCI&#8221;), supplies a broad array of components in the United States and abroad for the leading manufacturers of recreational vehicles (&#8220;RVs&#8221;) and manufactured homes and for the related aftermarkets of those industries. The Company also supplies components for adjacent industries including buses; trailers used to haul boats, livestock, equipment and other cargo; pontoon boats; modular housing; and factory-built mobile office units. 

The Company has two reportable segments: the recreational vehicle products segment (the &#8220;RV Segment&#8221;) and the manufactured housing products segment (the &#8220;MH Segment&#8221;). The RV Segment accounted for 92 percent &#32;of consolidated net sales for 2015 , and the MH Segment accounted for 8 percent &#32;of consolidated net sales for 2015 . Approximately 73 percent &#32;of the Company&#8217;s RV Segment net sales in 2015 &#32;were of products to manufacturers of travel trailer and fifth-wheel RVs. 

The Company is focused on profitable growth, both organic and through the acquisition of manufacturers of components for RVs, manufactured homes and adjacent industries. In order to support this growth, over the past several years the Company has expanded its geographic market and product lines, consolidated manufacturing facilities, and integrated manufacturing, distribution and administrative functions. At December 31, 2015 , the Company operated 42 &#32;manufacturing and distribution facilities in 16 states and Quebec, Canada, and reported consolidated net sales of $1.4 billion &#32;for the year ended December 31, 2015 . 

The Company was incorporated under the laws of Delaware on March 20, 1984, and is the successor to Drew National Corporation, which was incorporated under the laws of Delaware in 1962. The Company&#8217;s principal executive and administrative offices are located at 3501 County Road 6 East, Elkhart, Indiana 46514; telephone number (574) 535-1125; website www.drewindustries.com ; e-mail drew@drewindustries.com . The Company makes available free of charge on its website its Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K (and amendments to those reports) filed with the SEC as soon as reasonably practicable after such materials are electronically filed. 

Recent Developments 

Sales and Profits 

Consolidated net sales for 2015 &#32;increased to a record $1.4 billion , 18 percent &#32;higher than 2014 . Acquisitions completed by the Company in 2015 , as well as the Furrion Limited (&#8220;Furrion&#8221;) distribution and supply agreement for premium electronics (the &#8220;Furrion Agreement&#8221;), added $52 million in net sales in 2015 . A five percent increase in industry-wide wholesale shipments of travel trailer and fifth-wheel RVs, the Company&#8217;s primary RV market, as well as increased content per unit through market share gains, also positively impacted net sales growth in 2015 . 

In 2015 , the Company continued to grow sales to both adjacent industries and the aftermarket for the RV and MH Segments. Aggregate net sales to adjacent industries increased 40 percent &#32;to $193 million &#32;and aftermarket net sales increased 62 percent &#32;to $103 million . Together, these markets now account for 21 percent of consolidated net sales, double the percentage from 2010. 

For the full-year 2015 , the Company&#8217;s net income increased to $74.3 million , or $3.02 &#32;per diluted share, up from net income of $62.3 million , or $2.56 &#32;per diluted share, in 2014 . Excluding certain charges for severance, environmental and legal costs in 2015 , net income would have been $79.0 million in 2015 , or $3.20 per diluted share, and excluding the 2014 &#32;loss on the sale of the Company's aluminum extrusion-related assets, net income would have been $63.5 million in 2014 , or $2.61 per diluted share. 

In Item 7. &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,&#8221; the Company describes in detail the increase in its sales and profits during 2015 . 

Acquisitions 

During 2015 &#32;and early 2016 &#32;the Company completed five acquisitions: 

In January 2015 , the Company acquired the business and certain assets of EA Technologies, LLC (&#8220;EA Technologies&#8221;), an Elkhart, Indiana-based manufacturer of custom steel and aluminum parts and provider of electro-deposition (&#8216;e-coat&#8217;) and powder coating services for RV, bus, medium-duty truck, automotive, recreational marine, specialty and utility trailer, and military applications.

Other Developments 

On April 10, 2015, a special dividend of $2.00 &#32;per share of the Company&#8217;s Common Stock, representing an aggregate of $48.2 million , was paid to stockholders of record as of March 27, 2015. 

In July 2015, the Company entered into a 6-year exclusive distribution and supply agreement with Furrion, a Hong Kong based firm that designs, engineers and manufacturers premium electronics. This agreement provides the Company with the rights to distribute Furrion&#8217;s complete line of products to OEMs and aftermarket customers in the RV, specialty vehicle, utility trailer, horse trailer, marine, transit bus and school bus industries throughout the United States and Canada. Furrion currently supplies a premium line of LED televisions, sound systems, navigation systems, wireless backup cameras, solar prep units, power solutions and kitchen appliances, primarily to the RV industry. 

RV Segment 

Through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, the Company manufactures or distributes a variety of products used in the production of RVs, including: 

&#9679; Steel chassis for towable RVs 

&#9679; Furniture and mattresses 

&#9679; Axles and suspension solutions for towable RVs 

&#9679; Entry, luggage, patio and ramp doors 

&#9679; Slide-out mechanisms and solutions 

&#9679; Electric and manual entry steps 

&#9679; Thermoformed bath, kitchen and other products 

&#9679; Awnings and awning accessories 

&#9679; Windows 

&#9679; Electronic components 

&#9679; Manual, electric and hydraulic stabilizer and &#160; leveling systems 

&#9679; LED televisions, sound systems, navigation &#160; systems and wireless backup cameras 

&#9679; Chassis components 

&#9679; Other accessories 

The Company also supplies certain of these products to the RV aftermarket and to adjacent industries, including buses, trailers used to haul boats, livestock, equipment and other cargo, and pontoon boats. In 2015 , the RV Segment represented 92 percent &#32;of the Company&#8217;s consolidated net sales, and 90 percent &#32;of consolidated segment operating profit. RVs may be motorized (motorhomes) or towable (travel trailers, fifth-wheel travel trailers, folding camping trailers and truck campers). Approximately 73 percent &#32;of the Company&#8217;s RV Segment net sales in 2015 &#32;were of products to manufacturers of travel trailer and fifth-wheel RVs. 

Raw materials used by the Company&#8217;s RV Segment, consisting primarily of steel (coil, sheet, tube and I-beam), extruded aluminum, glass, wood, fabric and foam are available from a number of sources, both domestic and foreign. 

Operations of the Company&#8217;s RV Segment consist primarily of fabricating, welding, thermoforming, painting, sewing and assembling components into finished products. The Company&#8217;s RV Segment operations are conducted at 38 manufacturing and warehouse facilities throughout the United States and Canada, strategically located in proximity to the customers they serve. Of these facilities, 7 also conduct operations in the Company&#8217;s MH Segment. See Item 2. &#8220;Properties.&#8221; 

The Company&#8217;s RV Segment products are sold primarily to major manufacturers of RVs such as Thor Industries (symbol: THO), Forest River (a Berkshire Hathaway company, symbol: BRKA), Jayco (a private company) and other OEMs, and, to a lesser extent, to manufacturers in adjacent industries and distributors and retail dealers of aftermarket products. 

The RV industry is highly competitive, both among manufacturers of RVs and the suppliers of RV components, generally with low barriers to entry other than compliance with industry standards, codes and safety requirements, and the initial capital investment required to establish manufacturing operations. The Company competes with several other component suppliers on a regional and national basis with respect to a broad array of components for both towable and motorized RVs. &#32; The Company&#8217;s RV Segment operations compete on the basis of customer service, quality, functionality, product innovation, price and reliability. Although definitive information is not readily available, the Company believes with respect to its principal RV products (i) it is the leading supplier of windows and doors for towable RVs; (ii) it is the leading supplier of chassis and slide-out mechanisms for towable RVs; (iii) the leading suppliers of axles for towable RVs are the Company and Dexter Axle Company; (iv) it is the leading supplier of furniture for towable RVs, and the Company competes with several other manufacturers; (v) the Company is the leading supplier of leveling systems for towable RVs; and (vi) the leading suppliers of awnings for towable RVs are the Company, Carefree of Colorado and Dometic Corporation. 

The Company&#8217;s share of the market for its products in adjacent industries cannot be readily determined; however, RV Segment net sales to adjacent industries increased from $113 million &#32;in 2014 &#32;to $172 million &#32;in 2015 . The Company&#8217;s share of the aftermarket for RV parts also cannot be readily determined; however, RV Segment net sales to the aftermarket increased from $50 million &#32;in 2014 &#32;to $87 million &#32;in 2015 . The Company has made investments in people, technology and equipment to increase its share of both adjacent industries and the aftermarket, and is committed to continue these expansion efforts. 

Detailed narrative information about the results of operations of the RV Segment is included in Item 7. &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.&#8221; Financial information relating to the Company&#8217;s business segments is included in Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report. 

MH Segment 

Through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, the Company manufactures or distributes a variety of products used in the production of manufactured homes, including: 

&#9679;Vinyl and aluminum windows 

&#9679;Aluminum and vinyl patio doors 

&#9679;Thermoformed bath and kitchen products 

&#9679;Steel chassis and related components 

&#9679;Steel and fiberglass entry doors 

&#9679;Axles 

The Company also supplies certain of these products to the manufactured housing aftermarket and to adjacent industries, including modular housing and mobile office units. In 2015 , the MH Segment represented 8 percent &#32;of the Company&#8217;s consolidated net sales, and 10 percent &#32;of consolidated segment operating profit. Certain of the Company&#8217;s MH Segment customers manufacture both manufactured homes and modular homes, and certain of the products manufactured by the Company are suitable for both types of homes. As a result, the Company is not always able to determine in which type of home its products are installed. 

Raw materials used by the Company&#8217;s MH Segment, consisting primarily of steel (coil, sheet and I-beam), extruded aluminum and vinyl, glass, and ABS resin, are available from a number of sources, both domestic and foreign. 

Operations of the Company&#8217;s MH Segment consist primarily of fabricating, welding, thermoforming, painting and assembling components into finished products. The Company&#8217;s MH Segment operations are conducted at 13 manufacturing and warehouse facilities throughout the United States, strategically located in proximity to the customers they serve. Of these facilities, 7 also conduct operations in the Company&#8217;s RV Segment. See Item 2. &#8220;Properties.&#8221; 

The Company&#8217;s manufactured housing products are sold primarily to major producers of manufactured homes such as Clayton Homes (a Berkshire Hathaway company, symbol: BRKA), Cavco Industries, Inc. (symbol: CVCO), and other OEMs, and, to a lesser extent, to manufacturers in adjacent industries and distributors of aftermarket products. 

The manufactured housing industry is also highly competitive among manufacturers and suppliers. The Company competes with several other component suppliers with respect to a broad array of components, as well as with manufacturers of manufactured homes with vertically integrated operations. The Company&#8217;s MH Segment competes on the basis of customer service, quality, product innovation, price and reliability. Although definitive information is not readily available, the Company believes with respect to its principal manufactured housing products (i) it is the leading supplier of windows for manufactured homes; (ii) the Company&#8217;s manufactured housing chassis and chassis parts operations compete with several other manufacturers of chassis and chassis parts, as well as with builders of manufactured homes, many of which produce their own chassis and chassis parts; and (iii) the Company&#8217;s thermoformed bath and kitchen unit operation competes with several other manufacturers of bath and kitchen units. 

The Company&#8217;s share of the market for its products in adjacent industries and the aftermarket cannot be readily determined. MH Segment net sales to adjacent industries and the aftermarket was $20 million and $16 million in 2015 , respectively. The Company has made investments in people, technology and equipment to increase its share of both adjacent industries and the aftermarket, and is committed to continue these expansion efforts. 

Detailed narrative information about the results of operations of the MH Segment is included in Item 7. &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.&#8221; Financial information relating to the Company&#8217;s business segments is included in Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report. 

Sales and Marketing 

The Company&#8217;s sales activities are related to developing new customer relationships and maintaining existing customer relationships, primarily through the quality of its products, innovation, service, price and customer satisfaction. As a result of the Company's strategic decision to increase its sales to the aftermarket and adjacent industries, as well as expand into international markets, the Company has increased its annual marketing and advertising expenditures over the past few years, which were approximately $2 million in 2015 . 

The Company has several supply agreements or other arrangements with certain of its customers that provide for prices of various products to be fixed for periods generally not in excess of eighteen months; however, in certain cases the Company has the right to renegotiate the prices on sixty-days&#8217; notice. Both the RV Segment and the MH Segment typically ship products on average within one to two weeks of receipt of orders from their customers and, as a result, neither segment has any significant backlog. 

Capacity 

In 2015 , the Company&#8217;s facilities operated at an average of approximately 55 percent of their practical capacity, assuming at least two shifts of production at all facilities. However, while certain facilities could add a second shift of production in the short term, the Company has found this to be inefficient over the long term. Capacity varies significantly based on seasonal demand, as well as by facility, product line and geographic region, with certain facilities at times operating below 50 percent utilization, and other facilities at times operating above 90 percent utilization. 

At December 31, 2015 , the Company operated 42 &#32;manufacturing and distribution facilities, and for most products has the ability to fill demand in excess of capacity at individual facilities by shifting production to other facilities, but the Company would incur additional freight costs. Capital expenditures for 2015 &#32;were $29 million , and included approximately $15 million of &#8220;replacement&#8221; capital expenditures and approximately $14 million of &#8220;growth&#8221; capital expenditures. The ability to expand capacity in certain product areas, if necessary, as well as the potential to reallocate existing resources, is monitored regularly by management to help ensure the Company can maintain a high level of production efficiencies throughout its operations. 

Seasonality 

The RV and manufactured housing industries, as well as other industries where the Company sells products or where its products are used, historically have been seasonal and generally at the highest levels when the weather is moderate. Accordingly, the Company&#8217;s sales and profits have generally been the highest in the second quarter and lowest in the fourth quarter. However, because of fluctuations in dealer inventories, the addition of major RV open houses for dealers to the September/October timeframe, and the impact of international, national and regional economic conditions and consumer confidence on retail sales of RVs and other products for which the Company sells its components, as well as the impact of severe weather conditions on the timing of industry-wide shipments from time to time, current and future seasonal industry trends may be different than in prior years. 

International 

Over the past several years, the Company has been gradually growing international RV sales, primarily in Europe and Australia, and export sales represented approximately 1 percent &#32;of consolidated net sales in 2015 . The Company continues to focus on developing products tailored for international RV markets. The Company participates in the largest RV shows in Europe and has been receiving positive feedback on its products, especially its proprietary slide-out products. The Company has spent more than two years developing three slide-out systems suited to the needs of the European market, which were recently featured on new RV models. As a result, the Company believes it will see additional orders from European RV OEMs. The Company&#8217;s Director of International Business Development spends time in Australia, Europe and other international markets, assessing the dynamics of the local marketplace, building relationships with OEMs and helping the Company introduce its existing products and develop new products for those markets, with the goal of identifying long-term growth opportunities. The Company estimates the addressable market for annual net sales of its products outside of North America to be $750 million. 

Intellectual Property 

The Company holds 190 United States and foreign patents and has over 50 patent applications pending that relate to various products sold by the Company. The Company has also granted certain licenses that permit third parties to manufacture and sell products in consideration for royalty payments. The Company believes its patents are valuable and vigorously protects its patents when appropriate. 

From time to time, the Company has received notices or claims it may be infringing certain patent or other intellectual property rights of others, and the Company has given notices to, or asserted claims against, others that they may be infringing certain patent or other intellectual property rights of the Company. However, no material litigation is currently pending as a result of these claims. 

Research and Development 

The Company strives to be an industry leader in product innovation and is focused on developing new products, as well as improving existing products. Research and development expenditures are expensed as they are incurred. Research and development expenses were approximately $8 million in 2015 &#32;and $5 million in both 2014 &#32;and 2013, respectively. 

Regulatory Matters 

Rules promulgated under the Transportation Recall Enhancement, Accountability and Documentation Act (the &#8220;Tread Act&#8221;) require manufacturers of motor vehicles and certain motor vehicle related equipment to regularly make reports and submit documents and certain historical data to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (&#8220;NHTSA&#8221;) of the United States Department of Transportation (&#8220;DOT&#8221;) to enhance motor vehicle safety, and to respond to requests for information relating to specific complaints or incidents. 

Trailers produced by the Company for hauling boats, personal watercraft, snowmobiles and equipment must comply with Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (&#8220;FMVSS&#8221;) promulgated by NHTSA relating to lighting, braking, wheels, tires and other vehicle systems. 

Windows and doors produced by the Company for the RV industry must comply with regulations promulgated by NHTSA governing safety glass performance, egress ability, door hinge and lock systems, egress window retention hardware, and baggage door ventilation. Windows produced by the Company for buses also must comply with FMVSS promulgated by NHTSA. 

Upholstered products and mattresses produced by the Company for RVs and buses must comply with FMVSS promulgated by NHTSA regarding flammability. In addition, upholstered products and mattresses produced by the Company for RVs must comply with regulations promulgated by the Consumer Products Safety Commission regarding flammability, as well as standards for toxic chemical levels and labeling requirements promulgated by the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment. Plywood, particleboard and fiberboard used in RV products are required to comply with standards for formaldehyde emission levels promulgated by the California Air Resources Board and adopted by the Recreation Vehicle Industry Association (&#8220;RVIA&#8221;). 

Windows and entry doors produced by the Company for manufactured homes must comply with performance and construction regulations promulgated by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (&#8220;HUD&#8221;) and by the American Architectural Manufacturers Association relating to air and water infiltration, structural integrity, thermal performance, emergency exit conformance, and hurricane resistance. Certain of the Company&#8217;s products must also comply with the International Code Council standards, such as the IRC (International Residential Code), the IBC (International Building Code), and the IECC (International Energy Conservation Code) as well as state and local building codes. Thermoformed bath products manufactured by the Company for manufactured homes must comply with performance and construction regulations promulgated by HUD. 

The Company believes it is currently operating in compliance, in all material respects, with applicable laws and regulations and has made reports and submitted information as required. The Company does not believe the expense of compliance with these laws and regulations, as currently in effect, will have a material effect on the Company's operations, financial condition or competitive position; however, there can be no assurance this trend will continue as health and safety laws, regulations or other pertinent requirements evolve. 

Environmental 

The Company&#8217;s operations are subject to certain Federal, state and local regulatory requirements relating to the use, storage, discharge, transport and disposal of hazardous materials used during the manufacturing processes. Although the Company believes its operations have been consistent with prevailing industry standards, and are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations, one or more of the Company&#8217;s current or former operating sites, or adjacent sites owned by third-parties, have been affected by releases of hazardous materials. As a result, the Company may incur expenditures for future investigation and remediation of these sites, and recorded a pre-tax charge of $1.5 million related to environmental costs in 2015. In the past, environmental compliance costs have not had, and are not expected in the future to have, a material effect on the Company&#8217;s operations or financial condition; however, there can be no assurance that this trend will continue. 

Employees 

The number of persons employed full-time by the Company at December 31, 2015 &#32;was 6,576, compared to 5,845 at December 31, 2014 . The total at December 31, 2015 &#32;included 5,362 in manufacturing, 288 in transportation, 93 in sales, 172 in customer support and servicing, and 661 in administration. None of the employees of the Company are subject to collective bargaining agreements. The Company believes that relations with its employees are good.
