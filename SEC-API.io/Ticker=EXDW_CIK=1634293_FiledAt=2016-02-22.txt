 Item 1. Business. 

&#160; 

Exceed World, Inc., formerly known as Brilliant Acquisition, Inc., was incorporated in the State of Delaware on November 25, 2014. Since inception, the Company has been engaged in organizational efforts and obtaining initial financing. The Company was formed as a vehicle to pursue a business combination and has made no efforts to identify a possible business combination. As a result, the Company has not conducted negotiations or entered into a letter of intent concerning any target business. The business purpose of the Company is to seek the acquisition of or merger with, an existing company. The Company selected November 30 th as its fiscal year end. 

&#160; 

The Company, based on proposed business activities, is a &#8220;blank check&#8221; company. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#8220;SEC&#8221;) defines those companies as &#8220;any development stage company that is issuing a penny stock, within the meaning of Section 3 (a)(51) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;), and that has no specific business plan or purpose, or has indicated that its business plan is to merge with an unidentified company or companies.&#8221; Under SEC Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, the Company also qualifies as a &#8220;shell company,&#8221; because it has no or nominal assets (other than cash) and no or nominal operations. Many states have enacted statutes, rules and regulations limiting the sale of securities of &#8220;blank check&#8221; companies in their respective jurisdictions. Management does not intend to undertake any efforts to cause a market to develop in our securities, either debt or equity, until we have successfully concluded a business combination. The Company intends to comply with the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act for so long as it is subject to those requirements. 

&#160; 

The Company was organized as a vehicle to investigate and, if such investigation warrants, acquire a target company or business seeking the perceived advantages of being a publicly held corporation. The Company&#8217;s principal business objective for the next 12 months and beyond such time will be to achieve long-term growth potential through a combination with a business rather than immediate, short-term earnings. The Company will not restrict its potential candidate target companies to any specific business, industry or geographical location and, thus, may acquire any type of business. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

The analysis of new business opportunities will be undertaken by or under the supervision of Tomoo Yoshida, the sole officer and director of the Registrant. As of this date, the Company has not entered into any definitive agreement with any party, nor have there been any specific discussions with any potential business combination candidate regarding business opportunities for the Company. The Registrant has unrestricted flexibility in seeking, analyzing and participating in potential business opportunities. In its efforts to analyze potential acquisition targets, the Registrant will consider the following kinds of factors: 

&#160; 

(a) Potential for growth, indicated by new technology, anticipated market expansion or new products; &#160; 

(b) Competitive position as compared to other firms of similar size and experience within the industry segment as well as within the industry as a whole; &#160; 

(c) Strength and diversity of management, either in place or scheduled for recruitment; &#160; 

(d) Capital requirements and anticipated availability of required funds, to be provided by the Registrant or from operations, through the sale of additional securities, through joint ventures or similar arrangements or from other sources; &#160; 

(e) The cost of participation by the Registrant as compared to the perceived tangible and intangible values and potentials; &#160; 

(f) The extent to which the business opportunity can be advanced; &#160; 

(g) The accessibility of required management expertise, personnel, raw materials, services, professional assistance and other required items; and &#160; 

(h) Other relevant factors. &#160;
