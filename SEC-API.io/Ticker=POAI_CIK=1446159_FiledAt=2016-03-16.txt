 ITEM 1. BUSINESS. 

&#160;

Overview 

&#160;

We are a medical device company manufacturing an environmentally conscientious system for the collection and disposal of infectious fluids that result from surgical procedures and post-operative care. We own patent rights to our products, which consist of the STREAMWAY&#174;FMS and distribute our products to medical facilities where bodily and irrigation fluids produced during surgical procedures must be contained, measured, documented, and disposed. Our products minimize the exposure potential to the healthcare workers who handle such fluids. Our goal is to create products that dramatically reduce staff exposure without significant changes to established operative procedures, historically a major stumbling block to innovation and product introduction. In addition to simplifying the handling of these fluids, we believe our technologies provide cost savings to facilities over the aggregate costs incurred today using the traditional canister method of collection, neutralization, and disposal. We sell our products through an experienced in-house sales force. The Company has one regional manager currently on staff. We also intend to utilize independent distributors in the United States and Europe, initially, and eventually to other areas of the world.

&#160;

The STREAMWAY FMS is a wall mounted fully automated system that disposes of an unlimited amount of suctioned fluid providing uninterrupted performance for surgeons while virtually eliminating healthcare workers exposure to potentially infectious fluids found in the surgical environment. The system also provides an innovative way to dispose of ascetic fluid with no evac bottles, suction canisters, transport or risk of exposure. The Company also manufactures and sells two disposable products required for system operation: a bifurcated single procedure filter with tissue trap and a single use bottle of cleaning solution. Both items are used on a single procedure basis and must be discarded after use.

&#160;

Skyline&#8217;s virtually hands free direct-to-drain technology (a) significantly reduce the risk of healthcare worker exposure to these infectious fluids by replacing canisters, (b) further reduces the risk of worker exposure when compared to powered canister technology that requires transport to and from the operating room, (c) reduce the cost per procedure for handling these fluids, and (d) enhance the surgical team&#8217;s ability to collect data to accurately assess the patient&#8217;s status during and after procedures.

&#160;

Skyline believes that the STREAMWAY FMS is unique to the industry in that it allows for continuous suction to the surgical field and provides unlimited capacity to the user so no surgical procedure will ever have to be interrupted to change canisters. It is wall mounted and takes up no valuable operating room space. The FMS can replace the manual process of collecting fluids in canisters and transporting and dumping in sinks outside of the operating room that is still being used by many hospitals and surgical centers.

&#160;

Skyline believes its products provide substantial cost savings and improvements in safety in facilities that still use manual processes. In cases where healthcare organizations re-use canisters, the FMS cleaning process eliminates the need for cleaning of canisters for re-use. The FMS reduces the safety issues facing operating room nurses, the cost of the handling process, and the amount of infectious waste generated when the traditional method of disposing of canisters is used. The FMS is fully automated, does not require transport to and from the operating room and eliminates any canister that requires emptying. It is positioned to penetrate its market segment due to its virtually hands free operation, simple design, ease of use, continuous suction, continuous flow, unlimited capacity and efficiency in removal of infectious waste with minimal exposure of operating room personnel to potentially infectious material.

&#160;

The Company was originally incorporated on April 23, 2002 in Minnesota as BioDrain Medical, Inc. Effective August 6, 2013, the Company changed its name to Skyline Medical Inc. Pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger effective December 16, 2013, the Company merged with and into a Delaware corporation with the same name that was its wholly-owned subsidiary, with such Delaware Corporation as the surviving corporation of the merger. On August 31, 2015, the Company completed a successful offering and concurrent uplisting to The NASDAQ Capital Market. Our address is 2915 Commers Drive, Suite 900, Eagan, Minnesota 55121. Our telephone number is 651-389-4800, and our website address is www.skylinemedical.com. Information on our website is not included or incorporated by reference in this report.

Industry and Market Analysis 

&#160;

Infectious and Bio-hazardous Waste Management 

&#160;

There has long been recognition of the collective potential for ill effects to healthcare workers from exposure to infectious/bio-hazardous materials federal and state regulatory agencies have issued mandatory guidelines for the control of such materials, and in particular, bloodborne pathogens. The medical device industry has responded to this need by developing various products and technologies to limit exposure or to alert workers to potential exposure.

&#160;

The presence of infectious materials is most prevalent in the surgical suite and post-operative care units where often, large amounts of bodily fluids, including blood, bodily and irrigation fluids are continuously removed from the patient during the surgical procedure. Surgical teams and post-operative care personnel may be exposed to these potentially serious hazards during the procedure via direct contact of blood materials or more indirectly via splash and spray.

&#160;

According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (&#8220;OSHA&#8221;), workers in many different occupations are at risk of exposure to bloodborne pathogens, including Hepatitis B and C, and HIV/AIDS. First aid team members, housekeeping personnel, nurses and other healthcare providers are examples of workers who may be at risk of exposure.

&#160;

In 1991, OSHA issued the Bloodborne Pathogens Standard to protect workers from this risk. In 2001, in response to the Needlestick Safety and Prevention Act, OSHA revised the Bloodborne Pathogens Standard. The revised standard clarifies (and emphasizes) the need for employers to select safer needle devices and to involve employees in identifying and choosing these devices. The revised standard also calls for the use of &#8220;automated controls&#8221; as it pertains to the minimization of healthcare exposure to bloodborne pathogens. Additionally, employers are required to have an exposure control plan that includes universal precautions to be observed to prevent contact with blood or other potentially infectious materials, such as implementing work practice controls, requiring personal protective equipment and regulating waste and waste containment. The exposure control plan is required to be reviewed and updated annually to reflect new or modified tasks and procedures, which affect occupational exposure and to reflect changes in technology that eliminate or reduce exposure to bloodborne pathogens.

&#160;

According to the American Hospital Association&#8217;s (AHA) Hospital Statistics, 2013 edition, America&#8217;s hospitals performed approximately 86 million surgeries. This number does not include the many procedures performed at surgery centers across the country.

&#160;

The majority of these procedures produce potentially infectious materials that must be disposed with the lowest possible risk of cross-contamination to healthcare workers. Current standards of care allow for these fluids to be retained in canisters, located in the operating room where they can be monitored throughout the surgical procedure. Once the procedure is complete these canisters and their contents are disposed using a variety of methods all of which include manual handling and result in a heightened risk to healthcare workers for exposure to their contents. A Frost &#38; Sullivan research report from April 24, 2006 estimates that 60 million suction canisters are sold each year and the estimated market value of canisters is upwards of $120 million.

&#160;

A study by the Lewin Group, prepared for the Health Industry Group Purchasing Association in April 2007, reports that infectious fluid waste accounts for more than 75% of U.S. hospitals biohazard disposal costs. The study also includes findings from a bulletin published by the University of Minnesota&#8217;s Technical Assistance Program. &#8220;A vacuum system that uses reusable canisters or empties directly into the sanitary sewer can help a facility cut its infectious waste volume, and save money on labor, disposal and canister purchase costs.&#8221; The Minnesota&#8217;s Technical Assistance Program bulletin also estimated that, in a typical hospital, &#8220;. . . $75,000 would be saved annually in suction canister purchase, management and disposal cost if a canister-free vacuum system was installed.&#8221;

&#160;

We expect the hospital surgery market to continue to increase due to population growth, the aging of the population, expansion of surgical procedures to new areas, for example, use of the endoscope, which requires more fluid management, and new medical technology.

&#160;

There are currently approximately 40,000 operating rooms and surgical centers in the U.S. (AHA, Hospital Statistics, 2008). The hospital market has typically been somewhat independent of the U.S. economy; therefore we believe that our targeted market is not cyclical, and the demand for our products will not be heavily dependent on the state of the economy. We benefit by having our products address both the procedure market of nearly 51.6 million inpatient procedures (CDC, National Hospital Discharge Survey: 2010 table) as well as the hospital operating room market (approximately 40,000 operating rooms).

&#160;

Current Techniques of Collecting Infectious Fluids 

&#160;

Typically, during the course of the procedure, fluids are continuously removed from the surgical site via wall suction and tubing and collected in large canisters (1,500 - 3,000 milliliters (ml) capacity or 1.5 &#8211; 3.0 liters) adjacent to the surgical table.

&#160;

&#160;

These canisters, made of glass or high impact plastic, have graduated markers on them allowing the surgical team to make estimates of fluid loss in the patient both intra-operatively as well as for post-operative documentation. Fluid contents are retained in the canisters until the procedure is completed or until the canister is full and needs to be removed. During the procedure the surgical team routinely monitors fluid loss using the measurement calibrations on the canister and by comparing these fluid volumes to quantities of saline fluid introduced to provide irrigation of tissue for enhanced visualization and to prevent drying of exposed tissues. After the procedure is completed the fluids contained in the canisters are measured and a calculation of total blood loss is determined. This is done to ensure no excess fluids of any type remain within the body cavity or that no excessive blood loss has occurred, both circumstances that may place the patient at an increased risk post-operatively.

&#160;

Once total blood loss has been calculated, the healthcare personnel must dispose of the fluids. This is typically done by manually transporting the fluids from the operating room to a waste station and directly pouring the material into a sink that drains to the sanitary sewer where it is subsequently treated by the local waste management facility, a process that exposes the healthcare worker to the most risk for direct contact or splash exposure. Once emptied these canisters are placed in large, red pigmented, trash bags and disposed of as infectious waste &#8211; a process commonly referred to as &#8220;red-bagging.&#8221;

&#160;

Alternatively, the canisters may be opened in the operating room and a gel-forming powder is poured into the canister, rendering the material gelatinous. These gelled canisters are then red-bagged in their entirety and removed to a bio-hazardous/infectious holding area for disposal. In larger facilities the canisters, whether pre-treated with gel or not, are often removed to large carts and transported to a separate special handling area where they are processed and prepared for disposal. Material that has been red-bagged is disposed of separately, and more expensively, from other medical and non-medical waste by companies specializing in that method of disposal. 

&#160;

Although all of these protection and disposal techniques are helpful, they represent a piecemeal approach to the problem of safely disposing of infectious fluids and fall short of providing adequate protection for the surgical team and other workers exposed to infectious waste. A major spill of fluid from a canister, whether by direct contact as a result of leakage or breakage, splash associated with the opening of the canister lid to add gel, while pouring liquid contents into a hopper, or during the disposal process, is cause for concern of acute exposure to human blood components&#8211;one of the most serious risks any healthcare worker faces in the performance of his or her job. Once a spill occurs, the entire area must be cleaned and disinfected and the exposed worker faces a potential of infection from bloodborne pathogens. These pathogens include, but are not limited to, Hepatitis B and C, HIV/AIDS, HPV, and other infectious agents. Given the current legal liability environment the hospital, unable to identify at-risk patients due to concerns over patient rights and confidentiality, must treat every exposure incident as a potentially infectious incident and treat the exposed employee according to a specific protocol that is both costly to the facility and stressful to the affected employee and his or her co-workers. In cases of possible exposure to communicable disease, the employee could be placed on paid administrative leave, frequently involving worker&#8217;s compensation, and additional workers must be assigned to cover the affected employee&#8217;s responsibilities. The facility bears the cost of both the loss of the affected worker and the replacement healthcare worker in addition to any ongoing health screening and testing of the affected worker to confirm if any disease has been contracted from the exposure incident. Canisters are the most prevalent means of collecting and disposing of infectious fluids in hospitals today. Traditional, non-powered canisters and related suction and fluid disposable products are exempt and do not require FDA clearance. 

&#160;

We believe that our virtually hands free direct-to-drain technology will (a) significantly reduce the risk of healthcare worker exposure to these infectious fluids by replacing canisters, (b) further reduce the risk of worker exposure when compared to powered canister technology that requires transport to and from the operating room, (c) reduce the cost per procedure for handling these fluids, and (d) enhance the surgical team&#8217;s ability to collect data to accurately assess the patient&#8217;s status during and after procedures.

&#160;

In addition to the traditional canister method of waste fluid disposal, several new powered medical devices have been developed which address some of the deficiencies described above. MD Technologies, Inc., Dornoch Medical Systems, Inc. (Zimmer), and Stryker Instruments have all developed systems that provide for disposal into the sanitary sewer without pouring the infectious fluids directly through a hopper disposal or using expensive gel powders and most are sold with 510(k) concurrence from the FDA. Most of these competing products continue to utilize some variant on the existing canister technology, and while not directly addressing the canister, most have been successful in eliminating the need for expensive gel and its associated handling and disposal costs. Our existing competitors that already have products on the market have a clear competitive advantage over us in terms of brand recognition and market exposure. In addition, the aforementioned companies have extensive marketing and development budgets that could overpower an early stage company like ours. We believe that Stryker Instruments has the dominant market share position. 

&#160;

Products 

&#160; 

The STREAMWAY Fluid Management System (&#8220;FMS&#8221;) 

&#160;

The STREAMWAY FMS suctions surgical waste fluid from the patient using standard surgical tubing. The surgical waste fluid passes through our proprietary disposable filters and into the STREAMWAY FMS. The STREAMWAY FMS maintains continuous suction to the surgical field at all times. A simple, easy to use Human Interface Display screen guides the user through the set up process, ensuring that a safe vacuum level is identified and set by the user for each procedure and additionally guides them through the cleaning process.

&#160;

The STREAMWAY FMS is unique to our industry in that it allows for continuous suction to the surgical field and provides unlimited capacity to the user so no surgical procedure will ever have to be interrupted to change canisters. It is wall mounted and takes up no valuable operating room space.

&#160;

&#160;

The FMS will replace the manual process of collecting fluids in canisters and transporting and dumping in sinks outside of the operating room that is still being used by many hospitals and surgical centers. The manual process, involving canisters, requires that the operating room personnel open the canisters that contain waste fluid, often several liters, at the end of the surgical procedure and either add a solidifying agent or empty the canisters in the hospital drain system. Some facilities require that used canisters be cleaned by staff and reused. It is during these procedures that there is increased potential for contact with the waste fluid through splashing or spills. The FMS eliminates the use of canisters and these cleaning and disposal steps by collecting the waste fluid in the internal collection chamber and automatically disposing of the fluid with no handling by personnel. Each procedure requires the use of a disposable filter. At the end of each procedure, a proprietary cleaning fluid is attached to the FMS and an automatic cleaning cycle ensues, making the FMS ready for the next procedure. The cleaning fluid bottle is attached to the port on the FMS device. The cleaning fluid bottle and its contents are not contaminated and are used to clean the internal fluid pathway in the FMS device to which personnel have no exposure. During the cleaning cycle, the cleaning fluid is pulled from the bottle into the FMS, and then disposed in the same manner as the waste fluid from the surgical case. At the end of the cleaning cycle, the bottle is discarded. The filter and any suction tubing used during the procedure must be disposed of in the same manner as suction tubing used with the canister system. Handling of this tubing does present the potential for personnel exposure but that potential is minimal.

&#160;

We believe our product provides substantial cost savings and improvements in safety in facilities that still use manual processes. In cases where healthcare organizations re-use canisters, the FMS cleaning process eliminates the need for cleaning of canisters for re-use. The FMS reduces the safety issues facing operating room nurses, the cost of the handling process, and the amount of infectious waste generated when the traditional method of disposing of canisters is used. The FMS is fully automated, does not require transport to and from the operating room and eliminates any canister that requires emptying. We believe it is positioned to penetrate its market segment due to its virtually hands free operation, simple design, ease of use, continuous suction, continuous flow, unlimited capacity and efficiency in removal of infectious waste with minimal exposure of operating room personnel to potentially infectious material.

&#160;

In contrast to competitive products, the wall-mounted FMS does not take up any operating room floor space and it does not require the use of any external canisters or handling by operating room personnel. It does require a dedicated system in each operating room where it is to be used. The FMS is the only known direct-to-drain system that is wall-mounted and designed to collect, measure and dispose of, surgical waste. Other systems on the market are portable, meaning that they are rolled to the bedside for the surgical case and then rolled to a cleaning area, after the surgery is complete, and use canisters, which still require processing or require a secondary device (such as a docking station) to dispose of the fluid in the sanitary sewer after it has been collected. They are essentially powered canisters. A comparison of the key features of the devices currently marketed and the FMS is presented in the table below.

The FMS system may be installed on or in the wall during new construction or renovation or installed in a current operating room by connecting the device to the hospital&#8217;s existing sanitary sewer drain and wall suction systems. With new construction or renovation, the system will be placed in the wall and the incremental costs are minimal, limited to connectors to the hospital drain and suction systems (which systems are already required in an operating room), the construction of a frame to hold the FMS in position, and minimal labor. The fluid collection chamber is internal to the FMS unit and requires no separate installation. Based upon our consultations with several architects, we believe that there is no appreciable incremental expense in planning for the FMS system during construction.

&#160;

For on-the-wall installation in a current operating room, the location of the FMS may be chosen based on proximity to the existing hospital drain and suction systems. Installation will require access to those systems through the wall and connection to the systems in a manner similar to that for within-the-wall installation. The FMS system is mounted on the wall using a mounting bracket supplied with the system and standard stud or drywall attachments.

&#160;

Once installed, the FMS has inflow ports positioned on the front of the device that effectively replace the current wall suction ports most commonly used to remove fluids during surgery. Additionally, a disposable external filter, which is provided as part of our disposable cleaning kit, allows for expansion to additional inflow suction ports by utilizing one or two dual port filters.

&#160;

&#160;

Although the FMS is directly connected to the sanitary sewer, helping to reduce potential exposure to infectious fluids, it is possible that installation of the system will temporarily cause inconvenience and lost productivity as the operating rooms will need to be taken off line temporarily.

&#160;

One of the current techniques utilized by Stryker, Cardinal Health, and other smaller companies typically utilizes two to eight canisters positioned on the floor or on elaborate rolling containers with tubing connected to the hospital suction system and to the operative field. Once the waste fluids are collected, they must be transported out of the operating room and disposed of using various methods. These systems take up floor space in and around the operating room and require additional handling by hospital personnel, thereby increasing the risk of exposure to infectious waste fluids generated by the operating room procedure. Handling infectious waste in this manner is also more costly.

&#160;

&#160;

A summary of the features of the wall unit include:

&#160;

&#160; &#183; Minimal Human Interaction . The wall-mounted FMS provides a small internal reservoir that keeps surgical waste isolated from medical personnel and disposes the medical waste directly into the hospital sanitary sewer with minimal medical personnel interaction. This minimal interaction is facilitated by the automated electronic controls and computerized LCD touch-screen allowing for simple and safe single touch operation of the FMS. &#160;

&#160; &#183; Fluid Measurement . The STREAMWAY System volume measurement allows for in-process, accurate measurement of blood/saline suctioned during the operative procedure, and eliminates much of the estimation of fluid loss currently practiced in the operating room. This is particularly important in minimally invasive surgical procedures, where accounting for all fluids, including saline added for the procedure, is vital to the operation. The surgical team can also view in real time the color of the extracted or evacuated fluid through the viewing window on the system. &#160;

&#160; &#183; Cleaning Solution . A bottle of cleaning solution, proprietary to and sold by us, is used for the automated cleaning cycle at the conclusion of each procedure and prepares the STREAMWAY FMS for the next use, reducing operating room turnover time. The cleaning solution is intended to clean the internal tubing, pathways, and chamber within the system. The cleaning solution bottle is easily attached to the STREAMWAY FMS by inserting the bottle into the mount located on the front of the unit and inverting the bottle. The automated cleaning process takes less than five minutes and requires minimal staff intervention. The disposable cleaning fluid bottle collapses at the end of the cleaning cycle rendering it unusable; therefore it cannot be refilled with any other solution. The instructions for use clearly state that our cleaning fluid, and only our cleaning fluid, must be used with the STREAMWAY FMS following each surgical case. The warranty is voided if any other solution is used. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#183; Procedure Filters. One or two filters, depending on the type of procedure, will be used for every surgical procedure. The filter has been developed by us, is proprietary to the STREAMWAY FMS and is only sold by us. The filter is a two port, bifurcated, disposable filter that contains a tissue trap that allows staff to capture a tissue sample and send to pathology if needed. The filters are disposed of after each procedure. The cleaning fluid and filter are expected to be a substantial revenue generator for the life of the STREAMWAY FMS. &#160; &#160;

&#160; &#183; Ease of Use . The FMS simply connects to the existing suction tubing from the operative field (causing no change to the current operative methods). Pressing the START button on the FMS touch screen enacts a step by step instruction with safety questions ensuring that the correct amount of suction is generated minimizing the learning curve for operation at the surgical site. &#160;

&#160; &#183; Installation . We will arrange installation of the FMS products through a partnership or group of partnerships. Such partnerships will include, but not be limited to, local plumbers, distribution partners, manufacturer's representatives, hospital supply companies and the like. We will train our partners and standardize the procedure to ensure the seamless installation of our products. The FMS is designed for minimal interruption of operating room and surgical room utilization. Plug-and-play features of the design allow for almost immediate connection and hook up to hospital utilities for wall-mounted units allowing for quick start-up post-installation. &#160;

&#160; &#183; Sales Channel Partners . The FMS is sold to end-users through a combination of independent stocking distributors, manufacturer&#8217;s representatives, and direct sales personnel. We intend for all personnel involved in direct contact with the end-user will have extensive training and will be approved by Skyline. We plan to maintain exclusive agreements between Skyline and the sales channel partners outlining stocking expectations, sales objectives, target accounts and the like. Contractual agreements with the sales channel partners will be reviewed on an annual basis and expect that such agreements will contain provisions allowing them to be terminated at any time by Skyline based on certain specified conditions. &#160;

&#160; &#183; Competitive Pricing . The list sales price to a hospital or surgery center is $21,900 per system (one per operating room - installation extra) and $24 per unit retail for the proprietary consumable kit to the U.S. hospital market. &#160;

&#160;

Intellectual Property 

&#160;

We believe that in order to maintain a competitive advantage in the marketplace, we must develop and maintain protection of the proprietary aspects of our technology. We rely on a combination of patent, trade secret and other intellectual property rights and measures to protect our intellectual property.

&#160;

We spent approximately $261,000 in 2015 and $394,000 in 2014 on research and development. On January 25, 2014 the Company filed a non-provisional PCT Application No. PCT/US2014/013081 claiming priority from the U.S. Provisional Patent Application, number 61756763 which was filed one year earlier on January 25, 2013. The Patent Cooperation Treaty (&#8220;PCT&#8221;) allows an applicant to file a single patent application to seek patent protection for an invention simultaneously in each of the 148 member countries of the PCT, including the United States. By filing this single &#8220;international&#8221; patent application through the PCT system, it is easier and more cost effective than filing separate applications directly with each national or regional patent office in the various countries in which patent protection is desired.

&#160;

Our PCT patent application is for an enhanced model of the surgical fluid waste management system. We utilize this enhanced technology in the updated version of the STREAMWAY FMS unit we began selling in the first quarter of 2014. We obtained a favorable International Search Report from the PCT searching authority indicating that the claims in our PCT application are patentable (i.e., novel and non-obvious) over the cited prior art. A feature claimed in the PCT application is the ability to maintain continuous suction to the surgical field while simultaneously measuring, recording and evacuating fluid to the facilities sewer drainage system. This provides for continuous operation of the STREAMWAY FMS unit in suctioning waste fluids, which means that suction is not interrupted during a surgical operation, for example, to empty a fluid collection container or otherwise dispose of the collected fluid. We believe that this continuous operation and unlimited capacity feature provides us with a significant competitive advantage, particularly on large fluid generating procedures. All competing products, except certain models of MD Technologies, have a finite fluid collection capacity necessitating that the device be emptied when capacity is reached during the surgical procedure. In the case of MD Technologies while some of their models may have an unlimited capacity their process is not truly continuous like the Company&#8217;s system because it requires switching the vacuum containers when one becomes full. For example, when the first container becomes full, the vacuum is switched over to a second container in order to collect the fluid in the second container while the fluid in the first container is drained. When the second container becomes full, the vacuum is again switched back to the first container to collect fluid while the second container is drained, and so on. Even though the switching of the vacuum between containers is automated in certain MD Technology models, the automated switching is still believed to result in brief interruptions or reductions in suction during the surgical procedure.

&#160;

The Company holds the following granted patents in the United States, and a pending application in the United States on its earlier models: US7469727, US8123731 and US Publication No. US20090216205 (collectively, the &#8220;Patents&#8221;). These Patents will begin to expire on August 8, 2023.

&#160;

In general, the Patents are directed to a system and method for collecting waste fluid from a surgical procedure while ensuring there is no interruption of suction during the surgical procedure and no limit on the volume of waste fluid which can be collected. More particularly, the Patents claim a system and method in which waste fluid is suctioned or drawn into holding tanks connected to a vacuum source which maintains a constant negative pressure in the holding tanks. When the waste fluid collected in the holding tanks reaches a predetermined level, the waste fluid is measured and pumped from the holding tanks while maintaining the negative pressure. Therefore, because the negative pressure is maintained in the holding tanks, waste fluid will continue to be drawn into the holding tanks while the waste fluid is being pumped from the holding tanks. Thus, there is no limit to the volume of waste fluid which can be collected, and the suction at the surgical site is never interrupted during the surgical procedure.

&#160;

We also rely upon trade secrets, continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our trade secrets and proprietary know-how, in part, with confidentiality agreements with employees, although we cannot be certain that the agreements will not be breached, or that we will have adequate remedies for any breach.

&#160;

The Disposable Kit 

&#160;

The disposable kit is an integral, critical component of the FMS and our total value proposition to the customer. It consists of a proprietary, pre-measured amount of cleaning solution in a plastic bottle that attaches to the FMS. The disposal cleaning kit also includes an in-line filter with single or multiple suction ports. The proprietary cleaning solution placed in the specially designed holder is attached and recommended to be used following each surgical procedure. Due to the nature of the fluids and particles removed during surgical procedures, the FMS is recommended to be cleaned following each use. Utilizing the available vacuum of the wall system, the proprietary cleaning fluid is drawn into the FMS to provide a highly effective cleaning process that breaks up bio-film at the cellular level. Proper cleaning is required for steady, dependable and repeated FMS performance and for maintenance of the warranty of the FMS.

&#160;

Our disposables are a critical component of our business model. The disposables have the &#8220;razor blade business model&#8221; characteristic with an ongoing stream of revenue for every FMS unit installed, and revenues from the sale of the kits are expected to be significantly higher over time than the revenues from the sales of the unit. Our disposable, dual use filter is designed specifically for use only on our FMS. The filter is used only once per procedure followed by immediate disposal. Our operation instructions and warranty require that our filter is used for every procedure. There are no known off the shelf filters that will fit our FMS. We have developed a more effective and cost efficient filter, with intent to patent. We have exclusive distribution rights to the disposable fluid and facilitate the use of only our fluid for cleaning following procedures by incorporating a special adapter to connect the fluid to the connector on the FMS system. We will also tie the fluid usage, which we will keep track of with the FMS software, to the product warranty. While it could be possible for other manufacturers to provide fluids for utilization in this process, it would require that they manufacture an adapter compatible with our connector on the FMS, obtain a container that fits in the specially designed container holder on the FMS and perform testing to demonstrate that any other fluid would not damage the FMS. We believe that these barriers and the warranty control will allow us to achieve substantial revenue from our cleaning fluid, if we are able to sell a substantial number of FMS units. The instructions for use that accompanies the product will clearly state how the fluid is to be hooked up to the FMS machine. Further, a diagram on the FMS will also assist the user in attaching the fluid bottle to the machine. This will be a very simple task, and we do not anticipate that any training of operating room staff will be necessary.

&#160;

&#160;

All installations of our FMS product have been completed by either a hospital appointed service technician or a service and maintenance organization that is familiar with completing such installations in health care settings. We are exploring entering into an arrangement with one or more provider&#8217;s to provide installation services.

&#160; 

Corporate Strategy 

&#160;

Our strategy is focused on expansion within our core product and market segments, while utilizing a progressive approach to manufacturing and marketing to ensure maximum flexibility and profitability.

&#160;

Our strategy is to:

&#160;

&#160; &#183; Develop a complete line of wall-mounted fluid evacuation systems for use in hospital operating rooms, radiological rooms and free standing surgery centers as well as clinics and physicians&#8217; offices. Initially, we have developed the FMS to work in hospital operating rooms and surgical centers. This device was developed for use with the wall vacuum suction currently installed in hospitals. Opportunities for future products include an FMS developed for post-operation and recovery rooms with multiple inlet ports and multiple volume measurements that may incorporate an on-board vacuum supply. &#160;

&#160; &#183; Provide products that greatly reduce healthcare worker and patient exposure to harmful materials present in infectious fluids and that contribute to an adverse working environment. As one of the only stand-alone surgical fluid disposal systems directly connected to the sanitary sewer, the FMS could advance the manner in which such material is collected, measured and disposed of in operating rooms, post-operating recovery, emergency rooms and intensive care settings by eliminating the need to transport a device to the patient bedside and remove it for emptying and cleaning at the end of the procedure. We believe the cost of such exposures, measured in terms of human suffering, disease management costs, lost productivity, liability or litigation, will be, when properly leveraged, the strongest motivating factor for facilities looking at investing in the FMS line of products. &#160;

&#160; &#183; Utilize existing medical products independent distributors and manufacturer&#8217;s representatives to achieve the desired market penetration. Contacts have been established with several existing medical products distributors and manufacturer&#8217;s representatives and interest has been generated regarding the sales of the FMS and cleaning kits. &#160;

&#160; &#183; Continue to utilize operating room consultants, builders and architects as referrals to hospitals and day surgery centers. To date, the STREAMWAY System has achieved market acceptance through the installation of more than seventy-nine (79) FMS systems. The product has received numerous references from users and was also recognized by LifeScience Alley as a top ten finalist in their new technology showcase. Additionally, Skyline has become a member of Practice Greenhealth; highlighting the positive environmental impact of the STREAMWAY System. &#160;

&#160;

Other strategies may also include:

&#160; 

&#160; o Employing a lean operating structure, while utilizing the latest trends and technologies in manufacturing and marketing, to achieve both market share growth and projected profitability. &#160; 

&#160; o Providing a leasing program and/or &#8220;pay per use&#8221; program as alternatives to purchasing. &#160; 

&#160; o Providing service contracts to establish an additional revenue stream. &#160; 

&#160; o Utilizing the manufacturing experience of our management team to develop sources of supply and manufacturing to reduce costs while still obtaining excellent quality. While cost is not a major consideration in the roll-out of leading edge products, we believe that being a low-cost provider will be important long term. &#160;

&#160; o Offering an innovative warranty program that is contingent on the exclusive use of our disposable kit to enhance the success of our after-market disposable products. &#160;

Technology and Competition 

&#160;

Fluid Management for Surgical Procedures 

&#160;

The management of surgical waste fluids produced during and after surgery is a complex mix of materials and labor that consists of primary collection of fluid from the patient, transportation of the waste fluid within the hospital to a disposal or processing site and disposal of that waste either via incineration or in segregated landfills.

&#160;

&#160;

Once the procedure has ended, the canisters currently being used in many cases, and their contents must be removed from the operating room and disposed. There are several methods used for such disposal, all of which present certain risks to the operating room team, the crews who clean the rooms following the procedure and the other personnel involved in their final disposal. These methods include:

&#160;

&#160; &#183; Direct Disposal Through the Sanitary Sewer. In virtually all municipalities, the disposal of liquid blood may be done directly to the sanitary sewer where it is treated by the local waste management facility. This practice is approved and recommended by the EPA. In most cases these municipalities specifically request that disposed bio-materials not be treated with any known anti-bacterial agents such as glutalderhyde, as these agents not only neutralize potentially infectious agents but also work to defeat the bacterial agents employed by the waste treatment facilities themselves. Disposal through this method is fraught with potential exposure to the service workers, putting them at risk for direct contact with these potentially infectious agents through spillage of the contents or via splash when the liquid is poured into a hopper &#8211; a specially designated sink for the disposal of infectious fluids. Once the infectious fluids are disposed of into the hopper, the empty canister is sent to central processing for re-sterilization (glass and certain plastics) or for disposal with the bio-hazardous/infectious waste generated by the hospital (red-bagged). &#160;

&#160; &#183; Conversion to Gel for Red-Bag Disposal. In many hospital systems the handling of this liquid waste has become a liability issue due to worker exposure incidents and in some cases has even been a point of contention during nurse contract negotiations. Industry has responded to concerns of nurses over splash and spillage contamination by developing a powder that, when added to the fluid in the canisters, produces a viscous, gel-like substance that can be handled more safely. After the case is completed and final blood loss is calculated, a port on the top of each canister is opened and the powder is poured into it. It takes several minutes for the gel to form, after which the canisters are placed on a service cart and removed to the red-bag disposal area for disposal with the other infectious waste. There are four major drawbacks to this system: &#160;

&#160; &#183; It does not ensure protection for healthcare workers, as there remains the potential for splash when the top of the canister is opened. &#160;

&#160; &#183; Based on industry pricing data, the total cost per canister increases by approximately $2.00. &#160;

&#160; &#183; Disposal costs to the hospital increase dramatically as shipping, handling and landfill costs are based upon weight rather than volume in most municipalities. The weight of an empty 2,500 ml canister is about 1 pound. A canister and its gelled contents weigh about 7.5 pounds, and the typical cost to dispose of medical waste is approximately $.30 - $.50 per pound. &#160;

&#160; &#183; The canister filled with gelled fluid must be disposed; it cannot be cleaned and re-sterilized for future use. &#160;

Despite the increased cost of using gel and the marginal improvement in healthcare worker protection it provides, several hospitals have adopted gel as their standard procedure.

&#160;

Drainage Systems 

&#160;

Several new medical devices have been developed which address some of the deficiencies described above. MD Technologies, Inc., Cardinal Health, Inc., Dornoch Medical Systems, Inc. (now Zimmer) and Stryker Instruments have all developed systems that provide disposal into the sanitary sewer without pouring the infectious fluids directly through a hopper disposal or using expensive gel powders. All of these newer products are currently sold with 510(k) exempt concurrence from the FDA. Most of these competing products incorporate an internal collection canister with finite capacity, and while not directly eliminating the need to transport a device to and from the surgical room, we believe most have been successful in eliminating the need for expensive gel and its associated handling and disposal costs.

&#160;

Existing competitors, that already have products on the market, have a competitive advantage in terms of brand recognition and market exposure. In addition, the aforementioned companies have extensive marketing and development budgets that could overpower an early stage company like ours.

&#160;

We believe that Stryker Instruments has the dominant market share position. We also believe competing products are used in select procedures and often in some, but not all, surgical procedures.

&#160; 

Current Competition, Technology, and Costs 

&#160;

Single Use Canisters 

&#160;

In the U.S., glass reusable containers are infrequently used as their high initial cost, frequent breakage and costs of reprocessing are typically more costly than single use high impact plastic canisters, even when disposal is factored in. Each single use glass canister costs roughly $8.00 each while the high impact plastic canisters cost $2.00 - $3.00 each and it is estimated that a range of two to eight canisters are used in each procedure, depending on the operation.

&#160;

Our FMS would replace the use of canisters and render them unnecessary, as storage and disposal would be performed automatically by the FMS. It should be noted that these canisters are manufactured by companies with substantially more resources than our Company. Cardinal Health, a very significant competitor, manufactures both single use canisters as well as a more automated fluid handling system that compete with us. Accordingly, faced with this significant competition, we may have difficulty penetrating this market. Our true competitive advantage, however, is our unlimited capacity, eliminating the need for any high volume cases to be interrupted for canister changeover.

&#160; 

&#160;

Solidifying Gel Powder 

&#160;

The market potential for solidifying gel was estimated by industry publications at over $100 million in 2002. This market is not yet fully realized, but many hospitals, responding to increased concerns over inadvertent worker exposure to liquid waste, are converting to this technology. It is clear that solidifying gels, while not providing complete freedom from exposure to healthcare workers do present a level of safety and peace of mind to the healthcare workers who handle gel-treated canisters. While several gel manufacturers proclaim that sterility of the contents is achieved with the use of their product, protocols continue to recommend that the red-bag procedure is followed when using these products. One significant drawback of the solidifying gels is that they increase the weight of the materials being sent to the landfill by a factor of five to seven times, resulting in a significant cost increase to the hospitals that elect to use the solidifying gels.

&#160;

The FMS eliminates the need for solidifying gel, providing savings in both gel powder usage and associated landfill costs.

&#160;

Sterilization and Landfill Disposal 

&#160;

Current disposal methods include the removal of the contaminated canisters (with or without the solidifying gel) to designated biohazardous/infectious waste sites. Previously many hospitals used incineration as the primary means of disposal, but environmental concerns at the international, domestic and local level have resulted in a systematic decrease in incineration worldwide as a viable method for disposing of blood, organs or materials saturated with bodily fluids. When landfill disposal is used, canisters are included in the general red-bag disposal and, when gel is used, comprise a significant weight factor. Where hopper disposal is still in use, most of the contents of the red-bag consist only of outer packaging of supplies used in surgery and small amounts of absorbent materials impregnated with blood and other waste fluid. These, incidentally, are retained and measured at the end of the procedure to provide a more accurate assessment of fluid loss or retention. Once at the landfill site, the red-bagged material is often steam-sterilized with the remaining waste being ground up and interred into a specially segregated waste dumpsite.

&#160;

Handling Costs 

&#160;

Once the surgical team has finished the procedure, and a blood loss estimate is calculated, the liquid waste (with or without solidifying gels) is removed from the operating room and either disposed of down the sanitary sewer or transported to an infectious waste area of the hospital for later removal.

&#160;

The FMS would significantly reduce the labor costs associated with the disposal of fluid or handling of contaminated canisters, as the liquid waste is automatically emptied into the sanitary sewer after measurements are obtained. We utilize the same suction tubing currently being used in the operating room, so no additional cost is incurred with our process. While each hospital handles fluid disposal differently, we believe that the cost of our cleaning fluid after each procedure will be less than the current procedural cost that could include the cost of canisters, labor to transport the canisters, solidifying powder, gloves, gowns, mops, goggles, shipping, and transportation, as well as any costs associated with spills that may occur due to manual handling.

&#160;

A hidden but very real and considerable handling cost is the cost of infectious fluid exposure. A July 2007 research article published in Infection Control Hospital Epidemiology concluded that &#8220;Management of occupational exposures to blood and bodily fluids is costly; the best way to avoid these costs is by prevention of exposures.&#8221; According to the article, hospital management cost associated with occupational blood exposure can, conservatively, be more than $4,500 per exposure. Because of privacy laws, it is difficult to obtain estimates of exposure events at individual facilities; however, in each exposure the healthcare worker must be treated as a worse case event. This puts the healthcare worker through a tremendous amount of personal trauma, and the health care facility through considerable expense and exposure to liability and litigation.

&#160;

Nursing Labor 

&#160;

Nursing personnel spend significant time in the operating room readying canisters for use, calculating blood loss and removing or supervising the removal of the contaminated canisters after each procedure. Various estimates have been made, our management team estimates that the average nursing team spends twenty minutes pre-operatively and intra-operatively setting up, monitoring fluid levels and changing canisters as needed and twenty minutes post-operatively readying blood loss estimates or disposing of canisters. Estimates for the other new technologies reviewed have noted few cost savings to nursing labor.

&#160;

The FMS would save nursing time as compared to the manual process of collecting and disposing of surgical waste. Set-up is as easy as attaching the suction tube to the inflow port of the FMS. Post-operative clean-up requires approximately five minutes, the time required to dispose of the suction tubing and disposable filter to the red-bag, calculate the patient&#8217;s blood loss, attach the bottle of cleaning solution to the inlet port of the unit, initiate the cleaning cycle, and dispose of the emptied cleaning solution. The steps that our product avoids, which are typically involved with the manual disposal process include, canister setup, interpretation of an analog read out for calculating fluid, canister management during the case (i.e. swapping out full canisters), and then temporarily storing, transferring, dumping, and properly disposing of the canisters.

&#160;

&#160;

Competitive Products 

&#160; 

Disposable canister system technology for fluid management within the operating room has gone virtually unchanged for decades. As concern for the risk of exposure of healthcare workers to bloodborne pathogens, and the costs associated with canister systems has increased, market attention has increasingly turned toward fluid management. The first quarter of 2001 saw the introduction of four new product entries within the infectious material control field. Stryker Instruments introduced the &#8220;NeptuneTM&#8221; system, offering a combination of bio-aerosol and fluid management in a portable two-piece system; Waterstone Medical (now DeRoyal) introduced the &#8220;Aqua BoxTM&#8221; stationary system for fluid disposal; Cardinal Health introduced the Orwell Fluid Collection and Disposal System; and Dornoch Medical Systems, Inc. (Zimmer) introduced the &#8220;Red AwayTM&#8221; stationary system for fluid collection and disposal. All companies, regardless of size, have their own accessory kits.

&#160;

We differentiate from these competitors since we are completely direct-to-drain and have the most automatic, hands-free process of any of the systems currently on the market. Each of our competitors, with the exception of MD Technologies, Inc., has some significant manual handling involved in the process. For instance, some competing products require transport of the mobile unit to a docking port and then emptying of the fluid, while others require that the canister be manually transported to a more efficient dumping station. Regardless, most of our competitors require more human interaction with the fluid than our products do. Please refer to the chart included in the section headed as Products for a comparison of the key features of the devices currently marketed and the FMS.

&#160;

Although the mobility associated with most of the competing products adds time and labor to the process and increases the chance of worker exposure to waste fluids, it also allows the hospital to purchase only as many mobile units needed for simultaneous procedures in multiple operating rooms. With the FMS, a unit must be purchased and installed in each room where it is intended to be used.

&#160;

Marketing and Sales 

&#160;

Distribution 

&#160;

We sell the FMS and procedure disposables through various methods that include a direct sales force and independent distributors covering the vast majority of major U.S. markets. Currently we have one regional manager selling, and demoing the FMS for prospective customers and distributors, as well as, supporting our current customer base for disposable resupply. We are close to signing contracts with various hospital purchasing groups and signed on independent distributors. Our targeted customer base includes nursing administration, operating room managers, CFOs, CEOs, risk management, and infection control. Other professionals with an interest in the product include physicians, nurses, biomedical engineering, anesthetists, imaging, anesthesiologists, human resources, legal, administration and housekeeping.

&#160;

The major focus of our marketing efforts will be to introduce the FMS as a standalone device capable of effectively removing infectious waste and disposing of it automatically while providing accurate measurement of fluids removed, and also limiting exposure of the surgical team and healthcare support staff.

&#160;

Governmental and professional organizations have become increasingly aggressive in attempting to minimize the risk of exposure by medical personnel to bloodborne pathogens. We believe that the FMS provides a convenient and cost effective way to collect and dispose of this highly contaminated material.

&#160;

Our distributors may have installation and service capability, or we will contract those functions with an independent service/maintenance company. We have hired both distributors and service companies regarding these installation requirements. We have established extensive training and standards for the service and installation of the FMS to ensure consistency and dependability in the field. Users of the system require a minimal amount of training to operate the FMS. The instructions for use and the installation guide are included with every system along with a quick start guide, a troubleshooting manual and an on-board PLC controlling an intuitive touch screen with step by step instruction and safety features.

&#160;

We have structured our pricing and relationships with distributors and/or service companies to ensure that these entities receive at least a typical industry level compensation for their activities.

&#160;

Promotion 

&#160;

The dangers of exposure to infectious fluid waste are well recognized in the medical community. It is our promotional strategy to effectively educate medical staff regarding the risks of contamination using current waste collection procedures and the advantages of the FMS in protecting medical personnel from inadvertent exposure. We intend to leverage this medical awareness and concern with education of regulatory agencies at the local, state and federal levels about the advantages of the FMS.

&#160;

We supplement our sales efforts with a promotional mix that include a number of printed materials, video support and a website. We believe our greatest challenge lies in reaching and educating the 1.6 million medical personnel who are exposed daily to fluid waste in the operating room or in other healthcare settings (OSHA, CPL 2-2.44C). These efforts require utilizing single page selling pieces, video educational pieces for technical education, use of scientific journal articles and a webpage featuring product information, educational materials, and training sites.

&#160;

&#160;

We support our sales organization by attending major scientific meetings where large numbers of potential users are in attendance. The theme of our trade show booths focus on education, the awareness of the hazards of infectious waste fluids and the Company&#8217;s innovative solution to the problem. We have focused our efforts initially on the Association of Operating Room Nurses (&#8220;AORN&#8221;) meetings, where the largest concentration of potential buyers and influencers are in attendance and the Radiological Society of North America Scientific Assembly and Annual Meeting. We have partnered with the Association for Radiologic &#38; Imaging Nursing (&#8220;ARIN&#8221;) and will be presenting in their April 2016 annual educational conference in Vancouver, British Columbia. We feature information on protection of the healthcare worker on our website as well as links to other relevant sites. We have invested in limited journal advertising for targeted audiences that have been fully identified. The initial thrust focuses on features of the product and ways of contacting the Company via the webpage or directly through postage paid cards or direct contact. Additionally, we will create a press release distribution to clinician-oriented periodicals for inclusion in their new product development columns. These periodicals will provide the reader with an overview of the FMS and will direct readers to pursue more information by direct contact with us by accessing our webpage.

&#160; 

Pricing 

&#160;

We believe prices for the FMS and its disposable procedure kit reflect a substantial cost savings to hospitals compared to their long-term procedure costs. Our pricing strategy ensures that the customer realizes actual cost savings when using the FMS versus replacing traditional canisters, considering the actual costs of the canisters and associated costs such as biohazard processing labor and added costs of biohazard waste disposal. Suction tubing that is currently used in the operating room will continue to be used with our system and should not be considered in the return on investment equation. Our cleaning solution&#8217;s bottle is completely recyclable, and the selling price of the fluid is built into our cost analysis. In contrast, an operation using traditional disposal methods will often produce multiple canisters destined for biohazard processing. Once the canister has touched blood, it is considered &#8220;red bag&#8221; biohazard waste, whereas the cleaning fluid bottle used in the FMS can be recycled or disposed with the rest of the facility&#8217;s plastics. 

&#160;

The FMS lists for $21,900 per system (one per operating room &#8211; installation extra) and $24 per unit retail for the proprietary disposable kit to the U.S. hospital market. By comparison, the disposal system of Stryker Instruments, one of our competitors, retails for approximately $25,000 plus an $8,000 docking station and requires a disposable component with an approximate cost of $25 per procedure and a proprietary cleaning fluid (cost unknown per procedure). Per procedure cost of the traditional disposal process includes approximate costs of $2 - $3.00 per liter canister, plus solidifier at $2 per liter canister, plus the biohazard premium disposal cost approximated at $1.80 per liter canister. In addition, the labor, gloves, gowns, goggles, and other related material handling costs are also disposal expenses.

&#160;

Installation is done by distributors, independent contractors, or in-house engineering at an estimated price of $300 - $1,000, depending on the operating room. Installation of the FMS requires access only to the hospital&#8217;s sanitary sewer, vacuum suction, and electricity. To help facilities maintain their utilization rates, we recommend installation during off peak hours. In smaller facilities, an outside contractor may be called in, while larger institutions have their own installation and maintenance workforce. Installation time should not seriously impact the use of the operating room. Each FMS has an industry standard warranty period that can be extended through documented use of our disposables: one filter and one bottle of cleaning solution per procedure.

&#160;

Engineering and Manufacturing 

&#160;

We are currently manufacturing the FMS in a leased facility. We have the capability to manufacture, test, house, ship and receive from our warehouse. We contracted a manufacturing company, Wair Products in Bloomington, Minnesota that meets our standards and requirements that can produce six times the amount of FMS systems produced in-house at our facility on a monthly basis as sales increase.

&#160;

The disposables, including a bottle of proprietary cleaning solution and an in-line filter, is sourced through Diversified Manufacturing Corporation (cleaning solution) situated in Newport, Minnesota and MPP Corporation (filters), located in Osceola, Wisconsin that has tooled to manufacture our own newly designed disposable filter. We are pursuing intellectual property protection for these disposable products as well.

&#160;

Government Regulation 

&#160;

To date, no regulatory agency has established exclusive jurisdiction over the area of biohazardous and infectious waste in healthcare facilities. Several organizations maintain oversight function concerning various aspects of pertinent technologies and methods of protection.

&#160;

These agencies include:

&#160;

&#160; &#8226; OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health Administration) &#160;

&#160; &#8226; EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) &#160;

&#160; &#8226; DOT (Department of Transportation) &#160;

&#160; &#8226; JCAHO (Joint Commission of Accreditation of Hospitals) &#160;

&#160; &#8226; NFPA (National Fire Protection Association) &#160;

&#160; &#8226; AIA (American Institute of Architects) &#160;

&#160; &#8226; AORN (Association of Operating Room Nurses) &#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Application for Electrical Safety Testing and Certification 

&#160;

We sought and achieved testing and certification to the IEC 60606-1 and IEC 60606-1-2, two internationally recognized standards.

&#160;

The 6060101 &#38; 60601-2 2 nd edition certification for our STREAMWAY FMS is valid and enables us to continue to market and sell our product domestically.

&#160;

A new standard; IEC 60601-1 3rd Edition Medical Device Safety Testing was adopted by the International Organization of Standards in 2005 and had a compliance date of June 2012 for OUS and December 31, 2013 for the U.S. This standard, which is now recognized by the U.S. FDA, includes a provision of risk management which the 2 nd edition did not require. The purpose of these rules is to ensure that equipment manufacturers have safety, performance, and risk management control measures in place.

&#160;

The EU &#38; Canada required 60601-1 3 rd Edition compliance for all product sold or currently on the market after June 2013. Any product that had previously been certified to the 60601-1 2 nd generation standard was no longer allowed for use as the old standard was no longer recognized. This did not affect us as we did not sell internationally.

&#160;

The U.S. FDA compliance date to meet the new standard was December 31, 2013. The major difference between the U.S. and the EU &#38; Canadian market transition to the new standard is that the U.S. allows the 60601-1 2 nd edition testing to be grandfathered in, allowing previously certified product to remain on the market. Any new product that will be tested after December 31, 2013 should be certified to the new 60601-1 3 rd generation standard.

&#160;

FDA Clearance under Section 510(k) 

&#160;

The FDA Center for Devices and Radiological Health requires 510(k) submitters to provide information that compares its new device to a marketed device of a similar type, in order to determine whether the device is substantially equivalent (&#8220;SE&#8221;).

&#160;

This means that a manufacturer can submit a 510(k) comparing a new device to a device that has been found to be SE and the FDA can use this as evidence to determine whether the new device is SE to an already legally marketed device (or a &#8220;predicate device&#8221;). The ultimate burden of demonstrating the substantial equivalence of a new device to a predicate device remains with the 510(k) submitter, and in those occasions when the Center for Devices and Radiological Health is unfamiliar with certain aspects of the predicate device, the submitter will be required to provide information that substantiates a claim of substantial equivalence.

&#160;

As a matter of practice, the Center for Devices and Radiological Health generally considers a device to be SE to a predicate device if, in comparison to the predicate device, (i) the new device has the same intended use, (ii) the new device has the same technological characteristics (i.e., same materials design, energy source), (iii) the new device has new technological characteristics that could not affect safety or effectiveness, or (iv) the new device has new technological characteristics that could affect safety or effectiveness, but there are accepted scientific methods for evaluating whether safety or effectiveness has been adversely affected and there is data to demonstrate that the new technological features have not diminished safety or effectiveness. Pre-market notification submissions are designed to facilitate these determinations.

&#160;

The FDA requires, pursuant to a final regulation for Establishment Registration and Device Listing for Manufacturers of Devices, that a 510(k) premarket notification be submitted at least ninety days before marketing a device that: (1) is being introduced into distribution for the first time by that person or entity, or (2) is in distribution but is being significantly modified in design or use. A 510(k) submission must contain, among other things: (i) proposed labeling sufficient to describe the device&#8217;s intended use; (ii) a description of how the device is similar to or different from other devices of comparable type, or information about what consequences a proposed device modification may have on the device's safety and effectiveness; and (iii) any other information necessary to determine whether the device is substantially equivalent. The FMS is a Class II device, which is less stringently reviewed as that of a Class III device. Our COO has numerous years&#8217; significant experience in the FDA clearance process and has a team of regulatory consultants with significant experience in the FDA clearance process.

&#160;

We filed the 510(k) submission for clearance of the FMS device on March 14, 2009 and received written confirmation on April 1, 2009 that our 510(k) has been cleared by the FDA.

&#160;

Following this 510(k) clearance by the FDA, we continue to be subject to the normal ongoing audits and reviews by the FDA and other governing agencies. These audits and reviews are standard and typical in the medical device industry, and we do not anticipate being affected by any extraordinary guidelines or regulations.

&#160;

&#160;

Employees
