 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

Overview 

We are a Maryland corporation, formed in October 1994, that has elected to be taxed as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. We are a fully integrated, self-administered, and self-managed urban office REIT. We are the largest and leading urban office REIT uniquely focused on collaborative science and technology campuses in AAA innovation clusters locations. We consider AAA locations to be highly desirable for tenancy by science and technology entities because of their close proximity to concentrations of specialized skills, knowledge, institutions, and related businesses. Such locations are generally characterized by high barriers to entry for new landlords, high barriers to exit for tenants, and a limited supply of available space. Founded in 1994, Alexandria pioneered this niche and has since established a dominant market presence in key locations, including Greater Boston, San Francisco, New York City, San Diego, Seattle, Maryland, and Research Triangle Park. 

Alexandria develops dynamic urban cluster campuses and vibrant ecosystems that enable and inspire the world&#8217;s most brilliant minds and innovative companies to create life-changing scientific and technological breakthroughs. We believe in the utmost professionalism, humility, and teamwork. Alexandria manages its properties through fully integrated regional teams with unparalleled real estate, science, and technology expertise. Alexandria is known for its high-quality and diverse tenant base. Our tenants include multinational pharmaceutical companies, public and private biotechnology, life science product and service, medical device, digital health, and technology companies; academic and medical research institutions; U.S. government research agencies; non-profits; and venture capital firms. Alexandria has a longstanding and proven track record of developing Class A assets clustered in urban science and technology campuses that provide its innovative tenants with highly dynamic and collaborative environments that enhance their ability to successfully recruit and retain world-class talent and inspire productivity, efficiency, creativity, and success. We believe these advantages result in higher occupancy levels, longer lease terms, higher rental income, higher returns, and greater long-term asset value. 

We executed our initial public offering in 1997 and received our investment-grade ratings in 2011. 

As of December 31, 2015 , Al exandria&#8217;s total market capitalization was &#32; $10.9 billion &#32; and its asset ba se consisted of 32.0 million &#32;square feet, including 20.1 million &#32;RSF of operating properties and development and redevelopment projects under construction or pre-construction, as well as an additional 11.9 million &#32;square feet of future ground-up development projects. These operating properties and development projects include 11 &#32;properties that are subject to real estate joint venture arrangements, of which eight &#32;properties are held by consolidated real estate joint ventures and three &#32;properties are held by unconsolidated real estate joint ventures. Additional information regarding our consolidated and unconsolidated real estate joint ventures is included in &#8220;Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; in this annual report on Form 10-K. The occupancy percentage of our operating properties in North America was 97.2% &#32;as of December 31, 2015 . Our 10-year average occupancy rate of operating properties as of December 31, 2015 , was 95.0% . Investment-grade tenants represented 54% &#32;of our total ABR as of December 31, 2015 . The comparability of financial data from period to period is affected by the timing of our property acquisition, development, and redevelopment activities. Additional information regarding risk factors that may affect us is included in

Business objective and strategies 

Our primary business objective is to maximize long-term asset value and shareholder returns based on a multifaceted platform of internal and external growth. A key element of our strategy is our unique focus on Class A assets clustered in urban campuses. These key urban campus locations are characterized by high barriers to entry for new landlords, high barriers to exit for tenants, and a limited supply of available space. They represent highly desirable locations for tenancy by science and technology entities because of their close proximity to concentrations of specialized skills, knowledge, institutions, and related businesses. Our strategy also includes drawing upon our deep and broad real estate, science, and technology relationships in order to identify and attract new and leading tenants and to source additional value-creation real estate. 

The following chart summarizes the growth in ABR in our key cluster submarkets: 

Our tenant base is broad and diverse within the science and technology industries and reflects our focus on regional, national, and international tenants with substantial financial and operational resources. For a more detailed description of our properties and tenants, refer to &#8220; Item 2. Properties &#8221; in this annual report on Form 10-K. We have an experienced Board of Directors and are led by an executive and senior management team with extensive experience in the real estate, science, and technology industries. 

Acquisitions 

We seek to identify and acquire high-quality properties in our target cluster markets. Critical evaluation of prospective property acquisitions is an essential component of our acquisition strategy. When evaluating acquisition opportunities, we assess a full range of matters relating to the prospective property or properties, including: 

&#8226; 

Proximity to centers of innovation and technological advances; 

&#8226; 

Location of the property and our strategy in the relevant market; 

&#8226; 

Quality of existing and prospective tenants; 

&#8226; 

Condition and capacity of the building infrastructure; 

&#8226; 

Quality and generic characteristics of the improvements; 

&#8226; 

Physical condition of the structure and common area improvements; 

&#8226; 

Opportunities available for leasing vacant space and for re-tenanting or renewing occupied space; 

&#8226; 

Availability of and/or ability to add appropriate tenant amenities; 

&#8226; 

Availability of land for future ground-up development of new space; 

&#8226; 

Opportunities to redevelop existing space and generate higher rent; 

&#8226; 

The property&#8217;s unlevered yields; and 

&#8226; 

Our ability to increase the property&#8217;s long-term financial returns. 

Development 

A key component of our business model is our value-creation development projects. Our development strategy is primarily to pursue selective projects with significant pre-leasing where we expect to achieve appropriate investment returns and generally match a source of funds for this use. Our value-creation development projects focus on high-quality, generic, and reusable office/laboratory or tech office space to meet the real estate requirements of our wide range of tenants. 

Redevelopment 

Another key component of our business model is our value-creation redevelopment of existing office, warehouse, or shell space into high-quality, generic, and reusable space that can be leased at higher rates. Our redevelopment strategy generally includes significant pre-leasing of certain projects prior to the commencement of redevelopment. 

Balance sheet and financial strategy 

We seek to maximize balance sheet liquidity and flexibility, cash flows, and cash available for distribution to our stockholders through the ownership, operation, management, and selective acquisition, development, and redevelopment of office/laboratory and tech office properties, as well as management of our balance sheet. In particular, we seek to maximize balance sheet liquidity and flexibility, cash flows, and cash available for distribution by: 

&#8226; 

Maintaining access to diverse sources of capital, including operating cash flows after dividends, incremental debt, asset sales, and other capital such as the sale of equity or joint venture capital; 

&#8226; 

Maintaining significant liquidity through borrowing capacity under our unsecured senior line of credit, available commitments under secured construction loans, marketable securities, and cash and cash equivalents; 

&#8226; 

Minimizing the amount of near-term debt maturities in a single year; 

&#8226; 

Maintaining low to modest leverage; 

&#8226; 

Minimizing variable interest rate risk; 

&#8226; 

Generating high-quality, strong, and increasing operating cash flows; 

&#8226; 

Selectively selling real estate assets, including land parcels and non-core/&#8220;core-like&#8221; operating assets, and investing the proceeds into our highly leased value-creation development projects; 

&#8226; 

Allocating capital to Class A assets located in unique collaborative science and technology campuses in AAA urban innovation clusters; 

&#8226; 

Maintaining geographic diversity in stable-value urban intellectual centers of innovation; 

&#8226; 

Selectively acquiring high-quality office/laboratory and tech office properties in our target urban innovation cluster submarkets at prices that enable us to realize attractive returns; 

&#8226; 

Selectively developing properties in our target urban innovation cluster submarkets; 

&#8226; 

Selectively redeveloping existing office, warehouse, or shell space, or newly acquired properties, into high-quality, generic, and reusable space that can be leased at higher rental rates in our target urban innovation cluster submarkets; 

&#8226; 

Renewing existing tenant space at higher rental rates to the extent possible; 

&#8226; 

Minimizing tenant improvement costs; 

&#8226; 

Improving investment returns through the leasing of vacant space and the replacing of existing tenants with new tenants at higher rental rates; 

&#8226; 

Maintaining solid occupancy while maintaining high lease rental rates; 

&#8226; 

Realizing contractual rental rate escalations; and 

&#8226; 

Implementing effective cost control measures, including negotiating pass-through provisions in tenant leases for operating expenses and certain capital expenditures.

Competition 

In general, other office/laboratory and tech office properties are located in close proximity to our properties. The amount of rentable space available in any market could have a material effect on our ability to rent space and on the rents that we can earn. In addition, we compete for investment opportunities with other REITs, insurance companies, pension and investment funds, private equity entities, partnerships, developers, investment companies, owners/occupants, and foreign investors. Many of these entities have substantially greater financial resources than we do and may be able to invest more than we can or accept more risk than we are willing to accept. These entities may be less sensitive to risks with respect to the creditworthiness of a tenant or the geographic concentration of their investments. In addition, as a result of their financial resources, our competitors may offer more free rent concessions, lower rental rates, or higher tenant improvement allowances in order to attract tenants. These leasing incentives could hinder our ability to maintain or raise rents and attract or retain tenants. Competition may also reduce the number of suitable investment opportunities available to us or may increase the bargaining power of property owners seeking to sell. Competition in acquiring existing properties and land, both from institutional capital sources and from other REITs, has been very strong over the past several years. However, we believe we have differentiated ourselves from our competitors, as we are the first publicly traded REIT to focus primarily on the office/laboratory real estate niche; we are the largest and leading urban office REIT uniquely focused on collaborative science and technology campuses in AAA innovation cluster locations; and we have the most important relationships in the life science industry.

Refer to Note 2 &#8211; &#8220;Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#8221; to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report on From 10-K for information about our one reportable segment. 

Regulation 

General 

Properties in our markets are subject to various laws, ordinances, and regulations, including regulations relating to common areas. We believe we have the necessary permits and approvals to operate each of our properties. 

Americans with Disabilities Act 

Our properties must comply with Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (the &#8220;ADA&#8221;), to the extent that such properties are &#8220;public accommodations&#8221; as defined by the ADA. The ADA may require removal of structural barriers to access by persons with disabilities in certain public areas of our properties where such removal is readily achievable. We believe that our properties are in substantial compliance with the ADA and that we will not be required to incur substantial capital expenditures to address the requirements of the ADA. However, noncompliance with the ADA could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants. The obligation to make readily achievable accommodations is an ongoing one, and we will continue to assess our properties and make alterations as appropriate in this respect. 

Environmental matters 

Under various environmental protection laws, a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be liable for contamination resulting from the presence or discharge of hazardous or toxic substances at that property and may be required to investigate and clean up contamination located on or emanating from that property. Such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of the contaminants, and the liability may be joint and several. Previous owners may have used some of our properties for industrial and other purposes, so those properties may contain some level of environmental contamination. The presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination at our properties may expose us to third-party liability or may materially adversely affect our ability to sell, lease, or develop the real estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral. 

Some of our properties may have asbestos-containing building materials. Environmental laws require that asbestos-containing building materials be properly managed and maintained and may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators for failure to comply with these requirements. These laws may also allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos-containing building materials. 

In addition, some of our tenants routinely handle hazardous substances and wastes as part of their operations at our properties. Environmental laws and regulations subject our tenants, and potentially us, to liability resulting from these activities or from previous uses of those properties. Environmental liabilities could also affect a tenant&#8217;s ability to make rental payments to us. We require our tenants to comply with these environmental laws and regulations. 

Independent environmental consultants have conducted Phase I or similar environmental site assessments on the properties in our portfolio. Site assessments are intended to discover and evaluate information regarding the environmental condition of the surveyed property and surrounding properties and do not generally include soil samplings, subsurface investigations, or an asbestos survey. To date, these assessments have not revealed any material environmental liability that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business, assets, or results of operations. Nevertheless, it is possible that the assessments on our properties have not revealed all environmental conditions, liabilities, or compliance concerns that may have arisen after the review was completed or may arise in the future; and future laws, ordinances, or regulations may impose additional material environmental liability. 

Insurance 

We carry comprehensive liability, all-risk property, and rental loss insurance with respect to our properties. We select policy specifications and insured limits that we believe to be appropriate given the relative risk of loss, the cost of the coverage, and industry practice. In our opinion, the properties in our portfolio are currently adequately insured. In addition, we have obtained earthquake insurance for certain properties located in the vicinity of known active earthquake zones. We also carry environmental insurance and title insurance on our properties. We generally obtain our title insurance policies when we acquire the property, with each policy covering an amount equal to the initial purchase price of each property. Accordingly, any of our title insurance policies may be in an amount less than the current value of the related property.
