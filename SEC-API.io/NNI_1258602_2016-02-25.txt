 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

Overview 

Nelnet, Inc. (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) is a diverse company with a focus on delivering education-related products and services and student loan asset management. The largest operating businesses engage in student loan servicing, tuition payment processing and school information systems, and telecommunications. A significant portion of the Company's revenue is net interest income earned on a portfolio of federally insured student loans. The Company also makes investments to further diversify the Company both within and outside of its historical core education-related businesses, including, but not limited to, investments in real estate and start-up ventures. Substantially all revenue from external customers is earned, and all long-lived assets are located, in the United States. 

The Company was formed as a Nebraska corporation in 1978 to service federal student loans for two local banks. The Company built on this initial foundation as a servicer to become a leading originator, holder, and servicer of federal student loans, principally consisting of loans originated under the FFEL Program. A detailed description of the FFEL Program is included in Appendix A to this report. 

The Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (the &#8220;Reconciliation Act of 2010&#8221;) eliminated new loan originations under the FFEL Program effective July 1, 2010 and requires that all new federal student loan originations be made through the Federal Direct Loan Program. This law does not alter or affect the terms and conditions of existing FFELP loans. 

As a result of the Reconciliation Act of 2010, the Company no longer originates new FFELP loans. However, a significant portion of the Company's income continues to be derived from its existing FFELP student loan portfolio. As of December 31, 2015, the Company had a $28.3 billion &#32;student loan portfolio that will amortize over the next approximately 25 years. Interest income on the Company's existing FFELP loan portfolio will decline over time as the portfolio is paid down. However, since July 1, 2010, the effective date on and after which no new loans could be originated under the FFEL Program, the Company has purchased $20.8 billion of FFELP loans from other FFELP loan holders looking to adjust their FFELP businesses. The Company believes there may be additional opportunities to purchase FFELP portfolios to generate incremental earnings and cash flow. However, since all FFELP loans will eventually run off, a key objective of the Company is to reposition the Company for the post-FFELP environment. 

&#160; 

To reduce its reliance on interest income on student loans, the Company has expanded its services and products. In addition, in 2009, the Company began servicing federally-owned student loans for the Department. As of December 31, 2015, the Company was servicing $147.3 billion of student loans for 5.8 million borrowers &#32;on behalf of the Department. 

Recent Developments 

Telecommunications Acquisition 

On December 31, 2015, the Company purchased 92.5 percent of the ownership interests of Allo Communications LLC (&#8220;Allo&#8221;) for total cash consideration of $46.25 million. The remaining 7.5 percent of the ownership interests of Allo is owned by Allo management, who has the opportunity to earn an additional 11.5 percent (up to 19 percent) of the total ownership interests based on the financial performance of Allo. Allo provides pure fiber optic service directly to homes and businesses for internet, television, and telephone services. The acquisition of Allo provides additional diversification of the Company's revenues and cash flows outside of education. In addition, the acquisition leverages the Company's existing infrastructure, customer service capabilities and call centers, and financial strength and liquidity for continued growth. 

Sale of Nelnet Enrollment Solutions 

On February 1, 2016, the Company sold 100 percent of the membership interests in Sparkroom LLC, which includes the majority of the Company's inquiry management products and services within Nelnet Enrollment Solutions, for total cash consideration of $3.0 million. The majority of the cash proceeds will be recorded as a gain during the first quarter of 2016. The Company recognized $51.1 million of revenue and $9.3 million of gross margin related to these products and services during 2015. The Company retained the digital marketing and content solution products and services under the brand name Peterson's within the Nelnet Enrollment Solutions business, which include test preparation study guides, school directories and databases, career exploration guides, on-line courses, scholarship search and selection data, career planning, and on-line information about colleges and universities. The sale of Sparkroom LLC will not have a significant impact to net income in future periods.

Segment Operating Results 

The Company's reportable operating segments are defined by the products and services they offer or the types of customers they serve, and they reflect the manner in which financial information is currently evaluated by management. The Company includes separate financial information about its reportable segments, including revenues, net income or loss, and total assets for each of the Company's reportable segments, for the last three fiscal years in note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this report. For segment reporting purposes, business activities and operating segments that are not reportable are combined and included in "Corporate and Other Activities." 

For financial reporting purposes, the Company will disclose the operating results of Allo as a separate reportable operating segment. The Allo assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded by the Company at their respective estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. As such, Allo&#8217;s assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2015 are included in the Company&#8217;s consolidated balance sheet. However, Allo had no impact on the consolidated statement of income for 2015. Beginning January 1, 2016, the Company will reflect the operations of Allo in the consolidated statements of income. A description of Allo is provided with the other reportable operating segments below.

See Part II, Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Student Loan and Guaranty Servicing Operating Segment - Results of Operations - Student Loan Servicing Volumes" for additional information related to the Company's servicing volume. 

&#32;4 

Servicing federally-owned student loans for the Department 

&#160; 

The Company is one of four private sector companies (referred to as Title IV Additional Servicers, or "TIVAS") awarded a student loan servicing contract by the Department in June 2009 to provide additional servicing capacity for loans owned by the Department, with new loan volume allocated among the four servicers based on certain performance metrics established by the Department beginning in 2010. These loans include Federal Direct Loan Program loans originated directly by the Department and FFEL Program loans purchased by the Department. Under the servicing contract, the Company earns a monthly fee from the Department for each unique borrower who has loans owned by the Department and serviced by the Company. The amount paid per each unique borrower is dependent on the status of the borrower (such as in school or in repayment). The servicing contract was originally scheduled to expire in June 2014. Effective as of June 17, 2014, the Department extended the servicing contract with the Company for an additional five years through June 16, 2019. 

As of December 31, 2015, the Company was servicing $147.3 billion of student loans for 5.8 million borrowers &#32;under this contract. The Department is the Company's largest customer, representing approximately 15 percent of the Company's revenue in 2015. 

The Department currently allocates new loan volume among the four servicers based on the following performance metrics: 

&#8226; 

Two metrics measure the satisfaction among separate customer groups, including borrowers (35 percent) and Federal Student Aid personnel who work with the servicers (5 percent). 

&#8226; 

Three metrics measure the success of keeping borrowers in an on-time repayment status and helping borrowers avoid default as reflected by the percentage of borrowers in current repayment status (30 percent), percentage of borrowers more than 90 days but less than 271 days delinquent (15 percent), and percentage of borrowers over 270 days and less than 361 days delinquent (15 percent). 

The allocation of ongoing volume is determined twice each year based on the performance of each servicer in relation to the other servicers. Quarterly results are compiled for each servicer. The average of the September and December quarter end results are used to allocate volume for the period from March 1 to August 31, and the average of the March and June quarter end results are used to allocate volume for the period from September 1 to February month end, of each year. 

During the first five years of the servicing contract, the Department allocated new loan volume among the four servicers based on the following performance metrics: 

&#8226; 

Three metrics measured the satisfaction among separate borrower groups, including borrowers (20 percent), financial aid personnel at postsecondary schools participating in federal student loan programs (20 percent), and Federal Student Aid and other federal agency personnel or contractors who worked with the servicers (20 percent). 

&#8226; 

Two performance metrics measured the success of default prevention efforts as reflected by the percentage of borrowers (20 percent) and percentage of dollars (20 percent) in each servicer's portfolio that went into default. 

The Department also has contracts with 31 not-for-profit ("NFP") entities to service student loans, although six NFP servicers service the volume allocated to these 31 entities. While previously these entities have only serviced existing loans, effective January 1, 2015 they began to receive a total of 25 percent of new borrower loan volume, and as of September 1, 2015, this allocation was increased to 26 percent. The allocation of new borrower loan volume has and will continue to decrease new allocation volume for the Company. 

&#32;5 

The following table shows the Company's rankings and percent of new volume allocated to the Company since the inception of the Department's allocations of new loan volume based on performance metrics methodologies under this contract:

As of the filing of this report, the Department has not announced the September and December 2015 quarter end performance results for the March 1, 2016 to August 31, 2016 allocation period. 

Incremental revenue components earned by the Company from the Department (in addition to loan servicing revenues) include: 

&#8226; 

Administration of the Total and Permanent Disability (TPD) Discharge program . The Company processes applications for the TPD Discharge program and is responsible for discharge, monitoring, and servicing of TPD loans. Individuals who are totally and permanently disabled may qualify for a discharge of their federal student loans, and the Company processes applications under the program and receives a fee from the Department on a per application basis, as well as a monthly servicing fee during the monitoring period. The Company is the exclusive provider of this service to the Department. 

&#8226; 

Origination of consolidation loans. &#32;Beginning in 2014, the Department implemented a new process to outsource the origination of consolidation loans whereby each of the four TIVAS receives Federal Direct Loan consolidation origination volume based on borrower choice. The Department pays the Company a fee for each completed consolidation loan application it processes. The Company services the consolidation volume it originates. 

Servicing FFELP loans 

&#32;The Student Loan and Guaranty Servicing operating segment provides for the servicing of the Company's student loan portfolio and the portfolios of third parties. The loan servicing activities include loan conversion activities, application processing, borrower updates, customer service, payment processing, due diligence procedures, funds management reconciliations, and claim processing. These activities are performed internally for the Company's portfolio, in addition to generating external fee revenue when performed for third-party clients. 

&#160; 

The Company's student loan servicing division uses proprietary systems to manage the servicing process. These systems provide for automated compliance with most of the federal student loan regulations adopted under Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended (the &#8220;Higher Education Act&#8221;). 

The Company serviced FFELP loans on behalf of 32 third-party servicing customers as of December 31, 2015. The Company's FFELP servicing customers include national and regional banks, credit unions, and various state and non-profit secondary markets. The majority of the Company's external FFELP loan servicing activities are performed under &#8220;life of loan&#8221; contracts. Life of loan contract servicing essentially provides that as long as the loan exists, the Company shall be the sole servicer of that loan; however, the agreement may contain &#8220;deconversion&#8221; provisions where, for a fee, the lender may move the loan to another servicer. 

The elimination of new FFELP loan originations in July 2010 has caused and will continue to cause FFELP servicing revenue to decline as FFELP loan portfolios are paid down. However, the Company believes there may be opportunities to service additional FFELP loan portfolios from current FFELP participants as the program winds down. 

&#32;6 

Marketing, originating, and servicing private education student loans 

The Student Loan and Guaranty Servicing operating segment conducts marketing, origination, and servicing activities for private education loans. Private education loans are loans to students or their families that are non-federal loans; as such, the loans are not issued or guaranteed by the federal government. These loans are used primarily to bridge the gap between the cost of higher education and the amount funded through financial aid, federal loans, or the borrowers' personal resources. Although similar in terms of activities and functions as FFELP loan servicing (i.e., application processing, disbursement processing, payment processing, customer service, statement distribution, and reporting), private education loan servicing activities are not required to comply with provisions of the Higher Education Act and may be more customized to individual client requirements. The Company has invested in modernizing its website and origination servicing platform to position the private education servicing business for the long-term, expanding out services to include refinance and personal loan programs. The Company serviced private education loans on behalf of 26 third-party servicing customers as of December 31, 2015. 

Servicing and outsourcing services for FFELP guaranty agencies, including FFELP guaranty collection services 

&#160; 

The Student Loan and Guaranty Servicing operating segment provides servicing support for guaranty agencies, which serve as intermediaries between the Department and FFELP lenders, and are responsible for paying the claims made on defaulted loans. The Department has designated 29 guarantors that have been formed as either state agencies or non-profit corporations that provide FFELP guaranty services in one or more states. More than half of these guarantors contract externally for operational or technology services. The services provided by the Company include providing software and data center services, borrower and loan updates, default aversion services, claim processing services, and post-default collection services. 

A significant portion of guaranty servicing revenue earned by the Company relates to rehabilitating defaulted FFELP loans (collection services) on behalf of guaranty agencies. Federal budget provisions that became effective July 1, 2014 have reduced payments by the Department to guaranty agencies for assisting student loan borrowers with the rehabilitation of defaulted loans under FFELP. These provisions reduced the amount guaranty agencies retain upon successful rehabilitation from 37 percent to 16 percent of the loan balance. The decrease in the retention percent earned by guaranty agencies negatively impacted the Company&#8217;s guaranty collections revenue, and also contributed to a reduction in the segment's operating margin. During the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014, and 2013, the Company recognized $34.3 million, $41.6 million, and $54.2 million, respectively, in revenue from rehabilitating defaulted FFELP loans for guaranty agencies. 

A significant amount of the Company's guaranty servicing revenue has historically come from a single guaranty servicing client, College Assist, the Colorado state-designated guarantor. The contract with College Assist expired on October 31, 2015, and was not renewed. FFELP guaranty servicing and FFELP guaranty collection revenue recognized by the Company from College Assist for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $37.3 million and $48.5 million, respectively. 

The Company&#8217;s second largest guaranty servicing client, Tennessee Student Assistance Corporation ("TSAC"), has notified its servicer partners that it intends to exit the FFELP guaranty business at the end of their contract term on June 30, 2016. FFELP guaranty servicing and FFELP guaranty collection revenue recognized by the Company from TSAC for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $19.5 million and $17.9 million, respectively. 

After the expiration of TSAC's contract, effective June 30, 2016, the Company's only guaranty servicing customer will be the National Student Loan Program ("NSLP"). The Company provides software and data center services to NSLP, and recognized $4.0 million of revenue from this customer in 2015. 

Providing student loan servicing software and other information technology products and services 

&#160; 

The Student Loan and Guaranty Servicing operating segment provides student loan servicing software for servicing private education and federal loans. These proprietary software systems are used internally by the Company and licensed to third-party student loan holders and servicers. These software systems have been adapted so they can be offered as hosted servicing software solutions that can be used by third-parties to service various types of student loans, including Federal Direct Loan Program and FFEL Program loans. The Company earns a monthly fee from its remote hosting customers for each unique borrower on the Company's platform, with a minimum monthly charge for most contracts. As of December 31, 2015 , 1.8 million borrowers were hosted on the Company's hosted servicing software solution platforms. 

&#32;7 

Providing outsourced services including call center, processing, and marketing services 

The Company provides business process outsourcing specializing in contact center management. The contact center solutions and services include taking inbound calls, helping with outreach campaigns and sales, and interacting with customers through multi-channels. 

Competition 

&#160; 

The Company's scalable servicing platform allows it to provide compliant, efficient, and reliable service at a low cost, giving the Company a competitive advantage over others in the industry for all of this segment's services, which are discussed below. 

&#160; 

Loan servicing 

&#160; 

The principal competitor for existing and prospective FFELP and private education loan servicing business is Navient Corporation ("Navient"). Navient is the largest for-profit provider of servicing functions, as well as one of the largest service providers for private education loans. In contrast to its competitors, the Company has segmented its private education loan servicing on a distinct platform, created specifically to meet the needs of private education student loan borrowers, their families, the schools they attend, and the lenders who serve them. This ensures access to specialized teams with a dedicated focus on servicing these borrowers. 

&#160; 

With the elimination of new loan originations under the FFEL Program, four servicers, including the Company, were named by the Department in 2009 as servicers of federally-owned loans. The three other servicers are Great Lakes Educational Loan Services Inc. (&#8220;Great Lakes&#8221;), FedLoan Servicing (Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency (&#8220;PHEAA&#8221;)), and Navient. In addition, the Department has contracts with 31 NFP entities to service student loans that are serviced by six prime servicers. These NFP entities were authorized in 2012 to begin servicing loans for existing borrower accounts. While previously these entities have only serviced existing loans, effective January 1, 2015 they began to receive a portion of new borrower loan activity. The Company currently licenses its hosted servicing software to four prime servicers that represent 13 NFP organizations. PHEAA is the only other TIVAS servicer offering a hosted Federal Direct Loan Program servicing solution to the NFP servicers. 

Guaranty servicing 

&#160; 

With the elimination of new loan originations under the FFEL Program, services provided to guaranty agencies will continue for agencies' existing portfolios. The Company anticipates continuing to serve its existing guaranty customers as their portfolios pay down and/or until they exit the FFELP guaranty business. The Company does not expect to increase the number of its guaranty servicing customers. 

Software and technology 

&#160; 

The Company is one of the leaders in the development of servicing software for private education, Federal Direct Loan Program, and FFELP student loans. Many student loan lenders and servicers utilize the Company's software either directly or indirectly. The Company believes the investments it has made to scale its systems and to create a secure infrastructure to support the Department's servicing volume and requirements increase its competitive advantage as a long-term partner in the loan servicing market. 

Tuition Payment Processing and Campus Commerce 

The Company's Tuition Payment Processing and Campus Commerce operating segment provides products and services to help students and families manage the payment of education costs at all levels (K-12 and higher education). It also provides innovative education-focused technologies, services, and support solutions to help schools automate administrative processes and collect and process commerce data. 

See Part II, Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Tuition Payment Processing and Campus Commerce Operating Segment - Results of Operations" for a discussion of the seasonality of the business in this operating segment. 

&#32;8 

K-12 

In the K-12 market, the Company offers tuition management services, school information systems, and assistance with financial needs assessment and donor management. The Company provides services for almost 9,400 K-12 schools and serves over 2.3 million students and families. 

The Company is the market leader in actively managed tuition payment plans. Tuition management services include payment plan administration, incidental billing, accounts receivable management, and record keeping. K-12 educational institutions contract with the Company to administer deferred payment plans that allow families to make monthly payments over 6 to 12 months. The Company collects a fee from either the institution or the payer as an administration fee. 

The Company's financial needs assessment service helps K-12 schools evaluate and determine the amount of financial aid to disburse to the families it serves. The Company's donor services allow schools to assess and deliver strategic fundraising solutions using the latest technology. 

On June 3, 2014, the Company purchased 100 percent of the ownership interests of RenWeb. RenWeb provides school information systems to help schools automate administrative processes such as admissions, scheduling, student billing, attendance, and grade book management. RenWeb's information systems software is sold as a subscription service to schools. The combination of RenWeb&#8217;s school administration software and the Company&#8217;s tuition management and financial needs assessment services has significantly increased the value of the Company&#8217;s offerings in this area, allowing the Company to deliver a comprehensive suite of solutions to schools. 

Higher Education 

The Company offers two principal products to the higher education market: actively managed tuition payment plans, and campus commerce technologies and payment processing. The Company provides service for almost 800 colleges and universities world-wide and serves over 6.8 million students and families. 

Higher education institutions contract with the Company to administer actively managed payment plans that allow the student and family to make monthly payments on either a semester or annual basis. The Company collects a fee from the student or family as an administration fee. 

The Company's suite of campus commerce solutions provides services that allow for families' electronic billing and payment of campus charges. Campus commerce includes cashiering for face-to-face transactions, campus-wide commerce management, and refunds management, among other activities. The Company earns revenue for e-billing, hosting and maintenance, credit card processing fees, and e-payment transaction fees, which are powered by the Company's QuikPAY &#32;system, a secure payment processing engine. 

QuikPAY , a campus commerce product, is sold as a subscription service to colleges and universities. QuikPAY processes payments through the appropriate channels in the banking or credit card networks to make deposits into the client's bank account. It can be further deployed to other departments around campus as requested (e.g., application fees, alumni giving, parking, events, etc.). 

Competition 

The Company is the largest provider of tuition management services to the private and faith-based K-12 market in the United States. Competitors include financial institutions, tuition management providers, financial needs assessment providers, accounting firms, and a myriad of software companies. 

In the higher education market, the Company targets business offices at colleges and universities. In this market, the primary competition is limited to three campus commerce and tuition payment providers, as well as solutions developed in-house by colleges and universities. 

The Company's principal competitive advantages are (i) the customer service it provides to institutions and consumers, (ii) the technology provided with the Company's service, and (iii) the Company's ability to integrate its technology with the institution clients and their third party service providers. The Company believes its clients select products primarily based on technology features and functionality and the ability to integrate with other systems, but price and service also impact the selection process. 

&#160; 

&#32;9 

Asset Generation and Management 

The Asset Generation and Management operating segment includes the acquisition, management, and ownership of the Company's student loan assets. As of December 31, 2015, the Company's student loan portfolio was $28.3 billion. The Company generates a substantial portion of its earnings from the spread, referred to as the Company's student loan spread, between the yield it receives on its student loan portfolio and the associated costs to finance such portfolio. See Part II, Item 7, &#8220;Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Asset Generation and Management Operating Segment - Results of Operations - Student Loan Spread Analysis,&#8221; for further details related to the student loan spread. The student loan assets are held in a series of education lending subsidiaries and associated securitization trusts designed specifically for this purpose. In addition to the student loan spread earned on its portfolio, all costs and activity associated with managing the portfolio, such as servicing of the assets and debt maintenance, are included in this segment. 

Student loans consist of federally insured student loans and private education loans. Federally insured student loans were originated under the FFEL Program. The Company's portfolio of federally insured student loans is subject to minimal credit risk, as these loans are guaranteed by the Department at levels ranging from 97 percent to 100 percent. Substantially all of the Company's loan portfolio ( 99.1 percent &#32;as of December 31, 2015 ) is federally insured. The Company's portfolio of private education loans is subject to credit risk similar to other consumer loan assets. 

The Higher Education Act regulates every aspect of the federally insured student loan program, including certain communications with borrowers, loan originations, and default aversion. Failure to service a student loan properly could jeopardize the guarantee on federal student loans. In the case of death, disability, or bankruptcy of the borrower, the guarantee covers 100 percent of the loan's principal and accrued interest. 

FFELP loans are guaranteed by state agencies or non-profit companies designated as guarantors, with the Department providing reinsurance to the guarantor. Guarantors are responsible for performing certain functions necessary to ensure the program's soundness and accountability. Generally, the guarantor is responsible for ensuring that loans are serviced in compliance with the requirements of the Higher Education Act. When a borrower defaults on a FFELP loan, the Company submits a claim to the guarantor, who provides reimbursements of principal and accrued interest, subject to the applicable risk share percentage. 

Origination and Acquisition 

The Reconciliation Act of 2010 eliminated originations of new FFELP loans effective July 1, 2010. However, the Company believes there will be ongoing opportunities to continue to purchase FFELP loan portfolios from current FFELP participants looking to adjust their FFELP businesses. For example, from July 1, 2010 through December 31, 2015 , the Company purchased a total of $20.8 billion of FFELP student loans from various third-parties, including a total of $3.9 billion during 2015. The Company's competition for the purchase of student loan portfolios and residuals includes large banks, hedge funds, and other student loan finance companies. 

Interest Rate Risk Management 

Because the Company generates a significant portion of its earnings from its student loan spread, the interest rate sensitivity of the Company's balance sheet is very important to its operations. The current and future interest rate environment can and will affect the Company's interest income and net income. The effects on the Company's results of operations as a result of the changing interest rate environments are further outlined in Part II, Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Asset Generation and Management Operating Segment - Results of Operations - Student Loan Spread Analysis" and Part II, Item 7A, &#8220;Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk - Interest Rate Risk.&#8221; 

Telecommunications 

As discussed above, on December 31, 2015, the Company acquired 92.5 percent of the membership interests of Allo. Allo derives its revenue primarily from the sale of advanced telecommunication services, including internet, television, and telephone services, to residential and business customers in Nebraska, and specializes in high-speed internet services available through its all-fiber network. Allo currently serves the Scottsbluff, Gering, Bridgeport, North Platte, Ogallala, and Alliance communities in Nebraska. In November 2015, Allo announced plans to expand its network to make services available to substantially all commercial and residential premises in Lincoln, Nebraska, and currently plans to expand to additional communities in Nebraska and surrounding states over the next several years.

Internet and television services 

Internet, broadband, and television services include data and video products and services to residential and business subscribers. Allo data services provide high-speed internet access over Allo's all-fiber network at various symmetrical speeds up to 1 gigabit per second, depending on the nature of the network facilities that are available, the level of service selected, and the geographic market availability. Allo also offers a variety of data connectivity services in select markets, including Ethernet services capable of connecting multiple connections over Allo's fiber-based networks. Depending on geographic market availability, Allo's Internet Protocol Television Video ("IPTV") services range from limited basic service to advanced television, which includes several plans each with hundreds of local, national, and music channels, including premium and pay-per-view channels, as well as video on demand service. Subscribers may also subscribe to Allo's advanced video services, which consist of high-definition television, digital video recorders (&#8220;DVR&#8221;), and/or a whole home DVR. Allo's whole home DVR gives customers the ability to watch recorded shows on any television in the house, record multiple shows at one time, and utilize an intuitive on-screen guide and user interface. 

Allo expects that internet, broadband, and television services will continue to increase as a more significant component of its overall services, and offset the anticipated decline in traditional residential telephone services, which continue to be impacted by the industry-wide decline in access lines. 

Telephone services 

Local calling services include a full suite of telephone services, including basic services, primary rate interface ("PRI"), and session initiation protocol ("SIP"). Allo's service plans include options for voice-mail and other enhanced custom calling features including hunting, caller ID, call forwarding, call waiting, among others. Services are charged at a fixed monthly rate or can be bundled with selected services at a discounted rate. Allo provides a hosted PBX package, which utilizes a soft switch and allows the customer the flexibility of utilizing new telephone technology and features without investing in a new telephone system. The package bundles local service, calling features, and internet protocol (&#8220;IP&#8221;) business telephones. 

Long-distance services include traditional domestic and international long distance which enables customers to make calls that terminate outside their local calling area. These services also include toll free calls and conference calling. Allo offers a variety of long-distance plans, including unlimited flat-rate calling plans, and offers a combination of subscription and usage fees. 

Summary Financial and Operating Data 

The acquisition of privately held Allo was completed on December 31, 2015. The fair value of Allo's assets acquired and liabilities assumed are included in the Company's consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015. However, no operating results of Allo are included in the consolidated income statement of the Company for the year ended December 31, 2015. See note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information related to the acquisition of Allo. 

Certain unaudited historical financial and operating data of Allo prior to the Company's acquisition of Allo is summarized below.

(a) 

Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization ("EBITDA") is a non-GAAP performance measure that is frequently used in capital-intensive industries such as telecommunications. Allo's management has historically used EBITDA to compare Allo's performance to that of its competitors and to eliminate certain non-cash and non-operating items in order to consistently measure performance from period to period. EBITDA excludes interest expense and income taxes because these items are associated with a company's particular capitalization and tax structures. EBITDA also excludes depreciation and amortization expense because these non-cash expenses primarily reflect the impact of historical capital investments, as opposed to the cash impacts of capital expenditures made in recent periods, which may be evaluated through cash flow measures. There are limitations to using EBITDA as a performance measure, including the difficulty associated with comparing companies that use similar performance measures whose calculations may differ from Allo's calculations. In addition, EBITDA should not be considered a substitute for other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP. 

(b) 

Represents the estimated number of single residence homes, apartments, and condominiums that Allo already serves and those in which Allo has the capacity to connect to its network distribution system without further material extensions to the transmission lines, but have not been connected. 

(c) 

In November 2015, Allo announced plans to expand its network to make services available to substantially all commercial and residential premises in Lincoln, Nebraska, and currently plans to expand to additional communities in Nebraska and surrounding states over the next several years. 

Sales and Marketing 

The key components of Allo's overall marketing strategy include: 

&#8226; 

Promoting the advantages of an all-fiber network connected directly to homes and businesses that delivers synchronous internet speeds of one gigabit per second (about 100 times faster than standard broadband connections with copper or coaxial cable) 

&#8226; 

Building complete fiber communities by passing all homes and businesses within their network 

&#8226; 

Organizing sales and marketing activities around consumer, enterprise, and carrier customers 

&#8226; 

Positioning Allo as a single point of contact for customers&#8217; communications needs 

&#8226; 

Providing customers with a broad array of internet, broadband, television, and telephone services and bundling these services whenever possible 

&#8226; 

Providing excellent customer service, including 24/7/365 centralized customer support to coordinate installation of new services, repair, and maintenance functions 

&#8226; 

Developing and delivering new services to meet evolving customer needs and market demands 

&#8226; 

Utilizing proven modern technology to deliver services 

Allo currently offers services through direct marketing, call centers, its website, communication centers, and commissioned sales representatives. Allo markets its services both individually and as bundled services, including its triple-play offering of internet, television, and telephone services. By bundling service offerings, Allo is able to offer and sell a more complete and competitive package of services, which simultaneously increases its margin per customer and adds value for the consumer. Allo also believes that bundling leads to increased customer loyalty and retention. 

Network Architecture and Technology 

&#160; 

Allo has made significant investments in its technologically advanced telecommunications networks. As a result, Allo is able to deliver high-quality, reliable internet, television, and telephone services through fiber optics. Allo's wide-ranging network and extensive use of fiber provide an easy reach into existing and new areas. By bringing the fiber network to the customer premises, Allo can increase its service offerings, quality, and bandwidth services. Allo's existing fiber network enables it to efficiently respond and adapt to changes in technology and is capable of supporting the rising customer demand for bandwidth in order to support the growing amount of internet devices in the home, and Allo's all-fiber network enhances its operating efficiencies by facilitating new network and technology choices that provide for lower costs to operate. Allo's networks are supported by an advanced 100 percent digital telephone switch and IPTV service platform. The digital switch provides all local telephone customers with access to a full suite of telecommunication products, custom calling features, and value-added services. Allo's fiber network utilizes fiber-to-the-premise (&#8220;FTTP&#8221;) networks to offer bundled residential and commercial services. Allo leverages its high definition IPTV headend equipment to distribute content across its network allowing Allo to provide a sharp video picture, and to better manage costs of future channel additions and upgrades. Allo's network provides substantially all of its marketable homes and businesses with bandwidth of 1 gigabit per second. 

&#32;12 

Growth Strategy 

As discussed above, Allo plans to increase its customer base with its superior all-fiber network by entering additional markets currently served by carriers using traditional copper and coaxial cable in their telecommunications network, including Lincoln, Nebraska and additional communities in Nebraska and surrounding states. Although the initial capital expenditures for these expansion efforts are expected to be significant, Allo believes that its service delivery model will continue to generate customer demand sufficient to provide attractive returns on the capital investment. In addition, Allo is focused on increasing revenues per customer by capitalizing on increased demand for bandwidth by commercial and residential customers. With respect to IPTV services, at increased revenue levels operating margins have typically remained constant on a per customer basis. 

Competition 

&#160; 

Telecommunications businesses are highly competitive and continue to face increased competition as a result of technology changes and industry legislative and regulatory developments. Allo faces actual or potential competition from many existing and emerging companies, including incumbent and competitive local telephone companies, long-distance carriers and resellers, wireless companies, internet service providers ("ISPs"), satellite companies, cable television companies, and in some cases by new forms of providers who are able to offer competitive services through software applications, requiring a comparatively small initial investment. Due to consolidation and strategic alliances within the industry, Allo cannot predict the number of competitors it will face at any given time. The wireless business has expanded significantly and has caused many residential subscribers to traditional telephone services to give up those services and to rely exclusively on wireless service. Consumers are finding individual television shows of interest to them through the internet and are watching content that is downloaded to their computers. Some providers, including television and cable television content owners, have initiated what are referred to as &#8220;over-the-top&#8221; services that deliver video content to televisions and computers over the internet. Over-the-top services can include episodes of highly-rated television series in their current broadcast seasons. They also can include content that is related to broadcast or sports content that Allo carries, but that is distinct and may be available only through the alternative source. Finally, the transition to digital broadcast television has allowed many consumers to obtain high definition local broadcast television signals (including many network affiliates) over-the-air, using a simple antenna. Consumers can pursue each of these options without foregoing any of the other options. The incumbent telephone carrier in the markets Allo serves enjoys certain business advantages, including size, financial resources, favorable regulatory position, a more diverse product mix, brand recognition, and connection to virtually all of Allo's customers and potential customers. The largest cable operators also enjoy certain business advantages, including size, financial resources, ownership of or superior access to desirable programming and other content, a more diverse product mix, brand recognition, and first-in-the-field advantages with a customer base that generates positive cash flow for its operations. Allo's competitors continue to add features and adopt aggressive pricing and packaging for services comparable to the services Allo offers. Their success in selling some services competitive with Allo's can lead to revenue erosion in other related areas. Allo faces intense competition in its markets for long-distance, internet access, and other ancillary services that are important to Allo's business and to its growth strategy. 

Regulation and Supervision 

The Company's operating segments and industry partners are heavily regulated by federal and state government regulatory agencies. The following provides a summary of the more significant existing and proposed legislation and regulations affecting the Company. A failure to comply with these laws and regulations could subject the Company to substantial fines, penalties, and remedial and other costs, restrictions on business, and the loss of business. Regulations and supervision can change rapidly, and changes could alter the manner in which the Company operates and increase the Company's operations expenses as new or additional regulatory compliance requirements are addressed. 

Student Loan and Guaranty Servicing 

The Company's Student Loan and Guaranty Servicing operating segment, which services Federal Direct Loan Program, FFELP, and private education loans, is subject to federal and state consumer protection, privacy, and related laws and regulations. Some of the more significant federal laws and regulations include: 

&#8226; 

The Higher Education Act, which establishes financial responsibility and administrative capability that govern all third-party servicers of insured student loans 

&#8226; 

The Telephone Consumer Protection Act (&#8220;TCPA&#8221;), which governs communication methods that may be used to contact customers 

&#8226; 

The Truth-In-Lending Act and Regulation Z, which governs disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers 

&#32;13 

&#8226; 

The Fair Credit Reporting Act and Regulation V, which governs the use and provision of information to consumer reporting agencies 

&#8226; 

The Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Regulation B, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, creed, or other prohibited factors in extending credit 

&#8226; 

The Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (&#8220;SCRA&#8221;), which applies to all debts incurred prior to commencement of active military service and limits the amount of interest, including certain fees or charges that are related to the obligation or liability 

&#8226; 

The Electronic Funds Transfer Act (&#8220;EFTA&#8221;) and Regulation E, which protects individual consumers engaged in electronic fund transfers (&#8220;EFTs&#8221;) 

&#8226; 

The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (&#8220;GLBA&#8221;) and Regulation P, which governs a financial institution&#8217;s treatment of nonpublic personal information about consumers and requires that an institution, under certain circumstances, notify consumers about its privacy policies and practices 

&#8226; 

Laws prohibiting unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices 

&#8226; 

Various laws, regulations, and standards that govern government contractors 

As a student loan servicer for the federal government and for financial institutions and guarantors, including the Company&#8217;s FFELP student loan portfolio, the Company is subject to the Higher Education Act. The Higher Education Act regulates every aspect of the federally insured student loan program. Currently, C ongress is evaluating proposals to reauthorize the Higher Education Act. 

Under the TCPA, plaintiffs may seek actual monetary loss or damages of $500 - $1,500 per violation, whichever is greater, and the courts may treble the damage award for willful or knowing violations. In addition, TCPA lawsuits have asserted putative class action claims. In July 2015, the Federal Communications Commission ("FCC") issued a Declaratory Ruling and Order (the &#8220;Ruling&#8221;) addressing petitions with the FCC seeking relief or clarification regarding the TCPA. The Ruling addresses several issues, including the definition of &#8220;autodialer&#8221; and liability for calls to recipients of telephone numbers that have been reassigned. 

In July 2010, Congress passed The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the &#8220;Dodd-Frank Act&#8221;). The Dodd-Frank Act established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the &#8220;CFPB&#8221;), which has broad authority to regulate a wide range of consumer financial products and services. In December 2013, the CFPB issued a rule that allows the CFPB to supervise nonbank student loan servicers that handle more than one million borrowers, including the Company, thus giving the CFPB broad authority to examine, investigate, supervise, and otherwise regulate the Company's businesses, including the authority to impose fines and require changes with respect to any practices that the CFPB finds to be unfair, deceptive, or abusive. 

In May 2015, the CFPB launched a public inquiry into student loan servicing practices throughout the industry. In September 2015, the CFPB issued a report discussing public comments submitted in response to the inquiry, and suggesting a framework to improve borrower outcomes and reduce defaults, including the creation of consistent, industry-wide standards for the entire servicing market. 

Additionally, the Dodd-Frank Act authorizes state officials to enforce regulations issued by the CFPB. Most states also have statutes that prohibit unfair and deceptive practices. To the extent states enact requirements that differ from federal standards or state officials and courts adopt interpretations of federal consumer laws that differ from those adopted by the CFPB under the Dodd-Frank Act, or states increase their examination, supervision, and enforcement activities, the Company's ability to offer the same products and services to consumers nationwide may be limited and the Company may be subject to a higher risk of state enforcement actions. 

As a third-party service provider to financial institutions, the Company is subject to periodic examination by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (&#8220;FFIEC&#8221;). FFIEC is a formal interagency body of the U.S. government empowered to prescribe uniform principles, standards, and report forms for the federal examination of financial institutions by the Federal Reserve Banks, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the CFPB, and to make recommendations to promote uniformity in the supervision of financial institutions. 

Tuition Payment Processing and Campus Commerce 

The Tuition Payment Processing and Campus Commerce operating segment provides tuition management services and school information software for K-12 schools and tuition management services and campus commerce solutions for higher education institutions. As a service provider that takes payment instructions from institutions and their constituents and sends them to bank partners, the Company is directly or indirectly subject to a variety of federal and state laws and regulations. The Company's contracts with clients and bank partners require the Company to comply with these laws and regulations. 

&#32;14 

The Company's payment processing services are subject to the EFTA and Regulation E, which govern automatic deposits to and withdrawals from deposit accounts and customers&#8217; rights and liabilities arising from the use of ATMs, debit cards, and certain other electronic banking services. The Company assists its bank partners with fulfilling their compliance obligations pursuant to these requirements. 

The Company's payment processing services are also subject to the National Automated Clearing House Association (&#8220;NACHA&#8221;) requirements, which include operating rules and sound risk management procedures to govern the use of the Automated Clearing House ("ACH") Network. These rules are used to ensure that the ACH Network is efficient, reliable, and secure for its members. Because the ACH Network uses a batch process, the importance of proper submissions by NACHA members is magnified. 

The Company is also impacted by laws and regulations that affect the bankcard industry. The Company is registered with Visa, MasterCard, American Express, and the Discover Network as a service provider and is subject to their respective rules. 

The Company's higher education institution clients are subject to the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (&#8220;FERPA&#8221;), which protects the privacy of student education records. The Company's higher education institution clients disclose certain non-directory information concerning their students to the Company, including contact information, student identification numbers, and the amount of students&#8217; credit balances pursuant to one or more exceptions under FERPA. Additionally, as the Company is indirectly subject to FERPA, it may not permit the transfer of any personally identifiable information to another party other than in a manner in which an educational institution may properly disclose it. While the Company believes that it has adequate policies and procedures in place to safeguard the privacy of such information, a breach of this prohibition could result in a five-year suspension of the Company's access to the related client&#8217;s records. The Company may also be subject to similar state laws and regulations that restrict higher education institutions from disclosing certain personally identifiable student information. 

Some of the Company's K-12 and higher education institution clients choose to charge convenience fees to students, parents, or other payers who make online payments using a credit or debit card. Laws and regulations related to such fees vary from state to state and certain states have laws that to varying degrees prohibit the imposition of a surcharge on a cardholder who elects to use a credit or debit card in lieu of cash, check, or other means. The Company works with its clients to ensure that it can continue to provide the services they demand, while ensuring the Company is in compliance with these laws and regulations. 

The CFPB has responsibility for regulating consumer financial products and services and enforcing most federal consumer protection laws in the area of financial services, including consumer credit and the prepaid card industry. The CFPB has proposed regulations regarding the prepaid card industry, which, if adopted as proposed, could impose significant additional disclosure requirements, overdraft requirements, and other requirements on the prepaid card industry. Similarly, other future actions of the CFPB could require further regulatory disclosures and changes to payment card practices, fees, routing, and other matters with respect to credit, debit, and prepaid cards. 

The Company's contracts with higher education institution clients also require us to comply with regulations promulgated by the Department regarding the handling of student financial aid funds received by institutions on behalf of their students under Title IV of the Higher Education Act. On October 30, 2015, the Department amended cash management and other regulations to ensure students have convenient access to their Title IV funds, do not incur unreasonable fees, and are not led to believe they must open a financial account to receive such funds. 

Asset Generation and Management 

The Dodd-Frank Act provides the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the "CFTC") and the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") with substantial authority to regulate over-the-counter derivative transactions, and includes provisions that require derivative transactions to be executed through an exchange or central clearinghouse. There are also new risk retention rules set to go into effect in the fourth quarter of 2016 that could affect future student loan asset-backed securitization transactions by requiring issuers of asset-backed securities or persons who organize and initiate asset-backed securities transactions to retain a portion of the underlying assets' credit risk, expand disclosure and reporting requirements for each tranche of asset-backed securities, including new loan-level data requirements, and expand disclosure requirements relating to the representations, warranties, and enforcement mechanisms available to investors. 

&#32;15 

Telecommunications 

The telecommunications business that we have entered through the acquisition of Allo on December 31, 2015 is subject to extensive federal, state, and local regulation. Under the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (&#8220;Telecommunications Act&#8221;), federal and state regulators share responsibility for implementing and enforcing statutes and regulations designed to encourage competition and to preserve and advance widely available, quality telephone service at affordable prices. 

At the federal level, the FCC generally exercises jurisdiction over facilities and services of local exchange carriers to the extent they are used to provide, originate, or terminate interstate or international communications. The FCC has the authority to condition, modify, cancel, terminate, or revoke operating authority for failure to comply with applicable federal laws or FCC rules, regulations, and policies. 

State regulatory commissions generally exercise jurisdiction over carriers&#8217; facilities and services to the extent they are used to provide, originate, or terminate intrastate communications. In addition, municipalities and other local government agencies regulate the public rights-of-way necessary to install and operate networks. 

The Communications Act of 1934 ("Communications Act") requires, among other things, that telecommunications carriers offer services at just and reasonable rates and on non-discriminatory terms and conditions. The 1996 amendments to the Communications Act, contained in the Telecommunications Act, dramatically changed, and likely will continue to change, the landscape of the telecommunications industry. The central aim of the Telecommunications Act is to open local telecommunications markets to competition while enhancing universal service. The Telecommunications Act imposes a number of interconnection and other requirements on all local communications providers. All telecommunications carriers have a duty to interconnect directly or indirectly with the facilities and equipment of other telecommunications carriers. 

The State of Nebraska Public Services Commission dictates service requirements and fees which have required Allo to obtain franchises from each incorporated municipality in which Allo operates. Allo is also required to obtain permits for street opening and construction, or for operating franchises to install and expand fiber optic facilities. These permits or other licenses or agreements typically require the payment of fees. 

Internet Services 

The provision of internet access services is not significantly regulated by either the FCC or the state commissions. However, the FCC has been moving toward the imposition of some controls on the provision of internet access. The FCC continues to assert that it has jurisdictional authority in some areas related to the promotion of an open internet. The extent of the FCC&#8217;s jurisdiction with respect to the internet has not been resolved, and the outcome could lead to increased costs for Allo in connection with its provision of internet services, and could affect Allo's ability to effectively compete. 

As the internet has matured, it has become the subject of increasing regulatory interest. Congress and federal regulators have adopted a wide range of measures directly or potentially affecting internet use, including, for example, consumer privacy, copyright protections, defamation liability, taxation, obscenity, and unsolicited commercial e-mail. Allo's internet services are subject to the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act ("CALEA") requirements regarding law enforcement surveillance. Content owners are now seeking additional legal mechanisms to combat copyright infringement over the internet. Pending and future legislation in this area could adversely affect Allo's operations as an ISP and its relationship with internet customers. Additionally, the FCC and Congress are considering subjecting internet access services to the Universal Service funding requirements. These funding requirements could impose significant new costs on Allo's high-speed internet service. Also, the FCC and some state regulatory commissions direct certain subsidies to telephone companies deploying broadband to areas deemed to be &#8220;unserved&#8221; or &#8220;underserved.&#8221; State and local governmental organizations have also adopted internet-related regulations. These various governmental jurisdictions are also considering additional regulations in these and other areas, such as privacy, pricing, service and product quality, and taxation. The adoption of new internet regulations or the adaptation of existing laws to the internet could adversely affect Allo's business. 

On June 12, 2015, the FCC Net Neutrality Order became effective. The new rules prohibit ISPs from engaging in blocking, throttling, and paid prioritization, and transparency rules compelling the disclosure of network management policies were enhanced. The FCC would also have authority under the proposed rules to hear complaints and take enforcement action if it determines that the interconnection activities of ISPs are not just and reasonable, or if ISPs fail to meet general obligations not to harm consumers or what are referred to as edge providers. Shortly after the regulations took effect, a telecommunications industry group sued to challenge the regulations. That case, United States Telecom Association v. FCC , is before the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. Oral arguments for the case were heard on December 4, 2015, and an opinion from the Court is forthcoming. 

&#32;16 

Allo does not know how the Court&#8217;s opinion will affect the regulations, whether the regulations will be subject to legal challenges in the future, or how the rules will actually be administered by the FCC, but such rules could limit Allo&#8217;s ability to efficiently manage its cable systems and respond to operational and competitive challenges. 

Television Services 

Federal regulations currently restrict the prices that cable systems charge for the minimum level of television programming service, referred to as &#8220;basic service,&#8221; and associated equipment. All other television service offerings are now universally exempt from rate regulation. Although basic service rate regulation operates pursuant to a federal formula, local governments, commonly referred to as local franchising authorities, are primarily responsible for administering this regulation. The majority of Allo's local franchising authorities have never been certified to regulate basic service cable rates (and order rate reductions and refunds), but they generally retain the right to do so (subject to potential regulatory limitations under state franchising laws), except in those specific communities facing &#8220;effective competition,&#8221; as defined under federal law. There have been frequent calls to impose expanded rate regulation on the cable industry. As a result of rapidly increasing cable programming costs, it is possible that Congress may adopt new constraints on the retail pricing or packaging of cable programming. Federal rate regulations currently include certain marketing restrictions that could affect Allo's pricing and packaging of service tiers and equipment. As Allo attempts to respond to a changing marketplace with competitive pricing practices, it may face regulations that impede its ability to compete. 

IPTV operations require state or local franchise or other authorization in order to provide cable service to customers. Allo is subject to regulation under a Communications Act framework that addresses such issues as the use of local streets and rights of way; the carriage of public, educational, and governmental channels; the provision of channel space for leased commercial access; the amount and payment of franchise fees; consumer protection; and similar issues. In addition, federal laws and FCC regulations place limits on the common ownership of cable systems and competing multichannel television distribution systems, and on the common ownership of cable systems and local telephone systems in the same geographic area. The FCC has recently expanded its oversight and regulation of the cable television-related matters. Federal law and regulations also affect numerous issues related to television programming and other content. Under federal law, certain local television broadcast stations (both commercial and non-commercial) can elect, every three years, to take advantage of rules that require a cable operator to distribute the station&#8217;s content to the cable system&#8217;s customers without charge, or to forego this &#8220;must-carry&#8221; obligation and to negotiate for carriage on an arm&#8217;s length contractual basis, which typically involves the payment of a fee by the cable operator, and sometimes involves other consideration as well. The current three year cycle began on January 1, 2015. Allo has successfully negotiated agreements with all of the local television broadcast stations that would have been eligible for &#8220;must carry&#8221; treatment in each of its current markets. The contractual relationships between cable operators and most providers of content who are not television broadcast stations generally are not subject to FCC oversight or other regulation. 

The Communications Act requires most utilities owning utility poles to provide access to poles and conduits, and subjects the rates charged for this access to either federal or state regulation. In 2011, the FCC amended its existing pole attachment rules to promote broadband deployment. The 2011 order allows for new penalties in certain cases involving unauthorized attachments, but generally strengthens the ability to access investor-owned utility poles on reasonable rates, terms, and conditions. 

Allo's IPTV systems are subject to a federal copyright compulsory license covering carriage of television and radio broadcast signals. The possible modification or elimination of this compulsory copyright license is the subject of continuing legislative proposals and administrative review and could adversely affect Allo's ability to obtain desired broadcast programming. Copyright clearances for non-broadcast programming services are arranged through private negotiations. IPTV operators also must obtain music rights for locally originated programming and advertising from the major music performing rights organizations. These licensing fees have been the source of litigation in the past, and license fee disputes may arise in the future. 

Telephone services 

Allo offers voice communications services over its broadband network. The FCC has ruled that competitive telephone companies are entitled to interconnect with incumbent providers of traditional telecommunications services, which ensures that its services can compete in the market. The scope of these interconnection rights are being reviewed in a current FCC proceeding, which may affect Allo's ability to compete in the provision of voice services or result in additional costs. The FCC has also declared that certain services are not subject to traditional state public utility regulation. The full extent of the FCC preemption of state and local regulation of services is not yet clear. In November 2011, the FCC released an order significantly changing the rules governing intercarrier compensation payments for the origination and termination of telephone traffic between carriers. These rules have resulted and will continue to result in a substantial decrease in intercarrier compensation payments over a multi-year period.

Corporate 

Governmental bodies in the United States and abroad have adopted, or are considering the adoption of, laws and regulations restricting the transfer of, and safeguarding, non-public personal information. For example, in the United States, the Company and our financial institution clients are, respectively, subject to the Federal Trade Commission&#8217;s and the federal banking regulators&#8217; privacy and information safeguarding requirements under the GLBA. The GLBA and Regulation P govern a financial institution&#8217;s treatment of nonpublic personal information about consumers and require that an institution, under certain circumstances, notify consumers about its privacy policies and practices. With certain exceptions, the GLBA prohibits a financial institution from disclosing a consumer&#8217;s nonpublic personal information to a nonaffiliated third-party unless the institution satisfies various notice requirements and the consumer does not elect to prevent, or &#8220;opt out of,&#8221; the disclosure. The GLBA also imposes specific requirements regarding the disclosure of customer account numbers and the reuse and redisclosure of information a financial institution provides to a third party. While the Company's operations are subject to certain provisions of these privacy laws, the Company has limited its use of consumer information solely to providing services to other businesses and financial institutions. The Company limits sharing of non-public personal information to that necessary to complete transactions on behalf of the consumer and to that permitted by federal and state laws. 

Intellectual Property 

The Company owns numerous trademarks and service marks (&#8220;Marks&#8221;) to identify its various products and services. As of December 31, 2015 , the Company had 51 &#32;registered Marks. The Company actively asserts its rights to these Marks when it believes infringement may exist. The Company believes its Marks have developed and continue to develop strong brand-name recognition in the industry and the consumer marketplace. Each of the Marks has, upon registration, an indefinite duration so long as the Company continues to use the Mark on or in connection with such goods or services as the Mark identifies. In order to protect the indefinite duration, the Company makes filings to continue registration of the Marks. The Company owns one patent application that has been published, but has not yet been issued, and has also actively asserted its rights thereunder in situations where the Company believes its claims may be infringed upon. The Company owns many copyright protected works, including its various computer system codes and displays, Web sites, books and other publications, and marketing materials. The Company also has trade secret rights to many of its processes and strategies and its software product designs. The Company's software products are protected by both registered and common law copyrights, as well as strict confidentiality and ownership provisions placed in license agreements, which restrict the ability to copy, distribute, or improperly disclose the software products. The Company also has adopted internal procedures designed to protect the Company's intellectual property. 

The Company seeks federal and/or state protection of intellectual property when deemed appropriate, including patent, trademark/service mark, and copyright. The decision whether to seek such protection may depend on the perceived value of the intellectual property, the likelihood of securing protection, the cost of securing and maintaining that protection, and the potential for infringement. The Company's employees are trained in the fundamentals of intellectual property, intellectual property protection, and infringement issues. The Company's employees are also required to sign agreements requiring, among other things, confidentiality of trade secrets, assignment of inventions, and non-solicitation of other employees post-termination. Consultants, suppliers, and other business partners are also required to sign nondisclosure agreements to protect the Company's proprietary rights. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015 , the Company had approximately 3,400 &#32;employees. None of the Company's employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. The Company is not involved in any material disputes with any of its employees, and the Company believes that relations with its employees are good.
