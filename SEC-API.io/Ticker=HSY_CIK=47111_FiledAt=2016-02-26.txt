 Item 1. 

BUSINESS 

The Hershey Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on October 24, 1927 as a successor to a business founded in 1894 by Milton S. Hershey. In this report, the terms &#8220;Hershey,&#8221; &#8220;Company,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us&#8221; or &#8220;our&#8221; mean The Hershey Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries and entities in which it has a controlling financial interest, unless the context indicates otherwise. 

We are the largest producer of quality chocolate in North America and a global leader in chocolate and non-chocolate confectionery. We market, sell and distribute our products under more than 80 brand names in approximately 70 countries worldwide. 

Reportable Segments 

Our organizational structure is designed to ensure continued focus on North America, coupled with an emphasis on accelerating growth in our focus international markets, as we continue to transform into a more global company. Our business is organized around geographic regions, which enables us to build processes for repeatable success in our global markets. The Presidents of our geographic regions, along with the Senior Vice President responsible for our Global Retail and Licensing business, are accountable for delivering our annual financial plans and report into our CEO, who serves as our Chief Operating Decision Maker (&#8220;CODM&#8221;), so we have defined our operating segments on a geographic basis. Our North America business currently generates over 87% of our consolidated revenue and none of our other geographic regions is individually significant. Therefore, we currently define our reportable segments as follows: 

&#8226; 

North America &#32;- This segment is responsible for our traditional chocolate and sugar confectionery market position, as well as our grocery and growing snacks market positions, in the United States and Canada. This includes developing and growing our business in chocolate and non-chocolate confectionery, refreshment, pantry, food service and other snacking product lines. 

&#8226; 

International and Other - This segment includes all other countries where we currently manufacture, import, market, sell or distribute chocolate and non-chocolate confectionery and other products. Currently, this includes our operations in China and other Asia markets, Latin America, Europe, Africa and the Middle East, along with exports to these regions. While a less significant component, this segment also includes our global retail operations, including Hershey&#8217;s Chocolate World stores in Hershey, Pennsylvania, New York City, Chicago, Las Vegas, Shanghai, Niagara Falls (Ontario), Dubai and Singapore, as well as operations associated with licensing the use of certain trademarks and products to third parties around the world. 

Financial and other information regarding our reportable segments is provided in our Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis and Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Business Acquisitions and Divestitures 

In March 2015, we completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of KRAVE Pure Foods, Inc. (&#8220;Krave&#8221;), manufacturer of KRAVE jerky, a leading all-natural snack brand of premium jerky products. The transaction was undertaken to enable us to tap into the rapidly growing meat snacks category and further expand into the broader snacks space. 

In September 2015, we acquired the non-controlling 49% interest in Hershey do Brasil, giving us 100% ownership of this business. 

In September 2014, we completed the acquisition of 80% of the outstanding shares of Shanghai Golden Monkey Food Joint Stock Co., Ltd. (&#8220;SGM&#8221;), a confectionery company based in Shanghai, China, whose product line is primarily sold through traditional trade channels. The acquisition was undertaken in order to leverage these traditional trade channels, which complement our traditional China chocolate business which is primarily distributed through Tier 1 or hypermarket channels. As discussed throughout 2015, SGM&#8217;s declining performance levels and the results of our assessment of the quality of SGM&#8217;s accounts receivables and existing distributor networks indicated the need to test the goodwill arising from the SGM acquisition for impairment and ultimately resulted in the recording of a $280.8 

million impairment charge as of the end of the third quarter 2015. We are directing our efforts currently on developing an integration plan that is focused on the optimal structure for top-line growth. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we entered into an agreement redefining the terms of acquisition for the remaining 20% of SGM, which remained subject to regulatory approval as of year-end. We completed the purchase of the remaining 20% on February 3, 2016. 

In 2014, we also acquired all of the outstanding shares of The Allan Candy Company Limited (&#8220;Allan&#8221;) headquartered in Ontario, Canada and a controlling interest in Lotte Shanghai Food Company, a joint venture established in 2007 in China for the purpose of manufacturing and selling product to the joint venture partners. These acquisitions provide us with additional manufacturing and distribution capacity to serve primarily the North America and Asia markets, respectively. 

In March 2015, we completed the sale of Mauna Loa Macadamia Nut Corporation (&#8220;Mauna Loa&#8221;). 

Products 

Our principal confectionery offerings include chocolate and non-chocolate confectionery products; gum and mint refreshment products; pantry items, such as baking ingredients, toppings and beverages; and snack items such as spreads, meat snacks, bars and snack bites and mixes. 

&#8226; 

Within our North America markets, our product portfolio includes a wide variety of chocolate offerings marketed and sold under the renowned brands of Hershey&#8217;s , Reese&#8217;s , and Kisses , along with other popular chocolate and non-chocolate confectionery brands such as Jolly Rancher , Almond Joy , Brookside , Cadbury, &#32; Good &#38; Plenty , Heath , Kit Kat , Lancaster , Payday , Rolo , Twizzlers , Whoppers &#32;and York . We also offer premium chocolate products, primarily in the U.S., through the Scharffen Berger &#32;and Dagoba &#32;brands. Our gum and mint products include Ice Breakers &#32;mints and chewing gum, Breathsavers &#32;mints, and Bubble Yum &#32;bubble gum. Our pantry and snack items that are principally sold in North America include baking products and toppings and sundae syrups sold under the Hershey&#8217;s , Reese&#8217;s &#32;and Heath &#32;brands, as well as Hershey&#8217;s &#32;and Reese&#8217;s &#32;chocolate spreads and snack bites and mixes, Krave &#32;meat jerky products and Brookside &#32;fruit and nut bars. 

&#8226; 

Within our International and Other markets, we manufacture, market and sell many of these same brands, as well as other brands that are marketed regionally, such as Golden Monkey &#32;confectionery and snack products in China, Pelon Pelo Rico &#32;confectionery products in Mexico, IO-IO &#32;snack products in Brazil, and Nutrine &#32;and Maha Lacto &#32;confectionery products and Jumpin &#32;and Sofit &#32;beverage products in India. 

Principal Customers and Marketing Strategy 

Our customers are mainly wholesale distributors, chain grocery stores, mass merchandisers, chain drug stores, vending companies, wholesale clubs, convenience stores, dollar stores, concessionaires and department stores. The majority of our customers, with the exception of wholesale distributors, resell our products to end-consumers in retail outlets in North America and other locations worldwide. 

In 2015 , approximately 26% &#32;of our consolidated net sales were made to McLane Company, Inc., one of the largest wholesale distributors in the United States to convenience stores, drug stores, wholesale clubs and mass merchandisers and the primary distributor of our products to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. 

The foundation of our marketing strategy is our strong brand equities, product innovation and the consistently superior quality of our products. We devote considerable resources to the identification, development, testing, manufacturing and marketing of new products. We utilize a variety of promotional programs directed towards our customers, as well as advertising and promotional programs for consumers of our products, to stimulate sales of certain products at various times throughout the year. 

In conjunction with our sales and marketing efforts, our efficient product distribution network helps us maintain sales growth and provide superior customer service by facilitating the shipment of our products from our manufacturing plants to strategically located distribution centers. We primarily use common carriers to deliver our products from these distribution points to our customers. 

Raw Materials and Pricing 

Cocoa products, including cocoa liquor, cocoa butter and cocoa powder processed from cocoa beans, are the most significant raw materials we use to produce our chocolate products. These cocoa products are purchased directly from third-party suppliers, who source cocoa beans that are grown principally in Far Eastern, West African, Central and South American regions. West Africa accounts for approximately 70% of the world&#8217;s supply of cocoa beans. 

Adverse weather, crop disease, political unrest and other problems in cocoa-producing countries have caused price fluctuations in the past, but have never resulted in the total loss of a particular producing country&#8217;s cocoa crop and/or exports. In the event that a significant disruption occurs in any given country, we believe cocoa from other producing countries and from current physical cocoa stocks in consuming countries would provide a significant supply buffer. 

We also use substantial quantities of sugar, Class II fluid dairy milk, peanuts, almonds and energy in our production process. Most of these inputs for our domestic and Canadian operations are purchased from suppliers in the United States. For our international operations, inputs not locally available may be imported from other countries. 

We change prices and weights of our products when necessary to accommodate changes in input costs, the competitive environment and profit objectives, while at the same time maintaining consumer value. Price increases and weight changes help to offset increases in our input costs, including raw and packaging materials, fuel, utilities, transportation costs and employee benefits. When we implement price increases, there is usually a time lag between the effective date of the list price increases and the impact of the price increases on net sales, in part because we typically honor previous commitments to planned consumer and customer promotions and merchandising events subsequent to the effective date of the price increases. In addition, promotional allowances may be increased subsequent to the effective date, delaying or partially offsetting the impact of price increases on net sales. 

Competition 

Many of our brands enjoy wide consumer acceptance and are among the leading brands sold in the marketplace in North America and certain markets in Latin America. We sell our brands in highly competitive markets with many other global multinational, national, regional and local firms. Some of our competitors are large companies with significant resources and substantial international operations. Competition in our product categories is based on product innovation, product quality, price, brand recognition and loyalty, effectiveness of marketing and promotional activity, the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences, as well as convenience and service. 

Seasonality and Backlog 

Our sales are typically higher during the third and fourth quarters of the year, representing seasonal and holiday-related sales patterns. We manufacture primarily for stock and typically fill customer orders within a few days of receipt. Therefore, the backlog of any unfilled orders is not material to our total annual sales. 

Trademarks, Service Marks and License Agreements 

We own various registered and unregistered trademarks and service marks. The trademarks covering our key product brands are of material importance to our business. We follow a practice of seeking trademark protection in the U.S. and other key international markets where our products are sold. We also grant trademark licenses to third parties to produce and sell pantry items, flavored milks and various other products primarily under the Hershey&#8217;s &#32;and Reese&#8217;s &#32;brand names. 

Furthermore, we have rights under license agreements with several companies to manufacture and/or sell and distribute certain products. Our rights under these agreements are extendible on a long-term basis at our option. Our most significant licensing agreements are as follows:

Research and Development 

We engage in a variety of research and development activities in a number of countries, including the United States, Mexico, Brazil, India and China. We develop new products, improve the quality of existing products, improve and modernize production processes, and develop and implement new technologies to enhance the quality and value of both current and proposed product lines. Information concerning our research and development expense is contained in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Food Quality and Safety Regulation 

The manufacture and sale of consumer food products is highly regulated. In the United States, our activities are subject to regulation by various government agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration, the Department of Agriculture, the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Commerce and the Environmental Protection Agency, as well as various state and local agencies. Similar agencies also regulate our businesses outside of the United States. 

We believe our Product Excellence Program provides us with an effective product quality and safety program. This program is integral to our global supply chain platform and is intended to ensure that all products we purchase, manufacture and distribute are safe, are of high quality and comply with applicable laws and regulations. 

Through our Product Excellence Program, we evaluate the supply chain including ingredients, packaging, processes, products, distribution and the environment to determine where product quality and safety controls are necessary. We identify risks and establish controls intended to ensure product quality and safety. Various government agencies and third-party firms as well as our quality assurance staff conduct audits of all facilities that manufacture our products to assure effectiveness and compliance with our program and applicable laws and regulations. 

Environmental Considerations 

We make routine operating and capital expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations. These annual expenditures are not material with respect to our results of operations, capital expenditures or competitive position. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015 , we employed approximately 19,060 full-time and 1,650 part-time employees worldwide. Collective bargaining agreements covered approximately 5,930 employees. During 2016 , agreements will be negotiated for certain employees at four facilities outside of the United States, comprising approximately 73% of total employees under collective bargaining agreements. We believe that our employee relations are generally good. 

Financial Information by Geographic Area 

Our principal operations and markets are located in the United States. The percentage of total consolidated net sales for our businesses outside of the United States was 17.2% &#32;for 2015 , 19.2% &#32;for 2014 &#32;and 18.4% &#32;for 2013 . The percentage of total long-lived assets outside of the United States was 31.8% &#32;as of December 31, 2015 &#32;and 31.3% &#32;as of December 31, 2014 . 

Corporate Social Responsibility 

Our founder, Milton S. Hershey, established an enduring model of responsible citizenship while creating a successful business. Driving sustainable business practices, making a difference in our communities, and operating with the highest integrity are vital parts of our heritage. We continue this legacy today by providing high quality products while conducting our business in a socially responsible and environmentally sustainable manner. Each year we publish a full corporate social responsibility (&#8220;CSR&#8221;) report which provides an update on the progress we have made in advancing our CSR priorities such as food safety, responsible sourcing of ingredients, corporate transparency, our new focus on improving basic nutrition to help children learn and grow and our continued investment in the communities where we live and work. 

In 2015, Hershey efforts were again recognized for its environmental, social, and governance performance by being named to both the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index and the North America Index. The company was also honored as one of Corporate Responsibility &#32;magazine&#8217;s 100 Best Corporate Citizens, and as a 2015 World&#8217;s Most Ethical Company &#174; &#32;by the Ethisphere Institute.
