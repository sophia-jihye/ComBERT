Other undeveloped property in New Mexico of AMREP Southwest and its subsidiaries as of July 1, 2016 included approximately 17,000 acres, of which approximately 20% was property that AMREP Southwest and its subsidiaries had 90% contiguous ownership, 30% was property that AMREP Southwest and its subsidiaries had at least 50% but less than 90% contiguous ownership and 50% was property that AMREP Southwest and its subsidiaries had less than 50% contiguous ownership. High contiguous ownership areas are suitable for special assessment districts or city redevelopment areas that may allow for future development under the auspices of local government. Low contiguous ownership areas may require the purchase of a sufficient number of adjoining lots to create tracts suitable for development or that may be offered for sale individually or in small groups.

&#160;

&#160;

2 Developed lots/acreage include any tracts of land that have been entitled with infrastructure work that is substantially complete.

&#160;

3 Acreage under development includes real estate for which entitlement or infrastructure work is currently being completed. However, there is no assurance that the acreage under development will be developed because of the nature and cost of the approval and development process and market demand for a particular use. In addition, the mix of residential and commercial acreage under development may change prior to final development. The development of this acreage will require significant additional financing or other sources of funding, which may not be available.

&#160;

4 There is no assurance that undeveloped acreage will be developed because of the nature and cost of the approval and development process and market demand for a particular use. Undeveloped acreage includes real estate that can be sold &#8220;as is&#8221; (e.g., where no entitlement or infrastructure work has begun on such property).

In July 2016, at the request of AMREP Southwest, the City of Rio Rancho approved the formation of a public improvement district over a portion of the Lomas Encantadas subdivision and a portion of the Enchanted Hills/Commerce Center subdivision. The public improvement district is expected, over a period of at least thirty years commencing in fiscal year 2018, to reimburse AMREP Southwest for certain on-site and off-site costs of developing the subdivisions by imposing a special levy on the real property owners within the district.

&#160;

In addition, during 2016, AMREP Southwest began the process of developing certain of its commercial properties in Rio Rancho to be leased to tenants. Any such development will require, among other things, additional financing or other sources of funding, which may not be available, and the ability to attract appropriate tenants. During 2016, a subsidiary of AMREP Southwest constructed an approximately 2,200 square foot, single tenant retail building on property owned by the Company pursuant to a lease with a national retailer of specialty coffee, with lease revenue commencing at the end of 2016. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, the Company sold this property and received approximately $1,466,000 after expenses and payment in full of the outstanding principal balance of the loan associated with the development of the property.

&#160;

The continuity and future growth of the Company&#8217;s real estate business, if the Company pursues such growth, will require that the Company acquire new properties in or near Rio Rancho or expand to other markets to provide sufficient assets to support a meaningful real estate development business.

&#160;

AMREP Southwest and its subsidiaries compete with other owners and developers of land in the Rio Rancho and Albuquerque area that offer for sale developed and undeveloped residential lots and sites for commercial/industrial use.

Other Real Estate Interests 

&#160;

A subsidiary of AMREP Southwest owns two tracts of land and certain subsurface oil, gas and mineral interests in Colorado, including one property of approximately 160 acres planned for approximately 410 homes and two properties of approximately 5 acres each zoned for commercial use. In addition, in Rio Rancho, AMREP Southwest and its subsidiaries own subsurface oil, gas and mineral interests in approximately 55,000 &#8220;surface&#8221; acres of land owned by AMREP Southwest and its subsidiaries or by others in Rio Rancho.

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s Fulfillment Services business performs services for consumer publications, trade (business) publications, membership organizations, non-profit organizations, government agencies and other direct marketers.

&#160;

As of April 30, 2016, the Company&#8217;s Fulfillment Services business maintained databases of approximately 21 million active subscribers for its clients. In a typical month, the Company&#8217;s Fulfillment Services business produces or provides data for approximately 15 million mailing labels for its clients and processes over 7 million pieces of outgoing mail for them. Total revenues for the Company&#8217;s Fulfillment Services business were $34,757,000 for 2016.

&#160;

There are a number of companies that perform fulfillment and contact center services for consumer publications, trade (business) publications, membership organizations, non-profit organizations, government agencies and other direct marketers and with which the Company&#8217;s Fulfillment Services business competes, including two fulfillment service providers that are larger than the Company&#8217;s Fulfillment Services business. There is intense competition to obtain fulfillment and contact center services customers.
