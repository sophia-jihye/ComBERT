 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

&#160;

In this Annual Report on Form 10-K, or this &#8220;report,&#8221; we refer to AG Mortgage Investment Trust, Inc. as &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; &#8220;the Company,&#8221; or &#8220;our,&#8221; unless we specifically state otherwise or the context indicates otherwise. We refer to our external manager, AG REIT Management, LLC, as our &#8220;Manager,&#8221; and we refer to the parent company of our Manager, Angelo, Gordon &#38; Co., L.P. as &#8220;Angelo, Gordon.&#8221; 

&#160; 

Our company 

&#160;

We are a Maryland corporation focused on investing in, acquiring and managing a diversified portfolio of residential mortgage assets, other real estate-related securities and financial assets, which we refer to as our target assets. We conduct our operations to qualify and be taxed as a real estate investment trust, or REIT, for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxes on our taxable income that we distribute currently to our stockholders as long as we maintain our intended qualification as a REIT. We also operate our business in a manner that permits us to maintain our exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the Investment Company Act.

&#160; 

Our Portfolio 

&#160;

The majority of our portfolio is comprised of mortgage-backed securities, specifically residential mortgage-backed securities, or RMBS. Certain of the assets in our RMBS portfolio have an explicit guarantee of principal and interest by a U.S. government agency such as the Government National Mortgage Association, or Ginnie Mae, or a government-sponsored entity such as the Federal National Mortgage Association, or Fannie Mae, or the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, or Freddie Mac ( collectively, &#8220;GSEs&#8221;). We refer to these securities as Agency RMBS. Our Agency RMBS investments include mortgage pass-through securities, securities entitling the holder only to the interest payments made on the mortgages underlying certain MBS (&#8220;interest-only strips&#8221;), collateralized mortgage obligations (&#8220;CMOs&#8221;), and certain Agency RMBS for which the underlying collateral is not identified until shortly (generally two days) before the purchase or sale settlement date (&#8220;TBAs&#8221;).

&#160;

Our portfolio also includes a significant portion of RMBS that are not issued or guaranteed by Ginnie Mae or a GSE, which we refer to as Non-Agency RMBS. Our Non-Agency RMBS investments may include investment grade and non-investment grade fixed- and floating-rate securities. We categorize our Non-Agency RMBS by credit score at origination into Prime, Alt-A and Subprime. Our RMBS Interest Only securities (Non-Agency RMBS backed by interest-only strips), CRTs (defined below), RPL/NPL MBS, (described below), and Securitized Whole Loans, (described below) represent our Non-Agency RMBS not categorized by credit score at origination.

&#160;

Credit Risk Transfer securities (&#8220;CRTs&#8221;) are unguaranteed and unsecured mezzanine, junior mezzanine and first loss securities issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to decrease their exposure to mortgage default risk. The securities reference a pool of recently acquired single family mortgages from a specified time period. The risk of loss on the reference pool of mortgages is transferred to investors who may experience losses when credit events such as defaults, liquidations or delinquencies occur. The notes pay an uncapped floating rate spread over one-month LIBOR.

&#160;

RPL/NPL MBS are mortgage-backed securities collateralized by re-performing mortgage loans (&#8220;RPL&#8221;) or non-performing mortgage loans (&#8220;NPL&#8221;). The RPL/NPL MBS that we own represent the senior and mezzanine tranches in such securitizations. These RPL/NPL MBS are structured with significant credit enhancement (typically approximately 50% to the senior tranche and 40% to the mezzanine tranche) to mitigate our exposure to credit risk on these securities. &#8220;Credit enhancement&#8221; refers to the amount of subordination available to absorb all credit losses prior to losses being allocated to more senior tranches. Subordinate tranches typically receive no cash flow (interest or principal) until the senior and mezzanine tranches are paid off. In addition, the RPL/NPL MBS that we own typically contain an &#8220;interest rate step-up&#8221; feature, whereby the interest rate or &#8220;coupon&#8221; on the senior tranche increases by typically 300 basis points or typically 400 basis points in the case of mezzanine tranches (a &#8220;step up&#8221;) that begin to take effect if the security that we hold has not been redeemed or repurchased by the issuer within 36 months of issuance. We expect that the combination of the priority cash flow of the senior tranche and the 36-month step-up will result in these securities exhibiting short average lives and, accordingly, reduced interest rate sensitivity.

&#160;

&#160; 4 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Securitized Whole Loans are residential mortgage loans (generally RPLs or NPLs) in securitized form that we purchase from a related party or parties. The securitizations typically take the form of various classes of notes and a trust certificate. Securitized Whole Loans do not include RPLs or NPLs that we hold through interests in certain consolidated trusts.

&#160;

We have also invested in other target assets, including asset backed securities, or ABS, and commercial mortgage-backed securities, or CMBS. Our CMBS portfolio includes CMBS interest only securities (CMBS backed by interest-only strips) and Freddie Mac K-Series CMBS (described below). 

&#160;

Freddie Mac K-Series CMBS (&#8220;K-Series CMBS&#8221;) include CMBS, CMBS interest only and CMBS principal only securities which are regularly-issued structured pass-through securities backed by multifamily mortgage loans. K-Series CMBS feature a wide range of investor options which include guaranteed senior and interest only bonds as well as unguaranteed mezzanine, subordinate and interest only bonds which are issued by Freddie Mac. Our K-Series CMBS portfolio includes unguaranteed senior, mezzanine, subordinate and interest only bonds. In Item 7, we have categorized Freddie Mac K-Series CMBS interest only bonds as part of our &#8220;CMBS Interest Only&#8221; assets.

&#160;

We have also invested in residential and commercial mortgage loans, including RPLs and NPLs, as well as excess mortgage servicing rights (&#8220;MSRs&#8221;). We have the discretion to invest in other target assets such as other real estate structured finance products, other real estate-related loans and securities and interests in certain types of real estate. Non-Agency RMBS, ABS, CMBS, MSRs and residential and commercial mortgage loans are referred to as our &#8220;credit portfolio&#8221;, or &#8220;credit investments&#8221;, and residential and commercial mortgage loans are collectively referred to as loans. We use the term &#8220;credit securities&#8221; to refer to our credit portfolio excluding loans and MSRs. Additionally, we use the term &#8220;real estate securities&#8221; or &#8220;securities&#8221; to refer to our Agency RMBS portfolio and our credit securities.

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015 and per our GAAP consolidated balance sheet, we have a $2.8 billion investment portfolio comprised of real estate securities, loans and MSRs, which consists of $1.2 billion, or 43.4%, of Agency RMBS and $1.6 billion, or 56.6%, of assets in our credit portfolio. Our investment portfolio including TBAs in the Agency RMBS category and inclusive of investments held within affiliated entities in the credit investments category is $2.9 billion, which consists of $1.3 billion, or 44.2%, of Agency RMBS and $1.6 billion, or 55.8%, of assets in our credit portfolio. Refer to Note 3 in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2015 (&#8220;Annual Report&#8221;) for a discussion of investments held within affiliated entities. We utilize multiple hedging instruments as a means to mitigate interest rate risk. As of December 31, 2015 we had entered into $1.0 billion notional amount of interest rate swaps and $226.0 million notional amount of long positions in U.S. Treasury securities. This compares with a $3.3 billion investment portfolio as of December 31, 2014, comprised of real estate securities, loans, and MSRs, which consisted of $1.8 billion, or 55.2%, of Agency RMBS and $1.5 billion, or 44.8%, of assets in our credit portfolio per our GAAP consolidated balance sheet. Our investment portfolio including TBAs in the Agency RMBS category and gross of linked transactions and investments held within affiliated entities in the credit investments category was $3.7 billion, which consisted of $2.0 billion, or 55.4% of Agency RMBS and $1.7 billion, or 44.6%, of assets in our credit portfolio as of December 31, 2014. We had entered into $1.4 billion notional amount of interest rate swaps as of December 31, 2014. The Company had no positions in U.S. Treasury securities on December 31, 2014.

&#160; 

Our stock 

&#160;

We were incorporated in Maryland on March 1, 2011, and commenced operations in July 2011 when we successfully completed our initial public offering, or IPO. Concurrently with the consummation of our IPO, we completed a private placement offering of units to a limited number of investors qualifying as &#8220;accredited investors&#8221; under Rule 501 of Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act. Each unit consisted of one share of common stock (&#8220;private placement share&#8221;) and a warrant (&#8220;private placement warrant&#8221;) to purchase 0.5 of a share of common stock. Each private placement warrant had an exercise price of $20.50 per share (as adjusted for reorganizations, reclassifications, consolidations, mergers, sales, transfers or other dispositions). Collectively, we received net proceeds from our IPO, the private placement and the exercise of the underwriters&#8217; over-allotment option of approximately $198.1 million after subtracting expenses incurred.

&#160;

In 2012 we raised (i) approximately $353.5 million in net proceeds from sales of common stock through public offerings, our equity distribution program, and the exercise of warrants and (ii) approximately $161.2 million in net proceeds from two preferred stock offerings. In 2013 we raised approximately $33.2 million in net proceeds from sales of common stock through our equity distribution program and upon the exercise of warrants. We did not sell any additional shares of common stock in 2014 or 2015 through public offerings. We did not issue any additional classes of preferred stock during 2013, 2014 or 2015.

&#160;

&#160; 5 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

In November 2015, our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program (the &#8220;Repurchase Program&#8221;) to repurchase up to $25.0 million of our outstanding common stock. The Repurchase Program does not have an expiration date. As of December 31, 2015, we repurchased 126,715 shares of common stock at a total cost of approximately $1.7 million and at an average cost per share of $13.19. As of December 31, 2015, approximately $23.3 million of common stock remained authorized for future share repurchases under the Repurchase Program. See Item 5 for more detail.

&#160;

Our common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange, or NYSE, under the ticker symbol MITT . Our 8.25% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock and our 8.00% Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock trade on the NYSE under the ticker symbols MITT-PA and MITT-PB, respectively. 

&#160; 

Our manager 

&#160;

Market and interest rate trends 

&#160; 

Residential market opportunities 

&#160; 

Inclusive of distressed sales, home prices nationwide increased by 6.3 percent on a year-over-year basis in December 2015 as compared with December 2014, according to data released by CoreLogic. This marks the 46th consecutive monthly increase year-over-year in national home prices. The housing market remains strong, however, given the duration and strength of the recovery, additional over-performance is expected to be somewhat muted for the rest of 2016. The U.S. government agencies and central bank policy sponsorship of housing via lower mortgage rates and potential loosening of credit available to potential homeowners, coupled with a stable broader domestic economy, have provided some support for the housing market recovery.

&#160;

According to CoreLogic, the percent of all residential properties with a mortgage that was in a negative equity position, or underwater, decreased in the third quarter of 2015 to 8.1%, or 4.1 million homes, from 8.7%, or 4.4 million homes, in the prior quarter. A homeowner with negative equity means that such homeowner owes more on the home than the home is worth, which is also referred to as being underwater. For much of the country, the negative equity epidemic that developed during the 2008-2009 recession is lifting due to the rise in home prices over the past three years. CoreLogic predicts home prices will rise an additional 5.0% in 2016. If this occurs, 800,000 homeowners could regain positive equity. Additionally, credit performance in terms of serious delinquencies and subsequent default rates continued to improve in 2015 and is anticipated to remain positive in the near future. We believe that current prices for certain Non-Agency RMBS offer attractive risk-adjusted returns. We believe Angelo, Gordon&#8217;s granular credit-centric approach and deep understanding of government public policy initiatives will provide our Manager strong insight into both Non-Agency and Agency RMBS performance drivers.

&#160;

During the fourth quarter of 2014, the Federal Open Market Committee (&#8220;FOMC&#8221;) officially exited its large scale asset purchase program, commonly referred to as quantitative easing (QE). However, it continued to maintain its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of Agency RMBS into new purchases of Agency RMBS and of rolling over maturing U.S. Treasury securities at auction through an unspecified date in the future.

&#160;

&#160; 6 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

In December 2015, the FOMC decided to raise interest rates by 0.25%, marking the end of a seven year period where the federal funds rate was held near zero to support the recovery of the economy from the financial crisis. The FOMC stated that the process of normalizing interest rates is likely to proceed gradually and future policy actions depend on how the economy evolves relative to the FOMC&#8217;s objectives of maximum employment and 2% inflation. In the aftermath of the FOMC&#8217;s announcement, increases in funding costs put downward pressure on net interest margin.

&#160;

The Federal Reserve (the &#8220;Fed&#8221;), in its December 16, 2015 announcement, cautioned capital markets to anticipate the possibility of one or more additional increases in the Federal funds rate in 2016, depending on future growth in inflation and other economic indicators. Fed Chair Janet Yellen, in her remarks following the December FOMC policy meeting, stated that monetary policy remains &#8220;accommodative&#8221; following the initial rise in the Federal funds rate. Together with increasingly negative economic data reported to date in 2016, many market participants are increasingly skeptical of additional increases in the Federal funds rate in the foreseeable future. Ultimately, the nature of the economic data we receive in the coming quarters, and the market&#8217;s interpretation of the Federal Reserve&#8217;s response to that data will drive direction, magnitude and volatility of benchmark interest rates and the related fixed income markets.

&#160;

The initial reading on fourth quarter GDP decelerated to 0.7% as compared to 2.0% in the third quarter. Weighing on activity was a modest slowdown in personal consumption expenditures, continued weakness in fixed investment due to sharp declines in the oil and gas industry, and the ongoing decline in private inventory growth rates in response to the excess accumulation of inventories in prior periods. On a positive note, residential fixed investment continues to grow at a healthy rate (8.1% annual rate in Q4) in response to modestly robust housing demand and relatively low levels of housing inventory.

&#160;

In December 2015, non-farm payrolls expanded at 292,000 jobs per month, increasing the three month moving average to 284,000 per month. Most indicators of housing activity continue to show slow but steady progress. While the consumption component of GDP data in recent quarters has been encouraging, fourth quarter retail sales readings have lost momentum. Consumption came in softer at 2.2% in the fourth quarter versus 3.0% in the third quarter. Generally, consumption appears to be on solid footing but overall GDP growth is being constrained by a lack of investment and a slowing inventory growth rate. Manufacturing activity and exports continue to suffer from dollar strength and weigh down overall activity in the fourth quarter. On the inflation front, core Personal Consumption Expenditures (&#8220;PCE&#8221;) and average hourly earnings continue to fall short of where the Fed would like to see them.

&#160;

Credit markets experienced a tough fourth quarter of 2015, and it was a disappointing second half of 2015 for RMBS and ABS assets. Credit concerns, underperformance and lack of liquidity in other credit markets overwhelmed the mortgage and asset backed sectors. MBS and ABS credit spreads widened during the quarter as fears of a global contagion from China&#8217;s economic slowdown accelerated, the price of oil continued to slide and a lack of liquidity spread across most capital markets. Primary issuance of MBS was anemic and many issuers were forced to postpone new offerings until the market demand improved. By December the majority of market participants were relatively inactive for the rest of the year, with scant interest in positioning securities or making markets.

&#160;

Agency MBS had a difficult fourth quarter versus swap hedges. Continuing the trend that began in the third quarter of 2015, interest rate swaps used for interest rate hedging by most mortgage and ABS investors outperformed both MBS and credit securities. As a result, the spread on MBS and ABS assets, relative to our interest rate swap hedges widened, during the quarter, driving a decline in book value. The driving forces behind swap spread outperformance of both benchmark treasuries and spread products continued to be corporate bond issuance, global cross border capital movements and related selling of US dollar denominated reserve assets to holders that are more likely to require bank balance sheet funding.

&#160;

Non-mortgage consumer credit experienced some divergence in performance between credit card delinquencies, which remained at historical lows, and defaults on auto, equipment and student loans, which increased modestly. Consumer mortgage credit continued its pattern of stable to modest improvement in borrower performance. Home prices also continued to modestly rise and inventory levels remain light to tight in many major markets. Consumer appetite for housing continued to remain stable with expanding mortgage credit availability taking hold in the markets.

&#160;

The rise in savings rates since the financial crisis, continued low interest rates, steady employment gains and most recently a decline in energy costs have all contributed to significant improvement in the consumer&#8217;s balance sheet. This continues to fuel our optimism about the prospects of further housing recovery and longer term moderate home price appreciation. The U.S. housing market still benefits from favorable supply/demand dynamics, historically low mortgage rates and willingness on the part of federal regulators at the Federal Housing Finance Agency (&#8220;FHFA&#8221;) to further credit expansion and assist household formation. However, we expect that, without an increase in median income, the pace of home price appreciation is likely to moderate over the coming years.

&#160;

&#160; 7 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

The market movements outlined above have had a meaningful impact on our existing portfolio and may also have a significant impact on our operating results going forward. We believe current market dynamics may impact the availability and cost of financing.

&#160;

We expect that overall market conditions will continue to impact our operating results and will cause us to adjust our investment and financing strategies over time as new opportunities emerge and risk profiles of our business change.

&#160; 

Recent government activity 

&#160;

On January 12, 2016, the FHFA issued RIN 2590-AA39, Members of Federal Home Loan Banks (the &#8220;Final Rule&#8221;). The Final Rule, among other things, expressly excludes captive insurance companies, such as MITT Insurance Company LLC (&#8220;MITT Insurance&#8221;), from being eligible for membership in the Federal Home Loan Bank (the &#8220;FHLB&#8221;) system. Under the Final Rule, there is a one-year transition period from the effective date, February 19, 2016 (the &#8220;Effective Date&#8221;) within which the FHLB must wind down its relationships with any captive insurance companies that had been admitted to membership in the FHLB on or after September 12, 2014, including MITT Insurance (&#8220;Excluded Captives&#8221;). The Final Rule also prevents the FHLB from making any new advances or extending any existing advances to Excluded Captives after the Effective Date. In addition, upon the termination of membership, the FHLB must liquidate all outstanding advances to Excluded Captives, settle all other business transactions, and repurchase or redeem all FHLB stock held by the terminated Excluded Captive in accordance with the Final Rule. Therefore, MITT Insurance, along with all other Excluded Captives, must completely wind down all business relationships with the FHLB, including the repayment of all outstanding advances, prior to or simultaneously with the termination of MITT Insurance&#8217;s membership with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati (the &#8220;FHLBC&#8221;) where it is a member.

&#160;

The adopting release for the Final Rule expressly invited Congress to address the treatment of Excluded Captives with respect to membership in the FHLB. In October 2015, Reps. Blaine Luetkemeyer (R-Mo.), Denny Heck (D-Wash.), Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.) and John Carney (D-Del.) introduced H.R. 3808, a bill that would have preemptively prevented the FHFA from adopting the Final Rule. There can be no way of predicting if any subsequent legislation addressing the status of Excluded Captives with respect to the FHLB will be proposed in either house of Congress, the likelihood of passage of any such legislation, or the ultimate effects, if any, on the availability of short-term, low-cost funding provided by the FHLBs to Excluded Captives subsequent to the enactment of any such legislation.

&#160;

Housing finance reform proposals relating to Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae are expected to remain prominent topics during the 114 th U.S. Congress which began on January 3, 2015. Restructuring or winding down Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac had been stated goals of both houses of Congress, and also the Obama administration, during the 113 th U.S. Congress.

&#160;

On June 25, 2013, Senators Bob Corker (R-TN) and Mark Warner (D-VA) sponsored the Housing Finance Reform and Taxpayer Protection Act of 2013 (the &#8220;Corker-Warner Bill&#8221;) into the U.S. Senate. While the Corker-Warner Bill appeared to have lost momentum after the introduction of a competing bill in 2014, the Corker-Warner Bill was re-introduced in the U.S. Senate in September 2015 by its original sponsors, joined by Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and David Vitter (R-LA). As originally drafted, the Corker-Warner Bill has three key provisions:

&#160;

&#8226; the establishment of the Federal Mortgage Insurance Corporation (the &#8220;FMIC&#8221;); &#160;

&#8226; the creation of a Mortgage Insurance Fund (the &#8220;Fund&#8221;); and &#160;

&#8226; the wind-down of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. &#160;

The FMIC would be a government guarantor modeled after the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the &#8220;FDIC&#8221;) in that it would collect insurance premiums and maintain a deposit fund on all outstanding obligations. Every mortgage-backed security issued through the FMIC would have a private investor bearing the first risk of loss and holding at least $0.10 in equity capital for every dollar of risk. This private capital buffer is intended to protect taxpayers from the risk of default on the mortgages underlying securities issued by the FMIC. Thus, the ultimate purpose of the FMIC would be to require credit investors to bear the initial risk of default on MBS.

&#160;

&#160; 8 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

The Federal Housing Finance Authority (the &#8220;FHFA&#8221;) would be abolished after the establishment of the FMIC, and all current responsibilities of the FHFA, as well as its resources, would be transferred to the FMIC. In particular, the Corker-Warner Bill specifies that the FMIC would maintain a database of uniform loan-level information on eligible mortgages, develop standard uniform securitization agreements and oversee the common securitization platform currently being developed by the FHFA. In the event losses due to default on underlying mortgages exceed the first position losses of private credit investors in securities issued by the FMIC, the FMIC would cover such losses out of the Fund (described below). The Corker-Warner Bill specifies that the FMIC would endeavor to attain a reserve balance of 1.25% of the aggregate outstanding principal balance of covered securities within five years of the establishment of the FMIC and 2.50% of such amount within ten years of the establishment of the FMIC. The Fund would be paid with insurance premiums, akin to user fees, paid by private investors with various reporting requirements. The Corker-Warner Bill would revoke the charters of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac upon the establishment of the FMIC. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac would wind down as expeditiously as possible while maximizing returns to taxpayers as their assets are sold off.

&#160;

In March 2015, housing and mortgage financial reform legislation, H.R. 1491, was proposed by congressmen John Delaney (D-MD), John Carney (D-DE) and James A. Himes (D-CT), each of whom is a member of the House Financial Services Committee. The bill is called The Partnership to Strengthen Homeownership Act, and is similar to one introduced by the same congressmen in the last Congress (H.R. 5055), which never made it out of committee. Under this proposed legislation, all government guaranteed single-family and multi-family MBS would be supported by a minimum of 5% private sector capital, which would stand in a first loss position. The remaining 95% of the risk would be shared between Ginnie Mae and a private reinsurer on a pari passu basis. Fees paid to Ginnie Mae for providing these securities would be allocated to affordable housing programs. Under the bill, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae would be wound down over a five-year period, and their multifamily businesses would be spun out as separate entities. Ginnie Mae would be required to create and implement a workable multifamily guarantee that utilizes private sector pricing consistent with the single family model. The GSEs&#8217; current multifamily businesses would continue to function within the new multifamily housing market as purely private organizations with an explicit government guarantee provided by Ginnie Mae and a private sector reinsurer.

&#160;

We expect debate and discussion on residential housing and mortgage reform to continue over the next few years; however, we cannot be certain if or when H.R. 1491, the Corker-Warner Bill or any other housing finance reform bill will emerge from committee or be approved by Congress, and if so, what the effects may be. Historically, significant legislation has been difficult to pass in a presidential election year, and we cannot predict what effect the 2016 election cycle will have on the progress of housing finance reform legislation.

&#160;

In addition to housing finance reform legislation, in May 2014, FHFA Director Mel Watt presented the 2014 Strategic Plan for the Conservatorship of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and the 2014 Conservatorship Scorecard for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac focusing on how FHFA will manage the conservatorships of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac under its present statutory mandates. The Strategic Plan tends to favor policies that promote housing affordability, expand credit availability for new and refinanced mortgages, and increase the role of private capital in the mortgage market. 

&#160;

In August 2014, in the first step of what is expected to be a multi-year effort, the FHFA requested industry input on the development of a common mortgage-backed security under the auspices of both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Under the current proposal, the common mortgage-backed security would leverage their existing security structures and would encompass many of the pooling features of the current Fannie Mae mortgage-backed security and more of the disclosure framework of the current Freddie Mac participation certificate.

&#160;

In October 2014, FHFA Director Watt announced a number of general policy initiatives by the FHFA, including restoring a program that allows Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to guarantee loans with down payments as low as 3%. Director Watt also said that the FHFA was taking steps to bring certainty to the circumstances under which Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will require originators to repurchase defaulted mortgages that were later discovered to have underwriting defects. In November 2014, the FHFA also increased the 2014 Conservatorship Scorecard targets for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to complete credit risk transfers involving at least $90 billion in unpaid principal balance of single-family mortgages, up from $30 billion in 2013, and has encouraged Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to test multiple types of credit risk transfer structures, including securities-based transactions and insurance transactions. Under the terms of their agreements with the U.S. Treasury Department, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, under the direction of the FHFA, also continue to reduce the size of their retained mortgage portfolios. 

&#160;

Furthermore, in October 2014, the FHFA, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Securities And Exchange Commission, the Federal Reserve System and the Department of Housing and Urban Development adopted a final rule implementing the credit risk retention requirements of Section 941 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, or the Dodd-Frank Act, for asset-backed securities. As required by the Dodd-Frank Act, the final credit risk retention rule generally require &#8220;securitizers&#8221; to retain not less than 5% of the credit risk of the mortgage loans securitized.

Our investment strategy 

&#160;

We invest in a diversified pool of mortgage assets that generate attractive risk-adjusted returns to our investors over the long-term through a combination of dividends and capital appreciation. Our target assets include Agency RMBS, Non-Agency RMBS, ABS, CMBS, MSRs, residential and commercial loans and other real estate-related assets. Following our IPO, the risk-reward profile of investment opportunities supported the deployment of a majority of our capital into Agency RMBS. We believe that yields and net interest spreads on Agency RMBS that are currently available for investment are generally lower than what we have historically realized in our portfolio. Our goal for much of 2015, and looking forward to 2016, centers around deploying an increasing portion of our capital into attractive credit investments, including residential and commercial real estate loans.

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015, the fair value of our investment portfolio on a non-GAAP basis, inclusive of TBAs, consisted of 44.2% Agency RMBS, 45.1% residential investments, 8.8% commercial investments and 1.9% ABS. This compares with 2014, when the fair value of our investment portfolio on a non-GAAP basis, inclusive of TBAs, consisted of 55.4% Agency RMBS, 37.4% residential investments, 5.4% commercial investments and 1.8% ABS.

&#160; 

Our financing and hedging strategy 

&#160;

We generate income principally from the yields earned on our investments and, to the extent that leverage is deployed, on the difference between the yields earned on our investments and our cost of borrowing and any hedging activities. Subject to maintaining our qualification as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes and our Investment Company Act exemption, to the extent leverage is deployed, we may use a number of sources to finance our investments.

&#160;

We use leverage to increase potential returns to our stockholders and to fund the acquisition of our assets. We define &#8220;Non-GAAP Leverage&#8221; as the sum of repurchase agreements, inclusive of repurchase agreements accounted for as linked transactions and those held through affiliated entities, advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati (&#8220;FHLBC Advances&#8221;), the payable on unsettled buys less the financing on unsettled sells, and the consolidated tranche issued by the consolidated VIE which is classified as &#8220;Securitized debt&#8221; on our consolidated balance sheet. Leverage excludes repurchase agreements and net receivables/payables on unsettled trades pertaining to U.S. Treasury securities due to the highly liquid and temporary nature of these investments. We define &#8220;at risk&#8221; leverage as non-GAAP leverage inclusive of our net TBA position (at cost). These calculations divide leverage by our GAAP stockholders equity. As of December 31, 2015 our non-GAAP &#8220;at-risk&#8221;, non-GAAP and GAAP debt-to-equity leverage ratios were 3.53 to 1, 3.42 to 1, and 3.39 to 1, respectively, which reflect our current mix of Agency RMBS and credit portfolio. As of December 31, 2014 our non-GAAP &#8220;at risk&#8221;, non-GAAP and GAAP debt-to-equity leverage ratios were 4.17 to 1, 3.85 to 1, and 3.66 to 1. For a tabular representation of the above, refer to the &#8220;Financing activities&#8221; section of Item 7.

&#160;

We currently finance our investments primarily through short-term borrowings structured as repurchase agreements and through FHLBC Advances. As of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, we either directly or through our equity method investments in affiliates, had entered into master repurchase agreements, (&#8220;MRAs&#8221;), or loan agreements with 38 and 35 counterparties, respectively, under which we had borrowed an aggregate $2.5 billion and $2.8 billion, respectively, on a non-GAAP basis from 21 and 24 counterparties, respectively. As of December 31, 2015, the borrowings under our financing arrangements had maturities between January 4, 2016 and September 17, 2019, and as of December 31, 2014, the borrowings under repurchase agreements had maturities between January 2, 2015 and September 17, 2019. 

&#160;

In July 2015, our captive insurance subsidiary, MITT Insurance, was granted membership in the FHLBC and commenced obtaining advances from the FHLBC. Membership in the FHLBC permits MITT Insurance to access a variety of products and services offered by the FHLBC, including low-cost financing to finance our Agency RMBS, and obligates MITT Insurance to purchase FHLBC membership stock and activity stock, the latter being a percentage of the advances it obtains from the FHLBC. As with our repurchase agreement borrowings, if the value of any assets pledged to the FHLBC as collateral for advances decreases, the FHLBC could require posting of additional collateral to the amount of advances outstanding. As a result of the Final Rule, MITT Insurance must wind down its membership with the FHLBC by February 19, 2016. The Final Rule also prevented MITT Insurance from taking any new advances or extending and existing advances from the FHLBC.

&#160;

&#160; 10 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Subject to maintaining our qualification as a REIT and our Investment Company Act exemption, to the extent leverage is deployed, we utilize derivative financial instruments (or hedging instruments), including interest rate swap agreements, TBAs, interest rate swaptions, credit derivatives and non-derivative instruments including Agency interest-only securities and long or short positions in U.S. Treasury securities in an effort to hedge the interest rate risk associated with the financing of our portfolio. Specifically, we may seek to hedge our exposure to potential interest rate mismatches between the interest we earn on our investments and our borrowing costs caused by fluctuations in short-term interest rates. In utilizing leverage and interest rate hedges, our objectives are to improve risk-adjusted returns and, where possible, to lock in, on a long-term basis, a spread between the yield on our assets and the cost of our financing. As of December 31, 2015, we had entered into $1.0 billion notional of interest rate swaps that have variable maturities between October 30, 2017 and June 5, 2025, and $226.0 million notional of long positions in U.S. Treasury securities that have variable maturities between September 15, 2018 and September 30, 2022. As of December 31, 2014 we had entered into $1.4 billion notional of interest rate swaps that have variable maturities between May 27, 2017 and March 5, 2024. We had no positions in U.S. Treasury securities on December 31, 2014.

&#160; 

Risk management strategy 

&#160;

Our overall portfolio strategy is designed to generate attractive returns through various phases of the economic cycle. We believe that our broad approach within the real estate market, which considers all major categories of real estate assets, allows us to invest in a variety of attractive investment opportunities and help insulate our portfolio from some of the risks that arise from investing in a single collateral type.

&#160;

The components of our risk management strategy are:

&#160;

&#8226; Disciplined adherence to risk-adjusted return . Our Manager deploys capital only when it believes that risk-adjusted returns are attractive. In this analysis, our Manager considers the initial net interest spread of the investment, the cost of hedging and our ability to optimize returns over time through rebalancing activities. Our Manager&#8217;s management team has extensive experience implementing this approach. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#8226; Focus on multiple sectors . Our Manager looks for attractive investment opportunities in all major sectors of the U.S. mortgage market. Our management team evaluates investment opportunities in residential mortgage loans and securities (prime conforming, jumbo, Alt-A, and subprime) and across a wide spectrum of commercial property types. We believe this approach enables our Manager to identify attractive investments when it believes certain portions of the market are attractively priced or when investment opportunities in one or more sectors are scarce. By pursuing a broad investment strategy within the mortgage market, we believe our mortgage portfolio is less exposed to dislocations in specific sectors of the market. We believe a diversified mortgage portfolio outperforms the traditional single strategy portfolios in the REIT market, with returns more resistant to changes in the interest rate and consumer credit environment. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#8226; Concurrent evaluation of interest rate and credit risk. Our Manager seeks to balance our portfolio with both credit risk-intensive assets and interest rate risk-intensive assets. Both of these primary risk types are evaluated against a common risk-adjusted return framework. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#8226; Active hedging and rebalancing of portfolio. Our Manager periodically evaluates our portfolio against preestablished risk tolerances and will take corrective action through asset sales, asset acquisitions, and dynamic hedging activities to bring the portfolio back within these risk tolerances. We believe this approach generates more attractive long-term returns than an approach that either attempts to hedge away a majority of the interest rate and/or credit risk in the portfolio at the time of acquisition, on the one end of the risk spectrum, or a highly speculative approach that does not attempt to hedge any of the interest rate or credit risk in the portfolio on the other end of the risk spectrum. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#8226; Opportunistic approach to increased risk. Our Manager&#8217;s investment strategy is to preserve our ability to extend risk taking capacity during periods of changing market fundamentals. &#160; 

Our investments 

&#160;

Our target asset classes 

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015, the fair value of our investment portfolio on a non-GAAP basis, inclusive of TBAs comprised 44.2% of Agency RMBS, 42.9% of Non-Agency RMBS, 1.9% of ABS, 6.4% of CMBS, 2.2% residential mortgage loans, 2.4% commercial loans and 0.0% excess mortgage servicing rights. We have the discretion to invest in these and other target assets (as described below).

&#160;

&#160; 11 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Our target asset classes and the principal investments in which we invest are as follows:

&#160;

Asset Class

&#160; Principal Investments

Agency RMBS &#160; &#8226; RMBS for which a U.S. government agency such as the Government National Mortgage Association, or Ginnie Mae, or a federally-chartered corporation such as the Federal National Mortgage Association, or Fannie Mae, or the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, or Freddie Mac, guarantees payments of principal and interest on the securities they issue. &#160; &#160; &#160; Non-Agency RMBS &#160; &#8226; Fixed- and floating-rate residential Non-Agency RMBS, including investment grade and non-investment grade classes. The mortgage loan collateral for residential Non-Agency RMBS consists of residential mortgage loans that do not generally conform to underwriting guidelines issued by U.S. government agencies or U.S. government-sponsored entities. &#160; &#160; &#160; Other real estate-related assets and financial assets &#160; &#8226; Fixed- and floating-rate CMBS, including investment grade and non-investment grade classes. CMBS are secured by, or evidence ownership interest in, a single commercial mortgage loan or a pool of commercial mortgage loans.

&#160;

&#8226; Residential mortgage loans secured by residential real property, including prime, Alt-A, and subprime mortgage loans.

&#160;

&#8226; Commercial mortgage loans secured by commercial real property, including mezzanine loans and preferred equity.

&#160;

&#8226; First or second lien loans, subordinate interests in first mortgages, bridge loans to be used in the acquisition, construction or redevelopment of a property and mezzanine financing secured by interests in commercial real estate.

&#160;

&#8226; Other real estate structured finance products, MSRs, other real estate-related loans and securities and other financial assets.

&#160;

&#8226; Investment grade and non-investment grade debt and equity tranches of securitizations backed by various asset classes including, but not limited to, small balance commercial mortgages, aircraft, automobiles, credit cards, equipment, manufactured housing, franchises, recreational vehicles and student loans. Investments in ABS generally are not qualifying income for purposes of the 75% asset test applicable to REITs and generally do not generate qualifying income for purposes of the 75% income test applicable to REITs. As a result we may be limited in our ability to invest in such assets.

&#160;

&#8226; Interests in certain types of real estate.

&#160;

Our board of directors has adopted a set of investment guidelines that outline our target assets and other criteria which are used by our Manager to evaluate specific investment opportunities as well as our overall portfolio composition. Our Manager makes day-to-day determinations as to the timing and percentage of our assets that will be invested in each of the approved asset classes. Our decisions depend upon prevailing market conditions and may change over time in response to opportunities available in different interest rate, economic and credit environments. As a result, we cannot predict the percentage of our assets that will be invested in any one of our approved asset classes at any given time. We may change our strategy and policies without a vote of our stockholders. We believe that the diversification of our portfolio of assets and the flexibility of our strategy combined with our Manager&#8217;s and its affiliates&#8217; experience will enable us to achieve attractive risk-adjusted returns under a variety of market conditions and economic cycles. 

&#160; 

Investment policies 

&#160; 

Investment guidelines 

&#160;

We comply with investment policies and procedures and investment guidelines that are approved by our board of directors and implemented by our Manager. Our Chief Investment Officer reports on our investment portfolio at each regularly scheduled meeting of our board of directors. Our independent directors do not review or approve individual investment, leverage or hedging decisions made by our Manager.

&#160;

Our board of directors has adopted the following guidelines, among others, for our investments and borrowings:

&#160;

&#8226; no investment shall be made that would cause us to fail to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes; &#8226; no investment shall be made that would cause us to be regulated as an investment company under the Investment Company Act; and &#8226; our investments will be in our target assets. &#160;

These investment guidelines may be changed by our board of directors without the approval of our stockholders.

&#160;

We intend to continue to make regular quarterly distributions to holders of our common stock. We generally need to distribute at least 90% of our ordinary taxable income each year (subject to certain adjustments) to our stockholders in order to qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code. Our ability to make distributions to our stockholders depends, in part, upon the performance of our investment portfolio. Distributions to our stockholders are generally taxable to our stockholders as ordinary income, although a portion of our distributions may be designated by us as capital gain or qualified dividend income or may constitute a return of capital. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, we elected to satisfy the REIT distribution requirements in part with a dividend paid in 2016 and 2015, respectively. In conjunction with this, we accrued an excise tax of $1.7 million and $1.7 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively, which is included in the &#8220;Taxes payable&#8221; line item on the consolidated balance sheet in Item 8.

&#160; 

Our competitive advantages 

&#160;

We believe that our competitive advantages include the following:

&#160; 

Investment team with extensive RMBS experience 

&#160;

The experience of Angelo, Gordon investment professionals provides competitive advantages to us. Angelo, Gordon has over 140 investment professionals across its lines of investment disciplines. Of those, over 80 are involved in one of Angelo, Gordon&#8217;s real estate investment disciplines&#8212;RMBS, CMBS, commercial real estate, private equity real estate, real estate debt and net lease real estate. The insights, experience, and contacts of these professionals are available to us as a resource. Our Manager&#8217;s dedicated RMBS investment team is led by Jonathan Lieberman and has over 20 investment professionals, including portfolio managers, traders, analysts, and statisticians. The senior investment professionals have broad experience in managing residential mortgage-related assets through a variety of market cycles and credit and interest rate environments. The RMBS team has oversight from Michael Gordon, David Roberts and Jonathan Lieberman who have an average of over 35 years of investment experience. Angelo, Gordon is an established leader in the alternative investment field and its overall investment philosophy is credit and value-centric in that its investment process is based on a highly analytical framework and, with respect to RMBS, takes into account factors such as loan-level cash flows, historical and current borrower performance and collateral valuation.

&#160;

&#160; Breadth of Angelo, Gordon&#8217;s experience 

&#160;

Although our core investment strategy is focused on RMBS, Angelo, Gordon&#8217;s expertise in related investment disciplines such as residential and consumer debt, commercial real estate debt, commercial real estate, net lease real estate, distressed credit, leveraged loans and private equity provides our Manager with both (i) valuable investment insights to our RMBS investment selection and strategy and (ii) flexibility to opportunistically invest in target assets other than RMBS as market conditions warrant. As market conditions change and new opportunities are created that are consistent with our strategy and are structurally appropriate for us, we believe Angelo, Gordon&#8217;s extensive experience can assist our Manager in moving quickly to take advantage of those opportunities on our behalf.

&#160;

&#160; 14 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Access to our Manager&#8217;s relationships 

&#160;

Angelo, Gordon has created a broad network of deal sources, including relationships with major issuers of residential debt securities and the broker-dealers that trade these securities, augmented by ongoing dialogue with a substantial number of smaller, regional firms that tend to find investment opportunities that are often priced and sold on an off-market basis. Our Manager&#8217;s investment team has extensive industry contacts and client relationships which have generated proprietary deal flow.

&#160; 

Disciplined investment approach and granular credit analysis 

&#160;

We seek to maximize our risk-adjusted returns through our Manager&#8217;s disciplined investment approach, which relies on rigorous quantitative and qualitative analysis. Our investment thesis is predicated upon in-depth loan-level analysis and our proprietary analytics, which allow us to underwrite loans individually based on updated borrower credit information and property attributes. Our focus on fundamental granular analysis remains the cornerstone of our investment philosophy, and we believe that through this approach we can identify attractive investment opportunities.

&#160; 

Access to Angelo, Gordon&#8217;s well developed infrastructure and asset management systems 

&#160;

Angelo, Gordon has invested and continues to invest in the technology, analytics and systems that we believe are required to effectively and comprehensively evaluate potential investments. Our Manager&#8217;s investment team and Angelo, Gordon&#8217;s technology group has developed proprietary databases, portfolio systems and quantitative models to enhance valuation analytics (pipeline modeling, roll rates and severity of loss, amongst others). Our Manager&#8217;s investment team has developed proprietary prepayment, default, delinquency roll rate and loss severity models to analyze current mark-to-market home values on a loan-by-loan basis using borrower monthly performance statistics, credit characteristics and home price appreciation (or depreciation) by metropolitan statistical area for most of the residential market.

&#160; 

Access to Angelo, Gordon&#8217;s accounting, tax and internal risk control management systems 

&#160;

Our Manager utilizes Angelo, Gordon&#8217;s well developed accounting, tax and internal control departments, comprising over 50 certified public accountants. Additionally, our Manager has access to Angelo, Gordon&#8217;s technology, client service, disaster recovery and operational infrastructure to support our operations. We believe that Angelo, Gordon has a strong reputation for risk management and compliance.

&#160; 

Operating and regulatory structure 

&#160;

REIT qualification 

&#160;

We have elected to be treated as a REIT under Sections 856 through 859 of the Code. Our qualification as a REIT depends upon our ability to meet on a continuing basis, through actual investment and operating results, various complex requirements under the Code relating to, among other things, the sources of our gross income, the composition and values of our assets, our distribution levels and the diversity of ownership of our shares. We believe that we are organized in conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Code, and that our manner of operation enables us to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT.

&#160;

As a REIT, we generally are not subject to U.S. federal income tax on our REIT taxable income that we distribute currently to our stockholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year and do not qualify for certain statutory relief provisions, we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at regular corporate rates and may be precluded from qualifying as a REIT for the subsequent four taxable years following the year during which we lost our REIT qualification. Accordingly, our failure to qualify as a REIT could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and our ability to pay distributions, if any, to our stockholders. Even if we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to some U.S. federal, state and local taxes on our income or property. In addition, any income earned by a domestic taxable REIT subsidiary, or TRS, will be subject to corporate income taxation.

&#160; 

Investment Company Act exemption 

&#160;

We conduct our operations so that we are not considered an investment company under Section 3(a)(1)(C) of the Investment Company Act. Under Section 3(a)(1)(C) of the Investment Company Act, a company is deemed to be an investment company if it is engaged, or proposes to engage, in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading in securities and owns or proposes to acquire &#8220;investment securities&#8221; having a value exceeding 40% of the value of its total assets (exclusive of U.S. government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis, (&#8220;the 40% test&#8221;). &#8220;Investment securities&#8221; do not include, among other things, U.S. government securities, and securities issued by majority-owned subsidiaries that (i) are not investment companies and (ii) are not relying on the exceptions from the definition of investment company provided by Section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act.

&#160;

&#160; 15 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

The operations of many of our wholly-owned or majority-owned subsidiaries&#8217; are generally conducted so that they are exempted from investment company status in reliance upon Section 3(c)(5)(C) of the Investment Company Act. Because entities relying on Section 3(c)(5)(C) are not investment companies, our interests in those subsidiaries do not constitute &#8220;investment securities&#8221; for purposes of Section 3(a)(1)(C). To the extent that our direct subsidiaries qualify only for either Section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) exemptions from the Investment Company Act, we limit our holdings in those kinds of entities so that, together with other investment securities, we satisfy the 40% test. Although we continuously monitor our and our subsidiaries&#8217; portfolios on an ongoing basis to ensure compliance with that test, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain the exemptions from registration for us and each of our subsidiaries.

&#160;

The method we use to classify our subsidiaries&#8217; assets for purposes of Section 3(c)(5)(C) of the Investment Company Act is based in large measure upon no-action positions taken by the SEC staff. These no-action positions were issued in accordance with factual situations that may be substantially different from the factual situations we may face, and a number of these no-action positions were issued decades ago. No assurance can be given that the SEC or its staff will concur with our classification of our or our subsidiaries&#8217; assets or that the SEC or its staff will not, in the future, issue further guidance that may require us to reclassify those assets for purposes of qualifying for an exclusion from registration under the Investment Company Act. In August 2011 the SEC solicited public comment on a wide range of issues relating to Section 3(c)(5)(C), including the nature of the assets that qualify for purposes of the exemption and leverage used by mortgage related vehicles. There can be no assurance that the laws and regulations governing the Investment Company Act status of companies primarily owning real estate related assets, including the SEC or its staff providing more specific or different guidance regarding these exemptions, will not change in a manner that adversely affects our operations. To the extent that the SEC or its staff provides more specific guidance regarding Section 3(c)(5)(C) or any of the other matters bearing upon the definition of investment company and the exceptions to that definition, we may be required to adjust our investment strategy accordingly. Additional guidance from the SEC or its staff could provide additional flexibility to us, or it could further inhibit our ability to pursue the investment strategy we have chosen.

&#160;

Conducting our operations so as not to be considered an investment company under the Investment Company Act limits our ability to make certain investments. For example, these restrictions limit our and our subsidiaries&#8217; ability to invest directly in mortgage-related securities that represent less than the entire ownership in a pool of mortgage loans, debt and equity tranches of securitizations, certain real estate companies or assets not related to real estate.

&#160;

Restrictions on ownership and transfer of shares 

&#160;

Our charter, subject to certain exceptions, prohibits any person from directly or indirectly owning (i) more than 9.8% in value or in number of shares, whichever is more restrictive, of our outstanding common stock, or (ii) more than 9.8% in value or in number of shares, whichever is more restrictive, of our outstanding capital stock. We refer to those limitations in this report collectively as the share ownership limits. Our charter also prohibits any person from directly or indirectly owning shares of any class of our stock if such ownership would result in our being &#8220;closely held&#8221; under Section 856(h) of the Code or otherwise cause us to fail to qualify as a REIT.

&#160;

Our charter generally provides that any capital stock owned or transferred in violation of the foregoing restrictions will be deemed to be transferred to a charitable trust for the benefit of a charitable beneficiary, and the purported owner or transferee will acquire no rights in such shares. If the foregoing is ineffective for any reason to prevent a violation of these restrictions, then the transfer of such shares will be void ab initio .

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160;

Our net income depends, in large part, on our ability to acquire assets at favorable spreads over our borrowing and hedging costs. In acquiring our investments, we compete with other REITs, specialty finance companies, mortgage bankers, insurance companies, mutual funds, institutional investors, investment banking firms, financial institutions, governmental bodies, and other entities. See &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Market conditions.&#8221; In addition, there are numerous REITs and specialty finance companies with similar asset acquisition objectives. These other REITs and specialty finance companies increase competition for the available supply of mortgage assets suitable for purchase. Many of our competitors are significantly larger than we are, have access to greater capital and other resources and may have other advantages over us. In addition, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments and establish more relationships than we can. Current market conditions may attract more competitors, which may increase the competition for sources of financing. An increase in the competition for sources of financing could adversely affect the availability and cost of financing.

&#160;

&#160; 16 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

We have access to our Manager&#8217;s professionals and their industry expertise, which we believe provides us with a competitive advantage. These professionals help us assess investment risks and determine appropriate pricing for certain potential investments. These relationships enable us to compete more effectively for attractive investment opportunities. Despite certain competitive advantages, we may not be able to achieve our business goals or expectations due to the competitive risks that we face.

&#160; 

Staffing 

&#160;

We are managed by our Manager pursuant to a management agreement. Our Manager, pursuant to a delegation agreement dated as of June 29, 2011, has delegated to Angelo, Gordon the overall responsibility with respect to our Manager&#8217;s day-to-day duties and obligations arising under our management agreement. In addition, all of our officers are employees of Angelo, Gordon or its affiliates. We have no employees. Angelo, Gordon has over 370 employees.
