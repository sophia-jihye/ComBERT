GENERAL 

Newell Rubbermaid is a global marketer of consumer and commercial products that help people get more out of life every day, where they live, learn, work and play. The Company&#8217;s products are marketed under a strong portfolio of leading brands, including Sharpie &#174; , Paper Mate &#174; , Expo &#174; , Prismacolor &#174; , Mr. Sketch &#174; , Elmer&#8217;s &#174; , Parker &#174; , Waterman &#174; , Dymo &#174; , Rubbermaid &#174; , Contigo &#174; , Goody &#174; , Calphalon &#174; , Irwin &#174; , Lenox &#174; , Rubbermaid Commercial Products &#174; , Graco &#174; , Aprica &#174; &#32;and Baby Jogger &#174; . 

The Company is driving its strategy, the Growth Game Plan, into action and simplifying its structure through the execution of Project Renewal, making sharper portfolio choices and investing in new marketing and innovation to accelerate performance. In the Growth Game Plan operating model, the Company has two core activity systems, Development and Delivery, supported by three business partnering functions, Human Resources, Finance/IT and Legal, and four winning capabilities in Design, Marketing &#38; Insight, Supply Chain and Customer Development, all in service to drive accelerated performance in the Company&#8217;s five segments. The Company&#8217;s five segments and the key brands included in each segment are as follows: 

&#8226; 

Writing : Sharpie &#174; , Paper Mate &#174; , Expo &#174; , Prismacolor &#174; , Mr. Sketch &#174; , Elmer&#8217;s &#174; , X-Acto &#174; , Parker &#174; , Waterman &#174; and Dymo &#174; &#32;Office 

&#8226; 

Home Solutions : Rubbermaid &#174; , Contigo &#174; , bubba &#174; , Calphalon &#174; , Levolor &#174; &#32;and Goody &#174; &#160; 

&#8226; 

Tools : Irwin &#174; , Lenox &#174; , hilmor TM &#32;and Dymo &#174; &#32;Industrial 

&#8226; 

Commercial Products : Rubbermaid Commercial Products &#174; &#32; 

&#8226; 

Baby &#38; Parenting : Graco &#174; , Baby Jogger &#174; , Aprica &#174; and Teutonia &#174; &#160; 

In October 2015, the Company completed the acquisition of Elmer&#8217;s Products, Inc. (&#8220;Elmer&#8217;s&#8221;). Elmer&#8217;s, whose brands include Elmer&#8217;s &#174; , Krazy Glue &#174; &#32;(a trademark of Toagosei Co. Ltd., used with permission) and X-Acto &#174; , is a provider of activity-based adhesive and cutting products that inspire creativity in the classroom, at home, in the office, in the workshop and at the craft table. Elmer&#8217;s is included in the Writing segment. 

Based on the Company&#8217;s strategy to allocate resources to its businesses relative to each business&#8217; growth potential and, in particular, those businesses with the greater right to win in the marketplace, during 2015 the Company divested its Rubbermaid medical cart business, which focuses on optimizing nurse work flow and medical records processing in hospitals and was included in the Commercial Products segment. During 2015, the Company also initiated a process to divest its Levolor &#174; &#32;and Kirsch &#174; &#32;window coverings brands (&#8220;D&#233;cor&#8221;). The Rubbermaid medical cart and D&#233;cor businesses do not qualify as discontinued operations pursuant to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, and as a result, the medical cart business was included in the Company&#8217;s consolidated results from continuing operations in the Commercial Products segment until it was sold in August 2015, and D&#233;cor is and will continue to be included in the Company&#8217;s consolidated results from continuing operations in the Home Solutions segment until the business is sold. 

The Endicia on-line postage business and the Culinary electrics and retail businesses are classified as discontinued operations based on the Company&#8217;s commitment in 2014 to sell these businesses. Endicia was included in the Writing segment and the Culinary businesses were included in the Home Solutions segment. The Company completed the sale of Endicia in November 2015 and ceased operations in its Culinary electrics and retail businesses in the first quarter of 2015. 

&#32;3 

JARDEN ACQUISITION 

On December 13, 2015, the Company entered into an agreement and plan of merger (the &#8220;Merger Agreement&#8221;) to acquire Jarden Corporation (&#8220;Jarden&#8221;). The combined company will be named Newell Brands Inc. (&#8220;Newell Brands&#8221;), a consumer goods company with $16 billion in sales with a portfolio of leading brands in large, growing, unconsolidated, global markets. Jarden is a leading, global consumer products company with leading brands, such as Yankee Candle, Crock-Pot, FoodSaver, Mr. Coffee, Oster, Coleman, First Alert, Rawlings, Jostens, K2, Marker, Marmot, Volkl, and many others. 

Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, Jarden shareholders will receive at closing for each share of Jarden common stock merger consideration of (1) 0.862 of a share of Newell Rubbermaid common stock plus (2) $21.00 in cash. Based on the closing price of a share of Newell Rubbermaid common stock on February 24, 2016 of $37.74 per share, the implied total consideration is approximately $14.0 billion, including $5.5 billion of cash and $8.5 billion of Newell Rubbermaid common stock. 

The scaled enterprise is expected to accelerate profitable growth with leading brands in a global market that exceeds $100 billion, with business and capability development supported by the efficiencies of this transformational combination. Management believes that the scale of the combined Newell Rubbermaid and Jarden businesses in key categories, channels and geographies creates a much broader opportunity to deploy the Company&#8217;s advantaged set of brand development and commercial capabilities for accelerated growth and margin expansion. 

The transaction will be funded by cash on hand and additional debt financing. Newell Rubbermaid has obtained a committed bridge credit facility, which it expects to replace with permanent financing prior to closing. The Company is committed to maintaining its investment grade credit rating by using strong cash flow from the combined enterprise to prioritize debt reduction in the short term, while simultaneously maintaining its dividend per share. 

Newell Rubbermaid anticipates incremental annualized cost synergies of approximately $500 million over four years, driven by efficiencies of scale and new efficiencies in procurement, cost to serve and infrastructure that the combination unlocks. The Company&#8217;s intent is to design a benchmarked, efficient set of structures that support long-term business development. 

The acquisition is subject to approval by shareholders of both Newell Rubbermaid and Jarden, receipt of regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. It is expected to close in the second quarter of 2016.

STRATEGIC INITIATIVES 

Newell Rubbermaid is committed to building leading brands through understanding the needs of consumers and using those insights to create innovative, highly differentiated product solutions that offer superior performance and value. In 2015, the Company increased advertising and promotion investments in support of its brands by $42.3 million &#32;compared to 2014, and the Company intends to continue to leverage its portfolio of leading brands to create a margin structure that allows for further increases in brand investment. 

The Company is executing its Growth Game Plan, which is its strategy to simplify the organization and free up resources to invest in growth initiatives and strengthened capabilities in support of the Company&#8217;s brands. The changes being implemented in the execution of the Growth Game Plan are considered key enablers to building a bigger, faster-growing, more global and more profitable company. 

The Growth Game Plan encompasses the following aspects: 

The Newell Way 

The Newell Way is a set of behaviors that involve putting our consumers first in everything we do because our brands are designed to help consumers achieve more in life. When our consumers benefit, all of our other constituents benefit, including our customers, our employees and our investors. 

Growth is our key to success and is the energy that powers the Company. We aim to be more invested than our competitors in creating meaningful connections that drive growth with our consumers, customers, suppliers, employees and communities. The Newell Way is designed to build exceptional leadership at every level in the organization that will accelerate the Company&#8217;s performance and drive its transformation forward. 

&#32;4 

The Newell Way is not simply a means to improve business results; it is a means to improve personal results. We do what we say we are going to do and execute with E.D.G.E. - Every Day Great Execution. We will execute using the key tenets of The Newell Way to guide our decisions, with the aim of making the Company one of the leading consumer goods companies in the world.

5 Ways To Win 

&#8226; 

Make Our Brands Really Matter &#8212; Building an innovation engine, developing outstanding brand communications and winning with superior product design and performance. 

&#8226; 

Build An Execution Powerhouse &#8212; Transforming our supply chain and becoming a partner of choice to our customers. 

&#8226; 

Unlock Trapped Capacity For Growth &#8212; Eliminating complexity and establishing and developing an operating rhythm and information strategy to support growth. 

&#8226; 

Develop The Team For Growth &#8212; Building a community of leaders and focusing the organization on a performance-based culture and learning and development. 

&#8226; 

Extend Beyond Our Borders &#8212; Create and develop local teams in developing markets to build consumer insights and build the business locally. 

The Company&#8217;s transformation efforts in driving the Growth Game Plan into action began in late 2011 and are being implemented over a multi-year period in three phases, which are outlined below. 

&#8226; 

Delivery Phase &#8212; Execution during this phase included implementing structural changes in the organization while ensuring consistent execution and delivery. 

&#8226; 

Strategic Phase &#8212; Continued consistent execution and delivery while simultaneously shaping the future through increased brand investment and bringing capabilities to speed in order to propel the Growth Game Plan into action. 

&#8226; 

Acceleration Phase &#8212; Expand investments behind Win Bigger businesses to drive increased sales and margin expansion, which creates additional resources for further brand investment, while also remaining focused on consistent execution and delivery. 

During 2015, the Company executed against the Strategic Phase of the Growth Game Plan, investing in core activity systems critical to the Company&#8217;s success, unlocking trapped capacity for growth through Project Renewal, investing in new capabilities and the Company&#8217;s brands for accelerated growth, and beginning to leverage an operating company structure to release the full potential of the business. During 2016, the Company plans to transition to the Acceleration Phase of the Growth Game Plan. 

The Company will continue implementing changes to drive the Growth Game Plan strategy into action. These changes are the foundation of Project Renewal and are organized into the following five workstreams: 

&#8226; 

Organizational Simplification: The Company has de-layered its top structure and further consolidated its businesses from nine global business units (&#8220;GBUs&#8221;) to three operating groups that manage five operating segments. 

&#8226; 

EMEA Simplification: The Company is focusing its resources on fewer products and countries, while simplifying go-to-market, delivery and back office support structures. 

&#8226; 

Best Cost Finance: The Company is delivering a simplified approach to decision support, transaction processing and information management by leveraging SAP and the streamlined business segments to align resources with the Growth Game Plan. 

&#8226; 

Best Cost Back Office: The Company is driving &#8220;One Newell Rubbermaid&#8221; efficiencies in customer and consumer services and sourcing functions. 

&#32;5 

&#8226; 

Supply Chain Footprint: The Company is further optimizing manufacturing and distribution facilities across its global supply chain. 

In April 2015, the Company committed to a further expansion of Project Renewal (the &#8220;April 2015 Expansion&#8221;). Project Renewal was initially launched in October 2011 to reduce the complexity of the organization and increase investment in growth platforms within the business. Under Project Renewal, the Company is simplifying and aligning its businesses around two key activities - Brand &#38; Category Development and Market Execution &#38; Delivery. The April 2015 Expansion is expected to generate annualized incremental cost savings of approximately $150 million when fully implemented by the end of 2017, which includes savings expected to be realized during 2018 from projects completed in 2017. Under the April 2015 Expansion, the Company plans to implement additional activities designed to further streamline business partnering functions (e.g., Finance/IT, Legal and Human Resources), optimize global selling and trade marketing functions and rationalize the Company&#8217;s real estate portfolio. A large portion of the incremental savings are intended to be reinvested in the business to strengthen brand building and selling capabilities in priority markets around the world. In connection with the April 2015 Expansion, the Company expects to incur $150 million of additional costs. As a result, the cumulative costs of Project Renewal are expected to be approximately $690 to $725 million, of which approximately $645 to $675 million are expected to be cash costs. Project Renewal is expected to generate annualized cost savings of approximately $620 to $675 million by the end of 2017, which includes savings expected to be realized during 2018 from projects completed in 2017.

OTHER INFORMATION 

Multi-Product Offering 

The Company&#8217;s broad product offering in multiple categories permits it to more effectively meet the needs of its customers. With families of leading brand names and profitable and innovative new products, the Company can assist volume purchasers in selling a more profitable product mix. As a potential single source for an entire product line, the Company can use program merchandising to improve product presentation, optimize display space for both sales and income, and encourage impulse buying by retail consumers. 

Foreign Operations 

Information regarding the Company&#8217;s 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 &#32;foreign operations and financial information by geographic area is included in Footnote 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and is incorporated by reference herein. Information regarding risks relating to the Company&#8217;s foreign operations is set forth in Part I, Item 1A, of this report and is incorporated by reference herein. 

Please refer to Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Footnote 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the Company&#8217;s Venezuelan operations. 

Raw Materials and Sourced Finished Goods 

The Company has multiple foreign and domestic sources of supply for substantially all of its material requirements. The raw materials and various purchased components required for its products have generally been available in sufficient quantities. The Company&#8217;s product offerings require the purchase of resin, corrugate and metals, including steel, stainless steel, aluminum and gold. The Company&#8217;s resin purchases principally comprise polyethylene, polypropylene and copolyester. Over the long-term, the Company has experienced inflation in raw material prices, labor and sourced products, and in 2015, inflation in labor and sourced products offset deflation in raw material prices. In 2016, the Company expects continued labor and sourced product inflation and moderate inflation in raw material prices. On an annualized basis, resin and metals consumed as raw materials generally represent 10% to 15% of annual cost of products sold, with neither resin nor metals purchased as raw materials individually representing more than 10% of cost of products sold. 

The Company also relies on third-party manufacturers as a source for finished goods. Historically, the Company has experienced inflation in sourced product costs due to currency fluctuations and increased input and labor costs. For a limited number of product 

&#32;8 

lines, a single manufacturer or a limited number of manufacturers may supply substantially all of the finished goods for a product line. In particular, certain businesses within the Baby &#38; Parenting and Home Solutions segments rely on third-party manufacturers for substantially all of their products. Specifically, the Company&#8217;s Baby &#38; Parenting segment has a single source of supply for products that comprise a majority of Baby &#38; Parenting&#8217;s sales and which owns the intellectual property for many of those products. 

See Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for further discussion. 

Backlog 

The dollar value of unshipped factory orders is not material. 

Seasonal Variations 

Sales of the Company&#8217;s products tend to be seasonal, with sales and operating income in the first quarter generally lower than any other quarter during the year, driven principally by reduced volume and the mix of products sold in the first quarter. Historically, the Company has earned approximately 60% of its annual operating income during the second and third quarters of the year. The seasonality of the Company&#8217;s sales volume, combined with the accounting for fixed costs such as depreciation, amortization, rent, personnel costs and interest expense, impacts the Company&#8217;s results on a quarterly basis.

Customers/Competition 

The Company&#8217;s principal customers are large mass merchandisers, such as discount stores, home centers, warehouse clubs, office superstores, commercial distributors and e-commerce companies. The dominant share of the market represented by large mass merchandisers, together with consumer shopping patterns, contributes to a market environment in which dominant multi-category retailers and e-commerce companies have strong negotiating power with suppliers. This environment may limit the Company&#8217;s ability to recover cost increases through selling prices. 

Current trends among retailers and e-commerce companies include fostering high levels of competition among suppliers, demanding innovative new products and products tailored to each of their unique requirements and requiring suppliers to maintain or reduce product prices and deliver products with shorter lead times. Other trends, in the absence of a strong new product development effort or strong end-user brands, are for retailers and e-commerce companies to import generic products directly from foreign sources and to source and sell products, under their own private label brands, which compete with the Company&#8217;s products. The combination of these market influences has created an intensely competitive environment in which the Company&#8217;s principal customers continuously evaluate which product suppliers to use, resulting in downward pricing pressures and the need for big, consumer-meaningful brands, the ongoing introduction and commercialization of innovative new products, continuing improvements in category management and customer service, and the maintenance of strong relationships with large, high-volume purchasers. The Company competes with numerous manufacturers and distributors of consumer products, many of which are large and well-established. 

The Company&#8217;s principal methods of meeting its competitive challenges are creating and maintaining leading brands and differentiated products that deliver superior value and performance; delivering superior customer service and consistent on-time delivery; producing and procuring products at a competitive cost; and experienced management. In addition, the Company focuses on building consumer loyalty and increased consumer demand through increased investment in consumer insights and using those insights to develop innovative products and product features that meet consumers&#8217; needs. 

The Company has also positioned itself to respond to the competitive challenges in the retail environment by developing strong relationships with large, high-volume purchasers. The Company markets its strong multi-product offering through virtually every category of high-volume retailers, including discount, drug, grocery and variety chains; warehouse clubs; department, hardware and specialty stores; home centers; office superstores; contract stationers; and e-commerce companies. The Company&#8217;s largest customer, Wal-Mart (which includes Sam&#8217;s Club), accounted for approximately 10.9% &#32;of net sales in 2015 , across substantially all segments. The Company&#8217;s top-ten customers in 2015 &#32;included ( in alphabetical order ): amazon, Costco, Essendant, Lowe&#8217;s, Office Depot, Staples, Target, The Home Depot, Toys &#8216;R&#8217; Us and Wal-Mart.
