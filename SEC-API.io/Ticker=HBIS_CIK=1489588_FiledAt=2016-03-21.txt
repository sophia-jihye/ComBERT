 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

&#160;

Vapir, Inc. was incorporated on October 26, 2006 in the State of California. Vapir, Inc. specializes in the revolutionary technology of digital aromatherapy which is the art and science of utilizing naturally extracted aromatic essences from plants to balance and harmonize while freshening the environment with pleasant and distinctive fragrances. We invent, develop and produce revolutionary and easy to use digital aromatherapy devices. The unique value proposition of the Company&#8217;s proprietary technology (US Patent 6,095,153) is to prevent the creation of toxic by-products whenever plant materials are inhaled. This is accomplished by using convection heat that induces the safe release of plant essences without burning the source material. Our devices are designed in San Jose, California and manufactured in Guang Dong, China.

&#160;

Corporate History 

&#160;

We were originally incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on December 17, 2009 under the name Apps Genius Corp. Our original business was to develop, market, publish and distribute social games and software applications that consumers could use on a variety of platforms, including social networks, wireless devices and stand-alone websites. We were unsuccessful in operating our business and on October 7, 2013 we entered into a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement with FAL Minerals LLC and we changed our name to FAL Exploration Corp.

&#160;

Under the name FAL Exploration Corp., our plan was to acquire minority and majority interests in natural resource properties located throughout the United States. Our initial project was an interest in an open pit mine located in Clay County Alabama also known as the Brown Mine. Historically, graphite and gold have been mined in the area. The property which is over two hundred and twenty acres contains graphite and some surface gold. The Company planned to explore the property and either may utilize it as the main production plant should the Brown Mine prove to be commercially viable or seek to monetize the graphite, should it prove to be commercially viable. The agreement with FAL Minerals LLC has since been terminated and we have now entered into the Exchange Agreement with Vapir, Inc. and its shareholders.

&#160;

In anticipation of closing the Exchange Agreement, on September 17, 2014, we changed our name to Vapir Enterprises, Inc. to better represent our new business operations.

&#160;

Our Industry 

&#160; 

&#8220;Vaporizers&#8221; are battery-powered products that enable users to inhale vapor without smoke, Vaporizers are not like traditional cigarettes, and their construction is comprised of three functional components: &#9679; Digital temperature control, means you have the ability to choose the warmth of your vaporizer&#8217;s heating element. The heating element that vaporizes liquid and/or botanicals so that it can be inhaled; &#9679; vaporizers either heat the liquid or botanicals with direct contact with a heating element (conduction) or by exposing the herb to hot air (convection); and &#9679; Vaporizers require energy when hot. Depending on the intention behind the vaporizer&#8217;s design - the energy source will match the portable or stationary model paradigm.

&#160; 

&#160;

Our Products 

&#160;

Vaporizers 

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015, we offer 4 vaporizers, the Prima, VapirRise 2.0 ultimate, VAPIR NO2 Portable Digital Vaporizer and VAPIR Oxygen Mini Corded Vaporizer.

&#160;

Prima 

&#160;

&#160;

Prima is a digital vaporizer that supports extracts and botanicals. The unit is equipped with a removable/rechargeable lithium battery, a removable stainless steel vapor path and removable mouth piece which allows for easy cleaning, and four (4) pre-set temperatures which maintains pre-set heat levels by turning the heating element on and off as needed. Once the optimal temperature is reached, a green light on the casing will indicate that the device is now ready. This relatively simple technology enables the vaporizers to maintain heat levels.

&#160;

&#9679; Prima measures in at just 4 .7 inches, and weighs 5.7 oz, and comes in four (4) different colors (Blue, Black, Silver, and Orange). 

&#160;

VapirRise 2.0 Ultimate 

&#160;

&#160;

The VapirRise 2.0 Ultimate is designed for loose-leaf herbs and essential oils. It supports both balloon inflation and direct inhalation. It can serve up to 4 users simultaneously. It has touch pad controls, an LCD temperature display and medical grade stainless steel vapir path and a ceramic heating element.

&#160;

As the ceramic heating element of the device reaches the pre-set temperature, a fan blows air through the heating element. A sensor, which is located in the chamber of the unit, will constantly monitor the air temperature and maintain pre-set heat levels by turning the heating element on and off as needed. Once the optimal temperature is reached, a green light on the casing will indicate that the device is now ready. This relatively simple technology enables the vaporizers to maintain heat levels.

&#160;

This convection vaporizer is a stationary desktop model - which means it isn&#8217;t intended for on-the-go consumption. The VapirRise offers an exceptional approach to the at-home vaporization experience.

&#160;

Users can control the temperature (in both degrees Celsius &#38; Fahrenheit); control the Fan Speed (ten options including a fanless setting); pick between a balloon or hose inhalation methods; and choose to serve up to four people at once with the exclusive hookah adapter.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Seasonality of our Business 

&#160;

We do not consider our business to be seasonal.

&#160;

Marketing 

&#160;

We offer our vaporizers and related products through our website and third party online stores, to retail channels through our direct sales force, and through third party wholesalers, retailers and value-added resellers. Retailers of our products include small-box smoke shops, vape stores, and online retailersthroughout the United States.

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

Competition in the vaporizer industry is intense. We compete with other sellers of vaporizers that are similar to our products and our competitors use the same sales practices and marketing strategies as we use.

&#160;

The nature of our competitors is varied as the market is highly fragmented and the barriers to entry into the business are low. Our direct competitors sell products that are substantially similar to ours and through the same channels through which we sell our vaporizers. We compete with these direct competitors for sales through distributors, wholesalers and retailers.

&#160;

Our competitive position in the vaporizer industry is difficult to gauge as most of our competition are also smaller companies or are privately held and do not publicly report their earnings. We do know of several competitors, but, like us, many are in their initial stages of development and are focusing on different areas of this industry.

&#160;

As a general matter, we have access to and market and sell similar products as our competitors, and since we sell our products at substantially similar prices as our competitors; accordingly, the key competitive factors for our success is the quality of service and design we offer our customers, the scope and effectiveness of our marketing efforts, including media advertising campaigns and, increasingly, the ability to identify and develop new sources of customers by attending trade shows and word of mouth.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Regulatory Matters/Compliance 

&#160;

The United States Food and Drug Administration (the &#8220;FDA&#8221;) regulates electronic cigarettes as &#8220;tobacco products&#8221; under the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act of 2009 (the &#8220;Tobacco Control Act&#8221;). The FDA is not permitted to regulate electronic cigarettes as &#8220;drugs&#8221; or &#8220;devices&#8221; or a &#8220;combination product&#8221; under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act unless they are marketed for therapeutic purposes.

&#160;

Our vaporizers are classified as &#8220;tobacco products&#8221; under the Tobacco Control Act. The Tobacco Control Act grants the FDA broad authority over the manufacture, sale, marketing and packaging of tobacco products, although the FDA is prohibited from issuing regulations banning all cigarettes or all smokeless tobacco products, or requiring the reduction of nicotine yields of a tobacco product to zero.

&#160;

The Tobacco Control Act imposes significant new restrictions on the advertising and promotion of tobacco products. The law also requires the FDA to issue future regulations regarding the promotion and marketing of tobacco products sold or distributed over the internet, by mail order or through other non-face-to-face transactions in order to prevent the sale of tobacco products to minors.

&#160;

It is likely that the Tobacco Control Act could result in a decrease in tobacco product sales in the United States, including sales of our electronic cigarettes and vaporizers.

&#160;

The Tobacco industry expects significant regulatory developments to take place over the next few years, driven principally by the World Health Organization&#8217;s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (&#8220;FCTC&#8221;). The FCTC is the first international public health treaty on tobacco, and its objective is to establish a global agenda for tobacco regulation with the purpose of reducing initiation of tobacco use and encouraging cessation. Regulatory initiatives that have been proposed, introduced or enacted include:

&#160;

&#160; &#9679; the levying of substantial and increasing tax and duty charges; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; restrictions or bans on advertising, marketing and sponsorship; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; the display of larger health warnings, graphic health warnings and other labeling requirements; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; restrictions on packaging design, including the use of colors and generic packaging; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; restrictions or bans on the display of tobacco product packaging at the point of sale, and restrictions or bans on cigarette vending machines; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; requirements regarding testing, disclosure and performance standards for tar, nicotine, carbon monoxide and other smoke constituents levels; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; requirements regarding testing, disclosure and use of tobacco product ingredients; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; increased restrictions on smoking in public and work places and, in some instances, in private places and outdoors; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; elimination of duty free allowances for travelers; and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; encouraging litigation against tobacco companies. &#160;

If electronic cigarettes or vaporizers are subject to one or more significant regulatory initiatives, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.
