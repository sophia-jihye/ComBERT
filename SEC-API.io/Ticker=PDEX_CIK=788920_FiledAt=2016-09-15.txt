&#160;

During fiscal 2015, we obtained title to an industrial property located in Ramsey, Minnesota (the &#8220;Ramsey Property&#8221;) and extended financing to a company, Riverside Manufacturing, Inc. (&#8220;Riverside&#8221;), that operated out of the Ramsey Property. Our investment was made through our limited liability company, Pro-Dex Sunfish Lake, LLC to achieve a return on capital upon liquidation or upon foreclosure of the Riverside assets. The investments in the Ramsey Property and Riverside assets were sold during fiscal 2016. (See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained elsewhere in this report for additional information concerning this investment.)

&#160;

The income from discontinued operations included in our fiscal 2015 Consolidated Statement of Operations relates to the final earn out provisions from our sale of Pro-Dex Astromec, which we sold in February 2012.

&#160;

All years relating to financial data herein shall refer to fiscal years ended June 30, unless indicated otherwise.

&#160;

Description of Business

&#160;

The majority of our revenue is derived from designing, developing and manufacturing powered instruments for the medical and dental industries and motion control software and hardware for industrial and scientific applications. The proportion of total sales by customer type is as follows: 

&#160;

&#160; &#160; Years Ended June 30, &#160; &#160; &#160; 2016 &#160; &#160; 2015 &#160; &#160; &#160; (In thousands) &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; % of Revenue &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; % of Revenue &#160; Medical device and services &#160; $ 14,292 &#160; &#160; &#160; 71 % &#160; $ 7,619 &#160; &#160; &#160; 57 % Industrial and scientific &#160; &#160; 1,658 &#160; &#160; &#160; 8 % &#160; &#160; 2,052 &#160; &#160; &#160; 15 % Dental and component &#160; &#160; 1,320 &#160; &#160; &#160; 7 % &#160; &#160; 1,538 &#160; &#160; &#160; 12 % Repairs &#160; &#160; 833 &#160; &#160; &#160; 4 % &#160; &#160; 1,779 &#160; &#160; &#160; 13 % Other &#160; &#160; 2,055 &#160; &#160; &#160; 10 % &#160; &#160; 395 &#160; &#160; &#160; 3 % Total Sales &#160; $ 20,158 &#160; &#160; &#160; 100 % &#160; $ 13,383 &#160; &#160; &#160; 100 % &#160;

Our medical device products utilize proprietary designs developed by us primarily under exclusive development and supply agreements and are manufactured in our Irvine, California facility, as are our dental products. Our medical device products are sold primarily to original equipment manufacturers and our dental products are sold primarily to dental product distributors. In our Beaverton, Oregon facility, we design and manufacture embedded multi-axis motion controllers which are sold to distributors or original equipment manufacturers in the automation and research industries. In our San Dimas, California facility we manufacture plastic injection molds for a wide variety of industries. The proportion of total sales by facility is as follows:

&#160;

&#160; &#160; Years Ended June 30, &#160; &#160; &#160; 2016 &#160; &#160; 2015 &#160; &#160; &#160; (In thousands) &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; % of Revenue &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; % of Revenue &#160; Irvine &#160; $ 17,888 &#160; &#160; &#160; 89 % &#160; $ 11,732 &#160; &#160; &#160; 88 % Beaverton &#160; &#160; 969 &#160; &#160; &#160; 5 % &#160; &#160; 1,394 &#160; &#160; &#160; 10 % San Dimas &#160; &#160; 1,301 &#160; &#160; &#160; 6 % &#160; &#160; 257 &#160; &#160; &#160; 2 % Total Sales &#160; $ 20,158 &#160; &#160; &#160; 100 % &#160; $ 13,383 &#160; &#160; &#160; 100 % &#160;

&#160;

&#160;

In fiscal year 2016, our top 20 customers accounted for 87% of our sales compared to 82% in fiscal year 2015. In fiscal 2016, we had three customers, all included in medical device revenue above, that each accounted for more than 10% of sales and cumulatively totaled 56% of sales. This compares to fiscal year 2015, when our largest customer, included in medical device revenue above, accounted for 49% of our sales with our next largest customer accounting for 9% of our sales. In many cases, including our largest customers, disclosure of customer names is prohibited by confidentiality agreements with such entities. We have no plans to discontinue the sales relationships with our existing significant customers. Our largest customer in fiscal 2015 and previous years has informed us that they will be replacing a primary product that we sell with one that they will manufacture in the future. Therefore, although we expect to continue to have sales to this customer in fiscal 2017, we expect revenue to this customer to continue to decline. This customer accounted for $3.6 million or 18% of revenue in fiscal 2016 compared to $6.6 million or 49% of revenue in fiscal 2015.

&#160;

Our current objectives are focused primarily on maintaining our relationships with our current customers, continuing our cost reduction analysis of our new products and expanding our business with new product launches and services related to our areas of expertise. In that regard, we have completed two significant medical device development projects in the craniomaxillofacial (&#8220;CMF&#8221;) surgical segment during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 and the second quarter of fiscal 2016. However, there can be no assurance as to the level of success we will achieve in these objectives.

&#160;

The majority of the raw materials and components used to manufacture our products are purchased and are available from several sources, including through our own in-house machining capabilities. Portescap Danaher, K-V Engineering, and Fischer Connectors are examples of key suppliers. We have no exclusive arrangements with any of our suppliers, but in several instances only one supplier is used for certain high-value components. In most of such instances, secondary suppliers have been identified, although it is likely that any transition to a new or different supplier would result in a delay in the supply chain. We consider our relationships with our suppliers and manufacturers to be good. We do not intend to terminate any such relationship at this time, nor does management have knowledge that any supplier or manufacturer intends to terminate its relationship with us.

&#160;

Our commitment to product design, manufacturing and quality systems are supported by our compliance with several regulatory agency requirements and standards. We hold a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (&#8220;FDA&#8221;) Establishment Registration and a State of California Device Manufacturing License (Department of Public Health Food and Drug Branch) with respect to our Irvine, California facility. In addition, our Irvine, California facility is certified to ISO 13485:2003, Medical Device Directive 93/42/EEC &#8211; Annex II, and Canadian Medical Device Conformity Assessment System. Our Beaverton, Oregon facility is certified to ISO 9001:2008.

&#160;

At June 30, 2016, we had a backlog of $11.3 million compared with a backlog of $10.6 million at June 30, 2015. We have experienced, and may continue to experience, variability in our new order bookings due to, among other reasons, the launch of new products, the timing of customer orders based on end-user demand and customer inventory levels. We do not typically experience seasonal fluctuations in our shipments and revenues.

&#160;

Segments

&#160;

In fiscal 2016, we had four reportable segments based on our business activities and organization:

&#160;

&#183; Pro-Dex located in Irvine, California &#8211; providing primarily medical and dental instruments using shared production and assembly machines and workforce. This segment also incorporates Huber Precision as the revenues and assets of Huber Precision are not material to our total revenues and assets. Additionally, effective November 30, 2015 the former San Carlos office of Huber Precision was closed and all orders shipped since that date are manufactured at our Irvine facility. &#160;

&#183; OMS located in Beaverton, Oregon &#8211; providing multi-axis motion control applications. &#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; Fineline located in San Dimas, California. This business was purchased on February 1, 2015 and is a manufacturer of plastic injection molds for a variety of industries. &#160;

&#183; Engineering Services Division or (&#8220;ESD&#8221;). This division was launched in fiscal 2015 to provide permanent placement and contract services in the fields of engineering, manufacturing and quality to diverse businesses. &#160;

(See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained elsewhere in this report for additional information concerning these reporting segments.)

&#160;

Competition

&#160;

The markets for products in the industries served by our customers are intensely competitive, and we face significant competition from a number of different sources. Several of our competitors have significantly greater name recognition, as well as substantially greater financial, technical, product development and marketing resources, than us.

&#160;

We compete in all of our markets with other major medical device and motion control related companies. As a provider of outsourced services, we also compete with our customers&#8217; own internal development and manufacturing groups. Competitive pressures and other factors, such as new product or new technology introductions by us, our customers&#8217; internal development and manufacturing departments, or our competitors, may result in price or market share erosion that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Also, there can be no assurance that our products and services will achieve broad market acceptance or will successfully compete with other products targeting the same customers.

&#160;

Research and Development

&#160;

We conduct research and development activities to both maintain and improve our market position. Our research and development effort involves the design and manufacture of products that perform specific applications for our existing and prospective customers. Our research and development activities are focused on:

&#160;

&#183; expanding our knowledge base in the medical device and motion control industries to solidify our products with current customers and expand our customer base; &#160;

&#183; advancing applicable technologies; and &#160;

&#183; enhancing our product lines. &#160;

In certain instances we may share research and development costs with our customers by billing for non-recurring engineering services. Revenue recognized for non-recurring engineering services represented 5% and 4% of our revenue in fiscal year 2016 and 2015, respectively. During recent years, we have entered into certain development and supply contracts, the development portions of which provide for billable non-recurring engineering service fees. Such fees are recognized as revenue generally upon successful completion of the non-recurring engineering services. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, we completed the development portion of a contract entered into during fiscal 2012, allowing us to record approximately $336,000 in non-recurring engineering service revenue, included in medical device revenue. During the second quarter of fiscal 2016 we completed the development portion of a contract entered into during fiscal 2013 allowing us to record approximately $660,000 in non-recurring engineering service revenue, also included in medical device and services revenue. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, we executed a development agreement with another customer to design and develop a powered surgical device and during fiscal 2016 we recognized medical device service revenue in the amount of approximately $367,000 relating to this contract. We will continue to pursue other revenue-generating development projects. Accordingly, we believe that non-recurring engineering fees could represent a greater share of our revenue in the future.

&#160;

During the fiscal years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, we incurred research and development expenses amounting to $1,852,000 and $1,668,000, respectively, which costs exclude $412,000 and $493,000 in 2016 and 2015 respectively, that were, or will be, shared with our customers through billings for non-recurring engineering services.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Employees 

&#160;

At June 30, 2016, we had 76 full-time employees comprised of 60 employees in Irvine, California 9 in Beaverton, Oregon 6 in San Dimas, California and 1 in Boston, Massachusetts, as well as 28 temporary employees, 16 of whom are working on an ESD contract in New Jersey and the balance are working in Irvine, California. At June 30, 2015, we had 66 full-time employees, comprised of 54 employees in Irvine, 7 in Beaverton and 5 in San Dimas. None of our employees are a party to any collective bargaining agreements with us. We consider our relationships with our employees to be good.

&#160;

Government Regulations 

&#160;

The manufacture and distribution of medical and dental devices are subject to state and federal requirements set forth by various agencies, including the FDA, and state medical and dental boards. The statutes, regulations, administrative orders, and advisories that affect our businesses are complex and subject to diverse, often conflicting, interpretations. While we make every effort to maintain full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, we are unable to eliminate the ongoing risk that one or more of our activities or devices may at some point be determined to be non-compliant. The penalties for non-compliance could range from an administrative warning to termination of a portion of our business. Furthermore, even if we are subsequently determined to have fully complied with applicable laws or regulations, the costs to achieve such a determination and the intervening loss of business could adversely affect or result in the cessation of a portion of our business. A change in such laws or regulations at any time may have an adverse effect on our operations.

&#160;

The FDA designates all medical devices into one of three classes (Class I, II or III) based on the level of control necessary to assure the safety and effectiveness of the device (with Class I requiring the lowest level of control and Class III requiring the greatest level of control). The surgical instrumentation we manufacture is generally classified into Class I, and our dental instrumentation is generally classified into Class II. The FDA has broad enforcement powers to recall and prohibit the sale of products that do not comply with federal regulations, and to order the cessation of non-compliant processes. No claim has been made to date by the FDA regarding any of our products or processes. Nevertheless, as is common in the industry, certain of our products and processes have been the subject of routine governmental reviews and investigations.

&#160;

The total cost of providing health care services has been and will continue to be subject to review by governmental agencies and legislative bodies in the major world markets, including the United States, which are faced with significant pressure to lower health care costs. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act signed into law in March 2010 (the &#8220;Affordable Care Act&#8221;) imposes a 2.3% excise tax, currently suspended until December 31, 2017, on sales of certain medical devices, some of which we produce, that we may be unable to recover through price increases to our customers.

&#160;

We believe that our business is conducted in a manner consistent with Environmental Protection Agency (&#8220;EPA&#8221;) and other agency regulations governing disposition of industrial waste materials.

&#160;

While we believe that our products and processes fully comply with applicable laws and regulations, we are unable to predict the outcome of any investigation or review which may be undertaken in the future with respect to our products or processes.

&#160;

Management believes that each of our facilities has manufacturing systems and processes that are based on established Quality Management System standards. In addition, we believe that our Irvine, California facility is compliant with applicable Good Manufacturing Practices promulgated by the FDA, and is, along with our Beaverton, Oregon facility, compliant with applicable ISO standards set forth by the International Organization for Standardization.

&#160;

Patents, Trademarks and Licensing Agreements 

&#160;

We hold patents relating to miniature rotary drive products, multi-axis motion controllers and torque-limiting screwdrivers. Our patents have varying expiration dates. The near term expiration of the patents, if any, is not expected to cause any change in our revenue-generating operations as the revenue from the products associated with those patents is not material.

&#160;

We have no reason to believe that our activities infringe upon the intellectual property of any third party. With respect to our own patents, we have no reason to believe that our patents are invalid and we believe that at least some of our patents cover certain aspects of our products. While we are unaware of any reason that would cause us to assert or defend a claim of patent infringement, any such assertion or defense could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations due to the costs involved.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

We have certain federally registered trademarks relating to our products, including Pro-Dex &#174; OMS &#174; and OMS-EZ &#174; , along with a number of other common law trademarks.

&#160;

We have not entered into any franchising agreements. We have not granted nor do we hold any third-party licenses having terms under which we earn revenue or incur expense in material amounts.
